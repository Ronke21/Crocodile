<text>Surf music (also known as surf rock, surf pop, or surf guitar) is a genre of rock music associated with surf culture, particularly as found in Southern California. It was especially popular from 1958 to 1964 in two major forms. The first is instrumental surf, distinguished by reverb-heavy electric guitars played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, largely pioneered by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The second is vocal surf, which took elements of the original surf sound and added vocal harmonies, a movement led by the Beach Boys.

Dick Dale developed the surf sound from instrumental rock, where he added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, a spring reverb, and rapid alternate picking characteristics. His regional hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;, in 1961, launched the surf music craze, inspiring many others to take up the approach.

The genre reached national exposure when it was represented by vocal groups such as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Dale was quoted on such groups: &quot;They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn&#x27;t surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ... That was the difference ... the real surfing music is instrumental.&quot;

At the height of its popularity, surf music rivaled girl groups and Motown for the top American popular music trend. It is sometimes referred to interchangeably with the &quot;California sound&quot;. During the later stages of the surf music craze, many of its groups started to write songs about cars and girls; this was later known as &quot;hot rod rock&quot;.

==Instrumental surf==
===Form===

Surf music emerged in the late 1950s as instrumental rock and roll music, almost always in straight 4/4 (common) time, with a medium to fast tempo. The sound was dominated by electric guitars, which were particularly characterized by the extensive use of the &quot;wet&quot; spring reverb that was incorporated into Fender amplifiers from 1963, and was meant to emulate the sound of waves. The outboard separate Fender Reverb Unit that was developed by Fender in 1961 (as opposed to reverb that was incorporated as a built-in amp feature) was the actual first &quot;wet&quot; surf reverb tone. This unit is the reverb effect heard on Dick Dale records, and others such as &quot;Pipeline&quot; by the Chantays and &quot;Point Panic&quot; by the Surfaris. It has more of a wet &quot;drippy&quot; tone than the &quot;built-in&quot; amp reverb, due to different circuitry.

Guitarists also made use of the vibrato arm on their guitars to bend the pitch of notes downward, electronic tremolo effects and rapid (alternating) tremolo picking. Guitar models favored included those made by Fender (particularly the Jazzmaster, Jaguar and Stratocaster), Mosrite, Teisco, or Danelectro, usually with single coil pickups (which had high treble in contrast to double-coil humbucking pickups). Surf music was one of the first genres to universally adopt the electric bass, particularly the Fender Precision Bass. Classic surf drum kits tended to be Rogers, Ludwig, Gretsch or Slingerland. Some popular songs also incorporated a tenor or baritone saxophone, as on the Lively Ones&#x27; &quot;Surf Rider&quot; (1963) and the Revels&#x27; &quot;Comanche&quot; (1961). Often an electric organ or an electric piano featured as backing harmony.

===History===
By the early 1960s, instrumental rock and roll had been pioneered successfully by performers such as Link Wray, Nokie Edwards and the Ventures and Duane Eddy. This trend was developed by Dick Dale, who added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, the distinctive reverb (giving the guitar a &quot;wet&quot; sound), and the rapid alternate picking characteristic of the genre (influenced by Arabic music, which Dale learnt from his Lebanese uncle). His performances at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa, California, during the summer of 1961, and his regional hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27; later that year, launched the surf music craze, which he followed up with hits like &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962).

While Dick Dale was crafting his new sound in Orange County, the Bel-Airs were crafting their own in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County. The band was composed of five teen-aged boys. In 1959 they were still learning to play their instruments: Dick Dodd on drums, Chas Stuart on saxophone, Jim Roberts on piano, and Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson on guitars. Said Johnson of his relationship with Bertrand, &quot;Learning the guitar became a duo experience versus a solo thing. We learned to play by playing together, one guy would play the chords, the other would play the lead. This sound would become the basis for the Bel-Airs.&quot; They recorded their first single, &quot;Mr. Moto&quot;, in June 1961 (with Richard Delvy on drums instead of Dodd) and the song received radio airplay that summer. Dale was older, played louder, commanded a larger audience, and usually gets credit for creating surf music, but the Bel-Airs lay claim to having the first surf music single.

Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, with Orange County in particular having a strong surf culture, and the Rendezvous Ballroom hosted many surf-styled acts. Groups such as the Bel-Airs (whose hit &quot;Mr. Moto&quot;, influenced by Dale&#x27;s earlier live performances, was released slightly before &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin), the Challengers (with their album &quot;Surfbeat&quot;) and then Eddie &amp; the Showmen followed Dale to regional success.

The Chantays scored a top-ten national hit with &quot;Pipeline&quot;, reaching number four in May 1963. Probably the single-most famous surf tune hit was &quot;Wipe Out&quot; by the Surfaris, with its intro of a wicked laugh; the Surfaris were also known for their cutting-edge lead guitar and drum solos, and &quot;Wipe Out&quot; reached number two on the Hot 100 in August 1963 and number 16 in October 1966. The group also had two other global hits, &quot;Surfer Joe&quot; and &quot;Point Panic&quot;.

The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand. These included the Astronauts, from Boulder, Colorado; the Trashmen, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who reached number four with &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; in 1964; and the Rivieras, from South Bend, Indiana, who reached number five in 1964 with &quot;California Sun&quot;. the Atlantics, from Sydney, Australia, were not exclusively surf musicians, but made a significant contribution to the genre, the most famous example being their hit &quot;Bombora&quot;, in 1963. Also from Sydney were the Denvermen, whose lyrical instrumental &quot;Surfside&quot; reached number one in the Australian charts. Another Australian surf band who were known outside their own country&#x27;s surf scene were the Joy Boys, backing band for singer Col Joye; their hit &quot;Murphy the Surfie&quot; from 1963 was later covered by the Surfaris.

European bands around this time generally focused more on the style played by British instrumental rock group the Shadows. A notable example of European surf instrumental is Spanish band Los Relámpagos&#x27; rendition of &quot;Misirlou&quot;. The Dakotas, who were the British backing band for Merseybeat singer Billy J. Kramer, gained some attention as surf musicians with &quot;Cruel Sea&quot;, in 1963, which was later covered by the Ventures, and eventually other instrumental surf bands, including the Challengers and the Revelairs.

==Vocal surf==
===Distinctions===


In Matt Warshaw&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Surfing&quot;, he notes: &quot;Surf music is divided into two categories: the pulsating, reverb-heavy, &#x27;wet&#x27;- sounding instrumental form exemplified by guitarist Dick Dale, and the smooth-voiced, multitracked harmonized vocal style invented by the Beach Boys. Purists argue that surf music is by definition instrumental.&quot;

This second category of surf music was led by the Beach Boys, a group whose main distinction between previous surf musicians was that they projected a world view. In 1964, the group&#x27;s leader and principal songwriter, Brian Wilson, explained: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a conscious thing to build our music around surfing. We just want to be identified with the interests of young kids.&quot; A year later, he would express: &quot;I hate so-called &quot;surfin music. It&#x27;s a name that people slap on any sound from California. Our music is rightfully &#x27;the Beach Boy sound&#x27;—if one has to label it.&quot;

Vocal surf can be interpreted as a regional variant of doo-wop music, with tight harmonies on a song&#x27;s chorus contrasted with scat singing. According to musicologist Timothy Cooley, &quot;Like instrumental surf rock with its fondness for the twelve-bar blues form, the vocal version of Surf Music drew many key elements from African-American genres ... what made the Beach Boys unique was its ability to capture the nation&#x27;s and indeed the world&#x27;s imagination about the emerging New Surfing lifestyle now centered in Southern California, as well as the subtle songwriting style and production techniques that identify the Beach Boys&#x27; sound.&quot; In 1963, Murry Wilson, Brian&#x27;s father, who also acted as the Beach Boys&#x27; manager, offered his definition of surf music: &quot;The basis of surfing music is a rock and roll bass beat figuration, coupled with raunch-type weird-sounding lead guitar, an electric guitar, plus wailing saxes. Surfing music has to sound untrained with a certain rough flavor in order to appeal to teenagers. ... when the music gets too good, and too polished, it isn&#x27;t considered the real thing.&quot;

====Hot rod rock====
&quot;Hot rod music&quot; or &quot;hot rod rock&quot; evolved from surf music. Dick Dale recalled how surf music was re-imagined as hot rod music by a record company-inspired move to capture a larger market. According to &quot;The Ultimate Hot Rod Dictionary&quot;, by Jeff Breitenstein: &quot;While cars and, to a lesser degree, hot rods have been a relatively common and enduring theme in American popular music, the term &quot;hot rod music&quot; is most often associated with the unique &#x27;California sound&#x27; music of the early to mid-1960s ... and was defined by its rich vocal harmonies, amplified (generally Fender brand) electric guitars, and youth-oriented lyrics (most often celebrating hot rods and, more broadly, surfing and &#x27;girls&#x27;).&quot;

Author David Ferrandino wrote that &quot;the Beach Boys&#x27; musical treatments of both cars and surfboards are identical&quot;, whereas author Geoffrey Himes elaborated on &quot;subtle&quot; differences: &quot;Translating the surf-music format into hot-rod tunes wasn&#x27;t difficult... If surf music was a lot of Dick Dale and some Chuck Berry, hot-rod music was a little more Berry and a little less Dale — i.e. less percussive staccato and more chiming riffs. Instead of slang about waxes and boards, you used slang about carburetors and pistons; instead of name-dropping the top surfing beaches, you cited the nicknames for the top drag-racing strips; instead of warning about the dangers of a &#x27;wipe out&#x27;, you warned of &#x27;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&#x27;.&quot;

===Popularity===
In late 1961 the Beach Boys had their first chart hit, &quot;Surfin&#x27;, which peaked at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, In mid-1962, the group released their major-label debut, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, which hit number 14 and helped turn the surf rock craze into a national phenomenon. Next, the Beach Boys released &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; (1963), a Top 3 hit, and &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; (1963), which reached the top 10. Breitenstein writes that hot rod rock gained national popularity beginning in 1962 with the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;409&quot;, which is often credited with initiating the hot rod music craze, which lasted until 1965. Several key figures led the hot rod movement beside Wilson, including songwriter-producer-musician Gary Usher and songwriter-disc jockey Roger Christian.

Wilson then co-wrote &quot;Surf City&quot; in 1963 for Jan and Dean, and it spent two weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 100 chart in July 1963. In the wake of the Beach Boys&#x27; success, many singles by new surfing and hot rod groups were produced by Los Angeles groups. Himes notes: &quot;Most of these weren&#x27;t real groups; they were just a singer or two backed by the same floating pool of session musicians: often including Glen Campbell, Hal Blaine and Bruce Johnston. If a single happened to click, a group would be hastily assembled and sent out on tour. It was an odd blend of amateurism and professionalism.&quot; One-hit wonders included Bruce &amp; Terry with &quot;Summer Means Fun&quot;, the Rivieras with &quot;California Sun&quot;, Ronny &amp; the Daytonas with &quot;G.T.O.&quot;, and the Rip Chords with &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;. The latter two hits both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula was Jan &amp; Dean. Hot rod group the Fantastic Baggys wrote many songs for Jan and Dean and also performed a few vocals for the duo.

==Decline==
Like all other rock subgenres of this period, the surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was effectively ended by the British Invasion beginning in early 1964. Hot rod music also ceased to be prominent that year. The emerging garage rock, folk rock, blues rock and later psychedelic rock genres also contributed to the decline of surf rock. The Beach Boys survived the invasion by diversifying their approach to music. Brian explained to &quot;Teen Beat&quot;: &quot;We needed to grow. Up to this point we had milked every idea dry ... We had done every possible angle about surfing and then we did the car routine. But we needed to grow
artistically.&quot; After the decline of surf music, the Beach Boys continued producing a number of hit singles and albums, including the sharply divergent &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in 1966. Subsequently, they became the only American rock or pop group that could rival the Beatles. The band only sparingly returned to the hot rod and surfing-themed music, beginning with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Do It Again&quot;.

==Influence and revival==
Instrumental surf rock style guitar was used in the James Bond Theme of the first Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, recorded by Vic Flick with the John Barry Seven. The theme became a signature for Bond films and influenced the music of spy films of the 1960s. Surf music also influenced a number of later rock musicians, including Keith Moon of the Who, East Bay Ray of the Dead Kennedys, and Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago. During the mid-to late 1990s, surf rock experienced a revival with surf acts, including Dick Dale recording once more, partly due to the popularity of the movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1994, which used Dale&#x27;s &quot;Misirlou&quot; and other surf rock songs in the soundtrack.

===Surf punk===
Surf punk is a revival of the original surfing sound combining surf rock with punk rock. It was initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by groups and artists such as the Ramones, who released their seminal surf-punk album &quot;Rocket To Russia&quot; in 1977, featuring a prominent cover of &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; by The Trashmen (a cover of which as served as The Cramps&#x27; debut single in 1978). Other early surf punk artists included Johnny Thunders, who opened his debut solo album &quot;So Alone&quot; with an instrumental cover of The Chantays&#x27; song, &quot;Pipeline&quot;; the Forgotten Rebels from Canada, who released &quot;Surfin&#x27; on Heroin&quot; in 1981; and Agent Orange, from Orange County, California, who recorded punk cover versions of surf classics such as &quot;Misirlou&quot;, &quot;Mr. Moto&quot;, and &quot;Pipeline&quot;, with AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato calling the band &quot;influential&quot; and &quot;a step ahead of the rest of the punk/hardcore pack&quot;. The genre is related to skate punk, which rose to prominence at the same time in the Orange County beach towns that nurtured the first wave of surf musicians.

==Production==
Herb Alpert played a part in the genre, producing for Jan &amp; Dean. With Lou Adler, Alpert produced Jan &amp; Dean&#x27;s first Top Ten single, &quot;Baby Talk&quot;. Tony Hilder who owned the Impact label was a prolific surf music producer, whose status as a producer was still recognized many years later. His name as publisher, producer etc., appears on many records, both 45s and albums. If not for the poor crediting on the budget releases his name would have appeared on more. Gary Usher was a producer, arranger and writer. His work included the Surfaris and the Hondells. He also co-wrote &quot;409&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot;, which were hits for the Beach Boys. In later years, Sundazed Music would release the &quot;Barefoot Adventure: The 4 Star Sessions 1962-66&quot; compilation album. The notes say &quot; Gary Usher was a primary architect of the sound of the early-sixties West Coast; cars, girls, sun and surf!&quot;. Terry Melcher was a producer, noted for his part in shaping the sound of surf music as well as folk. He worked closely with the Beach Boys and was responsible for some of their chart success. Outside Brian Wilson&#x27;s work with the Beach Boys, one of the acts he produced was Bob &amp; Sheri with their 1962 single, &quot;Surfer Moon&quot;.

Los Angeles session musicians, The Wrecking Crew played on many surf music recordings.

<text>A loincloth is a one-piece garment, either wrapped around itself or kept in place by a belt. It covers the genitals and sometimes the buttocks. Loincloths which are held up by belts or strings are specifically known as breechcloth or breechclout. Often, the flaps hang down in front and back.

== History and types ==
Loincloths are worn in societies where no other clothing is needed or wanted. Loincloths are commonly used as an undergarment or swimsuit by wrestlers and by farmers in paddy fields in both Sri Lanka and India, where it is called Kovanam in Tamil, in Sinhala and kaupinam or langot.

The loincloth, or breechcloth, is a basic form of dress, often worn as the only garment. Men have worn a loincloth as a fundamental piece of clothing which covers their genitals, not the buttocks, in most societies which disapproved of genital nakedness throughout human history. The loincloth is in essence a piece of material, bark-bast, leather, or cloth, passed between the legs and covering the genitals. Despite its functional simplicity, the loincloth comes in many different forms.

The styles in which breechcloths and loincloths can be arranged are myriad. Both the Bornean &quot;sirat&quot; and the Indian &quot;dhoti&quot; have fabric pass between the legs to support a man&#x27;s genitals.

A similar style of loincloth was also characteristic of ancient Mesoamerica. The male inhabitants of the area of modern Mexico wore a wound loincloth of woven fabric. One end of the loincloth was held up, the remainder passed between the thighs, wound about the waist, and secured in back by tucking.

In Pre-Columbian South America, ancient Inca men wore a strip of cloth between their legs held up by strings or tape as a belt. The cloth was secured to the tapes at the back and the front portion hung in front as an apron, always well ornamented. The same garment, mostly in plain cotton but whose aprons are now, like T-shirts, sometimes decorated with logos, is known in Japan as .

Some of the culturally diverse Amazonian indigenous still wear an ancestral type of loincloth.

Until World War II, Japanese men wore a loincloth known as a . The is a piece of fabric (cotton or silk) passed between the thighs and secured to cover the genitals.

== Loincloths by culture ==
=== Australia ===

Worn by adult males in some Aboriginal cultures. Called &quot;naga&quot;, &quot;narga&quot;, &quot;nargar&quot; (etc) from Yulparija dialect of the Western Desert.

=== India ===
Unsewn Kaupinam and its later-era sewn variation langot are traditional clothes in India, worn as underwear in dangal held in akharas especially wrestling, to prevent hernias and hydrocele. Kacchera is mandatory for Sikhs to wear.

=== Japan ===
Japanese men and women traditionally wore a loincloth known as a &quot;fundoshi&quot;. The &quot;fundoshi&quot; is a 35 cm (14 in.) wide piece of fabric (cotton or silk) passed between the thighs and secured to cover the genitals. There are many ways of tying the &quot;fundoshi&quot;.

=== Native American ===
In most Native American tribes, men used to wear some form of breechcloth, often with leggings. The style differed from tribe to tribe. In many tribes, the flaps hung down in front and back; in others, the breechcloth looped outside the belt and was tucked into the inside, for a more fitted look. Sometimes, the breechcloth was much shorter, and a decorated apron panel was attached in front and behind.

A Native American woman or teenage girl might also wear a fitted breechcloth underneath her skirt, but not as outerwear. However, in many tribes&#x27; young girls did wear breechcloths like the boys until they became old enough for skirts and dresses. Among the Mohave people of the American Southwest, a breechcloth given to a young female symbolically recognizes her status as &quot;hwame&quot;.

===Philippines===


In the Philippines, loincloths of any sort are generally called &quot;bahág&quot;. It is often a single, long, rectangular cloth that is not tied with a belt or string and were made from either barkcloth or hand-woven textiles. The design of the weave is often unique to a specific tribe, while colors may denote the wearer’s social rank, such as plain white for commoners.

Throughout the pre-colonial period, the &quot;bahág&quot; was the normative dress for commoners and the servile class (the &quot;alipin&quot; caste). It survives today among some indigenous tribes of the Philippines, most notably the various Cordilleran peoples in the mountains of inland northern Luzon.

The &quot;bahág&quot; was also favoured by the pre-colonial noble (&quot;tumao&quot;) and warrior (&quot;timawa&quot;) classes of the Visayan people, as it showed off their elaborate, full-body tattoos (&quot;batok&quot;) that advertised combat prowess and other significant achievements:

One method of wrapping the &quot;bahág&quot; involves first pulling the long rectangular cloth (usually around ) in between the legs to cover the genitals, with a longer back flap. This back flap is then twisted across the right leg, then crossed at the waist in an anti-clockwise direction. It then goes under the front flap, then across the left leg. It is twisted back across the back loop, above the buttocks. The result is the two rectangular ends hanging in front of and behind the waist, with a loop around the legs resembling a belt.

The native Tagalog word for &quot;rainbow&quot;, &quot;bahagharì&quot;, literally means &quot;loincloth of the king&quot;.

=== Europe ===

Some European men around wore leather breechcloths, as can be seen from the clothing of Ötzi.&lt;ref name=&quot;iceman.it/clothing&quot;&gt;South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology. Retrieved 2010-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Romans wore a type of loincloth known as a subligaculum.

The use of breechcloths took on common use by the Metis and Acadians and are mentioned as early as the 1650s. In the 1740s and 1750s they were issued to the Canadien as part of their war uniform and in 1755 they even tried to issue them to soldiers from France.

<text>Porto Alegre (, , ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Its population of roughly 1.4 million inhabitants (2022) makes it the 11th-most populous city in the country and the centre of Brazil&#x27;s fifth-largest metropolitan area, with 4.1 million inhabitants (2022). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state.

Porto Alegre was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sepúlveda, who used the pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo to hide his identity; the official date, though, is 1772 with the act signed by immigrants from the Azores, Portugal.

The city lies on the eastern bank of the Guaíba Lake, where five rivers converge to form the Lagoa dos Patos, a giant freshwater lagoon navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port and a chief industrial and commercial centre of Brazil.

In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the World Social Forum, an initiative of several nongovernment organizations. The city became famous for being the first city that implemented participatory budgeting. The 9th Assembly of the World Council of Churches was held in Porto Alegre in 2006. Since 2000, Porto Alegre also hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest free software events, called FISL. The city was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, having previously been a venue for the 1950 FIFA World Cup.

==History==


The official date of the foundation of the city of Porto Alegre is 26 March 1772, by Manuel Sepúlveda, when Freguesia de São Francisco do Porto dos Casais was created and changed a year later to Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus de Porto Alegre. However, the village started in 1752, when 60 Azorean couples were brought over by the Treaty of Madrid to set up Missions at the Northeast Region of Rio Grande do Sul that was handed over to the Portuguese Crown in exchange for the Sacramento Colony located on the margin of the Plata River. Land demarcation took a long time and the Azoreans settled permanently at Porto de Viamão, which was the first name by which Porto Alegre went.

On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre became the capital city of the province, when the administration of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide his identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants from all over the world started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese.

The capital city of Rio Grande do Sul is also the capital city in the Pampas region, the name given to the region of fauna and flora typical of the vast plains that dominate the landscape of the southern tip of Brazil, and parts of Argentina and Uruguay, from where the &quot;gaúcho&quot; comes, the historical figure of a brave warrior who fought legendary battles and wars in the quest to conquer the borders of the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the 16th century.

After the declaration of Brazilian Independence in 1822, this was opposed by the inhabitants of the region and they fought a long war for their independence from the Brazilian Empire. The Farrapos War started with the confrontation in Porto Alegre, near the Azenha bridge on 20 September 1835. This conflict began the myth of the gaucho who is still praised in songs and celebrated in annual pageants and honored as names of streets and parks.

When the Farrapos War ended, the city continued to develop and underwent strong urban restructuring during the last decades of the 18th century, driven by the accelerated growth of port-related activities and shipyards. Its development continued over time and the city kept abreast with cultural, political and social events that were taking place within Brazil.

The city became known worldwide in 1963 through hosting the World University Games. In 1985, the people of Porto Alegre joined the movement for free elections and one of the largest demonstrations took place in the city.
In 2024, the city and other neighbouring areas were flooded due to heavy rain.

==The city==
The city is on a delta resulting from the junction of five rivers, officially called Guaíba Lake (popularly mentioned as a river, too). The city dates from the mid-18th century, when colonist from the Azores, islands in the Atlantic Ocean that are part of Portugal, settled in the area, sponsored by the Portuguese colonyimmi. The city was officially established in 1742. Porto Alegre is one of the wealthiest cities in Latin America and one of the most diverse. Its residents includes indigenous Brazilians, afro-Brazilians, immigrants from Portugal, Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. There are also significant Arab and Jewish contingents among its population. The Afro-Brazilian population of the state tends to be concentrated in the city.

Before this, Porto Alegre was the port of Viamão on the shore of Guaíba Lake. Its previous name was Porto dos Casais (Port of the Couples). and it was initially settled by Azoreans. Many families of settlers came from the city of Rio Grande in the littoral Lagunar region, to the south, a military fortress at that time. Today Rio Grande is the most important port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The city is also known as &quot;Porto do Sol&quot; (Port of the Sun) and &quot;Cidade Sorriso&quot; (Smile City). More than 70 neighborhoods (see below) are part of the city and two-thirds of the population are concentrated in the Zona Norte (Northern Zone), where most of the economic activity, including the city center, takes place.

Porto Alegre was the seat of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in southern Brazil, it is an important industrial center in the area. It is also a center for &quot;gaúcho&quot; (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its &quot;churrasco&quot; (barbecue) and &quot;chimarrão&quot; (a strong and hot tea prepared from yerba mate). In 2000, the literacy rate was 97%. The high quality of life is one of the city&#x27;s main features.

==Geography==
The city of Porto Alegre is located at the northern end of the large coastal lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos in southeastern Brazil. The city lies on the east bank of the mouth of the Rio Guaiba, the estuary of which forms the enormous freshwater lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos. Also joining the Guaíba at Porto Alegre are the Jacuí River, the Sinos River, the Gravataí River and the Caí River, all tributaries of Guaíba just before it empties into Lagoa dos Patos.

Porto Alegre has a long coastline on the Guaíba Lake, and its topography is punctuated by 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, a maze of islands facing the city forms an archipelago where a unique ecosystem gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the native flora of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species. Among these, there are many trees which are vestiges of the Atlantic Forest. The fauna is also diversified, especially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and tree-lined streets.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Porto Alegre has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by its high variability, but with well-defined seasons and evenly distributed rain throughout the year. The presence of Lake Guaíba contributes to increase the humidity of the air. The city experiences the most prominent difference among seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One reason for that is its much more southerly position relative to the rest of the country, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June. Due to a large depletion in the ozone layer over the south of Brazil, a result of the Antarctic ozone hole, the population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high UV radiation.
The winter is mild to cool, windy, rainy and quite changeable, which is also a feature of this time of the year. Usual winter temperatures range from to . In the coldest days of the year the temperature may fall slightly below zero, like in 2012, when it recorded . The summers are very hot, with temperatures that go up to , sometimes reaching . Sometimes, summer usually has irregular rains and periods of drought. Fall tends to be as changeable as winter, but is typically warmer. Spring is usually very rainy, with thunderstorms, strong winds and hailstorms. The climate of Porto Alegre is very affected by El Niño phenomenon, with flooding in some neighborhoods of the city, especially in the islands in the Lake Guaiba. However, a drainage system and a wall along the Historic District were built after a major flood in 1941 that devastated the city, preventing further damage.

Snow is very rare, sometimes confused with sleet. The only snowfall events in Porto Alegre were in 1879, 1910, 1984, 1994, 2000 and 2006, and few of them featured accumulation. However, frost sometimes occurs in the city. Occurrence of radiation fog is common, causing several delays in early flights. Unlike other large Brazilian cities much further north, notably Brasília, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro which receive a pronounced summer maximum in precipitation amounts, Porto Alegre experiences a prominent winter maximum in precipitation values and cloud cover, while the summer season is primarily hot and sunny; though evidently high humidity levels often give a distinct mugginess to the conditions and reduces air quality. According to 1981-2010 averages, Porto Alegre receives an average-total precipitation amount of Annually. This average makes the city slightly wetter than Rio at and, to a small extent, drier than both São Paulo at and Brasilia at , although 1991-2020 normals show annual precipitation figure rising to .

The highest recorded unofficial temperature was and the highest official one was , recorded on January 1, 1943, while the lowest official recorded temperature was on July 11, 1918. 
===Vegetation===

Porto Alegre lies in a transitional area between the subtropical forest and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established to protect native trees. Many of the city&#x27;s avenues have been planted with different tree species. One striking example of this is Teresópolis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found locally. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: &quot;Delta do Jacuí&quot; (Jacuí Delta) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve.

The urban area has many parks and plazas, making Porto Alegre one of the greenest provincial capitals in Brazil. The first city squares date from the second half of the 18th century and were originally large public spaces used as food markets. The city has of green space, occupying 31 percent of the city&#x27;s area. This is an average of 17.6 m2 per person. More than one million trees line the public streets and SMAM plants an average of 30,000 seedlings each year. The four main parks are: Parque Farroupilha, a park; Jardim Botânico (The Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre), with some 725 species of vegetation on about of land; and Parque Marinha do Brasil (The Brazilian Navy&#x27;s Park), a vast park of more than which offers a wide variety of sports fields and tracks. The city&#x27;s cycleway is called the Caminho dos Parques, which at over long links the Moinhos do Vento, Farroupilha and Guaíba shore parks.

The Lami José Lutzenberger Biological Reserve was established in 1975 in the Lami neighborhood of Porto Alegre, named after the local agronomist and environmentalist José Lutzenberger. It was the first municipal reserve in Brazil. The reserve covers . It reopened in April 2002 after being closed for more than ten years to allow its ecosystems to recover.
The reserve conserves nature and supports research and environmental education.

===Water===

Sewer service is available to 87.7 percent of the city, and 100 percent of the population is serviced by treated water. While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest the revenues it collects, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.
In 2010, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a US$83.2 million to support the Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre. The program is carried out by the Municipal Department of Management and Strategic Support and its focus is on improving water quality in Guaíba Lake and the Cavalhada River, developing urban infrastructure to reduce flood risk along the Cavalhada River, improving the environmental management in the Municipality of Porto Alegre, and promoting efficient municipal water, sanitation and storm drainage services. This program improves the quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Guaíba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement.

The Jacuí estuary contains the Jacuí Delta State Park, which in turn contains the Banhados do Delta Biological Reserve, a fully protected area which covers the islands of Pólvora and Pombas.

===Air quality===
Motor vehicles are responsible for the main atmospheric pollutant emissions. The city has the second worst air quality in Brazil, after only São Paulo. The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time. SMAM (the Municipal Council of the Environment) has encouraged the use of the cleanest fuels and has played a role in monitoring pollution levels.

A partnership between SMAM, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, the State Environmental Protection Foundation (FEPAM) and Petrobrás has created a network of five air monitoring stations in Porto Alegre. By utilizing a Petrobrás product called city diesel, sulphur levels in the air have dropped from 1.2 percent in 1989 to 0.5 percent. Hybrid buses which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of natural gas, the city&#x27;s taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2022 census, there were 1,332,845 people residing in the city of Porto Alegre. The census revealed the following numbers: 981,251 White people (73.6%), 178,354 Pardo (Multiracial) people (13.4%), 168,196 Black people (12.6%), 2,708 Amerindian people (0.2%), 2,306 Asian people (0.2%). In 2010, the city of Porto Alegre was the 10th most populous city in Brazil. In 2010, the city had 269,519 opposite-sex couples and 1,401 same-sex couples. The population of Porto Alegre was 53.6% female and 46.4% male.

Porto Alegre is mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. Its settlement started in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. From 1748 to 1756, 2,300 Azoreans were sent to the region by the King of Portugal to protect Southern Brazil from neighbouring invaders. These colonists, mostly composed of married couples, established the city of &quot;Porto dos Casais&quot; (literally translated &quot;harbor of the couples&quot;), nowadays Porto Alegre. In 1775, 55% of Rio Grande do Sul&#x27;s population was of Azorean Portuguese origin. Porto Alegre was composed mainly of Azoreans and their African slaves until the first half of the 19th century.
Other than the Portuguese, the first Europeans to settle Rio Grande do Sul were German immigrants. In 1824, the first immigrants from Germany arrived in Porto Alegre, but they were sent to what is now the city of São Leopoldo ( away). From 1824 to 1914, 50,000 Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul. Most of these colonists had rural communities in the countryside of the state as their first destination. The large rural exodus in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many originally German migrants from the countryside into Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose a large percentage of the population.

The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the Italians. They started emigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian Veneto region. As with the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the Serra Gaúcha region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre. Minority communities of immigrants, such as Central Europeans from Poland and Eastern Europeans from Ukraine and Jews; Arabs from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria; Asians from Japan; as well as Spaniards arriving after the Civil War also made Porto Alegre their home. According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, the ancestral composition of the population of Porto Alegre is: 77.70% European, 12.70% African and 9.60% Native American.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a temple in Porto Alegre.

===Crime===
The number of violent crimes has been dropping steadily since 2018.

==Politics, government and citizenship==

The executive branch is headed by the mayor of the municipality, which includes departments and other public administration bodies directly and indirectly. The legislature is represented by the City Council.

It hosted the first three editions of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The third edition attracted 20,763 delegates from 130 countries, with a total audience of 100,000 people from all parts of the world.

===Participatory budgeting===

A feature of public administration in Porto Alegre is the adoption of a system of popular participation in the definition of public investment, called the Participatory Budget. The first full participatory budgeting process was developed in the city starting in 1989. Participatory budgeting in its most meaningful form took place in the city from 1991 to 2004. Participatory budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city&#x27;s residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools).

Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre has occurred annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement. Porto Alegre spent about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, This money is subject to participatory budgeting, unlike the annual spending on fixed expenses such as debt service and pensions, which is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre took part at the peak of the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants having grown year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds. Although participatory budgeting appears to continue in the city today, two prominent scholars on the process have stated that &quot;after the defeat of the Workers&#x27; Party in late 2004, a politically conservative coalition maintained the surface features of PB while returning the actual functioning of the administration to more traditional modes of favor-trading and the favoring of local elites.&quot;

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and runs throughout the year in many assemblies in each of the city&#x27;s 16 districts, dealing with many areas of interest to urban life. The meetings elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend, in order to respond to citizens&#x27; concerns. In the following months, delegates meet to review technical project criteria and district needs.
City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district&#x27;s demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget. The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require, changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).

A World Bank paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, sewer and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986. According to Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy for the establishment of an active citizenship in Brazil. The distribution of investment resources planning that follows a part of the statement of priorities for regional or thematic meetings, culminating with the approval of an investment plan that works and activities program broken down by investment sector, by region and around the city. Also according to Fedozzi, this favors:

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre&#x27;s health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).

Despite being the pioneering experiment of participatory budgeting, Porto Alegre like many other examples does not have guaranteed sustainability. The positive impact has dwindled since 2004 due to funding changes and decreasing government commitment. Participatory budgeting has been suspended in Porto Alegre since 2017 

==Economy==


Located at the junction of five rivers, it has become an important alluvial port as well as one of the chief industrial and commercial centres in Brazil. Products of the rich agricultural and pastoral hinterland, such as soybeans, leather, canned beef, and rice, are exported from Porto Alegre to destinations as far away as Africa and Japan.

Among the main businesses located in Porto Alegre are Gerdau, Petroleo Ipiranga, Zaffari and RBS. Since 2000, General Motors (GM) is operating in Gravataí, located in the Metropolitan Region. Also in this Region but in Triunfo, there is a Petrochemical Pool, and in Eldorado do Sul Dell Computers has established a plant. In the health sector, the three hospitals: Hospital Moinhos de Vento, which is a private, JCAH-accredited hospital, Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital and Clinicas Hospital, public, are considered among the best in Latin America. The latter are university-affiliated, referral hospitals for the South of Brazil. Commerce is a very important economic activity, with many malls (like Praia de Belas Shopping, Shopping Iguatemi and the smaller though posh Shopping Moinhos). The Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre, directed to the production of shoes (around Novo Hamburgo) and to petrochemical industries, as well as services.

In the city is located the Electronics Technology Center (CEITEC), focused on the development and production of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), today announced the opening of Latin America&#x27;s first IC design center. To create state-of-the-art semiconductor products for high-volume markets that will be consumed in Latin America as well as exported to global markets. CEITEC S.A will accelerate the growth of Latin America&#x27;s electronics industry by leveraging Brazil&#x27;s regional influence, leadership and economic strength. The company will add 60 engineers to its ranks who will design RFID, digital media and wireless communication chips for its fabrication facility now ramping up for production. The total investment by the Brazilian government is almost US$210 million. The company is implementing a fab-lite strategy with the ability to manufacture analog/digital chips at its facility in Porto Alegre. The in-house design center with more than 100 engineers.

The GDP for the city was R$30,116,002,000 (2006). The per capita income for the city was R$20,900 (2006).

==Sustainability programs==

===Energy===

In Brazil, there are also a few coal-fired plants, fuel-oil fired plants and one nuclear facility. Increased utilization of natural gas and other sources is planned in order to reduce Brazil&#x27;s overdependence on hydroelectric power. In 1999, a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil was completed, with its terminus in Porto Alegre. Brazilian investment group Central Termoeletrica Sul (CTSul) has plans to invest US$698 million in a 650MW coal-fired power generation plant in Cachoeira do Sul, located in Rio Grande do Sul.

The largest wind energy park in Brazil, which is being built east of Porto Alegre in Osório, will add 150 megawatts (MW) to the Brazilian energy matrix. The production represents 5 percent of the energy consumed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and would be sufficient to meet two-thirds of Porto Alegre&#x27;s energy demands. The Farm opened in 2008 with 75 2MW turbines and has been approved for a 300MW expansion which would make it the largest wind farm in the region. The project is part of the Alternative Energy Sources Program (Proinfa) from state-owned Eletrobrás, which will purchase the energy produced for the next 20 years.

===Recycling===
Porto Alegre was one of the first cities in Brazil to develop a recycling program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the country. The city produces about 1,600 tonnes of household waste per day. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.

Rio Grande do Sul Museum of Art – MARGS

With an eclectic style, the building was designed by German architect Theo Wiederspahn. Originally it was the headquarters of the Fiscal Surveillance Agency of the Federal Revenue Office. Nowadays, it hosts the largest public collection of art works in Rio Grande do Sul.

Júlio de Castilhos Museum

Created in 1903, this is the oldest museum in the state. Its collection comprises thousands of pieces related to the local history, from Indian relics to objects and iconography about the Ragamuffin War and the Paraguayan War, including an important section showing fine sculptures from the Jesuitic Reductions.

Joaquim Felizardo Museum

This is an important museum with a large collection of archaeological artifacts and photographs of Porto Alegre&#x27;s old times. Its historical building, dating from 1845 to 1855, is one of the few intact relics of colonial architecture inside the modern urban environment.

Rio Grande do Sul Memorial

This museum displays a huge collection of documents, maps, objects, prints and other items related to the state&#x27;s history. Its building, designed by Theodor Wiederspahn, is one of the finest examples of eclectic architecture in the city.

Luiz Carlos Prestes&#x27; Memorial

Projected by Oscar Niemeyer, the Luiz Carlos Prestes&#x27; Memorial is a recent addition to the city&#x27; cultural landscape. Besides the wall presentation of Prestes&#x27; life, a hall for cultural, social and political events is placed to the citizens of Porto Alegre.

===Carnival/Carnaval===

The Porto Alegre Carnival began in the 18th century with the entrudo, a prank brought over by the Portuguese from the Azores, whereby people threw flour, water, and &quot;limão de cheiro&quot; missiles at each other. At the end of the 19th century, two important Carnival associations were born. Rivalry between the two long dominated the city&#x27;s Carnival. The corso, a parade of floats down Porto Alegre&#x27;s streets, was a celebration enjoyed by the more well-to-do of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

One of the most important Carnival personalities is King Momo. At the beginning of Carnival, usually in February, he receives the keys to the city from the Mayor of Porto Alegre, symbolically governing the Carnival during the four days of revelry. Vincente Rao was the most popular King Momo.

===Classic Music===

The city is a reference for the entire state in terms of classical music, serving as the main hub for production and dissemination of influence. It has a considerable audience for this genre; it is included in the tour routes of internationally renowned performers and boasts two major orchestras - the Porto Alegre Symphony Orchestra (OSPA) and the PUCRS Philharmonic Orchestra - as well as a chamber orchestra, the São Pedro Theater Chamber Orchestra, along with numerous smaller chamber groups and vocal and instrumental soloists. The city also has a large number of music schools and performance venues.

At the same time, there is noticeable development in academic research and advanced professional qualification in the undergraduate and graduate music programs at UFRGS. In addition to generating a significant collection of musicological texts and publications and preparing a large number of music professionals and new teachers, the organization of high-quality public recitals is an integral part of the functioning of these programs.

===Cuisine===

The traditional beverage is chimarrao, a South-American caffeine-rich infused drink. The Chalet of the XV de Novembro Plaza is located along the Glênio Peres Square, it is one of the most traditional bar-draught beer-restaurants in the city, where the last &quot;lambe-lambe&quot; photographs of the region work. &quot;Lambe-lambes&quot; are photographers who develop pictures outdoor using the oldest method known. In the Bavarian style, with art nouveau traits, the centenary Chalet was built up on a demountable steel structure, keeping its original chandeliers and tiles even nowadays.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of Porto Alegre is a mosaic of ancient and modern styles. This characteristic is most visible in the center of the city, the historic urban center, where examples of eighteenth-century architecture survive amidst nineteenth-century and contemporary buildings.
The architectural evolution of Porto Alegre does not differ in its general mechanism from most large Brazilian cities, although it has some unique elements. Its condition of provincial capital almost from the beginning resulted in a tendency to expand and monumentalize. Today it is the largest city in the state, the seat of a Metropolitan Region, and one of the largest cities in Brazil. Throughout its history, it has collected an extensive series of monumental buildings, many of extraordinary value, and some advanced urban planning projects, but as a whole, this did not result in a coherent plan nor did it reveal a spirit of long-term planning, having grown vastly in a disorganized and poorly controlled way, with urban plans being very much linked to political and economic oscillations.

The architecture in the city began with the Portuguese colonial style, went through the neoclassical, eclectic, and modernist schools. Porto Alegre verticalized, expanded, merged with neighboring cities, and became a metropolis. Now its architecture is being renewed under the influence of postmodernism and globalization, developing a hybrid and internationalizing style. This has given rise to criticism about the de-characterization of its identity and the extensive destruction of irreplaceable historical architecture in the wave of &quot;progress&quot; and real estate speculation.

Today, the city is reorganizing its urban landscape with major infrastructure works, especially roads, and erecting significant examples of contemporary architecture. At the same time, it faces the challenges of growing into one of Brazil&#x27;s largest capitals, with almost 1.5 million inhabitants. There is still a large population living in slums and without access to basic services, and dissatisfaction is growing with the directions that the public administration has adopted in the areas of urban planning, popular housing, use of special areas, urban mobility, nature preservation, and others. Urban revitalization projects promoted by the state and municipal governments, such as those of the Mauá Pier, the former Industrial District, and a program of concessions of parks and other public spaces to the private sector, have produced intense controversy.

==Events==

A wide range of cultural events are held in Porto Alegre. In addition to the traditional celebrations, a wide variety of activities are organized at Porto Alegre during the different seasons.

* World Social Forum: on several occasions (2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) the World Social Forum has been hosted in Porto Alegre. This event gathered more than 100,000 people from more than 100 countries each year. The main aim of these meetings is to discuss and deal with social issues.

==Transportation==
===International airport===


Salgado Filho International Airport serves commercial flights to most major cities all over Brazil and to smaller cities in the South of the country. There are also international flights to other South American countries, Panama, and Portugal.

===Air Force Base===
Canoas Air Force Base - ALA3, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in the nearby city of Canoas.

===Port===

The Port of Porto Alegre is situated in the Eastern margin of Guaíba Lake. The port lying on the eastern bank of the Guaíba lake at the point where its waters empty into the huge Lagoa dos Patos is one of Brazil&#x27;s largest ports. Located near the main access roads to Porto Alegre, it is away from the Salgado Filho International Airport and has access to the light railway station, through the docks of Mauá and Navegantes. Its geographical position enables a permanent traffic between Porto Alegre and Buenos Aires, transporting steel-industry products and mainly agricultural produce.

===Metro===
Porto Alegre has a rapid transit system operated by Trensurb, which links downtown Porto Alegre to its northern neighborhoods and to cities to the north of the metropolitan area, as Canoas, Esteio, Sapucaia do Sul, São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo. The line has stations at strategic spots, such as: the Public Market, the bus station, the airport and many other important and urban spots throughout Porto Alegre and the other cities the metro covers. The line is built at surface level (30 km, totally segregated) and elevated (12 km).

Trensurb is operated jointly by the federal government, the state government of Rio Grande do Sul and the city of Porto Alegre through the company Trensurb S.A. (Company of Urban Trains of Porto Alegre S.A.) and has 22 working stations, with a total extension of nearly , carrying about 130,000 users a day. 
Building of the (sole) Line 1 of the metro started in 1980. The choice of path was made to relieve the heavy traffic of highway BR-116, which already presented serious problems with the transit at the time. The line was inaugurated on March 2, 1985, between the Central Public Market and Sapucaia do Sul. In December 1997, it was extended to Unisinos. An extension of São Leopoldo–Museum was added in November 2000, after two months of trial service. , an extension to Novo Hamburgo is being completed, with the first station already fully functional.

A metro system inside Porto Alegre only is currently planned and it is already subject of much publicity and speculation. However, no project has been approved so far and the beginning of the constructions is yet undefined.

===Highways===
There are two federal highways in the city, BR-290 and BR-116, both running close to its northern and northwestern border. The small number is due to the inexistence of many destinations southeast or south of Porto Alegre (considering the landmass east of Lagoa dos Patos), if not for the cities of Pelotas (the third-biggest in population in the State) and Rio Grande (which hosts the State biggest port). Nonetheless, when coming from west, both highways bond in the neighbor municipality of Eldorado do Sul, running mostly jointly within the borders of Porto Alegre, only coming to separate at the very interchange to Canoas. This way, BR-116 has virtually no sole run within Porto Alegre.

BR-290 highway runs east–west across the state, linking the northeast coast of the state to the Uruguay–Argentina–Brazil border. It runs close to the northern border of the municipality. Coming from west, as it reaches the urban area of Porto Alegre, BR-290 highway becomes a high-standard long freeway that connects to the coast and to the BR-101 highway. The latter is an important way to get to Porto Alegre from the north of the country, by the city Osório. BR-101 connects to Curitiba, Florianópolis and northern Santa Catarina state, and has been recently upgraded to highway standards, with multiple lanes. By entering the BR-290 freeway/BR-101 system, and the other highways it connects to, it is possible to drive from Porto Alegre to as far as Rio de Janeiro or Belo Horizonte almost entirely through 4-lane (or more) highways.

The other road, BR-116, is a longitudinal highway, running northeast–south across the state, linking Porto Alegre to several satellite cities and other Brazilian capitals to the north, and Pelotas and Uruguay to the south. Within the municipality, it only touches the northwest side of the city, close to the end of Rio Gravataí (Gravataí River), sharing its entire run with BR-290, only separating when heading north onto Canoas.

A third road, BR-448, is currently under construction. BR-448 is planned to connect the northeast of Porto Alegre to Sapucaia do Sul, as an alternative to BR-116, notably jam-packed on its Canoas-Novo Hamburgo stretch during traffic rush hours.

The connection between downtown Porto Alegre and the highways is made by Avenida Presidente Castelo Branco (President Castelo Branco Avenue), which is a short - - avenue also bordering the northwest side of the city, Avenida dos Estados (States&#x27; Avenue), which is the access way to the Salgado Filho International Airport, and Avenida Assis Brasil (Assis Brasil Avenue), the main Avenue in the northern Porto Alegre.

===Bus===
The city has a functioning transportation system, especially the autobuses. Porto Alegre has also mini-buses from and to all the main neighborhoods in the city, with sitting-only transport and the possibility to hop on and off at any point but also higher fares. &quot;Linha Turística&quot; (Tourist Line) is a bus that leaves from Usina do Gasômetro tourist terminal around six times per day. During 90 minutes, it traverses the various districts of Porto Alegre, for a modest price. Exclusive bus lanes in the median of seven radial that converge on the city center are used by both urban and regional lines. The bus fleet totals 1,600, with 150 minibuses. About 325 million people use the system annually.

Those lines have no prefix. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but since there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal for the next bus. Transversal lines prefix &quot;T&quot; (T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different neighborhoods without going through the downtown area, which effectively eliminates the need of changing buses for the most common trips. lines prefix &quot;C&quot; (C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.

Mayor José Fogaça renewed his agreement with EMBARQ and the Center for Sustainable Transport Brazil (CTS-Brasil) to improve accessibility and mobility in downtown Porto Alegre. The agreement, signed on March 11, includes a new partnership with the Andean Development Corporation, a Latin American multilateral financial institution that is expected to provide $1 million in non-reimbursable technical assistance to help Porto Alegre complete the preparation phase of the &quot;Portais da Cidade&quot; bus rapid transit project, a groundbreaking transport system designed to reduce pollution and congestion downtown. The system will include a southern extension to accommodate activities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. CAF&#x27;s technical assistance will be administered through CTS-Brasil, which has been working to expand sustainable transport in Porto Alegre since 2005.

The bus station downtown and is served by several national and international lines. It is also connected to a Trensurb station (Porto Alegre Metro) and several municipal bus lines. Northbound passengers can rely on good bus connections throughout Brazil. However, an express bus might be recommended to travel to Uruguay or Argentina to avoid several stops en route.

===Taxi===
Porto Alegre has a total of 3,922 authorized taxicabs, with 317 taxi stops. Regular taxis are colored red, whereas 
airport taxicabs are colored white, both with blue strips on the sides containing white lettering.

==Sports==

Football is a passion of the people from Porto Alegre. There is a big rivalry between two football clubs, Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense, founded in 1903, and Sport Club Internacional, founded in 1909.

Other traditional teams includes Série C side Esporte Clube São José, which plays in the Estádio Passo D&#x27;Areia on the northern zone of the city, and Esporte Clube Cruzeiro, which from its founding in 1913 until 2019 played in Porto Alegre until they relocated to Cachoeirinha —in the metropolitan region of Porto Alehre—after inaugurating a brand new stadium there.

Porto Alegre was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil. The modernization of the Beira-Rio Stadium, home of SC Internacional and the city&#x27;s 2014 FIFA World Cup venue, left the venue with a capacity for 56,000 spectators. Internacional&#x27;s former home, the Estádio dos Eucaliptos, was a venue for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. Local rivals Grêmio play in their own stadium in the Humaitá district. The Arena do Grêmio stadium replaced the Estádio Olímpico Monumental in 2012 and meets CONMEBOL/FIFA standards. The Arena do Grêmio stadium has a capacity for 60,540 spectators.

American football is also played in the city, with two teams: Porto Alegre Pumpkins, the oldest in the state, and Porto Alegre Bulls, who play with the Esporte Clube São José, a club with multiple sports.

<text>5145 Pholus is an eccentric centaur in the outer Solar System, approximately in diameter, that crosses the orbit of both Saturn and Neptune. It was discovered on 9 January 1992 by American astronomer David Rabinowitz (uncredited) of UA&#x27;s Spacewatch survey at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. The very reddish object has an elongated shape and a rotation period of 9.98 hours. It was named after the centaur Pholus from Greek mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==
Pholus was the second centaur to be discovered. Centaurs are objects in between the asteroid and trans-Neptunian populations of the Solar System that is, beyond Jupiter&#x27;s and within Neptune&#x27;s orbit which behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 8.8–31.9 AU once every 91 years and 9 months (33,526 days; semi-major axis of 20.35 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.57 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic. It is a Saturn-, Uranus- and Neptune-crosser, crossing the orbits of these giant planets at a mean distance of 9.6, 11.9, and 30.1 AU from the Sun, respectively. Pholus has not come within one astronomical unit of a planet since 764 BC, and will not until 5290. It is believed that it originated in the Kuiper belt.

== Discovery and naming ==
Pholus was discovered by David Rabinowitz (not officially credited), working with the Spacewatch program, at Kitt Peak National Observatory on 9 January 1992. Rabinowitz&#x27;s discovery was confirmed by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker who identified the object on images they previously took on 1 January 1992. The discovery was announced by James Scotti on 23 January 1992 in an &quot;IAU Circular&quot; (IAUC 5434) of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. A first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the centaur&#x27;s observation arc by 15 years prior to its discovery. It was the second discovery of a centaur after 2060 Chiron discovered by Charles Kowal in 1977. In 1993, while with the Spacewatch program, David Rabinowitz went on to discover another centaur, 7066 Nessus.

This minor planet was named by the &quot;Minor Planet Names Committee&quot; for Pholus, a centaur from Greek mythology. As with 2060 Chiron, named after his brother Chiron, the tradition is to name this class of outer planet-crossing objects after the half-human, half-horse mythological creatures. In the mythological account, Pholus died from a self-inflicted wound from a poisoned arrow used by Heracles &quot;(see 5143 Heracles)&quot;, who buried Pholus on the mountain Pholoe. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 July 1992 ().

A symbol derived from that for 2060 Chiron, (), was devised in the late 1990s by German astrologer Robert von Heeren. It replaces Chiron&#x27;s K with a P for Pholus. A common variant, , uses a Greek φ.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Spectral type and color ===
After its discovery, Pholus was quickly found to be very red in color. The color has been speculated to be due to organic compounds on its surface. It is classified as a Z-class object on the Tholen taxonomic scheme.

The object has been classified by astronomers as RR and RR-U type, respectively. Polarimetric observations with ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in 2007 and 2008, revealed noticeable negative polarization at certain phase angles, distinctly different from that of trans-Neptunian objects. Pholus appears to have a rather homogeneous surface with a small amount of water frost on its darker regions.

The surface composition of Pholus has been estimated from its reflectance spectrum using two spatially segregated components: dark amorphous carbon and an intimate mixture of water ice, methanol ice, olivine grains, and complex organic compounds (tholins). The carbon black component was used to match the low albedo of the object. Unlike Chiron, Pholus has shown no signs of cometary activity.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
Diameter calculations range from 99 to 190 kilometers with a corresponding albedo between 0.155 and 0.04.

According to the Herschel Space Observatory with its PACS instrument, Pholus measures 99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.155, while a study from 1996 derived a diameter of 185 km. During 2003–2004, observations with the 1.8-meter Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) on Mount Graham Observatory, Arizona, determined an elongated shape, , with a mean diameter of 190 kilometers, based on a low albedo of 0.04. Johnston&#x27;s archive lists a diameter of 107 km with an albedo of 0.126, and &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo of a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 165 km based on an absolute magnitude of 7.64.

=== Rotation period ===
In March 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Pholus was obtained from photometric observations by Tegler using the VATT at Mount Graham. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 9.980 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.60 magnitude (). Alternative period determinations were also conducted by Hoffmann, Franham, and Buie with concurring results of 9.977, 9.982, and 9.983 hours, respectively ().

<text>The Holland Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel under the Hudson River that connects Hudson Square and Lower Manhattan in New York City in the east to Jersey City, New Jersey, in the west. The tunnel is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and carries Interstate 78. The New Jersey side of the tunnel is the eastern terminus of New Jersey Route 139. The Holland Tunnel is one of three vehicular crossings between Manhattan and New Jersey; the two others are the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge.

Plans for a fixed vehicular crossing over the Hudson River were first devised in 1906. However, disagreements prolonged the planning process until 1919, when it was decided to build a tunnel under the river. Construction of the Holland Tunnel started in 1920, and it opened in 1927. At the time of its opening, it was the longest continuous underwater tunnel for vehicular traffic in the world.

The Holland Tunnel was the world&#x27;s first mechanically ventilated tunnel. Its ventilation system was designed by Ole Singstad, who oversaw the tunnel&#x27;s completion. Original names considered for the tunnel included Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel and Canal Street Tunnel, but it was ultimately named the Holland Tunnel in memory of Clifford Milburn Holland, its initial chief engineer who died suddenly in 1924 prior to the tunnel&#x27;s opening.

==Description==
The Holland Tunnel is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It consists of a pair of parallel tubes underneath the Hudson River. The tunnel was designed by Clifford Milburn Holland, the project&#x27;s chief engineer, who died in October 1924, before it was completed. He was succeeded by Milton Harvey Freeman, who died less than a year after Holland did. Ole Singstad then oversaw the completion of the tunnel. The tunnel was designated a National Historic Civil and Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1982 and a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Emergency services at the Holland Tunnel are provided by the Port Authority Police Department, who are stationed at the Port Authority&#x27;s crossings.

=== Tubes ===

==== Materials and dimensions ====
Each tube has a diameter, and the two tubes run apart under the Hudson River. The exteriors of each tube are composed of a series of cast iron rings, each of which comprises 14 curved steel pieces that are each long. The steel rings are covered by a layer of concrete. Each tube provides a roadway with two lanes and of vertical clearance. The north tube is between portals, while the south tube is slightly shorter, at . If each tube&#x27;s immediate approach roads are included, the north tube is long and the south tube long. Most vehicles carrying hazmats, trucks with more than three axles, and vehicles towing trailers cannot use the tunnel. There is a width limit of for vehicles entering the tunnel.

Both tubes&#x27; underwater sections are long and are situated in the silt beneath the river. The lowest point of the roadways is about below mean high water. The lowest point of the tunnel ceiling is about below mean high water. The tubes descend at a maximum grade of 4.06% and ascend at a grade of up to 3.8%. The tubes stretch an additional from the eastern shoreline to the New York portals, and from the western shoreline to the New Jersey portals. These sections of the tunnel are more rectangular in shape, since they were built as open cuts that were later covered over. The walls and ceiling are furnished with glazed ceramic tiles, which were originally engineered to minimize staining. The majority of the tiles are white, but there is a two-tile-high band of yellow-orange tiles at the bottom of each tube&#x27;s walls, as well as two-tile-high band of blue tiles on the top.

The northern tube, which carries westbound traffic, originates at Broome Street in Lower Manhattan between Varick and Hudson Streets. It continues to 14th Street east of Marin Boulevard in Jersey City. The southern tube, designed for eastbound traffic, originates at 12th Street east of Marin Boulevard, and surfaces at the Holland Tunnel Rotary in Manhattan. The entrance and exit ramps to and from each portal are lined with granite and are wide. Although the two tubes&#x27; underwater sections are parallel and adjacent to each other, the tubes&#x27; portals on either side are located two blocks apart in order to reduce congestion on each side.

The Holland Tunnel&#x27;s tubes initially contained a road surface made of Belgian blocks and concrete. This was replaced with asphalt in 1955. Each tube contains a catwalk on its left (inner) side, raised above the roadway. Five emergency-exit cross-passages connect the two tubes&#x27; inner catwalks. When the Holland Tunnel opened, the catwalk was equipped with police booths and a telephone system, stationed at intervals of .

==== Traffic ====
The volume of traffic going through the Holland Tunnel has remained steady despite tight restrictions on eastbound traffic in response to the September 11 attacks, including a ban on commercial traffic entering New York City put in place after an August 2004 threat. Aside from a sharp decline immediately following the September 11 attacks, the number of vehicles using the Holland Tunnel in either direction daily steadily declined from a peak of 103,020 daily vehicles in 1999 to 89,792 vehicles in 2016. , the eastbound direction of the Holland Tunnel was used by 14,871,543 vehicles annually.

====Ventilation====
The Holland Tunnel was the first mechanically ventilated underwater vehicular tunnel in the world. It contains a system of vents that run transverse, or perpendicular, to the tubes. Each side of the Hudson River has two ventilation shaft buildings: one on land, and one in the river approximately from the respective shoreline. All of the ventilation buildings have buff brick facades with steel and reinforced-concrete frames.

The shafts within the river rise above mean high water. Their supporting piers descend , of which are underwater and are embedded in the riverbed. The river shafts double as emergency exits by way of shipping piers that connected each ventilation shaft to the shoreline. The New York Land Ventilation Tower, a five-story building with a trapezoidal footprint, is tall. The New Jersey Land Ventilation Tower is a four-story, building with a rectangular perimeter.

The four ventilation towers contain a combined 84 fans. Of these, 42 are intake fans with varying capacities from per minute. The other 42 are exhaust fans, which can blow between per minute. Exhaust ducts are located at the corners of the ventilation towers, while supply ducts are in the central portion. Compartments housing exhaust fans are positioned near the corners under the exhaust stacks, with the central portions of the fan floors free for intake fans, and the central section of each outer wall for air intakes. At the time of the tunnel&#x27;s construction, two-thirds of the 84 fans were being used regularly, while the other fans were reserved for emergency use. The fans blow fresh air into ducts, which provide air intake to the tunnel via openings at the tubes&#x27; curbside. The ceiling contains slits, which are used to exhaust air. The fans can replace all of the air inside the tunnel every 90 seconds. A forced ventilation system is essential because of the poisonous carbon monoxide component of automobile exhaust, which constituted a far greater percentage of exhaust gases before catalytic converters became prevalent.

===Approach plazas===

==== Boyle Plaza ====
The approach to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City begins where the lower level of NJ Route 139 and the Newark Bay Extension merge. On May 6, 1936, the section of what became Route 139/I-78 between Jersey Avenue and Marin Boulevard was named in memory of John F. Boyle, the former interstate tunnel commissioner. Despite being part of the Interstate Highway System, I-78 and Route 139 run concurrently along 12th and 14th Street Streets to reach the Holland Tunnel. Westbound traffic uses 14th Street while eastbound traffic uses 12th Street. The plaza was restored and landscaped by the Jersey City government in 1982.

There is a nine-lane toll plaza for eastbound traffic only at the eastern end of 12th Street, just west of the tunnel portal. The original toll plaza had eight lanes; it was renovated in 1953–1954, and the current nine-lane tollbooth was constructed in 1988.
==== Holland Tunnel Rotary ====

Soon after construction of the tunnel, and amid rising vehicular traffic in the area, a railroad freight depot, St. John&#x27;s Park Terminal, was abandoned and later demolished. The depot was located on the city block bounded by Laight, Varick, Beach, and Hudson Streets. The depot&#x27;s site was used as a storage yard until the 1960s when it became a circular roadway for traffic exiting the eastbound tube in Manhattan.

The original structure had four exits, but the plaza was renovated in the early 2000s with landscaping by Studio V Architecture and Ives Architecture Studio. A fifth exit was added in 2004.

==== Freeman Plaza ====

Originally used as the toll plazas for New Jersey-bound traffic, the small triangular patches of land at the mouth of the westbound tube entrance are referred to as Freeman Plaza or Freeman Square. The plaza is named after Milton Freeman, the engineer who took over the Holland Tunnel project after the death of Clifford Milburn Holland. The Freeman Plaza received its name just before the tunnel opened in 1927. The toll plaza was removed circa 1971 when the Port Authority stopped collecting tolls for New Jersey-bound drivers, and the square was later fenced off by the Port Authority. The small maintenance buildings for toll collectors were removed around 1982 or 1983. A bust of Holland sits outside the entrance to the westbound tube in Freeman Plaza.

A business improvement district for the area, the Hudson Square Connection, was founded in 2009 with the goal of repurposing the square for pedestrian use. Hudson Square Connection and the Port Authority collaborated to create a five-year, $27 million master plan for Freeman Plaza. In 2013, Freeman Plaza West was opened to the public. Bounded by Hudson, Broome, and Watts Streets, it features umbrellas, bistro tables and chairs, and tree plantings.

In 2014, Freeman Plaza East and Freeman Plaza North were opened on Varick and Broome Streets, respectively. The plazas contained chaise longues, bistro tables, and umbrellas. In 2016, the Hudson Square Connection added solar powered charging stations to both plazas, and introduced a summer lunchtime music series, called live@lunch. A statue by the artist Isamu Noguchi was also installed within the plaza. To the south of Freeman Plaza, between Varick, Watts, and Canal Streets is One Hudson Square, a New York City designated landmark in 2013.

==History==
===Need for vehicular tunnel===
Until the first decade of the 20th century, passage across the lower Hudson River was possible only by ferry. The first tunnels to be bored below the Hudson River were for railroad use. The Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad, now PATH, constructed two pairs of tubes to link the major railroad terminals in New Jersey with Manhattan Island: the Uptown Hudson Tubes, which opened in 1908, and the Downtown Hudson Tubes, which opened in 1909. The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s twin North River Tunnels, constructed to serve the new Pennsylvania Station, opened in 1910. The construction of these three tunnels proved that tunneling under the Hudson River was feasible. However, although train traffic was allowed to use the tunnel crossings, automotive traffic still had to be transported via ferry.

At the same time, freight traffic in the Port of New York and New Jersey was mostly carried on boats, but traffic had grown to such a point that the boats were at full capacity, and some freight started going to other ports in the United States. To alleviate this, officials proposed building a freight railroad tunnel, but this was blocked by the organized syndicates that held influence over much of the port&#x27;s freight operations. The public learned of the excessive traffic loads on existing boat routes, as well as the limited capacity of the H&amp;M and North River Tunnels, when the surface of the Hudson River froze in winter 1917, and again when Pennsylvania Railroad workers went on strike in winter 1918. One engineer suggested that three freight railroad tunnels would be cheaper to construct than one bridge.

=== Planning ===
==== Initial plans ====
In 1906, the New York and New Jersey Interstate Bridge Commission, a consortium of three groups, was formed to consider the need for a crossing across the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey. That year, three railroads asked the commission to consider building a railroad bridge over the river. In 1908, the commission considered building three bridges across the Hudson River at 57th, 110th, and 179th Streets in Manhattan. The reasoning was that bridges would be cheaper than tunnels. These three locations were considered to be the only suitable locations for suspension bridges; other sites were rejected on the grounds of aesthetics, geography, or traffic flows. John Vipond Davies, one of the partners for the consulting firm Jacobs and Davies (which had constructed the Uptown Hudson Tubes), wanted to build a vehicular tunnel between Canal Street, Manhattan, and 13th Street, Jersey City. This proposal would compete with the six-lane suspension bridge at 57th Street. Some plans provided for the construction of both the bridge and the tunnel. The ferries could not accommodate all of the 19,600 vehicles per day, as of 1913, that traveled between New York and New Jersey. The Bridge Commission hosted several meetings to tell truck drivers about the details of both the 57th Street Bridge and Canal Street Tunnel plans.

The United States Department of War brought up concerns about the 57th Street bridge plans: the span would need to be at least above the mean high water to avoid interfering with shipping. By comparison, the tunnel would be below mean water level. The Interstate Bridge Commission, which had been renamed the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission in April 1913, published a report that same month, stating that the Canal Street tunnel would cost $11 million while the 57th Street bridge would cost $42 million. In October 1913, Jacobs and Davies stated that a pair of tunnels, with each tube carrying traffic in one direction, would cost only $11 million, while a bridge might cost over $50 million. The low elevation and deep bedrock of Lower Manhattan was more conducive to a tunnel than to a bridge. By the end of that year, the consulting engineers for both the 57th Street Bridge and the Canal Street Tunnel had submitted their plans to the Bridge and Tunnel Commission. New York City merchants mainly advocated for the tunnel plan, while New Jerseyans and New York automobile drivers mostly supported the bridge plan. Meanwhile, the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission indicated that it favored the Canal Street tunnel plan. On the other hand, the 57th Street bridge plan remained largely forgotten.

The Public Service Commission of New Jersey published a report in April 1917, stating that the construction of a Hudson River vehicle tunnel from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City was feasible. That June, following this report, Walter Evans Edge, then Governor of New Jersey, convened the Hudson River Bridge and Tunnel Commission of New Jersey, which would work with the New York Bridge and Tunnel Commission to construct the new tunnel. In March 1918, a report was sent to the New York State Legislature, advocating for the construction of the tunnel as soon as possible. That year, six million dollars in funding for the Hudson River Tunnel was proposed in two bills presented to subcommittees of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. The bill was voted down by the Interstate Commerce Committee before it could be presented to the full Senate.

==== Plans approved ====

The original plans for the Hudson River tunnel were for twin two-lane tubes, with each tube carrying traffic in a single direction. A request for proposals for the tunnel was announced in 1918, and eleven such requests were considered. One of these proposals, authored by engineer George Goethals, was for a bi-level tube. A modification of Jacobs and Davies&#x27; 1913 plan, the Goethals proposal specified that each level would carry three lanes of traffic, and that traffic on each level would run in a different direction. Goethals stated that his plan would cost $12 million and could be completed in three years. Subsequently, John F. O&#x27;Rourke offered to build the tunnel for $11.5 million. Goethals cited the area&#x27;s freight traffic as one of the reasons for constructing the tube. His proposal would use a diameter shield to dig the tunnel. This large tunnel size was seen as a potential problem, since there were differences in the air pressure at the top and the bottom of each tunnel, and that air pressure difference increased with a larger tunnel diameter. Five engineers were assigned to examine the feasibility of Goethals&#x27;s design. In July 1919, President Woodrow Wilson ratified a Congressional joint resolution for a trans-Hudson tunnel, and Clifford Milburn Holland was named the project&#x27;s chief engineer. Holland stated that, based on the construction methods used for both pair of tubes, including the downtown pair, it should be relatively easy to dig through the mud on the bottom of the Hudson River, and that construction should be completed within two years.

The federal government refused to finance the project, even in part, and so it fell to the states to raise the funds. In June 1919, U.S. Senator and former New Jersey governor Edge presented another iteration of the Hudson River Tunnel bill to the U.S. Senate, where it was approved. The New York and New Jersey governments signed a contract in September 1919, in which the states agreed to build, operate, and maintain the tunnel in partnership. The contract was signed by the states&#x27; respective tunnel commissions in January 1920.

Under Holland&#x27;s plan, each of the two tubes would have an outside diameter of including exterior linings, and the tubes would contain two-lane roadways with a total width of . One lane would be for slower traffic, and the other would be for faster traffic. This contrasted with Goethals&#x27;s plan, wherein the three roadways would have had a total width of , only a few feet wider than Holland&#x27;s two-lane roadways. Additionally, according to Holland, the 42-foot-wide tube would require the excavation of more dirt than both 29-foot tubes combined: two circles with 29-foot diameters would have a combined area of , while a circle with a 42-foot diameter would have an area of . The more northerly westbound tube would begin at Broome and Varick Streets on the Manhattan side and end at the now-demolished intersection of 14th and Provost Streets on the New Jersey side. The more southerly eastbound tube would begin at the still-intact intersection of 12th and Provost Streets in Jersey City, and end at the south side of Canal Street near Varick Street. By way of comparison, Goethals&#x27;s plan would have combined the entrance and exit plazas on each side. The Motor Truck Association of America unsuccessfully advocated for three lanes in each tube.

Even though Goethals&#x27;s method of digging had not been tested, he refused to concede to Holland&#x27;s proposal, and demanded to see evidence that Holland&#x27;s proposal would work. The New York and New Jersey Tunnel Commission subsequently rejected Goethals&#x27;s plan in favor of a twin-tube proposal that Holland had devised, which was valued at around $28.7 million. When Goethals asked why, the commission responded that Goethals&#x27;s proposal had never been tested; that it was too expensive; and that the tunnel plans had many engineering weaknesses that could cause the tube to flood. Additionally, while a tube with three lanes in each direction would be able to handle more traffic than a tube with two lanes, projections showed that traffic on the tunnel&#x27;s approach roads could barely handle the amount of traffic going to and from the two-lane tubes, and that widening the approach roads on each side would cost millions of dollars more. The commission then voted to forbid any further consideration of Goethals&#x27;s plan. Holland defended his own plan by pointing out that the roadways in Goethals&#x27;s plan would not only feature narrower road lanes, but also would have ventilation ducts that were too small to ventilate the tube efficiently.

In May 1920, the New Jersey Legislature voted to approve the start of construction, overriding a veto from the New Jersey governor. The same month, the New York governor signed a similar bill that had been passed in the New York legislature. The legislature of New Jersey approved a $5 million bond issue for the tunnel in December 1920.

=== Construction ===
The first bid for constructing the Hudson River Tunnel, a contract for digging two of the tunnel&#x27;s eight planned shafts, was advertised in September 1920. A groundbreaking for the Hudson River Tunnel&#x27;s ventilation shaft, which marked the official start of construction on the tunnel, occurred on October 12, 1920, at Canal and Washington Streets on the Manhattan side. However, further construction of the Hudson River Tunnel was soon held up due to concerns over its ventilation system. There was also a dispute over whether the New York City government should pay for street-widening projects on the New Jersey side. Further delays arose when the New York and New Jersey tunnel commissions could not agree over which agency would award the contract to build the construction and ventilation shafts.

====Ventilation system====
The most significant design aspect of the Holland Tunnel is its ventilation system; it is served by four ventilation towers designed by Norwegian architect Erling Owre. At the time of its construction, underwater tunnels were a well-established part of civil engineering, but no long vehicular tunnels had been built, as all of the existing tunnels under New York City waterways carried only railroads and subways. These tubes did not have as much of a need for ventilation, since the trains that used the tubes were required to be electrically powered, and thus emitted very little pollution. On the other hand, the traffic in the Holland Tunnel consisted mostly of gasoline-driven vehicles, and ventilation was required to evacuate the carbon monoxide emissions, which would otherwise asphyxiate the drivers. There were very few tunnels at that time that were not used by rail traffic; the most notable of these non-rail tunnels, the Blackwall Tunnel and Rotherhithe Tunnel in London, did not need mechanical ventilation. However, a tunnel of the Hudson River Tunnel&#x27;s length required an efficient method of ventilation, so Chief Engineer Singstad pioneered a system of ventilating the tunnel transversely (perpendicular to the tubes).

In October 1920, General George R. Dyer, the chairman of the New York Tunnel Commission, published a report in which he wrote that Singstad had devised a feasible ventilation system for the Hudson River Tunnel. Working with Yale University, the University of Illinois, and the United States Bureau of Mines, Singstad built a test tunnel in the bureau&#x27;s experimental mine at Bruceton, Pennsylvania, measuring over long, where cars were lined up with engines running. Volunteer students were supervised as they breathed the exhaust in order to confirm air flows and tolerable carbon monoxide levels by simulating different traffic conditions, including backups. The University of Illinois, which had hired the only professors of ventilation in the United States, built an experimental ventilation duct at its Urbana campus to test air flows. In October 1921, Singstad concluded that a conventional, longitudinal ventilation system would have to be pressurized to an air flow rate of along the tunnel. On the other hand, the tunnel could be adequately ventilated transversely if the compartment carrying the tube&#x27;s roadway was placed in between two plenums. A lower plenum below the roadway floor could supply fresh air, and an upper plenum above the ceiling could exhaust fumes at regular intervals.

Two thousand tests were performed with the ventilation system prototype. The system was determined to be of sufficiently low cost, relative to the safety benefits, that it was ultimately integrated into the tunnel&#x27;s design. By the time the tunnel was in service, the average carbon monoxide content in both tunnels was 0.69 parts per 10,000 parts of air. The highest recorded carbon monoxide level in the Holland Tunnel was 1.60 parts per 10,000, well below the permissible maximum of 4 parts per 10,000. The public and the press proclaimed air conditions were better in the tubes than in some streets of New York City; after the tunnel opened, Singstad stated that the carbon monoxide content in the tubes were half of those recorded on the streets.

==== Tunnel boring ====
The ventilation system and other potential issues had been resolved by December 1921, and officials announced that the tunnel would break ground the following spring. Builders initially considered building a trench at the bottom of the Hudson River and then covering it up, but this was deemed infeasible because of the soft soil that comprised the riverbed, as well as the heavy maritime traffic that used the river. Officials started purchasing the properties in the path of the tunnel&#x27;s approaches, evicting and compensating the tenants &quot;without delay&quot; so that construction could commence promptly. A bid to construct the tubes was advertised, and three firms responded. On March 29, 1922, the contract to dig the tubes was awarded to the lowest bidder, Booth &amp; Flinn Ltd., for $19.3 million. The materials that were necessary to furnish the Hudson River Tunnel had already been purchased, so it was decided to start work immediately. Construction on the bores began two days later as workers broke ground for an air compressor to drive the tubes. The ceremony for the air compressor was held at the corner of Canal Street and West Side Highway on the Manhattan side. The workers who were performing the excavations, who were referred to as &quot;sandhogs&quot;, were to dig each pair of tubes from either bank of the Hudson River, so that the two sides would eventually connect somewhere underneath the riverbed. The tunnel was to be long between portals, and the roadway was to descend to a maximum depth of below mean high water level.

The start of construction for the tubes from the New Jersey side was delayed because the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel Commission had not yet acquired some of the land for the project. Although Jersey City officials had insisted that the Tunnel Commission widen 12th and 14th Streets in Jersey City, these officials were involved in a disagreement over sale prices with the Erie Railroad, which owned some of the land that was to be acquired for the street widening. As a result, work on the Hudson River Tunnel was delayed by one year and could not be completed before 1926 at the earliest. Work on the New Jersey side finally started on May 30, 1922, after Jersey City officials continued to refuse to cede public land for the construction of the tunnel&#x27;s plazas. The Jersey City Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter that denounced this action, since the New Jersey Tunnel Commission&#x27;s members on the Hudson River Tunnel Commission had not been notified of the groundbreaking until they read about it in the following day&#x27;s newspapers. In mid-June, a state chancellor made permanent an injunction that banned Jersey City officials from trying to preclude construction on the Hudson River Tunnel. The Hudson River Tunnel Commission ultimately decided that Jersey City would not have its own groundbreaking celebration due to the city&#x27;s various efforts at blocking the tunnel&#x27;s construction. However, although Jersey City officials had been primarily accused of delaying construction, officials from both states had wanted the Tunnel Commission to widen the approach streets to the Hudson River Tunnel as part of the construction process.

For the project, six tunnel digging shields were to be delivered. These shields comprised cylinders whose diameters were wider than the tunnel bores, and these cylinders contained steel plates of various thicknesses on the face that was to be driven under the riverbed. Four of the shields would dig the Hudson River Tunnel under the river, while the remaining two shields would dig from the Hudson River west bank to the Jersey City portals. They could dig through rock at a rate of per day, or through mud at a daily rate of . The air compressors would provide an air pressure of . The shovels used to dig the tunnel were provided by the Marion Power Shovel Company, while the six digging shields were built by the Merchants Shipbuilding Corporation. The air compressor was completed in September 1922, and the first shield was fitted into place in the Manhattan side&#x27;s construction shaft. By this point, the shafts on the New Jersey side were being excavated, and two watertight caissons were being constructed.

The shield started boring in late October of that year after the steel plates that were necessary for the shield&#x27;s operation had been delivered. The first permanent steel-rings lining the tubes were laid a short time afterward. The caissons were completed and launched into the river in December, and after the caissons were outfitted with the requisite equipment such as airlocks, tugboats dropped the caissons into place in January 1923. Officials projected that at this rate of progress, the tunnel would be finished within 36 months, by late 1926 or early 1927.

Tunnel construction required the sandhogs to spend large amounts of time in the caisson under high pressure of up to , which was thought to be necessary to prevent river water from entering prior to completion of the tubes. The caissons were massive metal boxes with varying dimensions, but each contained walls. Sandhogs entered the tunnel through a series of airlocks, and could only remain inside of the tunnel for a designated time period. On exiting the tunnel, sandhogs had to undergo controlled decompression to avoid decompression sickness or &quot;the bends&quot;, a condition in which nitrogen bubbles form in the blood from rapid decompression. The rate of decompression for sandhogs working on the Hudson River Tunnel was described as being &quot;so small as to be negligible&quot;. Sandhogs underwent such decompressions 756,000 times throughout the course of construction, which resulted in 528 cases of the bends, though none were fatal. The tunnel&#x27;s pressurization caused other problems, including a pressure blowout in April 1924 that flooded the tube.

Due to the geology of the Hudson River, the shields digging from the New Jersey side were mostly being driven through mud, and so could be driven at a faster rate than the shields from the New York side, which were being dug through large rock formations. When workers tried to dig through the Manhattan shoreline, they had encountered several weeks of delay due to the existence of an as-yet-unrecorded granite bulkhead on the shoreline. In September 1923, after having proceeded about from the Manhattan shoreline, workers encountered a sheet of Manhattan schist under the riverbed, forcing them to slow shield digging operations from to less than . This outcropping was fed from a stream in Manhattan that emptied into the Hudson River. The sandhogs planned to use small explosive charges to dig through the rock shelf without damaging the shield. By December 1923, about of each tube&#x27;s total length had been excavated, and the first of the shields had passed through the underwater shafts that had been sunk during construction. Due to these unexpected issues, the cost estimate for the tunnel was increased from $28 million to $42 million in January 1924. By March 1924, all seven of the ventilation shafts had been dug, and three of the four shields that were digging underwater had passed through their respective underwater construction shafts, with the fourth shield nearing its respective shaft.

Workers also performed tests to determine whether they could receive radio transmissions while inside the tunnel. They found that they were able to receive transmissions within much of the Hudson River Tunnel. However, a New Jersey radio station later found that there was a spot in the middle of the tunnel that had no reception.

The cost of the project increased as work progressed. In July 1923, the New York and New Jersey Vehicular Tunnel Commission had revised plans for the entrance and exit plazas on each side to accommodate an increase in traffic along Canal Street on the Manhattan side. The commission had spent $2.1 million to acquire land. Further redesigns were made in January 1924 due to a change of major components in the tunnel plan, including tunnel diameters and ventilation systems, which had increased the cost by another $14 million.

==== Nearing completion ====
The two ends of both tubes were scheduled to be connected to each other at a ceremony on October 29, 1924, in which President Calvin Coolidge would have remotely set off an explosion to connect the tunnel&#x27;s two sides. However, two days before the ceremony, Holland died of a heart attack at the sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan, aged 41. Individuals cited in &quot;The New York Times&quot; attributed his death to the stress associated with overseeing the tunnel&#x27;s construction. The ceremony was postponed out of respect for Holland&#x27;s death.

The tunnel was ultimately holed through on October 29, but it was a nondescript event without any ceremony. On November 12, 1924, the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel was renamed the Holland Tunnel by the two states&#x27; respective tunnel commissions. Holland was succeeded by Milton Harvey Freeman, who died of pneumonia in March 1925, after several months of overseeing the project. After Freeman&#x27;s death, the position was occupied by Ole Singstad, who oversaw the tunnel&#x27;s completion.

As part of the tunnel project, one block of Watts Street in Manhattan was widened to accommodate traffic heading toward the westbound tube. Sixth Avenue was also widened and extended between Greenwich Village and Church Street. Ten thousand people were evicted to make way for the Sixth Avenue extension. The north-south Church Street was widened and extended southward to Church Street and Trinity Place; West Side Highway was expanded and supplemented with an elevated highway; and the west-east Vestry and Laight Streets were also widened. On the New Jersey side, the Holland Tunnel was to connect a new highway (formerly the Route 1 Extension; now New Jersey Route 139), which extended westward to Newark. This included a viaduct, rising from 12th and 14th Streets, at the bottom of the Palisades, to the new highway, at the top of the Palisades. The New Jersey highway approach was opened in stages beginning in 1927, and most of that highway was finished in 1930.

The construction of the tunnel approach roads on the New Jersey side was delayed for months by Erie Railroad, whose Bergen Arches right-of-way ran parallel to and directly south of Route 139, in the right of way of the proposed approach roads. Although the Erie had promised to find another site for its railroad yards, it had refused to respond to the plans that the New Jersey State Highway Commission had sent them. In March 1925, the Highway Commission decided that construction on the approach roads would begin regardless of Erie&#x27;s response, and so the land would be taken using eminent domain. This led to a legal disagreement between the Erie and the Highway Commission. The Erie maintained that it absolutely needed 30 feet of land along 12th Street, while the Highway Commission stated that the most direct approach to the eastbound Holland Tunnel&#x27;s 12th Street portal should be made using 12th Street. The commission rejected a suggestion that it should use 13th Street, one block north, because it would cost $500,000 more and involve two perpendicular turns. In October 1926, one million dollars was allocated to the completion of the Route 139 approach.

The contracts for constructing the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s ventilation systems were awarded in December 1925. Two months later, the New York-New Jersey Vehicular Tunnel Commission asked for $3.2 million more in funding. The tunnel was now expected to cost $46 million, an increase of $17 million over what was originally budgeted. The Holland Tunnel was nearly complete: in March 1926, Singstad stated that the tunnel was expected to be opened by the following February. By May 1926, the tubes had been almost completely furnished: the polished-white tile walls were in place, as were the bright lighting systems and the Belgian-block-and-concrete road surfaces. The north tube&#x27;s tiles were sourced locally by the Sonzogni Brothers of Union City, New Jersey, while the south tube&#x27;s tiles were sourced in equal amounts from Czechoslovakia and Germany. The tiles&#x27; surfaces were specially engineered so that they could maintain their coloring even after years of use. The lighting systems used in the Holland Tunnel were designed to allow motorists to adjust to a gradual change in lighting levels just before leaving the tubes.

The ventilation towers were the only major component of the Holland Tunnel that was not completed, but major progress had been made by the end of 1926. Ole Singstad and the two states&#x27; tunnel commissions tested the tunnel&#x27;s ventilation system by releasing gas clouds in one of the tubes in February 1927. Singstad subsequently declared that the ventilation system was well equipped to ventilate the tunnel air. However, the New York Board of Trade and Transportation disagreed, stating that the system would be inadequate if there was a genuine incident within the tunnel. In April 1927, the board had conducted their own tests with two lighted candles, and a cloud of smoke had filled the entire tube before the ventilation system was able to perform a full exhaust. The Chief Surgeon of the U.S. Board of Mines supported Singstad&#x27;s position that the ventilation system could sufficiently filter the tubes&#x27; air. To affirm the ventilation system&#x27;s efficacy, in November 1927, the New York and New Jersey tunnel commissions burned a car within the tunnel; the ventilation system dissipated the fire within three and a half minutes.

The governors of New York and New Jersey took ceremonial rides through the tunnel in August 1926, meeting at the tunnel&#x27;s midpoint. The first unofficial drive through the entirety of the Holland Tunnel was undertaken by a group of British businessmen a year later, in August 1927. The next month, a group from the Buffalo and Niagara Frontier Port Authority Survey Commission also visited the tunnel. In October, a delegation of representatives from Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, toured the nearly complete Holland Tunnel to get ideas for the then-proposed Detroit–Windsor Tunnel. A reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; was able to make a test drive through the tunnel, noting that &quot;there is no sudden pressure of wind upon the ear-drums&quot; and that it would reduce the duration of crossing the Hudson River by between 15 and 22 minutes. Three hundred police officers were trained in advance of the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s opening, and bus companies started receiving franchises to operate buses through the tunnel.

===Opening===

The Holland Tunnel was officially opened at 4:55 p.m. EST on November 12, 1927. President Coolidge ceremonially opened the tunnel from his yacht by turning the same key that had opened the Panama Canal in 1915. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Coolidge had used &quot;the golden lever of the Presidential telegraphic instrument.&quot; It rang a giant brass bell at the tunnel&#x27;s entrances that triggered American flags on both sides of the tunnel to separate. The tunnel&#x27;s opening ceremony was broadcast on local radio stations. Approximately 20,000 people walked the entire length of the Holland Tunnel before it was closed to pedestrians at 7 p.m. The Holland Tunnel officially opened to vehicular traffic at 12:01 a.m. on November 13, the next day; over a thousand vehicles had gathered on the New Jersey side, ready to pay a toll. The first car to pay a toll was driven by the daughter of the chairman of New Jersey&#x27;s Bridge and Tunnel Commission. The widows of chief engineers Holland and Freeman rode in the second vehicle that paid a toll. At the time, the Holland Tunnel was the world&#x27;s longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel, as well as the world&#x27;s first tunnel designed specifically for vehicular traffic.

Each passenger car paid a 50-cent toll (worth about $ in ). Tolls for other vehicular classes ranged from 25 cents for a motorcycle to two dollars for large trucks. Commuter bus routes, which paid a 50-cent-per-vehicle toll, began operating through the tunnel in December 1927. Truckers subsequently objected that these rates were too high, as the Holland Tunnel truck tolls were double the tolls that were charged on the trans-Hudson ferries; by contrast, the tunnel&#x27;s passenger vehicle, motorcycle, and bus tolls were on par with those charged by the ferries. The toll revenues would be used to pay off the tunnel&#x27;s cost (which was estimated at $48 million in 1927 dollars, $ in dollars). Within ten years of opening, it was expected that all construction costs would be paid off. Horsedrawn vehicles were banned from the tunnel from the start, since it was believed that horses&#x27; slow speeds would cause traffic congestion in the tubes. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic was also banned. A few months before the tunnel&#x27;s opening, there were suggestions that pedestrians would be allowed to cross the tunnel if they paid a toll described as &quot;not encouraging,&quot; but the idea was never seriously considered.

The Holland Tunnel was expected to relieve congestion on the vehicular ferries across the Hudson River, since the capacity of the tunnel was similar to that of the vehicular ferries. Upon opening, it had been estimated that up to 15 million vehicles per year could use the tunnel in both directions, equating to a maximum daily capacity of 46,000 vehicles or an hourly capacity of 3,800 vehicles. Singstad stated that increasing freight traffic across the river would result in a corresponding increase in truck traffic, which would then cause the tunnel to reach its maximum traffic capacity shortly after its opening.

The Holland Tunnel was immediately popular. On November 13, a Sunday, 52,285 vehicles passed through the tunnel on its first day of operation, more than its projected maximum capacity. The lines to enter the tunnel stretched for miles on either end, although many of these vehicles were passenger cars who were making a round trip to tour the tunnel. On November 14, the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s first weekday of operation, the tunnel carried 17,726 cars. Traffic counts in the Holland Tunnel remained relatively steady until the following weekend, when over 40,000 vehicles went through the tunnel. The first holiday rush period for the Holland Tunnel occurred two weeks after the tunnel&#x27;s opening, when around 30,000 motorists used the tunnel over the Thanksgiving holiday; there were no major traffic disruptions. A half-million vehicles had passed through the Holland Tunnel within three weeks, and a million had used the tubes by New Year&#x27;s Day. Within the tunnel&#x27;s first year, 8.5 million vehicles had used it, and the toll revenue had grossed $4.7 million in profit; it was estimated that at this rate, the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s construction costs might be paid off sooner than expected.

Trans-Hudson ferries reported that their traffic counts had been halved in the two weeks since the tunnel opened, and at least one ferry route reduced service within one month of the opening. Another ferry cut its toll rates to half those of the Holland Tunnel in an effort to recover business. The Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (later PATH), which operated rapid transit services across the Hudson River through its Uptown and Downtown Hudson Tubes, also saw a decline in ridership after the Holland Tunnel opened. Even after the start of the Great Depression in 1929, when most transit in New York City saw declines, the Holland Tunnel saw an increase in traffic, as did ferry lines.

===Early years===
In 1930, there was a disagreement between the Hudson River Tunnel Commission and the Port of New York Authority over who would construct the Lincoln Tunnel. The tunnel was to be located further north along the Hudson River, connecting nearby Weehawken to Manhattan. The two agencies merged that April, and the expanded Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took over operations of the Holland Tunnel, a role that it maintains to this day. Real property title was not passed however. A second vehicular link between New Jersey and Manhattan, the George Washington Bridge, opened in October 1931. The Lincoln Tunnel, the third and final vehicular connection between New Jersey and Manhattan, first opened in December 1937. Within the first 25 years of the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s opening, it had carried 330 million vehicles in total, but a significant portion of Holland Tunnel traffic was diverted to the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge after the opening of the latter two crossings.

In 1945, the Port Authority approved the extension of a tunnel approach on the New Jersey side. A new viaduct for westbound traffic would connect the intersection of 14th Street and Jersey Avenue, outside the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s exit portal, to Hoboken Avenue and NJ Route 139, on top of The Palisades. This would supplement an existing bidirectional viaduct, which connected Hoboken Avenue with 12th Street and currently only carries eastbound traffic. The 14th Street viaduct was first opened for vehicular use in January 1951, although the road was not complete; it was officially completed that February. The 12th and 14th Street viaducts were later also connected to the New Jersey Turnpike Extension. The first part of the extension, Newark Bay Bridge, opened between Bayonne and Newark Liberty International Airport in April 1956; the connection between Bayonne and the 12th/14th Street viaducts was completed that September, providing direct highway connection between the Holland Tunnel and Newark Airport. The NJ Turnpike Extension, as well as the Holland Tunnel and the 12th/14th Street approaches, was designated as part of I-78 in 1958.

Starting in the 1940s, New York City officials developed plans to connect the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s Manhattan end to the Lower Manhattan Expressway, a proposed elevated highway connecting to both the Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn. This connection would be part of I-78. In 1956, Robert Moses suggested adding a third tube to the Holland Tunnel, similar to the Lincoln Tunnel&#x27;s third tube, so there would be sufficient capacity for the proposed expressway traffic. The route of the Lower Manhattan Expressway was approved in 1960, but quickly became controversial due to the large number of tenants who would have to be relocated. The Lower Manhattan Expressway project was ultimately canceled in March 1971.

The Port Authority voted in 1953 to replace the original tollbooths on the New Jersey side, which did not contain canopies, with an updated plaza that contained a canopy. The next year, the Port Authority also voted to refurbish the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s administration building on the New Jersey side, as well as construct a new service building. The development of a one-man miniature electric car for tunnel police, to be installed on the tubes&#x27; catwalks, was announced in August 1954. The Port Authority tested the &quot;catwalk car&quot; along a stretch of the Holland Tunnel. After the car had passed its test, policemen could patrol the full length of the tubes using the catwalk car instead of having to walk the tubes&#x27; entire length. By use of a swivel seat the policemen could drive the car in either direction.

===Late 20th century===
In 1970, the Port Authority stopped collecting tolls for New Jersey-bound drivers through the Holland Tunnel, who used the westbound tube, while doubling tolls to $1 for New York City-bound drivers, who used the eastbound tube. This was done in an effort to speed up traffic, and it was the first toll increase in the tunnel&#x27;s history. Although westbound drivers initially saved time by not paying tolls, the removal of westbound tolls ultimately had an adverse effect on traffic in the Holland Tunnel. In 1986, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, between the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island, stopped collecting tolls for Brooklyn-bound drivers (who were generally headed eastbound) and doubled its tolls for Staten Island-bound drivers (who were generally headed westbound). This had the effect of increasing congestion along the New Jersey-bound tube of the Holland Tunnel, which drivers could use for free. Drivers would go through New Jersey and use the Bayonne Bridge, paying a lower toll to enter Staten Island. The amount of westbound traffic in the Holland Tunnel increased compared to eastbound traffic: by 1998, there were 50,110 daily westbound trips and 46,688 daily eastbound trips through the tunnel. Simultaneously, there was a decrease in westbound trips on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge compared to eastbound trips on the bridge. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge toll pattern also caused traffic gridlock around the Holland Tunnel, and Canal Street saw the most severe congestion because it served as the main entrance to the tunnel. Fatal accidents involving pedestrians in Lower Manhattan also increased greatly as a result. Rush-hour congestion within the Holland Tunnel has persisted for more than thirty years due to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s one-way westbound toll.

A renovation of the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s tiled ceilings, which were deteriorating due to water damage, started in 1983. The ceilings were replaced at a total cost of $78 million, and the south tube&#x27;s ceiling was renovated first. Since the Holland Tunnel had to remain open during the renovation, 4,000 modular concrete ceiling panels were made offsite, and narrow lift trucks parked in one of the tube&#x27;s two lanes installed the panels while traffic continued to move through the tube&#x27;s other lane. The panels were each designed to the specifications of a certain section of tube, such that none of the ceiling panels were identical; the Port Authority stated that the ceiling-replacement project was the first one of its kind in the world. In 1988, after the ceiling renovations had been completed, work started on replacing the 8-lane tollbooth, which consisted of six lanes built in the 1950s and two additional lanes built in the 1980s. The new $54 million tollbooth contained 9 lanes and a central control center.

The Holland Tunnel was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 27, 1993, becoming part of the National Register of Historic Places. With this designation, it became the 92nd National Historic Landmark in New York City and the sixth such landmark nationally that was a tunnel. According to M. Ann Belkov, the National Park Service superintendent for Ellis Island, the tunnel had been granted landmark status because it had been the first &quot;mechanically ventilated underwater vehicular tunnel&quot; in the world.

===21st century===
Between 2003 and 2006, the fire protection system in both tunnels was modernized. Fire extinguishers were placed in alcoves along the tunnel walls. Although the water supply was turned off, it remained in place during the renovation.

The Holland Tunnel was closed on October 29, 2012, as Hurricane Sandy approached. The tunnel, like many other New York City tunnels, was flooded by the high storm surge. It remained closed for several days, opening for buses only on November 2 and to all traffic on November 7. In February 2018, the PANYNJ approved a $364 million project to repair flood damage from the hurricane. The agency closed the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s eastbound tube during late nights, except on Saturday nights, beginning in April 2020. Though the work was initially supposed to be completed in early 2022, the work was delayed by nearly a year. The PANYNJ then announced that the westbound tube would be closed during late nights, except on Saturdays, between February 2023 and late 2025.

===Accidents and terrorism===
The first fatal vehicular crash in the Holland Tunnel happened in March 1932, four and a half years after it opened. One person died and two others were injured.

The 1949 Holland Tunnel fire, which started aboard a chemical truck, caused severe damage to the south tube of the tunnel. The fire resulted in 69 injuries and nearly $600,000 worth of damage to the structure. In addition, two first responders, a FDNY battalion chief and a Port Authority patrolman, died as a result of injuries sustained in fighting the fire.

Due to its status as one of the few connections between Manhattan and New Jersey, the Holland Tunnel is considered to be one of the most high-risk terrorist target sites in the United States. Other such sites in New Jersey include the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken, New Jersey, the PATH station at Exchange Place in Jersey City, and the Port of Newark in Elizabeth.

In 1995, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and nine other men were convicted of a bombing plot in which a radical Islamic group plotted to blow up five or six sites in New York City, including the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge.

In 2006, a plot to detonate explosives in a Hudson River tunnel was uncovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was originally reported that the Holland Tunnel was the target, but in a later update of the source, the plot was clarified to be aimed at the PATH&#x27;s tubes instead of the Holland Tunnel.

====September 11 attacks====

Following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the Holland Tunnel remained closed to all but emergency traffic for over a month, due to its proximity to the World Trade Center site. When the tunnel reopened on October 15, 2001, strict new regulations were enacted, and single-occupancy vehicles and trucks were banned from entering the tunnel. In March 2002, before all of the post-9/11 restrictions were lifted, a warehouse fire near the eastbound tube&#x27;s New Jersey portal caused the tunnel to be closed entirely for five days; the fire continued for over a week. That April, all trucks were banned from the westbound tube, and trucks with more than three axles were also banned from the eastbound tube. Single-occupant vehicles were prohibited in the tunnel on weekday mornings between 6:00 am and 10:00 am until November 17, 2003, when the restrictions were lifted.

==Tolls==

, the tolls-by-mail rate going from New Jersey to New York City is $18.31 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York City to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York–issued E-ZPass users are charged $14.06 for cars and $13.06 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $16.06 for cars and $15.06 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the tolls-by-mail rate.

Tolls were formerly collected at a tollbooth on the New Jersey side. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York City to New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to south- or eastbound-only at that time. E-ZPass was first made available at the Holland Tunnel in October 1997.

In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was temporarily placed in effect for all Port Authority crossings, including the Holland Tunnel. Open road tolling began on December 23, 2020. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the tunnel. Instead, there will be cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries at the New Jersey side going to New York City. A vehicle without E-ZPass will have a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll will be mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors will detect their transponders wirelessly. The carpool discount plan was eliminated because the discount required a manual count of passengers.

===Historical toll rates===
===Congestion toll===

Congestion pricing in New York City was implemented in January 2025; drivers who enter Manhattan via the tunnel pay a second toll. The congestion charges are collected via E-ZPass and tolls-by-mail. The charges vary based on time of day and vehicle class, but the congestion toll is charged once per day. Drivers who use the Holland Tunnel to enter the congestion zone will receive a credit toward the congestion charge during the day, and they would pay a discounted toll at night.

<text>Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. For large numbers of local optima, SA can find the global optimum. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound. 

The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.
Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually only achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, this is sufficient for many practical problems.

The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several mathematical constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.

Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.

This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.

The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for probability density functions, or by using a stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953.

==Overview==
The state &quot;s&quot; of some physical systems, and the function &quot;E&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) to be minimized, is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state. The goal is to bring the system, from an arbitrary &quot;initial state&quot;, to a state with the minimum possible energy.

===The basic iteration===
At each step, the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state &quot;s*&quot; of the current state &quot;s&quot;, and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state &quot;s*&quot; or staying in state &quot;s&quot;. These probabilities ultimately lead the system to move to states of lower energy. Typically this step is repeated until the system reaches a state that is good enough for the application, or until a given computation budget has been exhausted.

===The neighbors of a state===
Optimization of a solution involves evaluating the neighbors of a state of the problem, which are new states produced through conservatively altering a given state. For example, in the traveling salesman problem each state is typically defined as a permutation of the cities to be visited, and the neighbors of any state are the set of permutations produced by swapping any two of these cities. The well-defined way in which the states are altered to produce neighboring states is called a &quot;move&quot;, and different moves give different sets of neighboring states. These moves usually result in minimal alterations of the last state, in an attempt to progressively improve the solution through iteratively improving its parts (such as the city connections in the traveling salesman problem). It is even better to reverse the order of an interval of cities. This is a smaller move since swapping two cities can be achieved by twice reversing an interval. 

Simple heuristics like hill climbing, which move by finding better neighbor after better neighbor and stop when they have reached a solution which has no neighbors that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead to any of the existing better solutions their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum that could be different. Metaheuristics use the neighbors of a solution as a way to explore the solution space, and although they prefer better neighbors, they also accept worse neighbors in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.

===Acceptance probabilities===
The probability of making the transition from the current state formula_1 to a candidate new state formula_2 is specified by an &quot;acceptance probability function&quot; formula_3, that depends on the energies formula_4 and formula_5 of the two states, and on a global time-varying parameter formula_6 called the &quot;temperature&quot;. States with a smaller energy are better than those with a greater energy. The probability function formula_7 must be positive even when formula_8 is greater than formula_9. This feature prevents the method from becoming stuck at a local minimum that is worse than the global one.

When formula_6 tends to zero, the probability formula_3 must tend to zero if formula_12 and to a positive value otherwise. For sufficiently small values of formula_6, the system will then increasingly favor moves that go &quot;downhill&quot; (i.e., to lower energy values), and avoid those that go &quot;uphill.&quot; With formula_14 the procedure reduces to the greedy algorithm, which makes only the downhill transitions.

In the original description of simulated annealing, the probability formula_3 was equal to 1 when formula_16—i.e., the procedure always moved downhill when it found a way to do so, irrespective of the temperature. Many descriptions and implementations of simulated annealing still take this condition as part of the method&#x27;s definition. However, this condition is not essential for the method to work.

The formula_7 function is usually chosen so that the probability of accepting a move decreases when the difference
formula_18 increases—that is, small uphill moves are more likely than large ones. However, this requirement is not strictly necessary, provided that the above requirements are met.

Given these properties, the temperature formula_6 plays a crucial role in controlling the evolution of the state formula_1 of the system with regard to its sensitivity to the variations of system energies. To be precise, for a large formula_6, the evolution of formula_1 is sensitive to coarser energy variations, while it is sensitive to finer energy variations when formula_6 is small.

===The annealing schedule===

The name and inspiration of the algorithm demand an interesting feature related to the temperature variation to be embedded in the operational characteristics of the algorithm. This necessitates a gradual reduction of the temperature as the simulation proceeds. The algorithm starts initially with formula_6 set to a high value (or infinity), and then it is decreased at each step following some &quot;annealing schedule&quot;—which may be specified by the user but must end with formula_14 towards the end of the allotted time budget. In this way, the system is expected to wander initially towards a broad region of the search space containing good solutions, ignoring small features of the energy function; then drift towards low-energy regions that become narrower and narrower, and finally move downhill according to the steepest descent heuristic.

For any given finite problem, the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm terminates with a global optimal solution approaches 1 as the annealing schedule is extended. This theoretical result, however, is not particularly helpful, since the time required to ensure a significant probability of success will usually exceed the time required for a complete search of the solution space.

==Pseudocode==
The following pseudocode presents the simulated annealing heuristic as described above. It starts from a state and continues until a maximum of steps have been taken. In the process, the call should generate a randomly chosen neighbour of a given state ; the call should pick and return a value in the range , uniformly at random. The annealing schedule is defined by the call , which should yield the temperature to use, given the fraction of the time budget that has been expended so far.

* For through (exclusive):
** Pick a random neighbour, 
** If :
* Output: the final state 

==Selecting the parameters==
In order to apply the simulated annealing method to a specific problem, one must specify the following parameters: the state space, the energy (goal) function , the candidate generator procedure , the acceptance probability function , and the annealing schedule AND initial temperature . These choices can have a significant impact on the method&#x27;s effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are no choices of these parameters that will be good for all problems, and there is no general way to find the best choices for a given problem. The following sections give some general guidelines.

===Sufficiently near neighbour===
Simulated annealing may be modeled as a random walk on a search graph, whose vertices are all possible states, and whose edges are the candidate moves. An essential requirement for the function is that it must provide a sufficiently short path on this graph from the initial state to any state which may be the global optimum the diameter of the search graph must be small. In the traveling salesman example above, for instance, the search space for n = 20 cities has n! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 (2.4 quintillion) states; yet the number of neighbors of each vertex is formula_26 edges (coming from n choose 20), and the diameter of the graph is formula_27.

===Transition probabilities===
To investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem, it can be useful to consider the &quot;transition probabilities&quot; that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm. For each edge formula_28 of the search graph, the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state formula_29 when its current state is formula_1. This probability depends on the current temperature as specified by , on the order in which the candidate moves are generated by the function, and on the acceptance probability function . (Note that the transition probability is not simply formula_31, because the candidates are tested serially.)

===Acceptance probabilities===
The specification of , , and is partially redundant. In practice, it&#x27;s common to use the same acceptance function for many problems and adjust the other two functions according to the specific problem.

In the formulation of the method by Kirkpatrick et al., the acceptance probability function formula_31 was defined as 1 if formula_33, and formula_34 otherwise. This formula was superficially justified by analogy with the transitions of a physical system; it corresponds to the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, in the case where T=1 and the proposal distribution of Metropolis–Hastings is symmetric. However, this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function, which is analogous to the proposal distribution in Metropolis–Hastings, is not symmetric, or not probabilistic at all. As a result, the transition probabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm do not correspond to the transitions of the analogous physical system, and the long-term distribution of states at a constant temperature formula_6 need not bear any resemblance to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution over states of that physical system, at any temperature. Nevertheless, most descriptions of simulated annealing assume the original acceptance function, which is probably hard-coded in many implementations of SA.

In 1990, Moscato and Fontanari, and independently Dueck and Scheuer, proposed that a deterministic update (i.e. one that is not based on the probabilistic acceptance rule) could speed-up the optimization process without impacting on the final quality. Moscato and Fontanari conclude from observing the analogous of the &quot;specific heat&quot; curve of the &quot;threshold updating&quot; annealing originating from their study that &quot;the stochasticity of the Metropolis updating in the simulated annealing algorithm does not play a major role in the search of near-optimal minima&quot;. Instead, they proposed that &quot;the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing.&quot; The method subsequently popularized under the denomination of &quot;threshold accepting&quot; due to Dueck and Scheuer&#x27;s denomination. In 2001, Franz, Hoffmann and Salamon showed that the deterministic update strategy is indeed the optimal one within the large class of algorithms that simulate a random walk on the cost/energy landscape.

===Efficient candidate generation===
When choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm, the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state. Therefore, as a general rule, one should skew the generator towards candidate moves where the energy of the destination state formula_29 is likely to be similar to that of the current state. This heuristic (which is the main principle of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm) tends to exclude &quot;very good&quot; candidate moves as well as &quot;very bad&quot; ones; however, the former are usually much less common than the latter, so the heuristic is generally quite effective.

In the traveling salesman problem above, for example, swapping two &quot;consecutive&quot; cities in a low-energy tour is expected to have a modest effect on its energy (length); whereas swapping two &quot;arbitrary&quot; cities is far more likely to increase its length than to decrease it. Thus, the consecutive-swap neighbor generator is expected to perform better than the arbitrary-swap one, even though the latter could provide a somewhat shorter path to the optimum (with formula_27 swaps, instead of formula_38).

A more precise statement of the heuristic is that one should try the first candidate states formula_29 for which formula_40 is large. For the &quot;standard&quot; acceptance function formula_7 above, it means that formula_42 is on the order of formula_6 or less. Thus, in the traveling salesman example above, one could use a function that swaps two random cities, where the probability of choosing a city-pair vanishes as their distance increases beyond formula_6.

===Barrier avoidance===
When choosing the candidate generator one must also try to reduce the number of &quot;deep&quot; local minima—states (or sets of connected states) that have much lower energy than all its neighboring states. Such &quot;closed catchment basins&quot; of the energy function may trap the simulated annealing algorithm with high probability (roughly proportional to the number of states in the basin) and for a very long time (roughly exponential on the energy difference between the surrounding states and the bottom of the basin).

As a rule, it is impossible to design a candidate generator that will satisfy this goal and also prioritize candidates with similar energy. On the other hand, one can often vastly improve the efficiency of simulated annealing by relatively simple changes to the generator. In the traveling salesman problem, for instance, it is not hard to exhibit two tours formula_45, formula_46, with nearly equal lengths, such that (1) formula_45 is optimal, (2) every sequence of city-pair swaps that converts formula_45 to formula_46 goes through tours that are much longer than both, and (3) formula_45 can be transformed into formula_46 by flipping (reversing the order of) a set of consecutive cities. In this example, formula_45 and formula_46 lie in different &quot;deep basins&quot; if the generator performs only random pair-swaps; but they will be in the same basin if the generator performs random segment-flips.

===Cooling schedule===
The physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times. Unfortunately, the &quot;relaxation time&quot;—the time one must wait for the equilibrium to be restored after a change in temperature—strongly depends on the &quot;topography&quot; of the energy function and on the current temperature. In the simulated annealing algorithm, the relaxation time also depends on the candidate generator, in a very complicated way. Note that all these parameters are usually provided as black box functions to the simulated annealing algorithm. Therefore, the ideal cooling rate cannot be determined beforehand and should be empirically adjusted for each problem. Adaptive simulated annealing algorithms address this problem by connecting the cooling schedule to the search progress. Other adaptive approaches such as Thermodynamic Simulated Annealing, automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states, according to the laws of thermodynamics.

==Restarts==
Sometimes it is better to move back to a solution that was significantly better rather than always moving from the current state. This process is called &quot;restarting&quot; of simulated annealing. To do this we set codice_1 and codice_2 to codice_3 and codice_4 and perhaps restart the annealing schedule. The decision to restart could be based on several criteria. Notable among these include restarting based on a fixed number of steps, based on whether the current energy is too high compared to the best energy obtained so far, restarting randomly, etc.

<text>The University of Münster (, until 2023 , WWU) is a public research university located in the city of Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany.

With more than 43,000 students and over 120 fields of study in 15 departments, it is Germany&#x27;s fifth largest university and one of the foremost centers of German intellectual life. The university offers a wide range of subjects across the sciences, social sciences and the humanities. Several courses are also taught in English, including PhD programmes as well as postgraduate courses in geoinformatics, geospational technologies or information systems.

Professors and former students have won ten Leibniz Prizes, the most prestigious as well as the best-funded prize in Europe, one Fields Medal and two Nobel Prizes. The University of Münster has also been successful in the German government&#x27;s Excellence Initiative.
==History==
The university has its roots in the Münster&#x27;s Jesuit College (&quot;Jesuiten-Kolleg Münster&quot;), founded in 1588, and the convent of lay sisters Liebfrauen-Überwasser, founded in 1040, of which it took its seal. The convent was dissolved in 1773, so that its funds could be used to found the University of Münster on 16 April 1780.

In 1631, Pope Urban VIII and Emperor Ferdinand II issued privileges, allowing the establishment of a university in Münster. However, due to a lack of funding, they were only put to use in 1780, when the modern University of Münster was founded with four faculties: Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology.

In 1843, it was renamed to Royal Theological and Philosophical Academy (&quot;Königliche Theologische und Philosophische Akademie&quot;), informally Münster Academy (&quot;Akademie Münster&quot;).

The ceremony of constitution was performed by Franz Freiherr von Fürstenberg. The university received the name Westphalian Wilhelm University (&quot;Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster&quot;), from Emperor Wilhelm II on 22 August 1907. In 2023 the university was renamed as the University of Münster (&quot;Universität Münster&quot;).

=== European degrees ===
1999 saw the beginning of the Bologna Process, which aimed to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher education qualifications. The Münster School of Business Administration and Economics was the first one to establish bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees.

<doc id="172249" wikidata="Q4072" url="?curid=172249" title="Göppingen">
<text>Göppingen (; or ) is a town in southern Germany, part of the Stuttgart Region of Baden-Württemberg. It is the capital of the district Göppingen. Göppingen is home to the toy company Märklin, and it is the birthplace of football player Jürgen Klinsmann. It also hosts the headquarters of TeamViewer AG.

==Geography==

Göppingen is situated at the bottom of the Hohenstaufen mountain, in the valley of the river Fils. The districts of Göppingen are Bartenbach, Bezgenriet, Faurndau, Göppingen, , Holzheim, Jebenhausen and Maitis.

== History ==
Tradition holds that the city was founded by an Alemannic leader called Geppo sometime in the 3rd or 4th century. A disastrous fire on August 25, 1782 destroyed most of the town, but it was immediately rebuilt. Industrialisation during the 19th century made the area into a centre of industry. The importance of such industry is still seen in the town in the present day in companies such as Märklin and Schuler.

===Jewish community===
Göppingen and the nearby village of Jebenhausen were home to a thriving Jewish community from 1777 until the Second World War. In 1777, the Baron von Liebenstein issued a &quot;Letter of Protection&quot; granting Elias Gutmann and other Jews permission to settle in Jebenhausen. The community grew and peaked in the mid-1800s, with the population center shifting from Jebenhausen to Göppingen and a substantial emigration of Jewish families to America by the late 19th Century. The Göppingen synagogue, constructed in 1881, was destroyed during the Kristallnacht from 9–10 November 1938. Detailed records of the communities were collected by Rabbi Dr. Aron Tänzer, who served the community from 1907-1937, and who was also a driving force behind the establishment of the secular city library in Göppingen. A comprehensive Jewish community history, &quot;Die Geschichte der Juden in Jebenhausen und Göppingen&quot;, was first produced by Tänzer in 1927, on the 150th anniversary of the settlement of Jebenhausen, and re-released in 1988 by the city of Göppingen with updated material added by Karl-Heinz Ruess. The Jewish Museum in Jebenhausen, opened in 1992, documents and preserves the history of the Jewish community of Jebenhausen and Göppingen.

===Cooke Barracks===
In 1930, a civilian air field was built north of Göppingen. This was acquired by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in 1935 and expanded into Fliegerhorst Kaserne. From 1945 through 1949, displaced persons and refugees were housed in the kaserne. In 1949, it was renamed Cooke Barracks in honor of Charles H. Cooke, Jr. who had been posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Soldier&#x27;s Medal for gallantry in action. In late 1950, the VII Corps (US) had been reactivated in Stuttgart and U.S. Army units began to be stationed at Cooke Barracks. The barracks began to be expanded and was used as the 28th Infantry Division headquarters. The 28th Infantry was redesignated as the 9th Infantry Division (United States) in 1954 and was replaced by the 8th Infantry Division in 1956. They were then replaced by the 4th Armored Division in 1957, which was redesignated as the 1st Armored Division in 1971 and moved to Hindenburg Kaserne in Ansbach in 1972. The 1st Infantry Division (Forward) moved from Augsburg in 1972 until they were deactivated in 1991. Cooke Barracks was returned to the German government in 1992. The barracks were again used to house refugees for some time, then returned to civilian use.

<text>Woldemar Voigt (; 2 September 1850 – 13 December 1919) was a German physicist.

==Biography==
Voigt was born in Leipzig, and died in Göttingen. He was a student of Franz Ernst Neumann.
Voigt taught at the Georg August University of Göttingen and eventually went on to head the Mathematical Physics Department there. He was succeeded in 1914 by Peter Debye, who took charge of the theoretical department of the Physical Institute.

Voigt worked on crystal physics, thermodynamics and electro-optics. His main work was the &quot;Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik&quot; (&quot;Textbook on crystal physics&quot;), first published in 1910. He discovered what is now called the Voigt effect in 1898. The word tensor in its current meaning was introduced by him in 1898. Voigt profile and Voigt notation are named after him. He was also an amateur musician and became known as a Bach expert (see External links). He was the first to suggest, in 1886, that Bach&#x27;s Concerto for two harpsichords in C minor, BWV 1060 was originally scored for violin and oboe.

In 1887 Voigt formulated a form of the Lorentz transformation between a rest frame of reference and a frame moving with speed formula_1 in the formula_2 direction. However, as Voigt himself said, the transformation was aimed at a specific problem and did not carry with it the idea of a general coordinate transformation, as is the case in relativity theory.

==Voigt transformation==

In modern notation Voigt&#x27;s transformation was
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
where formula_7.
If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by formula_8, they become the modern Lorentz transformation. Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Also Hendrik Lorentz (1909) is on record as saying that he could have taken these transformations into his theory of electrodynamics, if only he had known of them, rather than developing his own. It is interesting then to examine the consequences of these transformations from this point of view. Lorentz might then have seen that the transformation introduced relativity of simultaneity, and also time dilation. However, the magnitude of the dilation was greater than the now accepted value in the Lorentz transformations. Moving clocks, obeying Voigt&#x27;s time transformation, indicate an elapsed time
formula_9, while stationary clocks indicate an elapsed time formula_10.

Since Voigt&#x27;s transformation preserves the speed of light in all frames, the Michelson–Morley experiment and the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment can not distinguish between the two transformations. The crucial question is the issue of time dilation. The experimental measurement of time dilation by Ives and Stillwell (1938) and others settled the issue in favor of the Lorentz transformation.

*; This article ends with the announcement that in a forthcoming article the principles worked out so far shall be applied to the problems of reflection and refraction. The article contains on p. 235, last paragraph, and on p. 236, 2nd paragraph, a judgment on the Michelson experiment of 1886, which Voigt, after a correspondence with H. A. Lorentz in 1887 and 1888, has partly withdrawn in the article announced, namely in a footnote in Voigt (1888). According to Voigt&#x27;s first judgment, the Michelson experiment must yield a null result, independently of whether the Earth transports the luminiferous aether with it (Fizeau&#x27;s 1st aether hypothesis), or whether the Earth moves through an entirely independent, self-consistent universal luminiferous aether (Fizeau&#x27;s 2nd aether hypothesis).
*; In a footnote on p. 390 of this article, Voigt corrects his earlier judgment, made in &quot;Göttinger Nachrichten&quot; No. 8, p. 235 and p. 236 (1887), and states indirectly that, after a correspondence with H. A. Lorentz, he can no longer maintain that in the case of the validity of Fizeau&#x27;s 2nd aether hypothesis the Michelson experiment must yield a null result too.

<text>Stoewer was a German automobile manufacturer before World War II whose headquarters were in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland).

==History==
The first company was founded by the Stoewer brothers, Emil (lived 1873 – 1942) and Bernhard (1875 – 1937) in 1896 for manufacturing sewing machines in Stettin.

In 1899, the Stoewer brothers founded the firm &quot;Gebrüder Stoewer, Fabrik für Motorfahrzeugen&quot; and started to produce automobiles. Their first automobile was the Großer Stoewer Motorwagen, with 6.5 hp (4.8 kW) and maximum speed.

In 1908 Stoewers constructed the &quot;Stoewer G4&quot;. This model was successful for them at the time – 1070 cars were built. In 1910, Stoewer cars were built under licence by Mathis of Strassburg.
In 1916, the family-owned company was transformed into a limited company under the name of &quot;Stoewer-Werke AG, vormals Gebrüder Stoewer&quot;.

In the mid-20s a new class of cars was introduced: the &quot;D-Types&quot; included &quot;D3&quot;, &quot;D9&quot; and &quot;D10&quot; with four-cylinder engines, as well as &quot;D5&quot;, &quot;D6&quot; and &quot;D12&quot; with six cylinders.
Something special was the 1921 &quot;D7&quot; with a proprietary six-cylinder aero engine with . Of the fifty &quot;D10&quot; made, the only survivor was in Melbourne, Australia in original condition. It was on display at the 2014 MotorClassica. It is now in Germany.


In 1928 the company started to build &quot;S8&quot; and &quot;G14&quot; models with eight-cylinder engines.
At the beginning of the 1930s Stoewers delivered their highlights: &quot;G15 Gigant&quot;, &quot;M12 Marschall&quot; and &quot;P20 Repräsentant&quot;, each with eight-cylinder engines, with 60 to 120 hp (45 to 90 kW) and maximum speed. The production of these cars had to be cancelled after 2,500 vehicles being produced due to worldwide economic troubles. In 1931 Stoewer constructed one of the first cars with front-wheel drive at all, class &quot;V5&quot; 25 hp (19 kW), maximum speed. The model named &quot;Greif Junior&quot; was built under the licence of Tatra. Its successor &quot;V8 Greif&quot; was the last car constructed by Stoewer himself; class &quot;Arkona&quot; and &quot;Sedina&quot; were the last civilian cars produced by the company.

In 1936 the Stoewer factory developed the &#x27;uniform light off-road car&#x27; (&quot;le.E.Pkw&quot;, leichter geländegängiger Einheits-PKW) for the German army, a versatile four-wheel drive car, the Stoewer R200 initially (until 1940) equipped with four-wheel steering. Due to capacity-limitations, the cars also had to be produced by BMW-Factory Eisenach, as BMW 325, and by Hanomag in Hanover as the Type 20B. Together the three manufacturers made a total of ca. 13,000 units. 
Stoewer was one of many German companies that exploited slave labour during World War II and had its own camp for prisoners.
After World War II, the Red Army seized the remaining production facilities, dismantled the factory and sent the equipment to the Soviet Union. The company subsequently ceased to exist.

<text>A hidden message is information that is not immediately noticeable, and that must be discovered or uncovered and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and symbolic or cryptic codes such as a crossword or cipher. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as backmasking and steganography, many so-called hidden messages are merely fanciful imaginings or apophany.

== Description ==
The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages, and symbolic or cryptic codes such as a crossword or cipher. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.

== Backward audio messages ==
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate backmasking, while others are simply phonetic reversals resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, video games, music videos, movies, and television shows.

=== Backmasking ===

Backmasking is a recording technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by The Beatles, who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album &quot;Revolver.&quot; The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for &quot;clean&quot; releases of songs.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record-burnings and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners.

=== Phonetic reversal ===
Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their phonemes are reversed—a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, &quot;Kiss&quot; backwards sounds like &quot;sick&quot;, and so the title of Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Kiss Kiss&quot; sounds like &quot;Sick Sick Sick&quot; or &quot;Six Six Six&quot; backwards. Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as &quot;It&#x27;s fun to smoke marijuana&quot; or &quot;start to smoke marijuana&quot;. The Paul is dead phenomenon was started in part because a phonetic reversal of &quot;Number nine&quot; (the words were constantly repeated in &quot;Revolution 9)&quot; was interpreted as &quot;Turn me on, dead man&quot;.

According to proponents of reverse speech, phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

== Visual messages ==

Hidden messages can be created in visual mediums with techniques such as hidden computer text and steganography.

In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, &quot;Feel the Curves!!&quot; An image hidden inside one of the ice cubes depicted an oral sex act. Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled. Rival PepsiCo had a similar accusation in 1990 when their promotional Pepsi Cool Cans was accused of having the word &quot;sex&quot; hidden in their design if two of their cans were placed atop each other.

Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. According to the Snopes website, one image &quot;is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie&quot;: a topless woman in two frames of &quot;The Rescuers&quot;.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards PETCO, a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the San Diego Padres baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased naming rights to Petco Park, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: &quot;Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!&quot; However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting acrostic reads &quot;BOYCOTT PETCO&quot;. Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.

Secretive design language is widely used on web sites as Easter eggs or within products as hidden features, such as In-N-Out Burger&#x27;s secret menu or the new Norwegian passport design for security.

<doc id="172271" wikidata="Q335403" url="?curid=172271" title="The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus">
<text>The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus is a painting by the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí, begun in 1958 and finished in 1959. It is over 14 feet tall and over 9 feet wide (410 x 284 cm; 161.4 x 111.8 in), one in a series of large paintings Dalí did during this era.

==Description==
This work is an ambitious homage to Dalí&#x27;s Spain. It combines Spanish history, religion, art, and myth into a unified whole. It was commissioned for Huntington Hartford for the opening of his Museum Gallery of Modern Art in New York&#x27;s 2 Columbus Circle. At this time, some Catalan historians were claiming that Columbus was actually from Catalonia, not Italy, making the discovery all the more relevant for Dalí, who was also from this region of Spain. 

The eponymous painting deals with Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first landing in the New World. It depicts the event metaphorically rather than aiming for historical accuracy. Columbus is depicted not as a middle-aged mariner, but as an adolescent boy in a classical robe to symbolize America as a young continent with its best years ahead of it.

Dalí, in a period of intense interest in Roman Catholic mysticism at the time, symbolically portrayed Columbus bringing Christianity and the &quot;true church&quot; to a new world as a great and holy accomplishment. 

Gala Dalí, the painter&#x27;s wife, whom he often depicted as the Virgin Mary, poses for the role of The Blessed Virgin (or according to some commentators Saint Helena) on the banner in the right hand of Columbus. She appears as a Saint, suggesting that she is Dalí&#x27;s muse and that she is responsible for his own, &quot;Discovery of America&quot;.

Dalí painted himself in the background as a kneeling monk holding a crucifix. Dalí&#x27;s belief that Columbus was Catalan is represented by the incorporation of the old Catalan flag. 

The painting contains numerous references to the works of Diego Velázquez (specifically &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot;), a Spanish painter who had died 300 years earlier, and who influenced both Dalí&#x27;s painting and his moustache. Dalí borrows the spears from that painting and places them on the right hand side of his work. Within these spears, Dalí has painted the image of a crucified Christ, which was based on a drawing by the Spanish mystic, St. John.

In the bottom center of the painting, on the beach a few steps in front of Columbus, is the bumpy and pockmarked brown sphere of a sea urchin with a curious halo-like ring around it.

==Current status==
The painting now hangs in the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida which provides a permanent home for the collection of A. Reynolds Morse &amp; Eleanor R. Morse.

<doc id="172273" wikidata="Q10304508" url="?curid=172273" title="Tick">
<text>Ticks are parasitic arachnids of the order Ixodida. They are part of the mite superorder Parasitiformes. Adult ticks are approximately 3 to 5 mm in length depending on age, sex, species, and &quot;fullness&quot;. Ticks are external parasites, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The timing of the origin of ticks is uncertain, though the oldest known tick fossils are from the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years old. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.

Ticks belong to two major families, the Ixodidae or hard ticks, and the Argasidae, or soft ticks. &quot;Nuttalliella,&quot; a genus of tick from southern Africa, is the only member of the family Nuttalliellidae, and represents the most primitive living lineage of ticks. Adults have ovoid/pear-shaped bodies (idiosomas) which become engorged with blood when they feed, and eight legs. Their cephalothorax and abdomen are completely fused. In addition to having a hard shield on their dorsal surfaces, known as the scutum, hard ticks have a beak-like structure at the front containing the mouthparts, whereas soft ticks have their mouthparts on the underside of their bodies. Ticks locate potential hosts by sensing odor, body heat, moisture, and/or vibrations in the environment.

Ticks have four stages to their life cycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ticks belonging to the Ixodidae family undergo either a one-host, two-host, or three-host life cycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring blood ingestion, and as such, Argasid ticks undergo a multihost life cycle. Because of their hematophagous (blood-ingesting) diets, ticks act as vectors of many serious diseases that affect humans and other animals.

==Biology==
===Taxonomy and phylogeny===
Ticks belong to the Parasitiformes, a distinctive group of mites that are separate from the main group of mites, the Acariformes. Whether the two groups are more closely related to each other than to other arachnids is uncertain, and studies often recover them as not closely related. Within the Parasitiformes, ticks are most closely related to the Holothyrida, a small group of free living scavengers with 32 described species confined to the landmasses that formed the supercontinent Gondwana.

Relationships among members of the Parasitiformes, after Klompen, 2010:
Fossilized ticks have been discovered from the end of the Early Cretaceous onwards, most commonly in amber. The oldest discovered tick fossils are an argasid bird tick from Late Cretaceous (Turonian ~94-90 million years ago) aged New Jersey amber, and various ticks found in Burmese amber, including &quot;Khimaira&quot; which does not belong to any living family of tick, the living genus &quot;Nuttalliella&quot; and the possible nuttalliellid genera &quot;Deinocroton&quot; and &quot;Legionaris,&quot; as well as the members of the living ixodid genera &quot;Amblyomma&quot;, &quot;Ixodes&quot;, &quot;Haemaphysalis, Bothriocroton&quot; and &quot;Archaeocroton&quot; dating the earliest Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, around . An undescribed juvenile tick is known from late Albian amber, dating to 105 million years ago. The younger Baltic and Dominican ambers have also yielded examples that can be placed in living genera. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the last common ancestor of all living ticks likely lived around 195 million years ago in the Southern Hemisphere, in what was then Gondwana.

Ticks belong to three different families. The majority of tick species belong to the two families: Ixodidae (hard ticks) and Argasidae (soft ticks). The third living family is Nuttalliellidae, named for the bacteriologist George Nuttall. It comprises a single species, &quot;Nuttalliella namaqua&quot;, and as such is a monotypic taxon. &quot;Nuttalliella namaqua&quot; is found in southern Africa ranging from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.

Relationships of living and extinct tick families, after Chitimia-Dobler et al. 2022:The Ixodidae contain over 700 species of hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contain about 200 species; the genera accepted are &quot;Antricola&quot;, &quot;Argas&quot;, &quot;Nothoaspis&quot;, &quot;Ornithodoros&quot;, and &quot;Otobius&quot;. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The phylogeny of the Ixodida within the Acari is shown in the cladogram, based on a 2014 maximum parsimony study of amino acid sequences of 12 mitochondrial proteins. The Argasidae appear monophyletic in this study.

===Anatomy and physiology===
Ticks, like mites, belong to the subclass Acari that lack their primary somatic segmentation of the abdomen (or opisthosoma), rather these parasitic arachnids present a subsequent fusion of the abdomen with the cephalothorax (or prosoma). The tagmata typical of other Chelicerata have developed into the gnathosoma (head), which is retractable and contains the mouthparts, and idiosoma (body), which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The gnathosoma is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes. Features of the gnathosoma include two palps, two chelicerae, and hypostome. The hypostome acts as stabilizer and helps to anchor the tick&#x27;s mouthparts to the host. The chelicerae are specialized appendages used for cutting and piercing into the host&#x27;s skin while palps are leglike appendages that are sensory in function.

The ventral side of the idiosoma bears sclerites, and the gonopore is located between the fourth pair of legs. In the absence of segmentation, the positioning of the eyes, limbs, and gonopore on the idiosoma provide the only locational guidance.

Larval ticks hatch with six legs, acquiring the other two after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, each of which has seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller&#x27;s organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. Ticks can also use Haller&#x27;s organs to perceive infrared light emanating from a host. When stationary, their legs remain tightly folded against the body.

Ticks are extremely resilient animals. They can survive in a near vacuum for as long as half an hour. Their slow metabolism during their dormant periods enables them to go prolonged durations between meals. Even after 18 weeks of starvation, they can endure repeated two-day bouts of dehydration followed by rehydration, but their survivability against dehydration drops rapidly after 36 weeks of starvation. To keep from dehydrating, ticks hide in humid spots on the forest floor or absorb water from subsaturated air by secreting hygroscopic fluid produced by the salivary glands onto the external mouthparts and then reingesting the water-enriched fluid.

Ticks can withstand temperatures just above for more than two hours and can survive temperatures between for at least two weeks. Ticks have even been found in Antarctica, where they feed on penguins.

Most ticks are plain brown or reddish brown. However, the scuta of some species are decorated with white patterns.

====Ixodidae====

In nymphs and adults, the is prominent and projects forwards from the body. The eyes are close to the sides of the scutum and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard protective scutellum, a characteristic of this family, covers nearly the whole dorsal surface in males, but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. When an ixodid attaches to a host the bite is typically painless and generally goes unnoticed. They remain in place until they engorge and are ready to molt; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to molt in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.

====Argasidae====

The body of a soft tick is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded anterior portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above, as they are on the ventral surface. A centrally positioned dorsal plate with ridges projecting slightly above the surrounding surface, but with no decoration is often present. Soft ticks possess a leathery cuticle as well. A pattern of small, circular depressions expose where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The eyes are on the sides of the body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ in the structure of the genital pore.

====Nuttalliellidae====

Nuttalliellidae can be distinguished from both ixodid and argasid ticks by a combination of a projecting gnathosoma and a soft leathery skin. Other distinguishing characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.

===Diet and feeding===
Ticks are ectoparasites and consume blood to satisfy all of their nutritional requirements. They are obligate hematophages, and require blood to survive and move from one stage of life to another. Ticks can fast for long periods of time, but eventually die if unable to find a host. Hematophagy evolved independently at least six times in arthropods living during the late Cretaceous; in ticks it is thought to have evolved 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. This behavior evolved independently within the separate tick families as well, with differing host-tick interactions driving the evolutionary change.
Some ticks attach to their host rapidly, while others wander around searching for thinner skin, such as that in the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and life stage, preparing to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host&#x27;s skin and cuts into the surface. It extracts blood by cutting a hole in the host&#x27;s epidermis, into which it inserts its hypostome and prevents the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.

Ticks find their hosts by detecting an animals&#x27; breath and body odors, sensing body heat, moisture, or vibrations. A common misconception about ticks is they jump onto their host; however, they are incapable of jumping, although static electricity from their hosts has been shown to be capable of pulling the tick over distances several times their own body length. Many tick species, particularly Ixodidae, lie in wait in a position known as &quot;questing&quot;. While questing, ticks cling to leaves and grasses by their third and fourth pairs of legs. They hold the first pair of legs outstretched, waiting to grasp and climb on to any passing host. Tick questing heights tend to be correlated with the size of the desired host; nymphs and small species tend to quest close to the ground, where they may encounter small mammalian or bird hosts; adults climb higher into the vegetation, where larger hosts may be encountered. Some species are hunters and lurk near places where hosts may rest. Upon receiving an olfactory stimulus or other environmental indication, they crawl or run across the intervening surface.

Other ticks, mainly the Argasidae, are nidicolous, finding hosts in their nests, burrows, or caves. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to identify hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors. Many of them feed primarily on birds, though some &quot;Ornithodoros&quot; species, for example, feed on small mammals. Both groups of soft tick feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand, in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings, where they come out nightly to attack roosting birds or emerge when they detect carbon dioxide in the breath of their hosts.

Ixodidae remain in place until they are completely engorged. Their weight may increase by 200 to 600 times compared to their prefeeding weight. To accommodate this expansion, cell division takes place to facilitate enlargement of the cuticle. In the Argasidae, the tick&#x27;s cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested, but does not grow new cells, with the weight of the tick increasing five- to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.

Tick saliva contains about 1,500 to 3,000 proteins, depending on the tick species. The proteins with anti-inflammatory properties, called evasins, allow ticks to feed for eight to ten days without being perceived by the host animal. Researchers are studying these evasins with the goal of developing drugs to neutralise the chemokines that cause myocarditis, heart attack, and stroke.

Ticks do not use any other food source than vertebrate blood and therefore ingest high levels of protein, iron and salt, but few carbohydrates, lipids or vitamins. Ticks’ genomes have evolved large repertoires of genes related to this nutritional challenge, but they themselves cannot synthesize the essential vitamins that are lacking in blood meal. To overcome these nutritional deficiencies, ticks have evolved obligate interactions with nutritional endosymbionts. The first appearance of ticks and their later diversification were largely conditioned by this nutritional endosymbiosis lasting for millions of years. The most common of these nutritional endosymbionts belong to the &quot;Coxiella&quot; and &quot;Francisella&quot; bacterial genera. These intracellular symbiotic microorganisms are specifically associated with ticks and use transovarial transmission to ensure their persistence. Although &quot;Coxiella&quot; and &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts are distantly related bacteria, they have converged towards an analogous B vitamin-based nutritional mutualism with ticks. Their experimental elimination typically results in decreased tick survival, molting, fecundity and egg viability, as well as in physical abnormalities, which all are fully restored with an oral supplement of B vitamins. The genome sequencing of &quot;Coxiella&quot; and &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts confirmed that they consistently produce three B vitamin types, biotin (vitamin B7), riboflavin (B2) and folate (B9). As they are required for tick life cycle, these obligate endosymbionts are present in all individuals of the tick species they infect, at least at early stages of development since they may be secondarily lost in males during nymphal development. Since &quot;Coxiella&quot; and &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts are closely related to pathogens, there is a substantial risk of misidentification between endosymbionts and pathogens, leading to an overestimation of infection risks associated with ticks.

===Range and habitat===
Tick species are widely distributed around the world. They tend to flourish more in warm, humid climates, because they require a certain amount of moisture in the air to undergo metamorphosis, and low temperatures inhibit their development of eggs to larvae. 
The occurrence of ticks and tick-borne illnesses in humans is increasing. Tick populations are spreading into new areas, due in part to the warming temperatures of climate change.

Tick parasitism is widely distributed among host taxa, including marsupial and placental mammals, birds, reptiles (snakes, iguanas, and lizards), and amphibians. Ticks of domestic animals cause considerable harm to livestock through pathogenic transmission, causing anemia through blood loss, and damaging wool and hides. The Tropical Bont tick wreaks havoc on livestock and wildlife in Africa, the Caribbean, and several other countries through the spread of disease, specifically heartwater disease. The spinose ear tick has a worldwide distribution, the young feed inside the ears of cattle and various wildlife.

A habitat preferred by ticks is the interface where a lawn meets the forest, or more generally, the ecotone, which is unmaintained transitional edge habitat between woodlands and open areas. Therefore, one tick management strategy is to remove leaf litter, brush, and weeds at the edge of the woods. Ticks like shady, moist leaf litter with an overstory of trees or shrubs and, in the spring, they deposit their eggs into such places allowing larvae to emerge in the fall and crawl into low-lying vegetation. The 3 meter boundary closest to the lawn&#x27;s edge are a tick migration zone, where 82% of tick nymphs in lawns are found.

=== Ecology ===
In general, ticks are found wherever their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on through their migrations; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt discovered more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. It was also observed the tick species varied depending on the season of migration, in this study it is spring and autumn migrations, this is thought to occur due to the seasonal periodicities of the different species.

For an ecosystem to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements; the population density of host species in the area must be great enough and it must be humid enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, Ixodid ticks, particularly the North American &quot;I. scapularis&quot;, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence of deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.

Mites and nematodes feed on ticks, which are also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, ticks act as a disease vector and behave as the primary hosts of many different pathogens such as spirochaetes. Ticks carry various debilitating diseases therefore, ticks may assist in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.

Ticks can transmit an array of infectious diseases that affect humans and other animals. Ticks that carry zoonotic pathogens often tend to have a wide host range. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick, but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, domesticated pets, and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to ticks.

===Life cycle===
All three tick families ticks have four life cycle stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult.

====Ixodidae====

Ixodidae ticks have three different life cycles. Depending on the species, Ixodids can either possess a one-host life cycle, two-host life cycle, or three-host life cycle.

===== One-host ticks =====
In one-host ticks the tick remains on the host through the larval, nymphal, and adult stages, only to leave the host to lay eggs. Eggs laid in the environment hatch into larvae, which immediately seek out a host in which to attach and feed. Fed larvae molt into unfed nymphs that remain on the host. After engorging on the host&#x27;s blood, the nymphs molt into sexually mature adults that remain on the host in order to feed and mate. Once a female is both fed and ready to lay eggs, only then does she leave the host in search of a suitable area to deposit her eggs. Ticks that follow this life cycle are called one-host ticks. The winter tick &quot;Dermacentor albipictus&quot; and the cattle tick &quot;Boophilus microplus&quot; are examples of one-host ticks.

===== Two-host ticks =====
The life cycle of a two-host tick often spans two years. During fall the pregnant female tick will drop off her second host and lay her eggs. The eggs hatch during winter, the following spring the larvae emerge and attach to their first host. Newly hatched larvae attach to a host in order to obtain a blood meal. They remain on the host then develop into nymphs. Once engorged, they drop off the host and find a safe area in the natural environment in which to molt into adults, this typically occurs during the winter. Both male and female adults seek out a host on which to attach, which may be the same body that served as host during their early development but is often a larger mammal. Once attached, they feed and mate. females drop from the host to oviposit in the environment. Ticks that complete their life cycle in this manner are called two-host ticks, like &quot;Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum.&quot;

===== Three-host ticks =====
Most ixodid ticks require three hosts, and their life cycles typically span three years. The female tick drops off its host, often in the fall, and lays thousands of eggs. The larvae hatch in the winter and emerge in the spring. When the larvae emerge, they attach and feed primarily on small mammals and birds. During the summer the larvae become engorged and drop off the first host to molt and become nymphs, this often occurs during the fall. The following spring the nymphs emerge and seek out another host, often a small rodent. The nymphs become engorged and drop off the host in the fall to molt and become adults. The following spring the adult ticks emerge and seek out a larger host, often a large mammal such as cattle or even humans. Females will mate on their third host. Female adults then engorge on blood and prepare to drop off to lay her eggs on the ground, while males feed very little and remain on the host in order to continue mating with other females.

====Argasidae====
Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may go through up to seven nymphal stages (instars), requiring a meal of blood each time. Often, egg laying and mating occurs detached from the host in a safe environment. The eggs hatch and the larvae feed on a nearby host for anywhere from a few hours to several days, this depends on the species of tick. After they feed the larvae drop and molt into their first nymphal instars, then the nymph seeks out and feeds on its second host, often this is the same as the first host, within an hour. This process occurs repeatedly and until the last nymphal instar occurs, thus allowing the tick to molt into an adult. Once an adult these ticks feed rapidly and periodically their entire life cycle. In some species an adult female may lay eggs after each feeding. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs over the course of her lifetime. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process that is unique to argasid ticks.

====Nuttalliellidae====
Nuttalliellidae is an elusive monotypic family of tick, that is, possesses a single species, &quot;Nuttalliella namaqua.&quot; There is little to nothing known about the life cycle and feeding habits of &quot;N. namaqua&quot; but it is speculated this species of tick has multiple different hosts&quot;.&quot;

==Relationship with humans==

===Tick-borne disease===

Ticks can transmit many kinds of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, that infect ticks’ hosts. A tick can harbor more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis more difficult. Species of the bacterial genus &quot;Rickettsia&quot; are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus, and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and the Heartland virus. In the United States, Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the country.

Some species, notably the Australian paralysis tick, are also intrinsically venomous and can cause tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick&#x27;s ovaries, in which case the larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the heartwater, which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds act as reservoirs and vectors of foreign infectious diseases. In the Egyptian migratory bird study, over 20 strains of pathogenic viruses were detected within the tick sample from autumn.

Not all ticks in an infective area are infected with transmittable pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long feeding session are necessary for diseases to be transmitted. Consequently, tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, before then disinfecting the wound. In Australia and New Zealand, where tick-borne infections are less common than tick reactions, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends seeking medical assistance or killing ticks in-situ by freezing and then leaving them to fall out to prevent allergic/anaphylactic reactions. Professor Sheryl van Nunen, whose research in 2007 identified tick-induced mammalian meat allergy, famously said &quot;tweezers are tick squeezers&quot;, referring to the tick toxins squeezed into people attempting to remove ticks with tweezers. Ticks can be disposed of by flushing them down the toilet, placing them in a container of soapy water or alcohol, or sticking them to tape that can then be folded over and thrown away.

Bifenthrin and permethrin, both pyrethroids, are sometimes used as tick-control measures, although they have the disadvantage of being carcinogenic and able to attack the nervous systems of other species besides ticks. Those who walk through tick-infested areas can make it harder for ticks to latch onto them by tucking their trousers into boots made of smooth rubber, which ticks have trouble climbing.

Research since 2008 has documented red-meat allergies (mammalian meat allergy and Alpha-gal allergy) in the U.S. due to lone star tick bites. The range of the problem has been expanding with the range of the tick. Other species of ticks are known for being responsible for meat allergies in other countries, including Sweden, Germany, and Australia.

Many tick-transmitted viruses, such as Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, are classified as dangerous enough to require biosafety level 4 precautions in laboratory environments. This includes five levels of containment, viz., storage vials within humidified desiccators, within environmental chambers, within a tick suite, within a BSL4 laboratory. Precautions such as glove boxes, sticky pads, Vaseline barriers, safety suits, gloves, sticky tape, silicone vacuum grease, sticky trap paste, and micro mesh are used to safely contain ticks and prevent them from escaping.

===Population control measures===
With the possible exception of widespread DDT use in the Soviet Union, attempts to limit the population or distribution of disease-causing ticks have been quite unsuccessful. 
The parasitoid encyrtid wasp &quot;Ixodiphagus hookeri&quot; has been investigated for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill their hosts.

Predators and competitors of tick hosts can indirectly reduce the density of infected nymphs, thereby lowering tick-borne disease risk by lowering the density and/or tick burden of reservoir-competent hosts. A study in the Netherlands found that the number of larval ticks on bank voles and wood mice was lower at sites with significant red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and stone marten (&quot;Martes foina&quot;) activity.

This supports the results of a study from the northeastern United States, in which the incidence of Lyme borreliosis was negatively correlated with the density of red fox, possibly because foxes decrease the density of white-footed mice (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;), the most important reservoir-competent host for &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;.

Another natural form of control for ticks is the helmeted guineafowl, a bird species that consumes mass quantities of ticks. Opossums groom themselves, swallowing many ticks; they are net destroyers of ticks, killing around ninety percent of the ticks that attempt to feed on them. More generally, high animal diversity has a strongly protective effect against tick-borne disease.

Topical tick medicines may be toxic to animals and humans. The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide phenothrin in combination with the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. Some products were withdrawn, and others are known to cause adverse reactions.

<doc id="172274" wikidata="Q10734" url="?curid=172274" title="Centaur (small Solar System body)">
<text>In planetary astronomy, a centaur is a small Solar System body that orbits the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune and crosses the orbits of one or more of the giant planets. Centaurs generally have unstable orbits because of this; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years, but there is one 
known centaur, 514107 Kaʻepaokaʻawela, which may be in a stable (though retrograde) orbit. Centaurs typically exhibit the characteristics of both asteroids and comets. They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human. Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total centaur population difficult. Estimates for the number of centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000 to more than 10,000,000.

The first centaur to be discovered, under the definition of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the one used here, was 944 Hidalgo in 1920. However, they were not recognized as a distinct population until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977. The largest confirmed centaur is 10199 Chariklo, which at 260 kilometers in diameter is as big as a mid-sized main-belt asteroid, and is known to have a system of rings. It was discovered in 1997.

No centaur has been photographed up close, although there is evidence that Saturn&#x27;s moon Phoebe, imaged by the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe in 2004, may be a captured centaur that originated in the Kuiper belt. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope has gleaned some information about the surface features of 8405 Asbolus.

Ceres may have originated in the region of the outer planets, and if so might be considered an ex-centaur, but the centaurs seen today all originated elsewhere.

Of the objects known to occupy centaur-like orbits, approximately 30 have been found to display comet-like dust comas, with three, 2060 Chiron, 60558 Echeclus, and 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, having detectable levels of volatile production in orbits entirely beyond Jupiter. Chiron and Echeclus are therefore classified as both centaurs and comets, while Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 has always held a comet designation. Other centaurs, such as 52872 Okyrhoe, are suspected of having shown comas. Any centaur that is perturbed close enough to the Sun is expected to become a comet.

== Classification ==
A centaur has either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets (between Jupiter and Neptune). Due to the inherent long-term instability of orbits in this region, even centaurs such as and , which do not currently cross the orbit of any planet, are in gradually changing orbits that will be perturbed until they start to cross the orbit of one or more of the giant planets. Some astronomers count only bodies with semimajor axes in the region of the outer planets to be centaurs; others accept any body with a perihelion in the region, as their orbits are similarly unstable.

===Discrepant criteria===
However, different institutions have different criteria for classifying borderline objects, based on particular values of their orbital elements:
* The Minor Planet Center (MPC) defines centaurs as having a perihelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter () and a semi-major axis less than that of Neptune (). Though nowadays the MPC often lists centaurs and scattered disc objects together as a single group.
* The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) similarly defines centaurs as having a semi-major axis, &quot;a&quot;, between those of Jupiter and Neptune ().
* In contrast, the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) defines centaurs using a dynamical classification scheme. These classifications are based on the simulated change in behavior of the present orbit when extended over 10 million years. The DES defines centaurs as non-resonant objects whose instantaneous (osculating) perihelia are less than the osculating semi-major axis of Neptune at any time during the simulation. This definition is intended to be synonymous with planet-crossing orbits and to suggest comparatively short lifetimes in the current orbit.
* The collection &quot;The Solar System Beyond Neptune&quot; (2008) defines objects with a semi-major axis between those of Jupiter and Neptune and a Jupiter-relative Tisserand&#x27;s parameter above 3.05 as centaurs, classifying the objects with a Jupiter-relative Tisserand&#x27;s parameter below this and, to exclude Kuiper belt objects, an arbitrary perihelion cut-off half-way to Saturn () as Jupiter-family comets, and classifying those objects on unstable orbits with a semi-major axis larger than Neptune&#x27;s as members of the scattered disc.
* Other astronomers prefer to define centaurs as objects that are non-resonant with a perihelion inside the orbit of Neptune that can be shown to likely cross the Hill sphere of a gas giant within the next 10 million years, so that centaurs can be thought of as objects scattered inwards and that interact more strongly and scatter more quickly than typical scattered-disc objects.
* The JPL Small-Body Database lists 910 centaurs. There are an additional 223 trans-Neptunian objects (objects with a semi-major axis further than Neptune&#x27;s, i.e. ) with a perihelion closer than the orbit of Uranus ().

===Ambiguous objects===
The Gladman &amp; Marsden (2008) criteria would make some objects Jupiter-family comets: Both Echeclus (, ) and Okyrhoe (; ) have traditionally been classified as centaurs. Traditionally considered an asteroid, but classified as a centaur by JPL, Hidalgo (; ) would also change category to a Jupiter-family comet. Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (; ) has been categorized as both a centaur and a Jupiter-family comet depending on the definition used.

Other objects caught between these differences in classification methods include , which has a semi-major axis of 32 AU but crosses the orbits of both Uranus and Neptune. It is listed as an outer centaur by the &quot;Deep Ecliptic Survey&quot; (DES). Among the inner centaurs, (434620) 2005 VD, with a perihelion distance very near Jupiter, is listed as a centaur by both JPL and DES.

A recent orbital simulation of the evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects through the centaur region has identified a short-lived &quot;orbital gateway&quot; between 5.4 and 7.8 AU through which 21% of all centaurs pass, including 72% of the centaurs that become Jupiter-family comets. Four objects are known to occupy this region, including 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, P/2010 TO20 LINEAR-Grauer, P/2008 CL94 Lemmon, and 2016 LN8, but the simulations indicate that there may of order 1000 more objects &gt;1 km in radius that have yet to be detected. Objects in this gateway region can display significant activity and are in an important evolutionary transition state that further blurs the distinction between the centaur and Jupiter-family comet populations.

The Committee on Small Body Nomenclature of the International Astronomical Union has not formally weighed in on any side of the debate. Instead, it has adopted the following naming convention for such objects: Befitting their centaur-like transitional orbits between TNOs and comets, &quot;objects on unstable, non-resonant, giant-planet-crossing orbits with semimajor axes greater than Neptune&#x27;s&quot; are to be named for other hybrid and shape-shifting mythical creatures. Thus far, only the binary objects Ceto and Phorcys and Typhon and Echidna have been named according to the new policy.

Centaurs with measured diameters listed as possible dwarf planets according to Mike Brown&#x27;s website include 10199 Chariklo, and 2060 Chiron.

== Orbits ==

=== Distribution ===
The diagram illustrates the orbits of known centaurs in relation to the orbits of the planets. For selected objects, the eccentricity of the orbits is represented by red segments (extending from perihelion to aphelion).

The orbits of centaurs show a wide range of eccentricity, from highly eccentric (Pholus, Asbolus, Amycus, Nessus) to more circular (Chariklo and the Saturn-crossers Thereus and Okyrhoe).

To illustrate the range of the orbits&#x27; parameters, the diagram shows a few objects with very unusual orbits, plotted in yellow :
* (Apollo asteroid) follows an extremely eccentric orbit (), leading it from inside Earth&#x27;s orbit (0.94 AU) to well beyond Neptune ()
* follows a quasi-circular orbit ()
* has the lowest inclination ().
* is one of a small proportion of centaurs with an extreme prograde inclination (). It follows such a highly inclined orbit (79°) that, while it crosses from the distance of the asteroid belt from the Sun to past the distance of Saturn, if its orbit is projected onto the plane of Jupiter&#x27;s orbit, it does not even go out as far as Jupiter.

Over a dozen known centaurs follow retrograde orbits. Their inclinations range from modest (&quot;e.g&quot;., 160° for Dioretsa) to extreme (; &quot;e.g&quot;. 105° for ).
Seventeen of these high-inclination, retrograde centaurs were controversially claimed to have an interstellar origin.

=== Changing orbits ===
Because the centaurs are not protected by orbital resonances, their orbits are unstable within a timescale of 106–107 years. For example, 55576 Amycus is in an unstable orbit near the 3:4 resonance of Uranus. Dynamical studies of their orbits indicate that being a centaur is probably an intermediate orbital state of objects transitioning from the Kuiper belt to the Jupiter family of short-period comets. (679997) 2023 RB will have its orbit notably changed by a close approach to Saturn in 2201.

Objects may be perturbed from the Kuiper belt, whereupon they become Neptune-crossing and interact gravitationally with that planet (see theories of origin). They then become classed as centaurs, but their orbits are chaotic, evolving relatively rapidly as the centaur makes repeated close approaches to one or more of the outer planets. Some centaurs will evolve into Jupiter-crossing orbits whereupon their perihelia may become reduced into the inner Solar System and they may be reclassified as active comets in the Jupiter family if they display cometary activity. Centaurs will thus ultimately collide with the Sun or a planet or else they may be ejected into interstellar space after a close approach to one of the planets, particularly Jupiter.

== Physical characteristics ==
Compared to dwarf planets and asteroids, the relatively small size and distance of centaurs precludes remote observation of surfaces, but colour indices and spectra can provide clues about surface composition and insight into the origin of the bodies.

=== Colours ===
The colours of centaurs are very diverse, which challenges any simple model of surface composition. In the side-diagram, the colour indices are measures of apparent magnitude of an object through blue (B), visible (V) (i.e. green-yellow) and red (R) filters. The diagram illustrates these differences (in exaggerated colours) for all centaurs with known colour indices. For reference, two moons: Triton and Phoebe, and planet Mars are plotted (yellow labels, size not to scale).

Centaurs appear to be grouped into two classes:
* very red – for example 5145 Pholus
* blue (or blue-grey, according to some authors) – for example 2060 Chiron or 

There are numerous theories to explain this colour difference, but they can be broadly divided into two categories:
*The colour difference results from a difference in the origin and/or composition of the centaur (see origin below)
* The colour difference reflects a different level of space-weathering from radiation and/or cometary activity.

As examples of the second category, the reddish colour of Pholus has been explained as a possible mantle of irradiated red organics, whereas Chiron has instead had its ice exposed due to its periodic cometary activity, giving it a blue/grey index. The correlation with activity and color is not certain, however, as the active centaurs span the range of colors from blue (Chiron) to red (166P/NEAT). Alternatively, Pholus may have been only recently expelled from the Kuiper belt, so that surface transformation processes have not yet taken place.

Delsanti et al. suggest multiple competing processes: reddening by the radiation, and blushing by collisions.

=== Spectra ===
The interpretation of spectra is often ambiguous, related to particle sizes and other factors, but the spectra offer an insight into surface composition. As with the colours, the observed spectra can fit a number of models of the surface.

Water ice signatures have been confirmed on a number of centaurs (including 2060 Chiron, 10199 Chariklo and 5145 Pholus). In addition to the water ice signature, a number of other models have been put forward:
*Chariklo&#x27;s surface has been suggested to be a mixture of tholins (like those detected on Titan and Triton) with amorphous carbon.
*Pholus has been suggested to be covered by a mixture of Titan-like tholins, carbon black, olivine and methanol ice.
*The surface of 52872 Okyrhoe has been suggested to be a mixture of kerogens, olivines and a small percentage of water ice.
*8405 Asbolus has been suggested to be a mixture of 15% Triton-like tholins, 8% Titan-like tholin, 37% amorphous carbon and 40% ice tholin.
Chiron appears to be the most complex. The spectra observed vary depending on the period of the observation. Water ice signature was detected during a period of low activity and disappeared during high activity.

===Similarities to comets===

Observations of Chiron in 1988 and 1989 near its perihelion found it to display a coma (a cloud of gas and dust evaporating from its surface). It is thus now officially classified as both a minor planet and a comet, although it is far larger than a typical comet and there is some lingering controversy. Other centaurs are being monitored for comet-like activity: so far two, 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT have shown such behavior. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, and so is classified as a comet, though its orbit is that of a centaur. 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but recently became active, and so it too is now classified as both a comet and an asteroid. Overall, there are ~30 centaurs for which activity has been detected, with the active population biased toward objects with smaller perihelion distances.

Carbon monoxide has been detected in 60558 Echeclus 
and Chiron
 in very small amounts, and the derived CO production rate was calculated to be sufficient to account for the observed coma. The calculated CO production rate from both 60558 Echeclus and Chiron is substantially lower than what is typically observed for 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, another distantly active comet often classified as a centaur.

There is no clear orbital distinction between centaurs and comets. Both 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann and 39P/Oterma have been referred to as centaurs since they have typical centaur orbits. The comet 39P/Oterma is currently inactive and was seen to be active only before it was perturbed into a centaur orbit by Jupiter in 1963. The faint comet 38P/Stephan–Oterma would probably not show a coma if it had a perihelion distance beyond Jupiter&#x27;s orbit at 5 AU. By the year 2200, comet 78P/Gehrels will probably migrate outwards into a centaur-like orbit.

===Rotational periods===
A periodogram analysis of the light-curves of these Chiron and Chariklo gives respectively the following rotational periods: 5.5±0.4~h and 7.0± 0.6~h.

===Size, density, reflectivity===
Centaurs can reach diameters up to hundreds of kilometers. The largest centaurs have diameters in excess of 300 km, and primarily reside beyond 20 AU. 

== Hypotheses of origin ==
The study of centaurs’ origins is rich in recent developments, but any conclusions are still hampered by limited physical data. Different models have been put forward for possible origin of centaurs.

Simulations indicate that the orbit of some Kuiper belt objects can be perturbed, resulting in the object&#x27;s expulsion so that it becomes a centaur. Scattered disc objects would be dynamically the best candidates (For instance, the centaurs could be part of an &quot;inner&quot; scattered disc of objects perturbed inwards from the Kuiper belt.) for such expulsions, but their colours do not fit the bicoloured nature of the centaurs. Plutinos are a class of Kuiper belt object that display a similar bicoloured nature, and there are suggestions that not all plutinos&#x27; orbits are as stable as initially thought, due to perturbation by Pluto.

Further developments are expected with more physical data on Kuiper belt objects.

Some centaurs may have their origin in fragmentation episodes, perhaps triggered during close encounters with Jupiter. The orbits of centaurs 2020 MK4, P/2008 CL94 (Lemmon), and P/2010 TO20 (LINEAR-Grauer) pass close to that of comet 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, the first discovered centaur and close encounters are possible in which one of the objects traverses the coma of 29P when active.

At least one centaur, 2013 VZ70, might have an origin among Saturn&#x27;s irregular moon population via impact, fragmentation, or tidal disruption.

<text>Until independence in 1975, [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] had few ties abroad except those that passed through Portugal. Following independence, the new government sought to expand its diplomatic relationships. A common language, tradition, and colonial legacy have led to close collaboration between São Tomé and other ex-Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Angola. São Toméan relations with other African countries in the region, such as Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, are also good. In December 2000, São Tomé signed the African Union treaty; it was later ratified by the National Assembly.

The São Toméan government has generally maintained a foreign policy based on nonalignment and cooperation with any country willing to assist in its economic development. In recent years, it has also increasingly emphasized ties to the United States and western Europe.

<text>Capricorn One is a 1977 thriller film in which a reporter discovers that a supposed Mars landing by a crewed mission to the planet has been faked via a conspiracy involving the government and—under duress—the crew themselves. It was written and directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment. It stars Elliott Gould as the reporter, and James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O. J. Simpson as the astronauts. Hal Holbrook plays a senior NASA official who goes along with governmental and corporate interests and helps to fake the mission. The music score was created by Jerry Goldsmith.

==Plot==
Capricorn One—the first crewed mission to Mars—is on the launch pad. Just before liftoff, astronauts Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis, and John Walker are suddenly removed from the spacecraft. Bewildered, they are flown to an abandoned military base in the desert. The launch proceeds on schedule, with the public unaware the spacecraft is empty.

At the base, NASA official James Kelloway informs the astronauts that a faulty life-support system would have killed them in-flight. He says they must help counterfeit the televised footage during the flight to and from Mars. Another failed space mission would result in NASA&#x27;s funding being cut and private contractors losing millions in profits. Kelloway threatens their families to force their cooperation.

The astronauts remain captive during the flight and appear to be filmed after landing on Mars, although they are actually inside a makeshift TV studio at the base. At the command center, only a few officials know about the conspiracy until an alert technician, Elliot Whitter, notices that ground control receives the crew&#x27;s televised transmissions before the spacecraft telemetry arrives. Whitter reports this to his supervisors, including Kelloway, but is told it is due to a faulty workstation. Whitter partially shares his concerns with a TV journalist friend, Robert Caulfield. Whitter suddenly vanishes, and when Caulfield goes to Whitter&#x27;s apartment the next day, he discovers someone else living there and that all evidence of Whitter&#x27;s recent life has been erased. As Caulfield investigates, several attempts are made on his life.

Upon returning to Earth, the empty spacecraft burns up during atmospheric reentry due to a faulty heat shield, which would have killed the astronauts had they been on board. The astronauts realize officials will need to kill them to keep the hoax a secret. They escape in a small jet which quickly runs out of fuel, forcing a crash-landing in the desert. They split up on foot to increase their chances of finding help and exposing the plot. Kelloway sends helicopters after them. Willis and Walker are found, while Brubaker evades capture.

Caulfield interviews Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;widow&quot;, Kay, after reviewing a televised conversation between the astronauts and their wives. Kay Brubaker had seemed confused when her husband mentioned their last family vacation. She explains that the family had actually gone to a different location, where a western movie was being filmed. Brubaker was intrigued by how special effects and technology made it seem real.

Caulfield believes Brubaker would never make such a mistake and may have been sending his wife a message. Caulfield goes to the deserted western movie set and is shot at. As he investigates further, federal agents break into his home, arresting him for possessing cocaine that they planted there. His exasperated boss bails Caulfield out, then fires him.

A reporter friend tells Caulfield about an abandoned military base located 300 miles (480 km) from Houston. The base is deserted, but Caulfield finds Brubaker&#x27;s necklace and medallion and concludes the astronauts were there. Caulfield hires a crop-dusting pilot named Albain to search the desert. They spot and follow two helicopters to a closed isolated gas station where Brubaker is hiding. They rescue him as he attempts to escape his pursuers. The helicopters chase their plane through a canyon but crash when Albain blinds them with crop spray.

Ultimately, Caulfield and Brubaker arrive at the astronauts&#x27; memorial service, where Kelloway and Kay Brubaker see them and live network TV coverage exposes the truth. The audience is left to imagine the fallout.

==Production==
===Development===
Peter Hyams began thinking about a film of a space hoax while working on broadcasts of the Apollo program missions for CBS. He later reflected regarding the Apollo 11 Moon landing, &quot;There was one event of really enormous importance that had almost no witnesses. And the only verification we have ... came from a TV camera.&quot;

He later elaborated, in a 2014 interview with UK film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;:
Whenever there was something on the news about a [space flight], they would cut to a studio in St. Louis where there was a simulation of what was going on. I grew up in the generation where my parents basically believed if it was in the newspaper it was true. That turned out to be bullshit. My generation was brought up to believe television was true, and that was bullshit too. So I was watching these simulations and I wondered what would happen if someone faked a whole story.

Hyams wrote the script in 1972 but no one wanted to make it. He says interest in the script was re-activated by the Watergate Scandal. He approached producer Paul Lazarus. Hyams and Lazarus had a meeting with Lew Grade, head of production company ITC Entertainment who had recently moved into film production with &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;. Grade agreed to make the film after only five minutes. The budget was $4.8 million.

Grade announced the film in October 1975 as a part of a slate of ten films he intended to make over the next 12 months, including &quot;The Domino Principle&quot;, &quot;Action - Clear the Fast Lanes&quot; and &quot;Juarez&quot;. The last two were ultimately not made.

To stay within the budget, NASA&#x27;s co-operation was needed. Lazarus had a good relationship with the space agency from &quot;Futureworld&quot;. The filmmakers were thus able to obtain government equipment as props, including a prototype Apollo Lunar Module, despite the story&#x27;s negative portrayal of the space agency.

In September 1976, it was announced the cast would include Elliott Gould, O. J. Simpson, James Brolin, Brenda Vaccaro, and Candice Bergen. The presence of Brolin and Simpson in the cast helped secure a presale to NBC. Ultimately Bergen pulled out and was replaced by Karen Black.

===Shooting===
Filming started in January 1977. Shooting locations included Cinema Center Films in Studio City, and Red Rock Canyon State Park.

Hyams later joked, &quot;O. J. Simpson was in it, and Robert Blake was in &quot;Busting&quot; [Hyams&#x27; first feature]. I&#x27;ve said many times: Some people have AFI Lifetime Achievement awards; some people have multiple Oscars; my bit of trivia is that I&#x27;ve made films with two leading men who were subsequently tried for the first-degree murder of their wives.&quot;

==Release==
The film originally was scheduled to debut in the United States in February 1978, but good preview screenings and delays in &quot;Superman&quot; caused it to move to May. &quot;Capricorn One&quot; became the year&#x27;s most-successful independent film.

Hyams later said:
In Japan and the UK, a version with a running time of 129 minutes was released theatrically, with additional scenes such as the docking of the spacecraft during the Mars landing, and with different cuts of detail. However, the rights company (ITC Entertainment) has since taken the position that the final version of &quot;Capricorn One&quot; is the 123-minute version currently in circulation, and that the 129-minute version no longer exists. Therefore, only the 123-minute version is currently distributed in Japan and the UK. However, in 2019, film material from the 129-minute version was discovered at the National Film Archive of Japan, so remastered material was created based on this film and released as &quot;bonus content&quot; only on Japanese Blu-ray, after obtaining permission from the rights company.

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an expensive, stylistically bankrupt suspense melodrama&quot; while describing much of its screenplay as &quot;humorless comic-strip stuff.&quot; Conversely, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;a surprisingly good thriller&quot; with a runaway car sequence &quot;that provides some of the best action footage I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; faulted the film&#x27;s &quot;underdeveloped script&quot; and &quot;scattershot casting&quot;, calling the duo of Savalas and Gould &quot;a bullseye&quot; but Waterston and Simpson lacking in &quot;group chemistry&quot;.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought the beginning of the film was the best part, and what follows &quot;is wildly uneven, veering between the serious and the merely silly, and ending up likely to please only the least demanding.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Capricorn One&quot; harks back to the old adventure serials, but Hyams doesn&#x27;t have remotely enough wit or technique to achieve a fresh stylization of vintage formulas.&quot;

Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated &quot;Somewhere within this flabby, overproduced fantasy about space-age double-dealing and Watergate-type sleuthing lives a smaller, tighter film—and a much wittier satire on the space program and technologies, like Hollywood, designed to deceive and manipulate. The trouble is that this more ideal version is not really struggling to get out but wallowing complacently in the limitless excess that has become the Lew Grade trademark.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMovie critic Donald Guarisco wrote: &quot;This agreeable high-concept effort is one of Peter Hyams&#x27; most accomplished films. The script&#x27;s conspiracy-theory premise requires a major suspension of disbelief, but Hyams makes it worthwhile for those willing to make that leap.&quot;

&quot;Capricorn One&quot; holds a 65% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A string of questionable plot contrivances threaten to bury its story, but &quot;Capricorn One&quot; manages to unfurl an amusing, sharply cynical conspiracy yarn.&quot;

==Other media==

Two novelizations of the film were written and published by separate authors. The first was written by Ken Follett (under the pseudonym Bernard L. Ross) and published in the United Kingdom; the other was written by Ron Goulart and published in the United States.

The Follett novel is notable for giving Robert Caulfield more development than the movie does, including giving him something of a relationship with CBS reporter Judy Drinkwater (who has more time in the book than in the movie) and ending the book with him and Judy. The story saves his career and results in his being employed by CBS.

Clips from the faked Mars landing scenes have been used for illustration purposes in various Moon landing hoax conspiracy documentaries, notably the Fox TV show &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon&quot; and Bart Sibrel&#x27;s film &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon&quot; (2001). The latter also features a still shot from the hoax scene on the DVD&#x27;s front cover.

In 2020–2021, &quot;Capricorn One&quot; was used as part of an internet prank. A viral video purported to be released by WikiLeaks was uploaded to BitChute, Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms and blogs with a title: &quot;Wikileaks releases - Moon landing cut scene - filmed in Nevada desert&quot;. In fact, WikiLeaks released no such video. Close inspection revealed this prank video to be made using clips from &quot;Capricorn One&quot; and even various film reels shot on the set of &quot;Capricorn One&quot;, which were then cut and spliced with stock footage from the Apollo missions and training sessions.

<doc id="172279" wikidata="Q329016" url="?curid=172279" title="Northern Low Saxon">
<text>Northern Low Saxon (in Standard High German: &#x27;, also&#x27;, lit. &quot;North(ern) Low Saxon/German&quot;; in Standard Dutch: &quot;&quot;) is a subgroup of Low Saxon dialects of Low German. As such, it covers a great part of the West Low German-speaking areas of northern Germany, with the exception of the border regions where South Low Saxon (Eastphalian and Westphalian) is spoken, and Gronings dialect in the Netherlands.

==Dialects==
Northern Low Saxon can be divided into Holsteinian (), Schleswigian (), East Frisian Low Saxon, Dithmarsch (), North Hanoveranian (), Emslandish (), and Oldenburgish () in Germany, with additional dialects in the Netherlands such as Gronings.

&quot; is spoken in Holstein, the southern part of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, in Dithmarschen, around Neumünster, Rendsburg, Kiel and Lübeck.

&quot; () is spoken in Schleswig, which is divided between Germany and Denmark. It is mainly based on a South Jutlandic substrate. Therefore, it has some notable differences in pronunciation and grammar with its southern neighbour dialects. The dialects on the west coast of Schleswig (Nordfriesland district) and some islands show some North Frisian influences.

&quot;&quot; is spoken around the city of Oldenburg. It is limited to Germany. The main difference between it and East Frisian Low Saxon, which is spoken in the Frisian parts of Lower Saxony, is the lack of an East Frisian substrate. &quot;Oldenburgisch&quot; is spoken in the city of Bremen as &quot;Bremian&quot;, which is the only capital where &quot;Oldenburgisch&quot; is spoken.

c) 
* Dithmarsch
* Schleswigsch / Schleswigian
* Holsteinisch / Holsteinian
* Oldenburgisch
* Emsländisch
* Nordhannoversch

Emsländisch and Oldenburgisch are also grouped together as &quot;Emsländisch-Oldenburgisch&quot;, while Bremen and Hamburg lie in the area of Nordhannoversch (in a broader sense).

==Characteristics==
The most obvious common character in grammar is the forming of the perfect participle. It is formed without a prefix, as in all North Germanic languages, as well as English and Frisian, but unlike standard German, Dutch and some dialects of Westphalian and Eastphalian Low Saxon:
*&quot;gahn&quot; (to go): &quot;Ik bün&quot; gahn (I have gone/I went), Standard German: &quot;gehen&quot;; &quot;ich bin&quot; gegangen/&quot;ich&quot; ging
*&quot;seilen&quot; (to sail): &quot;He hett&quot; seilt (He (has) sailed), Standard German: &quot;segeln&quot;; &quot;er ist&quot; gesegelt/&quot;er&quot; segelte
*&quot;kopen&quot; (to buy): &quot;Wi harrn&quot; köfft (We had bought), Standard German: &quot;kaufen&quot;; &quot;wir haben&quot; gekauft/&quot;wir &quot; kauften
*&quot;kamen&quot; (to come): &quot;Ji sünd&quot; kamen (You (all) have come/You came), Standard German: &quot;kommen&quot;; &quot;ihr seid&quot; gekommen/&quot;ihr&quot; kamt
*&quot;eten&quot; (to eat): &quot;Se hebbt&quot; eten (They have eaten/They ate), Standard German: &quot;essen&quot;; &quot;sie haben&quot; gegessen/&quot;sie&quot; aßen

The diminutive (&quot;-je&quot;) (Dutch and East Frisian Low Saxon &quot;-tje&quot;, Eastphalian &quot;-ke&quot;, High German &quot;-chen&quot;, Alemannic &quot;-le&quot;, &quot;li&quot;) is hardly used. Some examples are &quot;Buscherumpje&quot;, a fisherman&#x27;s shirt, or &quot;lüttje&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;lütt&quot;, little. Instead the adjective &quot;lütt&quot; is used, e.g. &quot;dat lütte Huus&quot;, &quot;de lütte Deern&quot;, &quot;de lütte Jung&quot;.

There are a lot of special characteristics in the vocabulary, too, but they are shared partly with other languages and dialects, e.g.:
*Personal pronouns: &quot;ik&quot; (like Dutch ik, standard German form &quot;ich&quot;), &quot;du&quot; (like German Du, standard German form &quot;du&quot;), &quot;he&quot; (like Dutch hij, standard German form &quot;er&quot;), &quot;se&quot; (like Dutch zij, standard German form &quot;sie&quot;), &quot;dat&quot; (Dutch dat, standard German form &quot;es/das&quot;), &quot;wi&quot; , &quot;ji&quot; (similar to English ye, Dutch jij, standard German forms &quot;wir&quot;, &quot;ihr&quot;), &quot;se&quot; (standard German form &quot;sie&quot;).
*Interrogatives (English/High German): &quot;wo&quot; , &quot;woans&quot; (how/&quot;wie&quot;), &quot;wo laat&quot; (how late/&quot;wie spät&quot;), &quot;wokeen&quot; (who/&quot;wer&quot;), &quot;woneem&quot; (where/&quot;wo&quot;), &quot;wokeen sien&quot; / &quot;wen sien&quot; (whose/&quot;wessen&quot;)
*Adverbs (English/High German): &quot;laat&quot; (late/&quot;spät&quot;), &quot;gau&quot; (fast/&quot;schnell&quot;), &quot;suutje&quot; (slowly, carefully/&quot;langsam&quot;, &quot;vorsichtig&quot;, from Dutch &quot;zoetjes&quot; ‘nice and easy’, adverbial diminutive of &quot;zoet&quot; ‘sweet’), &quot;vigeliensch&quot; (difficult, tricky/&quot;schwierig&quot;)
*Prepositions (English/High German): &quot;bi&quot; (by, at/&quot;bei&quot;), &quot;achter&quot; (behind/&quot;hinter&quot;), &quot;vör&quot; (before, in front of/&quot;vor&quot;), &quot;blangen&quot; (beside, next to, alongside/&quot;neben&quot;), &quot;twüschen&quot; (betwixt, between/&quot;zwischen&quot;), &quot;mang&quot;, &quot;mank&quot; (among/&quot;unter&quot;)

<text>Hamburg German, also known as Hamburg dialect or Hamburger dialect (natively , ), is a group of Northern Low Saxon varieties spoken in Hamburg, Germany. Occasionally, the term &quot;Hamburgisch&quot; is also used for Hamburg &quot;Missingsch&quot;, a variety of standard German with Low Saxon substrates. These are urban dialects that have absorbed numerous English and Dutch loanwords, for instance &quot;Törn&quot; &#x27;trip&#x27; (&lt; &quot;turn&quot;) and &quot;suutje&quot; &#x27;gently&#x27; (&lt; Dutch ). 

Hamburg&#x27;s name is pronounced in these dialects, with a &quot;ch&quot; similar to that in the standard German words &quot;ich&quot; or &quot;Milch&quot; (&quot;ich-Laut&quot;). Typical of the Hamburg dialects and other Lower Elbe dialects is the pronunciation (and &quot;eu&quot; spelling) for the diphthong (written &quot;öö&quot;, &quot;öh&quot; or &quot;ö&quot;), e.g.:

However, as in most other Low Saxon dialects, the long monophthong is pronounced (as in French &quot;peu&quot;), for instance &quot;Kööm&quot; ~ &quot;Kœm&quot; &#x27;caraway&#x27;.

The Low Saxon language in Hamburg is divided in several subdialects, namely:
* Finkwarder Platt
* Olwarder Platt
* Veerlanner Platt (with many sub-sub-dialects)
* Barmbeker Platt.

The Hamborger Veermaster is a famous sea shanty sung in the regional dialect. The all-purpose greeting &quot;moin&quot; is universally used in Hamburg.

The language area can be further divided into North-Markish (Stendal, Wittenberge, Prenzlau) and Middle-Markish (Brandenburg an der Havel).

The modern South-Markish (also called South Brandenburgian) dialects of southern Brandenburg and Berlin, however, are not Low German but Central German dialects. With the development of the Berlin metropolitan area, the original Low German Brandenburgish of Berlin developed into Berlinerisch, the local High German dialects, which today are considered an East Central German subgroup. The spread of High German into the Brandenburgish language area is an ongoing process.

<text>In fluid dynamics, the drag coefficient (commonly denoted as: formula_1, formula_2 or formula_3) is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the drag equation in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less aerodynamic or hydrodynamic drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.

The drag coefficient of any object comprises the effects of the two basic contributors to fluid dynamic drag: skin friction and form drag. The drag coefficient of a lifting airfoil or hydrofoil also includes the effects of lift-induced drag. The drag coefficient of a complete structure such as an aircraft also includes the effects of interference drag.

== Definition ==

The drag coefficient formula_4 is defined as

formula_5

where:
* formula_6 is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity;
* formula_7 is the mass density of the fluid;
* formula_8 is the flow speed of the object relative to the fluid;
* formula_9 is the reference area

The reference area depends on what type of drag coefficient is being measured. For automobiles and many other objects, the reference area is the projected frontal area of the vehicle. This may not necessarily be the cross-sectional area of the vehicle, depending on where the cross-section is taken. For example, for a sphere formula_10 (note this is not the surface area = formula_11).

For airfoils, the reference area is the nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower than for a car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.

Airships and some bodies of revolution use the volumetric drag coefficient, in which the reference area is the square of the cube root of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.

Two objects having the same reference area moving at the same speed through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.

As a caution, note that although the above is the conventional definition for the drag coefficient, there are other definitions that one may encounter in the literature. The reason for this is that the conventional definition makes the most sense when one is in the Newton regime, such as what happens at high Reynolds number, where it makes sense to scale the drag to the momentum flux into the frontal area of the object. But, there are other flow regimes. In particular at very low Reynolds number, it is more natural to write the drag force as being proportional to a drag coefficient multiplied by the speed of the object (rather than the square of the speed of the object). An example of such a regime is the study of the mobility of aerosol particulates, such as smoke particles. This leads to a different formal definition of the &quot;drag coefficient,&quot; of course.

== Cauchy momentum equation ==
In the non dimensional form of the Cauchy momentum equation, the skin drag coefficient or skin friction coefficient is referred to the transversal area (the area normal to the drag force, so the coefficient is locally defined as:

formula_12

where:
* formula_13 is the local shear stress, which is by definition the stress component in the direction of the local flow velocity;
* formula_14 is the local dynamic pressure of the fluid
* formula_7 is the local mass density of the fluid;
* formula_8 is the local flow speed of the fluid

== Background ==

The drag equation

:formula_17

is essentially a statement that the drag force on any object is proportional to the density of the fluid and proportional to the square of the relative flow speed between the object and the fluid. The factor of formula_18 comes from the dynamic pressure of the fluid, which is equal to the kinetic energy density.

The value of formula_4 is not a constant but varies as a function of flow speed, flow direction, object position, object size, fluid density and fluid viscosity. Speed, kinematic viscosity and a characteristic length scale of the object are incorporated into a dimensionless quantity called the Reynolds number formula_20. formula_4 is thus a function of formula_20. In a compressible flow, the speed of sound is relevant, and formula_4 is also a function of Mach number formula_24.

For certain body shapes, the drag coefficient formula_4 only depends on the Reynolds number formula_20, Mach number formula_24 and the direction of the flow. For low Mach number formula_24, the drag coefficient is independent of Mach number. Also, the variation with Reynolds number formula_20 within a practical range of interest is usually small, while for cars at highway speed and aircraft at cruising speed, the incoming flow direction is also more-or-less the same. Therefore, the drag coefficient formula_4 can often be treated as a constant.

For a streamlined body to achieve a low drag coefficient, the boundary layer around the body must remain attached to the surface of the body for as long as possible, causing the wake to be narrow. A high &quot;form drag&quot; results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower viscosities contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.
For other objects, such as small particles, one can no longer consider that the drag coefficient formula_4 is constant, but certainly is a function of Reynolds number.
At a low Reynolds number, the flow around the object does not transition to turbulent but remains laminar, even up to the point at which it separates from the surface of the object. At very low Reynolds numbers, without flow separation, the drag force formula_32 is proportional to formula_33 instead of formula_34; for a sphere this is known as Stokes&#x27; law. The Reynolds number will be low for small objects, low velocities, and high viscosity fluids.

A formula_4 equal to 1 would be obtained in a case where all of the fluid approaching the object is brought to rest, building up stagnation pressure over the whole front surface. The top figure shows a flat plate with the fluid coming from the right and stopping at the plate. The graph to the left of it shows equal pressure across the surface. In a real flat plate, the fluid must turn around the sides, and full stagnation pressure is found only at the center, dropping off toward the edges as in the lower figure and graph. Only considering the front side, the formula_4 of a real flat plate would be less than 1; except that there will be suction on the backside: a negative pressure (relative to ambient). The overall formula_4 of a real square flat plate perpendicular to the flow is often given as 1.17. Flow patterns and therefore formula_4 for some shapes can change with the Reynolds number and the roughness of the surfaces.
== Drag coefficient examples ==

=== General ===
In general, formula_4 is not an absolute constant for a given body shape. It varies with the speed of airflow (or more generally with Reynolds number formula_20). A smooth sphere, for example, has a formula_4 that varies from high values for laminar flow to 0.47 for turbulent flow. Although the drag coefficient decreases with increasing formula_20, the drag force increases.

=== Aircraft ===
As noted above, aircraft use their wing area as the reference area when computing formula_4, while automobiles (and many other objects) use projected frontal area; thus, coefficients are not directly comparable between these classes of vehicles. In the aerospace industry, the drag coefficient is sometimes expressed in drag counts where 1 drag count = 0.0001 of a formula_4.

=== Automobile ===
== Blunt and streamlined body flows ==

=== Concept ===
The force between a fluid and a body, when there is relative motion, can only be transmitted by normal pressure and tangential friction stresses. So, for the whole body, the drag part of the force, which is in-line with the approaching fluid motion, is composed of frictional drag (viscous drag) and pressure drag (form drag). The total drag and component drag forces can be related as follows:

formula_45

where:
*formula_9 is the planform area of the body,
*formula_47 is the wet surface of the body,
*formula_48 is the pressure drag coefficient,
*formula_49 is the friction drag coefficient,
*formula_50 is the unit vector in the direction of the shear stress acting on the body surface d&quot;S&quot;,
*formula_51 is the unit vector in the direction perpendicular to the body surface d&quot;S&quot;, pointing from the fluid to the solid,
*formula_52 magnitude of the shear stress acting on the body surface d&quot;S&quot;,
*formula_53 is the pressure far away from the body (note that this constant does not affect the final result),
*formula_54 is pressure at surface d&quot;S&quot;,
*formula_55 is the unit vector in direction of free stream flow

Therefore, when the drag is dominated by a frictional component, the body is called a streamlined body; whereas in the case of dominant pressure drag, the body is called a blunt or bluff body. Thus, the shape of the body and the angle of attack determine the type of drag. For example, an airfoil is considered as a body with a small angle of attack by the fluid flowing across it. This means that it has attached boundary layers, which produce much less pressure drag.

The wake produced is very small and drag is dominated by the friction component. Therefore, such a body (here an airfoil) is described as streamlined, whereas for bodies with fluid flow at high angles of attack, boundary layer separation takes place. This mainly occurs due to adverse pressure gradients at the top and rear parts of an airfoil.

Due to this, wake formation takes place, which consequently leads to eddy formation and pressure loss due to pressure drag. In such situations, the airfoil is stalled and has higher pressure drag than friction drag. In this case, the body is described as a blunt body.

A streamlined body looks like a fish (tuna), Oropesa, etc. or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with high angle of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a streamlined body will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag is dominated by the pressure component in the wake region at high Reynolds number.

To reduce this drag, either the flow separation could be reduced or the surface area in contact with the fluid could be reduced (to reduce friction drag). This reduction is necessary in devices like cars, bicycle, etc. to avoid vibration and noise production.

<doc id="172293" wikidata="Q482366" url="?curid=172293" title="An American Family">
<text>An American Family is an American television documentary series that followed the life of a California family in the early 1970s. Widely referred to as the first example of an American reality TV show, the series drew millions of weekly viewers, who were drawn to a story that seemed to shatter the rosy façade of upper-middle-class suburbia. It also became a lightning rod for discussion about the precarious state of the American family in the early 1970s. &quot;An American Family&quot; ranks #32 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot; list.

== Production and story ==
Created by Craig Gilbert, &quot;An American Family&quot; examined the daily trials and tribulations of the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California. Researching subjects for the series, Gilbert interviewed about 24 families before he settled on the Louds—a mother, father, and five &quot;telegenic&quot; children who owned a large house, multiple cars, and a swimming pool. Shooting began in May 1971, and Gilbert and his film crew, which included the cinematographer Alan Raymond and his wife Susan Raymond who handled sound, spent the next seven months filming the Louds.

The final product, edited down from 300 hours of 16-millimeter footage, was &quot;An American Family&quot;, which aired in 1973 as 12 weekly one-hour episodes on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The film was presented in fly-on-the-wall style with very limited narration.

The story that unfolded of the Louds, who at the outset of the series seemed to epitomize the American dream, showed a married couple on the verge of divorce and children, ranging from 14 to 20 years old, in high and low moments. The &quot;toothpaste-bright affluence, California-style&quot; family, as described in 1973 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, turned out to be &quot;comfortably ordinary, sadly familiar, the kind of family most white middle-class Americans can identify with.&quot;

The series was popular, earning more than 10 million viewers a week. It also sparked controversy and drove conversation in national magazines and television talk shows about the state of the American family.

The intense interest in the Louds, wrote Dennis Lim in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2011, &quot;had much to do with their lives seeming to fall apart as America watched.&quot;

== The Loud family ==
The popularity of the series, which was viewed by 10 million Americans per week, gave the Louds a form of celebrity. Family members profiled were:

* Bill Loud (1921–2018)
* Pat Loud (1926–2021)
* Lance Loud (1951–2001)
* Kevin Robert Loud (born 1953)
* Grant Loud (born 1954)
* Delilah Ann Loud (born 1955)
* Michelle Loud (born 1957)

Lance Loud is credited as the first continuing character on television who was openly gay, and he subsequently became an icon within the LGBT community. He later became a columnist for the national LGBT news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;. Lance, who had been a pen pal of Andy Warhol, himself known for his commentary on celebrity, said the series fulfilled “the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are.”

One of the more notable moments of the series was when, after 21 years of marriage, Pat asked Bill for a divorce and to leave the house. Pat&#x27;s saying to her husband, &quot;You know there&#x27;s a problem&quot; – with Bill&#x27;s response, &quot;What&#x27;s your problem?&quot; – was chosen as one of the Top 100 Television Moments by &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

The series drew intense interest, millions of viewers, and considerable controversy. The family was featured in &quot;Newsweek&quot; on March 12, 1973, in the article &quot;The Broken Family&quot;.

In 2003, PBS broadcast the show &quot;Lance Loud!: A Death in an American Family,&quot; which was filmed in 2001. Visiting the same family again at the invitation of Lance before his death, the family members participated in the documentary, with the exception of Grant. Lance was 50 years old, had gone through 20 years of addiction to crystal meth, and was HIV positive. He died of liver failure caused by a hepatitis C and HIV co-infection that year. The show was billed by PBS as the final episode of &quot;An American Family&quot;.

Subsequent to the showing of &quot;A Death in an American Family&quot;, Pat and Bill Loud moved back in together, granting one of Lance&#x27;s last wishes. They lived very close to three of their four surviving children—Grant, Michelle and Delilah—and kept in close contact with Kevin and his family, who lived in Arizona. In 2012, Pat Loud released a book about her son&#x27;s life called &quot;Lance Out Loud&quot;. Bill died in July 2018. Pat Loud died in her sleep from natural causes on January 10, 2021, at age 94.

==Critical response==
According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2011, &quot;critical and popular reaction varied,&quot; and it suggested the series reflected America in a &quot;counterculture hangover.&quot;

Some critics praised the raw honesty of the series. The anthropologist Margaret Mead called it &quot;an extraordinary series&quot; and said that &quot;nothing like it has ever been done.&quot; Mead also proclaimed that &quot;An American Family&quot; was &quot;as new and significant as the invention of drama or the novel.” Others were put off, viewing the Louds as a sign of the nuclear family&#x27;s demise.

Jean Baudrillard, a French philosopher and sociologist, described &quot;An American Family&quot; as a symptom of the way TV has changed our relationship with reality itself.

The Louds&#x27; response to the series was positive at first, it seemed. Shortly after filming wrapped, Pat Loud wrote in a letter to Gilbert: “I think you’ve handled the film with as much kindness as is possible and still remained honest. I am, in short, simply astounded, enormously pleased and very proud.” But the Louds&#x27; feelings soon soured. They began to vocalize criticism of Gilbert&#x27;s emphasis on the negative parts of their lives. In an appearance on Th&quot;e Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1973, Pat Loud said the series “makes us look like a bunch of freaks and monsters.&quot;

In 1988, Gilbert reflected on the legacy, stating, “I stand behind every frame of that series, yet I understand why it made so many people uncomfortable. This was a film about all of us. About how we’re all trying, and usually failing, to make sense out of life.&quot;

A 1973 review by John J. O&#x27;Conner in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; called it &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; and &quot;unusually sensitive,&quot; and maintained: &quot;It might be challenged and attacked. It cannot be dismissed.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
&quot;An American Family&quot; is widely credited with ushering in the era of reality television. In 2013, Gilbert criticized the modern-day genre of reality television, saying, &quot;What they’re doing is they’re using real people, but they’re scripting the shows.&quot; He called reality TV &quot;basically cheap television.&quot;

The series inspired numerous TV shows, films, and documentaries.

In 1974, the BBC made its own similar program, called &quot;The Family&quot;. The program consisted of 12 half-hour episodes, showing the daily lives and concerns of the working-class Wilkins family, of Reading, Berkshire, England.

In 1978, in a skit called &quot;The Loud Family,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; portrayed a family whose members shouted at the top of their lungs, even during intimate moments.

The series inspired a 1977 story arc in the satirical soap opera &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; in which a television crew for &quot;The David Susskind Show&quot; documents the daily life of the titular character as the &quot;typical American consumer housewife&quot;.

In 1979, Albert Brooks spoofed the series in his film &quot;Real Life&quot;.

In 1983, HBO broadcast &quot;An American Family Revisited: The Louds 10 Years Later&quot;.

The &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; episode &quot;The Very Loud Family&quot;, where Emma films their daily lives for a school project, is inspired by &quot;An American Family&quot;.

The 1985–88 mockumentary series of TV films &quot;The History of White People in America&quot; and &quot;Portrait of a White Marriage&quot; parody the series in following the lives of a dysfunctional white suburban family led by Fred Willard and Mary Kay Place.

The series inspired the MTV reality television series &quot;The Real World&quot;.

Jonathan Dayton, co-director of the 2006 film &quot;Little Miss Sunshine,&quot; says the film was inspired in part by &quot;An American Family&quot;.

In April 2011, PBS rebroadcast the entire original series in a marathon format on many of its member stations, before the release of the HBO film &quot;Cinema Verite&quot;, based on the series.

On July 7, 2011, most PBS stations presented &quot;An American Family: Anniversary Edition&quot;, a two-hour film by Alan and Susan Raymond that featured selected moments from the documentary series, in tribute to the 40 years since the series began filming in 1971. It was subsequently released on DVD.

The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard mentions the television series in his 1981 book, &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;.

== Dispute over &quot;Cinema Verite&quot; ==
The 2011 HBO film &quot;Cinema Verite,&quot; a fictional examination of the making &quot;An American Family,&quot; brought to the surface a dispute over the process of making &quot;An American Family.&quot;

The film portrays a clash between the series&#x27; creator, Gilbert (played by James Gandolfini), and the cinematographer Alan Raymond (played by Patrick Fugit). The clash depicted in the film was over the validity of the original series&#x27; &quot;cinema verite&quot; descriptor&quot;.&quot; The film suggests Gilbert &quot;may have instigated drama and may have overstepped boundaries&quot; during the filming of &quot;An American Family&quot;, including a rumored relationship between him and Pat Loud (which both parties deny).

Alan Raymond and his wife, Susan, who handled sound on &quot;An American Family,&quot; served as consultants on the HBO project, but they said they agreed with the &quot;thrust&quot; of Gilbert&#x27;s series. The Raymonds did have their criticisms. Alan said he and Susan were &quot;at odds with Craig over the treatment of the family. There were numerous confrontations where we tried to raise the question about whether the experiment was veering off course.”

Director Robert Pulcini said, &quot;Everybody remembers it a little bit differently or a lot differently depending on what you’re talking about.&quot;

Gilbert saw it differently, defending his approach this way: &quot;I didn’t script a thing. I didn’t do anything. I didn’t negotiate anything. I didn’t manipulate anything.&quot; He dismissed the HBO film as &quot;a fiction&quot; and offered that &quot;an impossible script&quot; challenged the film.

The film&#x27;s screenwriter David Seltzer defended his script, saying, &quot;The critical mass of research was my barometer for what to go with&quot;. Seltzer also consulted Pat Loud&#x27;s book when writing the script.

Gilbert and the Raymonds shared the opinion that &quot;An American Family&quot; is unfairly blamed as the progenitor of today&#x27;s reality television.

== Craig Gilbert ==
Gilbert was born in New York City; his father was a copyright lawyer who worked with songwriters including Irving Berlin. He started his film and TV career at WNET-TV, in New York. He produced documentaries about anthropologist Margaret Mead and Christy Brown, a disabled Irish artist. Daniel Day-Lewis, in preparation for his Oscar-winning role as Brown for the 1989 movie &quot;My Left Foot&quot;, consulted Gilbert. Gilbert and his wife, Suzanne Stater, separated in the early 1970s shortly before filming began (incidentally, Bill and Pat announce their separation on camera in an episode of the series). &quot;The idea for the series was something out of my own life,&quot; Gilbert said to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1973.

<doc id="172296" wikidata="Q6483460" url="?curid=172296" title="Lance Loud">
<text>Alanson Russell &quot;Lance&quot; Loud (June 26, 1951 – December 22, 2001) was an American television personality, magazine columnist, and new wave rock-n-roll performer. Loud is best known for his 1973 appearance in &quot;An American Family&quot;, a pioneer reality television series that featured his coming out, leading to his status as an icon in the gay community.

==Early life==
Alanson Russell &quot;Lance&quot; Loud was born in 1951 in La Jolla, California to William and Patricia (nee Russell) Loud. The oldest of five children, at the time of his birth, Loud&#x27;s father was in the United States Navy. Following his father&#x27;s separation from the Navy, Loud and his family spent several years living in his mother&#x27;s hometown of Eugene, Oregon. During Loud&#x27;s adolescence, he and his family moved from Oregon to Santa Barbara, California. It was here that Loud&#x27;s teen years were shaped after discovering the artistic and cultural influences of Andy Warhol, The Factory, and The Velvet Underground. Eventually, Loud became a pen pal and friend of Warhol&#x27;s.

In late 1969, Loud and his best-friend, Kristian Hoffman, drove to San Francisco to experience Haight-Ashbury and the neighborhood&#x27;s much-publicized cultural scene as well as explore the city&#x27;s gay enclaves. After leaving the Bay Area, the pair drove east to the San Joaquin Valley and Altamont Raceway Park near Tracy, California. There, they attended the now-infamous Altamont Free Concert.

==&quot;An American Family&quot;==

Loud&#x27;s fame came with &quot;An American Family&quot;, a documentary of his family&#x27;s life, which was broadcast in the U.S. on PBS in 1973, drawing 10 million viewers and causing considerable controversy. The show was based in Santa Barbara, California.

The show&#x27;s first episodes document Loud&#x27;s move to and new life in New York City. Driven by his obsession with The Velvet Underground and Warhol, Loud left Santa Barbara with his friend Kristian Hoffman. He became a regular at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and frequently attended Charles Ludlam productions at La Mama. Loud befriended both musicians and actors at each of the clubs, including Jackie Curtis and Holly Woodlawn.

Shortly after the series ended, Loud appeared on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, performing with his band called &quot;Loud&quot;. The group at that time included younger siblings Delilah, Michelle and Kevin and eventually became &quot;The Mumps&quot;. During the interview, Loud stated that he thought the show&#x27;s director, writer, filmmaker Craig Gilbert, had intentionally edited the series to make him appear obnoxious and grating.

During the course of the documentary, Loud became both a curiosity and gay icon for his homosexuality being revealed on television to a national audience. While his sexual orientation became a topic of controversy and media scrutiny after several appearances on &quot;Dick Cavett&quot; and other talk shows, the positive feedback from the gay community led Loud to embrace what he saw as an important role in the gay liberation movement. 

==The Mumps==

Loud regrouped his band, naming it &quot;The Mumps&quot;. Along with Kristian Hoffman, the band included Rob Duprey, Jay Dee Daugherty and Aaron Kiley. Daugherty and Kiley left the band early on and were replaced by Kevin Kiely and Paul Rutner.

Over the course of five years, The Mumps were booked regularly at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and CBGB, played on bills with rock and punk rock bands such as Television, Talking Heads, the Ramones, Blondie, Milk &#x27;N&#x27; Cookies, The Cramps, Cheap Trick, and Van Halen. Despite this popularity and two critically acclaimed, independent 45s, the group never landed a contract with a major record label. Two compilations of their music have been released: &quot;Fatal Charm&quot; (Eggbert Records, 1994), and a lavishly illustrated, remastered, 2-disc CD/DVD compilation, &quot;How I Saved The World&quot;, in 2005. The CD booklets contain affectionate tributes from members of the Cramps, Sparks, R.E.M., the New York Dolls, Blondie, Dramarama, the Go-Go&#x27;s, Danzig, Devo, Patti Smith Group, and the Screamers, as well as praise from Danny Fields, Jayne County, Rufus Wainwright, and Paul Reubens, helping to secure The Mumps a place in musical history.

Loud wrote a monthly column in the influential &quot;Rock Scene&quot; magazine, an early supporter of glam and the punk genre. In his columns, Loud reported on his favorite artists and covered junkets he took, such as a brief tour with Jim Dandy Mangrum of the band Black Oak Arkansas.

==Later career and family==
When Loud left music performance, he became a columnist for several national magazines, including &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, and &quot;Creem&quot;. As a journalist, Loud remained active in cultural scenes as well as giving occasional lectures on the impact of &quot;An American Family&quot; on American society at colleges around the country. He was present at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh when his teenage letters to Andy were officially entered into the Andy Warhol archive.

The Loud family was kept in the public eye through two televised PBS updates, each filmed by the original &quot;An American Family&quot; team of Alan and Susan Raymond. The last documentary, called &quot;Lance Loud! A Death in An American Family&quot;, was about Loud&#x27;s physical decline, to include his 20-year addiction to crystal meth and his struggle to survive with HIV. The documentary was shown on PBS in January 2003.

Subsequent to the showing of &quot;A Death in An American Family&quot;, Loud&#x27;s parents moved back in together, granting one of his last wishes. Loud&#x27;s mother and father lived in the same vicinity of all of their children, with the exception of Kevin, who lived outside of California. Loud&#x27;s father, Bill, died in 2018 and his mother, Pat, died in 2021.

==Death==
In 2001, Loud entered the Carl Bean hospice in Los Angeles, California, suffering from hepatitis C and the effects of HIV. While in hospice care, he wrote his final article, &quot;Musings on Mortality&quot;.

On December 22, 2001, Lance Loud died at age 50 of liver failure due to the comorbidity of hepatitis C and HIV.

Portions of Loud&#x27;s memorial gathering in the garden of Hollywood&#x27;s Chateau Marmont are included in the documentary, &quot;A Death in An American Family&quot;, including tributes from friends and family. A rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was sung by Rufus Wainwright while he was accompanied on piano by Wainwright&#x27;s mother Kate McGarrigle.

==Legacy==
In 2010, HBO Films announced that it was making &quot;Cinema Verite&quot;, a film about the making of &quot;An American Family&quot;, with Thomas Dekker cast as Lance Loud. The film had its debut showing on HBO on April 23, 2011.

In 2012, Loud&#x27;s mother, Pat, authored a book about his life titled &quot;Lance Out Loud&quot;. The book was edited by Christopher Makos and published by Glitterati Incorporated.

<doc id="172298" wikidata="Q526983" url="?curid=172298" title="Joe Doyle (politician)">
<text>Joseph Doyle (27 June 1936 – 8 August 2009) was an Irish Fine Gael politician. He served two terms as a deputy for the Dublin South-East constituency. He served variously as a member of Dublin City Council, Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, becoming Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1998 to 1999.

==Political career==
Doyle, a former sacristan in the local Roman Catholic church in Donnybrook, was first elected to public office at the 1979 local elections, to represent the Pembroke area for Fine Gael on Dublin City Council. He served continually in City Hall from 1979 until his retirement at the 2004 local elections. Between 1998 and 1999 he served as Lord Mayor of Dublin.

He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin South-East at the November 1982 general election, where his party constituency colleague was party leader (and after the election Taoiseach) Garret FitzGerald.

==Rebellion on abortion==
Doyle achieved early party notoriety in 1983, when he was one of eight Fine Gael TDs to defy the party and vote against the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition&#x27;s proposed wording to the anti-abortion constitutional amendment. Whereas the government&#x27;s wording included a negative prohibition, namely that nothing in the constitution should be interpreted as granting a right to abortion, Doyle—along with Alice Glenn and some other colleagues—endorsed the Fianna Fáil alternative wording that granted a &quot;right to life to the unborn, with due regard to the equal right of the mother&quot;. Because of the controversial nature of the issue of abortion, and the fact that Fine Gael was split on it, he was not sacked from the party for breaking the party whip.

==Winning and losing seats==
He was one of a number of TDs to lose their seats at the 1987 general election. At the Seanad election that followed, he was elected by the Administrative Panel to sit in the upper house (Seanad Éireann). He regained his Dáil seat at the 1989 general election, where he and FitzGerald achieved two seats out of four with a tight vote-management strategy. However, he lost his seat again at the 1992 general election to new running mate Frances Fitzgerald. Though he contested the 1997 general election—under party pressure because it saw Doyle as the party&#x27;s best chance to win a seat, even though he had originally decided not to contest any more general elections—he failed to regain a Dáil seat. He had the consolation of retaining his Senate seat in the election to the 21st Seanad.

==Lord Mayor of Dublin==
Doyle served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1998 to 1999. He was central to the decision to erect the Spire of Dublin, on the site of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar.

On his retirement from Dublin City Council in 2004, his political rival, Labour Party Dublin City Councillor Dermot Lacey, paid the following tribute: &quot;I have long respected his integrity and commitment to achieving what he believed was best for the people he represented. In many ways Joe as a politician is the epitome of the historic mandate of Fine Gael - honourable, conservative, compassionate and committed to the democratic institutions of our State.&quot;

==Epilepsy==
Doyle openly discussed in public life his lifelong experience of battling with epilepsy, a consequence of which was that he could not drive, normally a necessity for a local representative elected from a constituency.

==Best man at Brendan Behan&#x27;s wedding==
He also revealed that as sacristan in the local church he had been best man at the wedding of Irish playwright and author Brendan Behan, when Behan found himself without a best man at the ceremony.

==Personal life and family==
Joe Doyle married Margaret Mary Maguire on 11 February 1969 in the Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, Dublin. They had two sons and one daughter. Joe&#x27;s step-brother, John Doyle (1925–2009), was also active in politics and was Conservative Mayor and Bailiff of Hemel Hempstead in 1969.

Doyle was educated at CBS Westland Row.

<doc id="172299" wikidata="Q40895" url="?curid=172299" title="Dumbo">
<text>Dumbo is a 1941 American animated fantasy drama film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film is based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl, and illustrated by Helen Durney for the prototype of a novelty toy (&quot;Roll-a-Book&quot;).

The main character is Jumbo Jr., an elephant who is ridiculed for his oversized ears and mockingly nicknamed &quot;Dumbo&quot;, but in fact he is capable of flying by using his ears as wings. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is a mouse named Timothy – a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.

Produced to recoup the financial losses of both &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot; was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy. At 64 minutes, it is one of the studio&#x27;s shortest animated features. Sound was recorded conventionally using the RCA System. One voice was synthesized using the Sonovox system, but it too was recorded using the RCA System.

&quot;Dumbo&quot; was released on October 23, 1941, where it was met with critical acclaim for its story, humor, visuals, and music. The film was later criticized for stereotyping of black people. Its accolades include an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot;.

In the years following its initial release, &quot;Dumbo&quot; remains popular ever since, with a popular theme park attraction, merchandise products, a television series, and a live-action adaptation being produced.

==Plot==
In Florida, while a large circus spends the off-season in its winter grounds, a flock of white storks delivers many babies to the animals. One elephant, Mrs. Jumbo, does not receive her baby, and keeps scanning the sky in hope. The next spring, the circus sets out on a new tour. A belated stork catches up with a moving train named Casey Jr. and drops off the expected baby elephant, Jumbo Jr. The other elephants are initially delighted, until they see the baby has revealed far-oversized ears, and mockingly nickname him &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Mrs. Jumbo shows her baby great care and love, defending him from the others&#x27; abuse.

Being clumsy due to his ears, Dumbo is made into a sideshow attraction. When some rowdy boys started to bully Dumbo and his ears, even breaking into his pen, the furious Mrs. Jumbo spanks their leader. The circus staff is drawn in by the commotion and sees Mrs. Jumbo throwing hay bales at kids, the shocked staff remove Dumbo from the pen, causing Mrs. Jumbo to be further enraged, eventually dousing the circus’s ringmaster in a water tub. She is subsequently deemed mad and locked up in a cage, while Dumbo is blamed for the incident by the elephants, and is still bullied by the others.

After scaring off the other elephants, Timothy, a mouse that travels with the circus, befriends Dumbo and decides to make him a star. He whispers in the ringmaster&#x27;s ear while the latter sleeps, convincing him to try a new stunt with Dumbo as the top of a pyramid of elephants. Dumbo trips on his ears during the show and knocks over the pyramid, injuring the others and causing the to collapse. After, all elephants exile Dumbo permanently as he is put in with the clowns&#x27; firemen act, regularly jumping from a &quot;burning building&quot; prop into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity, he hates the new performance and is upset.

Timothy decides to take Dumbo to see Mrs. Jumbo, but they cannot see each other&#x27;s faces and can only intertwine trunks. Meanwhile, the decide to increase the popularity of their fireman act by dangerously raising the platform Dumbo jumps from. In celebration of the plan, they drink champagne, and a bottle of it falls into a water vat. Crying after visiting his mother, Dumbo has an unsettling case of the hiccups, so Timothy takes him to the vat for some water, only to discover that the water contains champagne. Both of them get drunk, and hallucinate pink elephants.

While recovering the next morning, Dumbo and Timothy are later discovered asleep high up in a tree by Dandy Crow and his gang of crows. Initially making fun of Timothy&#x27;s assertion that Dumbo flew with his ears while being drunk, the crows are soon moved by Dumbo&#x27;s sad story. They decide to help Timothy, giving him a &quot;magic feather&quot; to help Dumbo fly. Holding the feather, Dumbo does indeed take off a second time. He and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience.

During the clowns&#x27; fire act, Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly. He drops the feather, but Timothy assures him it was only a psychological aid. As Dumbo successfully flies about the big top, much to the audience’s delight, he throws a trunkful of peanuts to the other elephants as payback. Dumbo gains fame and fortune, Timothy becomes his new manager and signs him to a Hollywood contract, and Mrs. Jumbo is freed. She and Dumbo are given a private coach on Casey Jr., and the crows wave goodbye to the duo as they travel away.

&quot;Note&quot;: The scene where Casey Jr. climbs a hill is a reference to Watty Piper’s The Little Engine That Could.

==Voice cast==
The voice actors are uncredited for their roles in the film.
* The title character is Dumbo, the nickname given to Jumbo Jr. He is a newborn elephant who has huge ears and is able to use them to fly, carrying what he thinks of as a magic feather. Dumbo is speechless in this film.
* Edward Brophy as Timothy Q. Mouse, an anthropomorphic mouse who becomes the only friend of Dumbo after his mother is locked up and does his best to make Dumbo happy again. He is never referred to by name save for a mention in a newspaper article near the end of the film.
* Verna Felton as
** Elephant Matriarch, the well-meaning but pompous leader of the elephants who is cold toward Dumbo.
** Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo&#x27;s mother, who not only speaks just once in the film to give Dumbo&#x27;s name, but also sings her lullaby “Baby Mine” to him.
* Cliff Edwards as Dandy Crow (previously named Jim Crow on the original model sheets), the leader of a group of crows. Though he initially jokes and ridicules Timothy&#x27;s idea that Dumbo can fly, he hears Dumbo&#x27;s tragic history and becomes determined to help Dumbo fly for real. He is never mentioned by name in the film.
* Herman Bing as The Ringmaster, who is the strict, and foolish owner of the circus. Due to being misinformed about Mrs. Jumbo&#x27;s attack on the rowdy boys, he assumes she simply snapped and locks her up.
* Sterling Holloway as Mr. Stork, Dumbo&#x27;s carrier stork seen at the beginning of the film.
* Margaret Wright as Casey Junior, the sentient 2-4-0 tender locomotive hauling the circus train.
* The Hall Johnson Choir as Crow Chorus

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Dumbo&quot; is based upon a children&#x27;s story written by Helen Aberson-Mayer and Harold Pearl, with illustrations by Helen Durney. The children&#x27;s book was first brought to the attention of Walt Disney in late 1939 by Kay Kamen, the studio&#x27;s head of merchandise licensing, who showed a prototype of the Roll-A-Book that included &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Disney immediately grasped its possibilities and heartwarming story and purchased the rights to it.

Originally intended as a short film, Disney soon realized a decent book adaption needed a feature-length film. At the time, the foreign markets in Europe had been curtailed due to World War II, which caused &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; to fail at the box office. With the film&#x27;s modest budget, &quot;Dumbo&quot; was intended to be a low-budget feature designed to bring revenue to the studio. Story artists Dick Huemer and Joe Grant were assigned to develop the plot into a feature-length film. From January 22 to March 21, 1940, they wrote a 102-page script outline in chapters, much like a book, an unusual way of writing a film script. They conceived the stork-delivery and the pink elephants sequences and had Dumbo&#x27;s mother renamed from &quot;Mother Ella&quot; to &quot;Mrs. Jumbo&quot;. They riffed on elephants&#x27; fear of mice by replacing a wise robin named &quot;Red&quot; found in the original story with the wisecracking mouse character, Timothy. They also added a &quot;rusty black crow&quot;, which was later expanded into five. Regardless of this, very little was changed from the original draft. In March 1940, a story team headed by Otto Englander translated the outline into story sketches.

===Animation===
From Disney&#x27;s perspective, &quot;Dumbo&quot; required none of the special effects that had slowed down production and grew the budgets of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, and &quot;Bambi&quot;. When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director Ben Sharpsteen was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive. As a result, the character designs are simpler, background paintings are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the character animation. Although the film is more &quot;cartoony&quot; than previous Disney films, the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement.

Watercolor paint was used to render the backgrounds. &quot;Dumbo&quot; is one of the few Disney features to use the technique, which was also used for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, and regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used oil paint and gouache. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, which drew influences from &quot;Dumbo&quot;, also made use of watercolor backgrounds.

====Disney animators&#x27; strike====

During a story meeting for &quot;Bambi&quot; on February 27, 1940, Disney observed that &quot;Dumbo&quot; was &quot;an obvious straight cartoon&quot; and that the animators that were assigned on &quot;Bambi&quot; were not appropriate for the look of &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Animators such as Art Babbitt and Ward Kimball were considered for the film. For that reason, less experienced animators were brought on to animate the characters. Kimball recalled that Disney approached him in a parking lot about &quot;Dumbo&quot; and summarized the entire story in five minutes. &quot;And listening to him tell that story,&quot; Kimball noted, &quot;I could tell that the picture was going to work. Because everything sounded right. It had a great plot.&quot; In spite of this, Bill Tytla, who was one of the studio&#x27;s top animators, animated the title character, but admitted that &quot;it was in the nature of the film to go very fast and get it out in a hurry.&quot; To speed up production, Disney used photostats of story sketches instead of full layout artwork for the film, and had experienced animators to supervise the younger, less experienced animators assigned on the film.

Production on the film was interrupted on May 29, 1941, when much of the Disney animation staff went on strike. Kimball chose to not to strike, but his close friend Walt Kelly, who was an assistant animator helping him on the crow sequence, left the studios shortly after for reasons unrelated to the strike.

Some have interpreted the clowns&#x27; requests to get a raise from their boss being a reference to the Disney animators that went on strike in 1941 (during the creation of the film), demanding higher pay from Walt himself. Animator and strike organizer Art Babbitt denied this, saying he had been assigned to animate the sequence before the strike. &quot;People attached political significance to what happened there. You know, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go on strike&#x27; and so on. We weren&#x27;t thinking strike at the time. In fact, there never would have been a strike if it hadn&#x27;t been forced on us.&quot;

== Music ==
Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace scored the film while Ned Washington wrote the lyrics to the songs. For their work on the score, Churchill and Wallace won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Churchill and Washington&#x27;s work on &quot;Baby Mine&quot; also garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Release==

&quot;Dumbo&quot; was completed and delivered to Disney&#x27;s distributor, RKO Radio Pictures, on September 11, 1941. RKO initially balked at the film&#x27;s 64-minute length and asked Disney to add another ten minutes. Disney refused, &quot;No, that&#x27;s as far as I can stretch it. You can stretch a thing so far and then it won&#x27;t hold. The picture is right as it is. And another ten minutes is liable to cost five hundred thousand dollars. I can&#x27;t afford it.&quot; The film was re-released in theaters in 1949, 1959, 1972, and 1976.

===Television broadcast===
&quot;Dumbo&quot; had its television premiere on September 14, 1955, albeit severely edited, as an installment of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television show. The film was shown unaltered on September 17, 1978, as part of a two-night salute to the program&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

===Home media===
Along with &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot; was the first of Disney&#x27;s canon of animated films to be released on home video. The film was originally released on June 26, 1981, on VHS, Laserdisc and Betamax as a rental only before becoming available for sale in early 1982. Sales were also extended to CED in October 1982. It was again re-released on VHS and Betamax as part of the Walt Disney Classics series on November 6, 1985. The film was re-released on VHS and Laserdisc on July 12, 1991. It was followed by another re-issue on VHS and Laserdisc on October 28, 1994, as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. On October 23, 2001, a 60th Anniversary Edition was released in VHS and DVD formats.

In 2006, a &quot;Big Top Edition&quot; of the film was released on DVD. A 70th Anniversary Edition of the film was released in the United States on September 20, 2011. The 70th Anniversary Edition was produced in two packages: a two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo and a one-disc DVD. The film was also released as a movie download. All versions of the 70th Anniversary Edition contain deleted scenes and several bonus features, including &quot;Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo&quot; and &quot;The Magic of Dumbo: A Ride of Passage&quot;, while the two-disc Blu-ray version includes games, animated shorts, and several exclusive features. The film was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD on April 26, 2016, to celebrate its 75th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Despite the advent of World War II, &quot;Dumbo&quot; was still the most financially successful Disney film of the 1940s. After its October 23 release, &quot;Dumbo&quot; proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $950,000 () to produce, half the cost of &quot;Snow White&quot;, less than a third of the cost of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and certainly less than the expensive &quot;Fantasia&quot;. &quot;Dumbo&quot; eventually grossed roughly more than $1.3 million () during its original release. The film returned a profit of $850,000.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Dumbo&quot; was &quot;a pleasant little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor, a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique in drawing and use of color.&quot; Cecelia Ager, writing in &quot;PM&quot;, called &quot;Dumbo&quot; &quot;the nicest, kindest Disney yet. It has the most taste, beauty, compassion, skill, restraint. It marks a return to Disney first principles, the animal kingdom—that happy land where Disney workers turn into artists; where their imagination, playfulness, ingenuity, daring flourish freest; where, in short, they&#x27;re home.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that the film was &quot;the most genial, the most endearing, the most completely precious cartoon feature film ever to emerge from the magical brushes of Walt Disney&#x27;s wonder-working artists&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;Like story and characters, &quot;Dumbo&quot;″s coloring is soft and subdued, free from picture-postcard colors and confusing detail—a significant technical advance. But the charm of &quot;Dumbo&quot; is that it again brings to life that almost human animal kingdom where Walter Elias Disney is king of them all.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised the film as &quot;one of Walt Disney&#x27;s most delightful offerings. Technically, it is excellent; the color is exceptionally good. The story itself is pleasing; it combines comedy with human appeal. The only fault is that occasionally the action slows down.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; had originally scheduled to run a story with an appearance cover for &quot;Mammal of the Year&quot; (a play on its annual &quot;Man/Person of the Year&quot; honor) on December 8, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 of that year had postponed it, and the story was later published on December 29.

Among retrospective reviews, film critic Leonard Maltin stated that &quot;Dumbo&quot; is his favorite of Disney&#x27;s films and he described it as &quot;one of Walt Disney&#x27;s most charming animated films&quot;. In 2011, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; named the film as one of the 25 all-time best animated films. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s consensus reads &quot;&quot;Dumbo&quot; packs plenty of story into its brief runtime, along with all the warm animation and wonderful music you&#x27;d expect from a Disney classic.&quot; Metacritic has assigned a weighted score of 96 out of 100 for &quot;Dumbo&quot; based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

====Depiction of black people====
The film has been criticized for its stereotypical depiction of black people. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Racism in American Films&quot; (2018) notes that &quot;All of the circus laborers are African American, the only time that blacks are seen in any great number in the entire movie.&quot; Film scholar Richard Schickel, in his 1968 book &quot;The Disney Version&quot;, argued that the group of crows in the film were African American stereotypes. The lead crow, voiced by white actor Cliff Edwards in an imitation of Southern African American dialect, was named &quot;Jim Crow&quot;, after the pre-Civil-War minstrel character. The term had become a pejorative term for African Americans, and commonly referred to racial segregation laws, and the character&#x27;s name was changed in the 1950s to &quot;Dandy Crow&quot; in attempt to avoid controversy. The other crows were voiced by African American actors and singers of the popular all-black &quot;Hall Johnson Choir&quot;, including actors James Baskett (&quot;Song of the South&quot;) and Nick Stewart (&quot;The Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy Show&quot;). Ward Kimball, the chief animator of the crows, used famous African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson as live-action reference for the characters. The personalities and mannerisms of the crows—specifically their fast-paced, back and forth dialogue—were inspired by the backchat found on the band records of Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong. Karina Longworth, exploring the history of &quot;Song of the South&quot; in her podcast &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;, discussed the basis of the crows in minstrel show culture, as part of a wider use of minstrel culture by Walt Disney.

The crow characters have been praised by a number of critical sources. The animation historian John Canemaker felt that the crows were amongst the very few characters in the film that sympathize and are empathetic with Dumbo&#x27;s plight. Being a marginalized ethnic group themselves, they can relate to Dumbo as a fellow outcast. Canemaker further added that the crows &quot;are the most intelligent, the happiest, the freest spirited characters in the whole film.&quot; In 1980, film critic Michael Wilmington referred to the crows as &quot;father figures&quot;, self-assured individuals who are &quot;obvious parodies of proletarian blacks&quot;, but comments, &quot;The crows are the snappiest, liveliest, most together characters in the film. They are tough and generous. They bow down to no one. And, of course, it is they who teach Dumbo to fly.&quot;

In 2017, Whoopi Goldberg expressed the desire for the crow characters to be more merchandised by Disney, &quot;because those crows sing the song in &quot;Dumbo&quot; that everybody remembers.&quot; In 2019, Floyd Norman, the first African-American animator hired at Walt Disney Productions during the 1950s, defended the crows in an article entitled &quot;Black Crows and Other PC Nonsense&quot;.

The crows and Timothy Q. Mouse were not included in the 2019 live-action/CGI remake of &quot;Dumbo&quot;. In 2019, it was reported that an edited version of the animated film without the crows would be featured on the forthcoming Disney+ service. The movie streams on Disney+ uncensored, with an advisory in the synopsis warning &quot;it may contain outdated cultural depictions.&quot; In 2021, the film was one of several that Disney limited to viewers 7 years and older on their service Disney+, citing similarity of the crows&#x27; depictions to &quot;racist minstrel shows&quot;.

The Casey Jr. Circus Train is an attraction found at Disneyland and Disneyland Paris.

In June 2009, Disneyland introduced a flying Dumbo to their nighttime fireworks show, in which the elephant flies around Sleeping Beauty Castle while fireworks synched to music go off.

Casey Junior is the second float in the Main Street Electrical Parade and its versions. Casey, driven by Goofy, pulls a drum with the parade logo and Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.

===Video games===
The Ringmaster appears as one of four villains in the 1999 PC game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot;. In the game, the Disney Villains alter the happy endings from Jiminy Cricket&#x27;s book; in particular, the Ringmaster forces Dumbo to endlessly perform humiliating stunts in his circus. In the end, the Ringmaster is defeated when he is knocked unconscious by a well-aimed custard pie.

Dumbo appears in the popular PlayStation 2 game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; released in 2002 in the form of a summon that the player can call upon in battle for aid. Sora, the protagonist, flies on Dumbo while he splashes enemies with water from his trunk. Dumbo reprises his role as a summon in the follow-up game &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance.

Dumbo, Timothy Q. Mouse, the Ringmaster, Mrs. Jumbo, and Mr. Stork appear as playable characters in the world builder video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, as part of the main storyline of the game.

===Cancelled sequel===
In 2001, the &quot;60th Anniversary Edition&quot; DVD of &quot;Dumbo&quot; featured a sneak peek of the proposed sequel &quot;Dumbo II&quot;, including new character designs and storyboards. Robert C. Ramirez (&quot;&quot;) was to direct the sequel, in which Dumbo and his circus friends navigated a large city after being left behind by their traveling circus. &quot;Dumbo II&quot; also sought to explain what happened to Dumbo&#x27;s father, Mr. Jumbo. Dumbo&#x27;s circus friends included the chaotic twin bears Claude and Lolly, the curious zebra Dot, the older, independent hippo Godfry, and the adventurous ostrich Penny. The animals were metaphors for the different stages of childhood. &quot;Dumbo II&quot; was supposed to be set on the day immediately following the end of the first &quot;Dumbo&quot; movie. John Lasseter cancelled &quot;Dumbo II&quot;, soon after being named Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2006.

===Live-action adaptation===

On July 8, 2014, Walt Disney Pictures announced that a live-action adaptation of &quot;Dumbo&quot; was in development. In the same announcement, Ehren Kruger was confirmed as the screenwriter, as well as co-producer with Justin Springer. On March 10, 2015, Tim Burton was announced as the director. On January 11, 2017, it was reported that Will Smith was in talks to star in the remake as the father of some children who befriend Dumbo. That same day, it was revealed that Tom Hanks had reportedly been offered to play the film&#x27;s villain. The following month, it was announced that Smith would not be starring in the film. Smith passed on the project due to a disagreement over salary and scheduling as well as to star in &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;. He played the role of Genie in the 2019 live-action remake of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. In March 2017, it was reported that Eva Green was in talks to play a trapeze artist. Following this announcement, Danny DeVito was cast as a ringleader named Medici. Two weeks later, it was reported that Colin Farrell had entered negotiations to play the role of Holt, which was originally offered to Will Smith. On April 4, 2017, Michael Keaton, Burton&#x27;s former frequent collaborator, entered talks to star as the villain. Keaton confirmed his involvement with the film on June 26, 2017. Filming took place at Cardington Studios in Bedfordshire, England. On July 15, 2017, Disney announced the casting for all of the principal roles and that the film would be released on March 29, 2019. DeObia Oparei, Joseph Gatt and Alan Arkin also play new characters created for the film.

<doc id="172303" wikidata="Q1094512" url="?curid=172303" title="Civilization (1980 board game)">
<text>Civilization is a board game designed by Francis Tresham, published in the United Kingdom in 1980 by Hartland Trefoil and in the United States in 1981 by Avalon Hill. The &quot;Civilization&quot; brand is now owned by Hasbro. It was out of print for many years, before it saw republication in 2018, by Gibsons Games. The game typically takes eight or more hours to play and is for two to seven players.

&quot;Civilization&quot; is widely considered to be one of the most influential games in the strategy genre, cited as foundational to both the grand strategy and 4X subgenres.

The game is also first in incorporating a technology tree (or &quot;tech tree&quot;), a common feature in subsequent board and video games, which allows players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items are obtained.

==Overview==

The &quot;Civilization&quot; board depicts areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The board is divided into many regions. Each player plays a historic civilization and starts in the area where appropriate for that civilization, and attempts to grow and expand their empire over successive turns, trying to build the greatest civilization while minimizing the effects of calamities and war.

The goal of &quot;Civilization&quot; is to be first to advance to the final space on a table called the Archaeological Succession Table (AST). The AST starts at 8,000 B.C. and ends at 250 B.C. The AST contains fifteen spaces, and players are advanced on the AST each turn. At several points, however, certain conditions must be met (such as, the civilization must have a certain number of cities) in order to advance. Since any given civilization is unlikely to meet the advancement criteria at every stage of the AST, games usually last more than fifteen turns.

&quot;Civilization&quot; is unusual in that it does not focus on war and combat, as many games of its genre do. Instead, players are encouraged to trade and cooperate in order to advance. However, war and combat are entirely permissible, and are sometimes inevitable. In fact, the game is designed to limit players&#x27; geographical expansion possibilities, forcing them to deal with other civilizations militarily, diplomatically, or otherwise if they wish their own civilization to reach its full potential.

==Gameplay==

A game starts with each player having a single population token in the area based on the specific civilization represented (e.g. on the island of Crete for the Cretans or in Africa for the Egyptians). As the first few turns progress, the population expands exponentially. Since any given area only supports so many population tokens, players need to spread out, eventually meeting the civilizations of other players. 

Trade is the most important activity in &quot;Civilization&quot;. Trade cards give a player&#x27;s civilization wealth, which ultimately helps their civilization advance on the AST. As each civilization grows, adding more and more population to the board, players can convert excess population into cities by gathering six population tokens in an area favoring settlement (or twelve in other areas). Each city grants a trade card to the owner, one of eleven commodities, such as iron, salt and grain. Having more cities gives access to more valuable commodities, such as bronze, spice and gold. Each such commodity has a value equal to the number of cities required, so for example once your civilization grows its third city, you can gain a salt card, valued 3, and you need eight cities to have a chance at a gems card, valued 8. However, collecting more cards in a set gives an exponentially larger payout (number of cards squared times the commodity value). For example, as mentioned one salt is worth 3 points. Two salt, however, is worth (2^2x3=)12 points, and three are worth (3^2x3=)27 points.

The total number of cards in each set differs. There are nine salt cards but only four gems cards, for instance. While collecting all four gems cards pays (4^2x8=)128 points collecting all nine salt cards pay (9^2x3=)243 points, so every commodity remains relevant. Thus, players are encouraged to trade with each other to collect sets of the same commodity. You trade by selecting some of your cards to offer another player, truthfully stating one of them, as well as the total points value of the proposed trade. If that player agrees, you swap cards. 

The quirk is that along with trade cards come eight calamity cards such as volcano eruptions, famine and civil war, which destroy population and cities. The player that is stuck with a particular calamity card at the end of trading suffers that calamity. Since players are only required to tell the truth about one of the cards and the total points value they are trading, calamity cards can be slipped into a trade to avoid their effects. Many &quot;trade sessions&quot; can become quite vocal and exuberant as players try to out-trade one another. 

After trading is complete and calamities are resolved, players can cash in their sets of commodity cards. Gains from trade are used to purchase civilization cards, such as agriculture, coinage, philosophy and medicine, which grant special abilities and give bonuses toward future civilization card purchases. The goal of the game is to advance (on the AST) through the Late Iron Age and become the most advanced civilization on the map board. This is accomplished through clever game play and purchase of several high-value civilization cards, while trying not to antagonize your neighbors.

==Editions==

Civilization by Hartland Trefoil (1980).

Civilization by Avalon Hill (1982):

The 1st edition has a cover depicting an antique Greek temple, an Egyptian fresco and some baskets; the board with the map is a one-piece multifold.

The 2nd edition has a board consisting of two separate pieces and has a cover showing the faces of three figures from ancient history above a collage of the Pyramids, the Parthenon, the Nile, and an erupting Mount Vesuvius. These three people are: a general of the Roman Legion (using the likeness of actor Stephen Boyd from the 1964 film &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;); a Greek or Roman statesman or philosopher (using the likeness of Alec Guinness also from &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;); and a Judaean or Minoan noblewoman (using the likeness of actress Rita Gam from the 1961 movie &quot;King of Kings&quot;).

Civilization by Gibsons Games/Welt der Spiele/Piatnik (1988): English and German version. The cover shows six members from people around the Mediterranean Sea.

Civilisation by Descartes (1989): French version. The cover shows a grayhaired male, a Roman temple and the Pyramids in the background.

Civilisation by Gibsons (2018): UK version. The cover shows a Roman officer and an Egyptian noblewoman.

==Expansions==
=== Advanced Civilization (1991) ===

The Advanced Civilization expansion contains simplified trading rules and gives every civilization the possibility to buy all civilization advances. It also adds more trading cards, civilization advances, calamities and rules for up to eight players. It contains all the cards available in the &quot;Trade Card Set&quot; (below).

=== Other expansions ===
* Trade Card Set (1982): Usable with the Avalon Hill version. Adds additional commodities such as timber, silver and ivory to reduce the frequency of calamities, reduce the risk for a shortage in low value trade cards (which disproportionately hurts the players with the most cities), and increase the challenge of making large sets. &quot;Advanced Civilization&quot; includes this expansion.
* Western Extension Map (1988): Usable with the Hartland/Trefoil and the Avalon Hill version. Extends the game board west of Italy to cover Gaul, parts of the Iberian peninsula, the British Isles and northwest Africa. (Note that a version of this expansion was also available for the original Hartland Trefoil version of the game)
* Eastern Expansion Map (1995): Usable with the Hartland/Trefoil and the Avalon Hill version. Adds Persia, Sumer, Samita and Indus people and covers the areas of Persia, the westernmost parts of the Indian subcontinent and Arabia. The map has the imprint &quot;Civilisation Eastern Extension Unofficial Version&quot;. It was published in Alea Magazine #21 (Spain). In addition there are five new civilization cards.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Incunabula&quot; was the first computer emulation of the board game by Avalon Hill (1984, for MS-DOS). Besides the main game, it included two shorter variants, one eliminating trade and one that includes only trade.

&quot;Avalon Hill&#x27;s Advanced Civilization&quot; was a 1995 MS-DOS computer version of the board game, incorporating the Advanced Civilization expansion. The rules were slightly modified from the board game for computer play.

A projected sequel of the &quot;Civilization&quot; board game in the ages after antiquity drove the development of &quot;Age of Renaissance&quot;, published by Avalon Hill in 1996. This game, designed for 3 to 6 players, has kept only a few features of &quot;&#x27;Civilization&quot;, such as commodities (no longer collectible cards but territories) and the civilization advances (no longer cards but ticks in a check list).

&quot;Civilization&quot; is also well-known as the core inspiration behind Sid Meier&#x27;s computer game of the same name, which would itself act as the progenitor of the wider 4X genre.

==Reception==
In the February 1983 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine (Issue #70), Tony Watson thought the game was ground-breaking, saying, &quot;Once in a while, a new game comes out that proves that there is still plenty of virgin territory out there for game designers to explore and plenty of room for innovative and imaginative approaches to those subjects. Avalon Hill&#x27;s release, &quot;Civilization&quot;, is just such a game.&quot; He concluded, &quot;&quot;Civilization&quot; is a game that defies comparison with others [...] It&#x27;s a fine value and is highly recommended.&quot;

In the January 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 12), Steve Jones examined the game at length and concluded, &quot;&quot;Civilization&quot; is an excellent multi-player game for those who like long games which require considerable thought, concentration and decision making.&quot;

&quot;Civilization&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Steven Savile commented that designer Francis Tresham &quot;created a thinking gamer&#x27;s game, one that deserves to be played around a table with friends — especially the cheerfully scheming sort&quot;.

==Awards==
At the 1983 Origins Awards, &quot;Civilization&quot; was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for &quot;Best Pre-20th Century Boardgame of 1982&quot;.

==Legacy==
The game shares the name and the basic broad themes of expansion, development and conflict with the MicroProse computer game &quot;Civilization&quot; by Sid Meier that came out a decade later. While the gameplay of the computer game is unrelated to &quot;Civilization&quot;, MicroProse did pay Avalon a licensing fee for the name. Later in 1998 MicroProse filed a lawsuit against Activision (who licensed the rights to the board game) and Avalon Hill to secure the rights for using the name. The lawsuit was settled amicably in 2000, with Avalon Hill selling all rights to the &quot;Civilization&quot; franchise to MicroProse.
Although the success of the &quot;Civilization&quot; computer games series has led to multiple board games, starting with &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot; in 2002, none of these games has any direct relation to the &quot;Civilization&quot; board game discussed here.

<text>Viral meningitis, also known as aseptic meningitis, is a type of meningitis due to a viral infection. It results in inflammation of the meninges (the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, sensitivity to light and neck stiffness. 
Viruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses). However, other viruses can also cause viral meningitis, such as West Nile virus, mumps, measles, herpes simplex types I and II, varicella and lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Based on clinical symptoms, viral meningitis cannot be reliably differentiated from bacterial meningitis, although viral meningitis typically follows a more benign clinical course. Viral meningitis has no evidence of bacteria present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is often needed to identify the disease.
In most cases, there is no specific treatment, with efforts generally aimed at relieving symptoms (headache, fever or nausea). A few viral causes, such as HSV, have specific treatments.
In the United States, viral meningitis is the cause of more than half of all cases of meningitis. With the prevalence of bacterial meningitis in decline, the viral disease is garnering more and more attention. The estimated incidence has a considerable range, from 0.26 to 17 cases per 100,000 people. For enteroviral meningitis, the most common cause of viral meningitis, there are up to 75,000 cases annually in the United States alone. While the disease can occur in both children and adults, it is more common in children.

==Signs and symptoms==

Viral meningitis characteristically presents with fever, headache and neck stiffness. Fever is the result of cytokines released that affect the thermoregulatory (temperature control) neurons of the hypothalamus. Cytokines and increased intracranial pressure stimulate nociceptors in the brain that lead to headaches. Neck stiffness is the result of inflamed meninges stretching due to flexion of the spine. The various layers of meninges act form a separation between the brain and the skull. In contrast to bacterial meningitis, symptoms associated with viral meningitis are often less severe and do not progress as quickly. Nausea, vomiting and photophobia (light sensitivity) also commonly occur, as do general signs of a viral infection, such as muscle aches and malaise. Increased cranial pressure from viral meningitis stimulates the area postrema, which causes nausea and vomiting. Widened pulse pressure (systolic - diastolic blood pressure), bradycardia, and irregular respiration would be alarming for Cushing&#x27;s reflex, a sign of acutely elevated intracranial pressure. Photophobia is due to meningeal irritation. In severe cases, people may experience concomitant encephalitis (meningoencephalitis), which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures or focal neurologic deficits.

Babies with viral meningitis may only appear irritable, sleepy or have trouble eating. Infection in the neonatal period may be the result of infection during pregnancy. In severe cases, people may experience concomitant encephalitis (meningoencephalitis), which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures or focal neurologic deficits. The pediatric population may show some additional signs and symptoms that include jaundice and bulging fontanelles. A biphasic fever is more often seen in children compared to adults. The first fever arrives with the onset of general constitutional symptoms, and the second accompanying the onset of the neurological symptoms.

Symptoms can vary depending on the virus responsible for infection. Enteroviral meningitis (the most common cause) typically presents with the classic headache, photophobia, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. With coxsackie and echo virus&#x27; specifically, a maculopapular rash may be present, or even the typical vesicles seen with Herpangina. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can be differentiated from the common presenting meningeal symptoms by the appearance of a prodromal influenza-like sickness about 10 days before other symptoms begin. Mumps meningitis can present similarly to isolated mumps, with possible parotid and testicular swelling. Interestingly, research has shown that HSV-2 meningitis most often occurs in people with no history of genital herpes, and that a severe frontal headache is among the most common presenting symptoms. Patients with varicella zoster meningitis may present with herpes zoster (Shingles) in conjunction with classic meningeal signs. Meningitis can be an indication that an individual with HIV is undergoing seroconversion, the time when the human body is forming antibodies in response to the virus.

== Causes ==
The most common causes of viral meningitis in the United States are non-polio enteroviruses. The viruses that cause meningitis are typically acquired from sick contacts. However, in most cases, people infected with viruses that may cause meningitis do not actually develop meningitis.

Viruses that can cause meningitis include:
==Mechanism==

Viral Meningitis is mostly caused by an infectious agent that has colonized somewhere in its host. People who are already in an immunocompromised state are at the highest risk of pathogen entry. Some of the most common examples of immunocompromised individuals include those with HIV, cancer, diabetes, malnutrition, certain genetic disorders, and patients on chemotherapy. Potential sites for this include the skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, and genitourinary tract. The organism invades the submucosa at these sites by invading host defenses, such as local immunity, physical barriers, and phagocytes or macrophages. After pathogen invasion, the immune system is activated. An infectious agent can enter the central nervous system and cause meningeal disease via invading the bloodstream, a retrograde neuronal pathway, or by direct contiguous spread. Immune cells and damaged endothelial cells release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cytokines, and nitric oxide. MMPs and NO induce vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. Cytokines induce capillary wall changes in the blood brain barrier, which leads to expression of more leukocyte receptors, thus increasing white blood cell binding and extravasation.

The barrier that the meninges create between the brain and the bloodstream are what normally protect the brain from the body&#x27;s immune system. Damage to the meninges and endothelial cells increases cytotoxic reactive oxygen species production, which damages pathogens as well as nearby cells. In meningitis, the barrier is disrupted, so once viruses have entered the brain, they are isolated from the immune system and can spread. This leads to elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, meningeal irritation, and neuronal death.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of viral meningitis is made by clinical history, physical exam, and several diagnostic tests. Kernig and Brudzinski signs may be elucidated with specific physical exam maneuvers, and can help diagnose meningitis at the bedside. Most importantly however, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected via lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap). This fluid, which normally surrounds the brain and spinal cord, is then analyzed for signs of infection. CSF findings that suggest a viral cause of meningitis include an elevated white blood cell count (usually 10-100 cells/μL) with a lymphocytic predominance in combination with a normal glucose level. Increasingly, cerebrospinal fluid PCR tests have become especially useful for diagnosing viral meningitis, with an estimated sensitivity of 95-100%. Additionally, samples from the stool, urine, blood and throat can also help to identify viral meningitis. CSF vs serum c-reactive protein and procalcitonin have not been shown to elucidate whether meningitis is bacterial or viral.

In certain cases, a CT scan of the head should be done before a lumbar puncture such as in those with poor immune function or those with increased intracranial pressure. If the patient has focal neurological deficits, papilledema, a Glasgow Coma Score less than 12, or a recent history of seizures, lumbar puncture should be reconsidered.

Differential diagnosis for viral meningitis includes meningitis caused by bacteria, mycoplasma, fungus, and drugs such as NSAIDS, TMP-SMX, IVIG. Further considerations include brain tumors, lupus, vasculitis, and Kawasaki disease in the pediatric population.

==Treatment==

Because there is no clinical differentiation between bacterial and viral meningitis, people with suspected disease should be sent to the hospital for further evaluation. Treatment for viral meningitis is generally supportive. Rest, hydration, antipyretics, and pain or anti-inflammatory medications may be given as needed. However, if there is initial uncertainty as to whether the meningitis is bacterial or viral in origin, empiric antibiotics are often given until bacterial infection is ruled out.

Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus have a specific antiviral therapy. For herpes the treatment of choice is aciclovir. If encephalitis is suspected, empiric treatment with IV aciclovir is often warranted.

Surgical management is indicated where there is extremely increased intracranial pressure, infection of an adjacent bony structure (e.g. mastoiditis), skull fracture, or abscess formation.

The majority of people that have viral meningitis get better within 7–10 days.

==Epidemiology==
From 1988 to 1999, about 36,000 cases occurred each year in the United States. As recently as 2017, the incidence in the U.S. alone increased to 75,000 cases per year for enteroviral meningitis. With the advent and implementation of vaccinations for organisms such as &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza&quot; type B, and &quot;Neisseria meningitis&quot;, rates of bacterial meningitis have been in decline, making viral meningitis more common. Countries without high rates of immunization still carry higher rates of bacterial disease. While the disease can occur in both children and adults, it is more common in children. Rates of infection tend to reach a peak in the summer and fall. During an outbreak in Romania and in Spain viral meningitis was more common among adults. While, people aged younger than 15 made up 33.8% of cases. In contrast in Finland in 1966 and in Cyprus in 1996, Gaza 1997, China 1998 and Taiwan 1998, the incidence of viral meningitis was higher among children.

==Recent research==

It has been proposed that viral meningitis might lead to inflammatory injury of the vertebral artery wall.

The Meningitis Research Foundation is conducting a study to see if new genomic techniques can improve the speed, accuracy and cost of diagnosing meningitis in children in the UK. The research team will develop a new method to be used for the diagnosis of meningitis, analysing the genetic material of microorganisms found in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). The new method will first be developed using CSF samples where the microorganism is known, but then will be applied to CSF samples where the microorganism is unknown (estimated at around 40%) to try and identify a cause. There is also research investigating whether high-throughput sequencing, wherein the investigator does not need to compare DNA results with known genomic sequences, could be used in specifically diagnosing unknown causes of viral meningitis.

While there is some emerging evidence that bacterial meningitis may have a negative impact on cognitive function, there is no such evidence for viral meningitis.

<text>Highlife is a Ghanaian music genre that originated along the coastal cities of present-day Ghana in the 19th century, during its history as a colony of the British and through its trade routes in coastal areas. It encompasses multiple local fusions of African metre and western jazz melodies. It uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional African music, but is typically played with Western instruments. Highlife is characterized by jazzy horns and guitars which lead the band and its use of the two-finger plucking guitar style that is typical of African music. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound.

Highlife gained popularity and the genre spread throughout West African regions. Pioneers like Cardinal Rex Lawson, E.T. Mensah, Victor Uwaifo, all perfected this sound by infusing traditional Africa drums and western &quot;Native Blues&quot;. After the Second World War its popularity came back within the Igbo people of Nigeria, taking their own traditional guitar riffs and the influence of the diverse culture and flavour of Nigeria, mixed and perfected it to form Igbo highlife which became the country&#x27;s most popular music genre in the 1960s.

Highlife has remained a part of popular music for Ghanaians and their diaspora globally through its integration with religious institutions and the positive effect it had on immigrating Ghanaians leaving their homeland.

==History==
The following arpeggiated highlife guitar part is modeled after an Afro-Cuban guajeo. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 &quot;clave motif&quot; guajeo as shown below. The bell pattern known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot; is indigenous to Ghana, and is used in highlife.
The origins of Highlife stem from colonialism and trading in West Africa through regional styles of music.

=== Palm wine music ===
Palm-wine music, also known as maringa in Sierra Leone, was one style that originated on coastal locations when local musicians began using portable instruments brought by traders and fused it with local string and percussion instruments. It was usually played in a syncopated 4/4 metre. This music was played in low class palm-wine bars at ports where sailors, dock workers, and working class locals would drink and listen to the music. Eventually this genre worked its way inland and a more Africanized version came containing 12/8 polyrhythms, this would be known as the &quot;Native Blues&quot;. This style would gain popularity up until World War II when production of the records was stopped.

=== Brass-band highlife ===
A style of highlife that resembled western brass bands in European forts across West Africa. The military would use local musicians in their brass band regiments and taught them linear marching music. After these musicians saw how the West Indian regimental bandsmen practiced traditional music in their spare time it inspired them to do the same. The fusion of linear marching music with polyrhythmic local music created a danceable style called adaha, as well as a style with cheaper, local instruments called konkoma. This fusion was similar to the birth of jazz in New Orleans.

=== Dance and guitar band highlife ===
In the 1920s, Ghanaian musicians incorporated foreign influences like the foxtrot and calypso with Ghanaian rhythms like &quot;osibisaba&quot; (Fante). Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy during the colonial period, and was played by numerous bands including the Jazz Kings, Cape Coast Sugar Babies, and Accra Orchestra along the country&#x27;s coast. The high class audience members who enjoyed the music in select clubs gave the music its name. The dance orchestra leader Yebuah Mensah (E.T. Mensah&#x27;s older brother) told John Collins in 1973 that the term &#x27;highlife&#x27; appeared in the early 1920s &quot;as a catch-phrase for the orchestrated indigenous songs played at [exclusive] clubs by such early dance bands as the Jazz Kings, the Cape Coast Sugar Babies, the Sekondi Nanshamang and later the Accra Orchestra. The people outside called it the highlife as they did not reach the class of the couples going inside, who not only had to pay a relatively high entrance fee of about 7s 6d (seven shillings and sixpence), but also had to wear full evening dress, including top-hats if they could afford it.&quot; From the 1930s, highlife spread via Ghanaian workers to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Gambia among other West African countries, where the music quickly gained popularity.

In the 1940s, the music diverged into two distinct streams: dance band highlife and guitar band highlife. Guitar band highlife featured smaller bands and, at least initially, was most common in rural areas. Because of the history of stringed instruments like the seprewa in the region, musicians were happy to incorporate the guitar. They also used the &quot;dagomba&quot; style, borrowed from Kru sailors from Liberia, to create highlife&#x27;s two-finger picking style. Guitar band highlife also featured singing, drums and claves. E.K. Nyame and his Akan Trio helped to popularize guitar band highlife, and would release over 400 records during Nyame&#x27;s lifetime. Dance band highlife, by contrast, was more rooted in urban settings. In the post-war period, larger dance orchestras began to be replaced by smaller professional dance bands, typified by the success of E.T. Mensah and the Tempos. As foreign troops departed, the primary audiences became increasingly Ghanaian, and the music changed to cater to their tastes. Mensah&#x27;s fame soared after he played with Louis Armstrong in Accra in May 1956, and he eventually earned the nickname, the &quot;King of Highlife&quot;. Also important from the 1950s onward was musician King Bruce, who served as band leader to the Black Beats. Some other early bands were, the Red Spots, the Rhythm Aces, the Ramblers and Broadway-Uhuru.

=== The Ghanaian diaspora ===
Economic problems led to a mass migration of Ghanaians in the 1960s looking for more opportunities and after that political instability in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s would cause more people and many prominent highlife musicians to leave and create clusters of communities across the west with Germany being a preferred destination because of its relaxed immigration laws.

==== Burger highlife ====
Ghanaians in Germany created a secular style of highlife that combined the genre with funk, disco, and synth-pop. It is believed it was called burger highlife because the largest communities of Ghanaians resided in Hamburg. The music became associated with migrants who would travel between Germany and Ghana. It also would become defined by its use of modern technologies; by the late &#x27;90s, productions used solely electronic instruments.

==== Gospel highlife ====
Considered one of the most popular music genres to both Ghanaians and its diaspora, gospel highlife has outlived burger highlife because of its success in blurring the lines between religion and pop culture. This genre is similar to burger highlife but its inspiration comes from Charismatic Christianity and Pentecostalism. Its significance within the communities stems from the religious institution&#x27;s ability to provide social and cultural infrastructure for the Ghanaian diaspora in Germany.

==Jazz in Ghana==
=== 1950s ===
E.T. Mensah and Kofi Ghanaba were important musicians in Ghana. From the late 1950s, famous jazz musicians began to visit Ghana, such as Ahmad Jamal and Louis Armstrong who played in Ghana (1956 and 1960). Armstrong&#x27;s All Stars member Edmond Hall came to Ghana in 1959 to set up a short-lived jazz in Accra.

Guy Warren was one notable musician who played with E.T. Mensah and the Tempos before moving to America and working with musicians such as Red Saunders to record the album &quot;Africa Speaks, America Answers&quot;, as well as playing with Duke Ellington in Chicago for a short time. Warren is credited with introducing highlife to the United States in an attempt to bring African-American musicians back in touch with the music of Africa, as awareness of African influence on Afro-American music was lacking before the &quot;African musical renaissance&quot; of the late &#x27;50s.

<doc id="172308" wikidata="Q1109497" url="?curid=172308" title="Piedmont blues">
<text>Piedmont blues (also known as East Coast, or Southeastern blues) refers primarily to a guitar style, which is characterized by a fingerpicking approach in which a regular, alternating thumb bass string rhythmic pattern supports a syncopated melody using the treble strings generally picked with the fore-finger, occasionally others. The result is comparable in sound to ragtime or stride piano styles. Blues researcher Peter B. Lowry coined the term, giving co-credit to fellow folklorist Bruce Bastin. The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles, particularly the Mississippi Delta blues, by its ragtime-based rhythms.

==Origins==

The basis of the Piedmont style began with the older &quot;frailing&quot; or &quot;framming&quot; guitar styles that may have been universal throughout the South, and was also based, at least to some extent, on formal &quot;parlor guitar&quot; techniques as well as earlier banjo playing, string band, and ragtime. What was particular to the Piedmont was that a generation of players adapted these older, ragtime-based techniques to blues in a singular and popular fashion, influenced by guitarists such as Blind Blake and Gary Davis.

==Geography==
The Piedmont blues was named after the Piedmont plateau region, on the East Coast of the United States from about Richmond, Virginia to Atlanta, Georgia. Piedmont blues musicians come from this area, as well as Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and northern Florida, western South Carolina, central North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama – later the Northeastern cities such as Boston, Newark, New Jersey, and New York.

Nick Spitzer, Professor of Anthropology and American Studies, folklorist, and producer of &quot;American Routes&quot; describes Piedmont Blues in this way: Among the rolling hills, small farms, mills, and coal and railroad camps of the rural East Coast Piedmont, between Tidewater coast and the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, black and white economic and cultural patterns have overlapped considerably — more so than in the nearby areas or the Deep South. Piedmont blues styles reflects this, meshing traces of gospel, fiddle tunes, blues, country, and ragtime into its rolling, exuberant sound.

==Recordings==
Recording artists such as Blind Blake, Josh White, Buddy Moss, and Blind Boy Fuller helped spread the style on the strength of their sales throughout the region. It was nationally popular with the African-American audience for about twenty years from the mid-1920s through to the mid-1940s. Blind Boy Fuller recorded &quot;Step It Up and Go&quot; in 1940.

==Post-World War II==
As a form of Black American popular music, Piedmont blues fell out of favor on a national basis after World War II. By the late-1950s, it was being performed at US folk music revivals and festivals initially by established Piedmont blues artists such as Josh White, Rev. Gary Davis, and Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, as well as Cephas &amp; Wiggins, John Jackson in later years.
While musicologists such as George Mitchell, Peter B. Lowry and Tim Duffy collected recordings by the aging community of Piedmont blues players, younger musicians such as Stefan Grossman, Roy Book Binder, Jorma Kaukonen, Paul Geremia, Keb Mo&#x27;, Michael Roach, Samuel James, Eric Bibb, Ry Cooder, David Bromberg, and Guy Davis have carried on the Piedmont tradition, often having &quot;studied&quot; under some of the old Piedmont masters. The Piedmont fingerpicking style of guitar playing has also influenced other folk and popular musicians such as Doc Watson and Ralph McTell. Arlo Guthrie famously used a Piedmont blues backing for his &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; monologues, as it was easy to play repeatedly for long stretches of time.

==Preservation efforts==
Cultural organizations in North Carolina have supported the preservation of the Piedmont blues. The Greensboro-based Piedmont Blues Preservation Society has partnered with musicians such as Max Drake and a number of public schools in North Carolina to provide performances, exhibitions, and educational programs.

<doc id="172310" wikidata="Q611289" url="?curid=172310" title="Crazy Climber">
<text>is a vertically scrolling video game produced by Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan) and released for arcades in 1980. In North America, the game was also released by Taito America. Ports for the Arcadia 2001 and Atari 2600 were published in 1982, followed by the Famicom in 1986 and X68000 in 1993.

With the goal of scaling a series of skyscrapers using two joysticks (one controlling the left side of the character&#x27;s body, the other the right) &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; was the first in a &quot;climbing games&quot; genre which includes Nintendo&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The genre eventually became better known as platform games and is defined by jumping and traversal between platforms, neither of which are found in &quot;Crazy Climber&quot;.

&quot;Crazy Climber&quot; was the third highest-earning arcade game of 1980 in Japan while also being a commercial success in North America. A lesser-known sequel, &quot;Crazy Climber 2&quot;, was released for arcades in 1988.

==Gameplay==

The player assumes the role of a climber attempting to reach the top of four skyscrapers. The climber is controlled via two joysticks.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; was the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1980, just below &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;. &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; was also Japan&#x27;s eighth highest-grossing arcade game of 1981.

In North America, &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; was among the top ten highest-earning arcade games in the summer of 1982.

==Legacy==
* In 1981, Bandai Electronics manufactured a hand-held VFD version of the game.
* A 3D Board Game was released by Bandai in 1981, exclusively in Japan.
* &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1982) for the Atari 2600 was similar to &quot;Crazy Cimber&quot;, a variation on its gameplay format with added web shooting and swinging abilities.
* A 1985 sequel titled &quot;Crazy Climber &#x27;85&quot; was produced, but put into storage by Nichibutsu in favor of &quot;Terra Cresta&quot;. This unreleased sequel was eventually included in on the PlayStation version of &quot;Nichibutsu Arcade Classics&quot;.
* A Japanese-only sequel, &quot;Crazy Climber 2&quot;, was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features.
* On February 3, 1996, &quot;Hyper Crazy Climber&quot; was released only in Japan for the PlayStation. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartooney characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a &quot;Bomberman&quot;-style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used. It was also released for Windows on November 30 the same year.
* On March 2, 2000, &quot;Crazy Climber 2000&quot; was released for the PlayStation. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; and a scan of the instruction panel. Like &quot;Hyper Crazy Climber&quot; which released for the same console 4 years earlier, &quot;Crazy Climber 2000&quot; was released only in Japan.
* Japanese publisher HAMSTER released the arcade version of &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; under their &quot;Oretachi Gēsen Zoku Sono (オレたちゲーセン族)&quot; classic game line for the PlayStation 2 on July 21, 2005.
* &quot;Crazy Climber Wii&quot; was released for the Wii in Japan on December 20, 2007.
* The arcade game was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on February 23, 2010.
* The game was released for the Nintendo Switch by HAMSTER under their Arcade Archives series in February 2018. It had been previously released on May 15, 2014, for the PlayStation 4 as the first entry in the series.

<text>The Daily Telegraph, also nicknamed The Tele, is an Australian tabloid newspaper published by Nationwide News Pty Limited, a subsidiary of News Corp Australia, itself a subsidiary of News Corp. It is published Monday through Saturday and is available throughout Sydney, across most of regional and remote New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South East Queensland.

A 2013 poll conducted by Essential Research found that the &quot;Telegraph&quot; was Australia&#x27;s least-trusted major newspaper, with 49% of respondents citing &quot;a lot of&quot; or &quot;some&quot; trust in the paper. Amongst those ranked by Nielsen, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; website is the sixth most popular Australian news website with a unique monthly audience of 2,841,381 readers.

==History==

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was founded in 1879, by John Mooyart Lynch, a former printer, editor and journalist who had once worked on the &quot;Melbourne Daily Telegraph&quot;. Lynch had failed in an attempt to become a politician and was looking to start his own paper to reflect the opinion of the common working man. Lynch put together a large team of backers, including an old friend Watkin Wynne, who was unusual for being a very wealthy journalist, and Robert Sands, who ran the printing company John Sands. The first edition was published on 1 July 1879, costing only one penny. The first page of the first edition outlined Lynch&#x27;s vision for his paper, saying:
&quot;We wish to make this journal a reliable exponent of public opinion, which we think is hardly represented in the existing press.
&quot;Without disparaging existing journals in Sydney, which we fully admit have many excellencies, we believe that they have missed the great objective of journalism to be in sympathy with and to report public opinion.&quot;

When sales of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; began to fall in 1882 the newspaper was taken over by Watkin Wynne. Wynne introduced shorter, punchier, stories and more sensationalism.

The &quot;Telegraph&quot; reported on various events and movements of the time. The paper was reported as being a strong advocate for Federation. In the first decade of the 20th century, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; had lost its lead in paper sales and was in a fierce circulation war with other Sydney dailies, particularly the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

Watkin Wynne remained in charge of the paper until his death in 1921. Under his successors, the paper underwent some major changes. In 1924, the paper began running news on the front page rather than just advertising. Still a broadsheet (large format paper), in 1927 declining circulation and financial troubles forced a switch to the smaller tabloid format. In 1929, it was taken over by wealthy tobacco manufacturer Sir Hugh Denison, the founder of the Sydney newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;. In 1929, Denison formed Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) with S Bennett Ltd and media owner R. C. Packer. Denison later also acquired the &quot;Daily Guardian&quot; (which had been owned by Smith&#x27;s Weekly) which he combined with the &quot;Telegraph News Pictorial&quot; to form the new &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. 

The paper returned to a broadsheet format in 1931. From 1936 until its sale to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited in 1972, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; was owned by Sir Frank Packer&#x27;s Australian Consolidated Press. Packer sold the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s company News Limited in 1972 for $15 million. 

In 1990, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; merged with its afternoon stablemate, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. The merged entity would resume the name of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in January 1996.

==Counterparts==
On Sundays, its counterpart is &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

Its Melbourne counterparts are the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; and &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot;. In Brisbane, it is linked with &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot;, in Adelaide, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, in Hobart, &quot;The Mercury&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Tasmanian&quot;, in Darwin, The &quot;Northern Territory News&quot; and &quot;Sunday Territorian&quot;.

== Political stance ==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has traditionally been opposed to the Australian Labor Party, and is often a supporter of the Liberal Party of Australia. A 2013 front-page headline said of the second Rudd Government &quot;Finally, you now have the chance to kick this mob out&quot; and &quot;Australia Needs Tony&quot;. The paper&#x27;s high-profile columnists are predominantly conservative.

A Roy Morgan media credibility survey found that 40% of journalists viewed News Limited newspapers as Australia&#x27;s most partisan media outlet, ahead of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 25%. The survey found that readers took a generally dim view of journalists. In response to the question &quot;Which newspapers do you believe do not accurately and fairly report the news?&quot;, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; came third (9%) behind the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; (11%) and &quot;All of them&quot; (16%).

At the 2007 Australian federal election &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for only the second time endorsed the Australian Labor Party. At the 2010 Australian federal election the newspaper endorsed the Coalition and Tony Abbott. In the 2013 election, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; ran 177 stories that were pro-Coalition and 11 stories that leaned the other way. During both the 2016 and 2019 Australian federal elections, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; strongly endorsed prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison respectively, both of the Liberal Party, while attacking then-opposition leader Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor party lost both elections.

===Endorsements===

===Editors===
The &quot;Telegraph&quot; is edited by Ben English. The previous editor was Christopher Dore. Dore&#x27;s predecessors are Paul Whittaker, Gary Linnell, David Penberthy, Campbell Reid, David Banks, and Col Allan, who served as editor-in-chief at the Murdoch-owned &quot;New York Post&quot; from 2001 to 2016.

==Circulation and readership==
Readership data from Enhanced Media Metrics Australia October 2018 report shows that the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; has total monthly readership of 4,500,000 people via print and digital, compared to 7,429,000 people for its primary competitor, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; weekday print newspaper circulation fell from 310,724 in June 2013 to 221,641 in June 2017. Saturday newspaper circulation fell to 221,996 over the same period.

As of February 2019, third-party web analytics provider Alexa ranked &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; website as the 343rd most visited website in Australia (down from 90th in July 2015).

<text>Edward Cedric Hardwicke (7 August 1932 – 16 May 2011) was an English actor, who had a distinguished career on the stage and on-screen. He was best known for playing Captain Pat Grant in &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–73), and Dr. Watson in Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1986–94).

==Early life==
Hardwicke was born in London, the son of actors Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Helena Pickard. He began his film career in Hollywood at the age of 10, in Victor Fleming&#x27;s film &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; which starred Spencer Tracy. He returned to England, attended Stowe School, and fulfilled his national service as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and trained as an actor.

==Career==
Hardwicke played at the Bristol Old Vic, the Oxford Playhouse and the Nottingham Playhouse before in 1964 joining Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre. He performed regularly there for seven years. He appeared with Olivier in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; and Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot;. He also appeared in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (with Robert Stephens), &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, Georges Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; (directed by Jacques Charon of the &quot;Comédie Française&quot;), &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;. He returned to the National in 1977 for a production of Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;The Lady from Maxim&#x27;s&quot;.

In 1973 he played Dr Astrov in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole at the Bristol Old Vic, and had an uncredited role as Charles Calthrop in the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;. In 1975 he appeared in Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;On Approval&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, and in 1976 he played Sir Robert Chiltern in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, a production with which he toured Canada.

In 1993 he played the role of C. S Lewis&#x27;s brother Warnie opposite Anthony Hopkins in &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, directed by Richard Attenborough.

In 1995 he appeared in Ian McKellen&#x27;s updated film of &quot;Richard III&quot;. His father, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, had appeared in the Laurence Olivier 1955 film version.

In 2001 he played Arthur Winslow in &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role played by his father in the 1948 film.

===TV and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;===
Hardwicke had a small role in &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; episode of the 1968 series &quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes&quot; featuring Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes.

Hardwicke played Judas Iscariot in the Dennis Potter TV play &quot;Son of Man&quot; (1969). He became familiar to television audiences in the 1970s drama series &quot;Colditz&quot;, in which he played Pat Grant, a character based on the real-life war hero Pat Reid. He then played Arthur in the sitcom &quot;My Old Man&quot;. In 1978 he appeared as Bellcourt in the last filmed episode of &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;.

In 1990 he was a contestant on &quot;Cluedo&quot;, facing off against Nanette Newman.

David Burke suggested Hardwicke as his successor in the role of Doctor Watson in the Granada Television adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes stories in &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; series, alongside Jeremy Brett as Holmes. Hardwicke played the role for eight years from 1986 to 1994, his first episode being &quot;The Empty House&quot; and his last &quot;The Cardboard Box&quot;. He portrayed a very calm and attentive Watson, somewhat intolerant of Holmes&#x27;s more outlandish moods, and became permanently associated with it, also playing it on the West End stage with Brett in &quot;The Secret of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1989. That same year, he also directed &quot;Going On&quot; by Charles Dennis at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

His other television appearances were numerous, and included: &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978), &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (1980), &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; (1984), &quot;Lovejoy&quot; (1992), &quot;Dangerfield&quot; (1996), &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot; (1997), &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1999), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (2000), &quot;The Goodbye Plane&quot; (2003), &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (2004), &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (2007), &quot;Holby City&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot; (2010) as a World War II veteran, and &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; (1978).

<text>Gerhard &quot;Gerd&quot; Müller (; 3 November 1945 – 15 August 2021) was a German professional footballer. A prolific striker, especially in and around the six-yard box, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalscorers and players in the history of the sport. With success at club and international level, he is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

At international level with West Germany, he scored 68 goals in 62 appearances, and at club level, in 15 years with Bayern Munich, in which he scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches, he became—and still is—record holder of that league. In 74 European club games he scored 65 goals. Averaging over a goal a game with West Germany, Müller was, as of 11 July 2021, 21st on the list of all time international goalscorers, despite having played fewer matches than every other player in the top 48. Among the top scorers, he has the third-highest goal-to-game ratio. He also had the highest ratio of 0.97 goals per game in the European Cup, scoring 34 goals in 35 matches.

Nicknamed &quot;Bomber der Nation&quot; (&quot;the nation&#x27;s Bomber&quot;) or simply &quot;Der Bomber&quot;, Müller was named European Footballer of the Year in 1970. After a successful season at Bayern Munich, he scored ten goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup for West Germany where he received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, before winning the 1970 Ballon d&#x27;Or. In 1972, he won the UEFA European Championship and was the top goalscorer, scoring two goals in the final. Two years later, he scored 4 goals in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, including the winning goal in the final.

Müller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the World Cup with 14 goals for 32 years. In 1999, Müller was ranked ninth in the European Player of the Century election held by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS), and he was voted 13th in the IFFHS&#x27; World Player of the Century election. In 2004, Pelé named Müller in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

==Club career==
===Bayern Munich===
Born 3 November 1945, in Nördlingen, Germany, Müller began his football career at his hometown club TSV 1861 Nördlingen youth ranks in 1958. Aged 18, Müller joined Bayern Munich in 1964, where he teamed up with future stars Franz Beckenbauer and Sepp Maier. The club, which would go on to become the most successful German club in history, was then still in the Regionalliga Süd &quot;(Regional League South)&quot;, which was one level below the Bundesliga at the time.
After one season, Bayern Munich advanced to the Bundesliga and started a long string of successes. With his club, Müller amassed titles during the 1960s and 1970s: he won the German Championship four times, the DFB-Pokal four times, the European Cup three consecutive years (the first West German team to win it; Müller scored in the 1974 final replay and the 1975 final), the Intercontinental Cup once, and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup once.

An opportunistic goal-scorer, Müller also became German top scorer seven times and European top scorer twice. Müller scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches for Bayern Munich, 53 goals over the second-most successful Bundesliga scorer, Robert Lewandowski, since 2022.

====Club goal records====
At his peak, Müller held the single-season Bundesliga record with 40 goals in season 1971–72, a record that would be held until Lewandowski scored 41 goals during the 2020–21 season, also for Bayern Munich. Then, Müller also held the record for most club goals scored in all European club competitions in one season for 40 years, scoring 67 goals during the 1972–73 FC Bayern Munich season, and 85 (72 for Munich, 13 West Germany) goals in total during 1972. However, that record was surpassed by Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona in Spain who scored 73 in the 2011/12 season, and 91 goals in the calendar year of 2012.

===Fort Lauderdale Strikers===
After his career in the Bundesliga, Müller went to the United States, where he joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (based in the Miami area) of the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1979. He played three seasons with this team, scoring 38 goals, and reaching, but losing, the league final in 1980.

==International career==

Müller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany. He was Germany&#x27;s all-time leading scorer for almost 40 years until surpassed by Miroslav Klose in 2014, though Klose required over double the number of caps to do so, scoring his 69th goal in his 132nd appearance. Müller&#x27;s international career started in 1966 and ended on 7 July 1974 with victory at the 1974 FIFA World Cup at his home stadium in Munich. He scored the winning goal for the 2–1 victory over Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Netherlands in the final. His four goals in that tournament and his ten goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup combined made him the all-time highest FIFA World Cup goalscorer at the time with 14 goals. His record stood until the 2006 tournament, coincidentally held in Germany, when it was broken by Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who also required more matches than Müller to achieve his tally. Müller also participated in the 1972 European Championship, becoming top scorer with four goals (including two in the final) and winning the Championship with the West German team.

Müller quit playing for West Germany after the 1974 FIFA World Cup triumph following an argument with the German Football Association (DFB) at the post-tournament celebration, when officials&#x27; wives were allowed to attend but players&#x27; wives were not.

==Life after football==

After Müller ended his career in 1981, he fell into a slump and suffered from alcoholism. However, his former companions at Bayern Munich convinced him to go through alcohol rehabilitation. When he emerged, they gave him a job as a coach at Bayern Munich II.

He held the position from 1992 until he retired in 2014 due to health problems. There is also a collection of apparel released by sporting giants Adidas under the Gerd Müller name. It is part of the Adidas originals series. In July 2008, the Rieser Sportpark, in Nördlingen, where Müller had begun his career, was renamed the Gerd-Müller-Stadion in his honour.

On 6 October 2015, it was announced that Müller was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on 15 August 2021 in a nursing home in Wolfratshausen, aged 75.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===

In his book, &quot;Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football&quot;, author David Winner writes, &quot;Müller was short, squat, awkward-looking and not notably fast; he never fitted the conventional idea of a great footballer, but he had lethal acceleration over short distances, a remarkable aerial game, and uncanny goalscoring instincts. His short legs gave him a low center of gravity, so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over. He also had a knack of scoring in unlikely situations.&quot;

Müller used extreme acceleration, agility, and deceptive changes of pace to get to loose balls first, and bypass defenders. His teammate Franz Beckenbauer has emphasized Müller&#x27;s unusual speed: &quot;His pace was incredible. In training I have played against him and I never had a chance.&quot;

A prolific goalscorer, Müller was also known for his movement, coordination, intelligence, and clinical finishing inside the penalty area. He had the ability to score goals from awkward positions with almost any part of his body, not only with his head or either foot.

===Legacy===
Müller is widely considered to be one of the greatest strikers and goalscorers in the history of football. He is seen as the greatest &quot;goal poacher&quot; in history, with Gary Lineker calling him &quot;the ultimate goal poacher&quot;. He is one of only two players, alongside Lionel Messi, to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League, the Ballon d&#x27;Or and the European Golden Shoe. After his death in 2021, FC Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer declared that Müller was &quot;the greatest striker there&#x27;s ever been&quot;, while Franz Beckenbauer stated that Müller was &quot;the most important player in the history of Bayern Munich&quot;.

==Career statistics==

===Club===

===International===

Müller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany. His 14 goals in FIFA World Cup tournaments were a record between 1974 and 2006. This score was bettered in 2006 by Brazil&#x27;s Ronaldo, and eight years later by German Miroslav Klose, who also broke Müller&#x27;s record for goals for Germany. However, Müller managed to score eight hat-tricks in his international career.

<text>QuakeNet is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, and was one of the largest IRC networks. The network was founded in 1997 by Garfield (Henrik Rasmussen, Denmark) and Oli (Oli Gustafsson, Sweden) as a new home for their respective countries&#x27; Quake channels. At its peak on February 8, 2005, the network recorded 243,394 simultaneous connections. , there are 9 servers and about 12,000 users remaining.

==About QuakeNet==
Founded in 1997 as an IRC network for QuakeWorld players, QuakeNet saw huge growth over the coming years as it attracted many other gamers. As interest in IRC started to decline, QuakeNet&#x27;s userbase followed suit.

==Services==
Channels often feature QuakeNet&#x27;s requestable bespoke channel service &#x27;Q&#x27;. Q is the main channel service and manages account authentication similar to nickname registration on servers with Nickserv; although there is no nickname protection service, instead operating on a first come first served basis. The other popular channel service seen in the larger channels is &#x27;S&#x27;. S is SpamScan, a service used to detect spam from channels and warn or later punish the offending users. Since April 2014, D was also added as a channel service which collects various statistic metrics about a channel, such as word counts and popular phrases.

Additional services include O as an operserv reference bot to the server operators on QuakeNet, and R (RequestBot) which allows users to request both Q and S if their channel meets their requirements. There are many other backend services which help QuakeNet staff administer the network. QuakeNet also is the home to many other third-party bot-operated services that can be used for various purposes to assist channel operators to run their channels or provide light entertainment. Many of these channels can be found using the channel search facility on the QuakeNet website.

==Webchat==
QuakeNet has a webchat client which allows users to connect to the network without the use of a dedicated IRC client. The client software, called qwebirc, was created by the QuakeNet development team. It is often embedded into other websites and also used by other IRC networks.

<doc id="172317" wikidata="Q1760601" url="?curid=172317" title="Ray transfer matrix analysis">
<text>Ray transfer matrix analysis (also known as ABCD matrix analysis) is a mathematical form for performing ray tracing calculations in sufficiently simple problems which can be solved considering only paraxial rays. Each optical element (surface, interface, mirror, or beam travel) is described by a ray transfer [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which operates on a vector describing an incoming light ray to calculate the outgoing ray. Multiplication of the successive matrices thus yields a concise ray transfer matrix describing the entire optical system. The same mathematics is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see electron optics.

This technique, as described below, is derived using the &quot;paraxial approximation&quot;, which requires that all ray directions (directions normal to the wavefronts) are at small angles relative to the optical axis of the system, such that the approximation remains valid. A small further implies that the transverse extent of the ray bundles ( and ) is small compared to the length of the optical system (thus &quot;paraxial&quot;). Since a decent imaging system where this is the case for all rays must still focus the paraxial rays correctly, this matrix method will properly describe the positions of focal planes and magnifications, however aberrations still need to be evaluated using full ray-tracing techniques.

== Matrix definition ==
The ray tracing technique is based on two reference planes, called the &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot; planes, each perpendicular to the optical axis of the system. At any point along the optical train an optical axis is defined corresponding to a central ray; that central ray is propagated to define the optical axis further in the optical train which need not be in the same physical direction (such as when bent by a prism or mirror). The transverse directions and (below we only consider the direction) are then defined to be orthogonal to the optical axes applying. A light ray enters a component crossing its input plane at a distance from the optical axis, traveling in a direction that makes an angle with the optical axis. After propagation to the output plane that ray is found at a distance from the optical axis and at an angle with respect to it. and are the indices of refraction of the media in the input and output plane, respectively.

The ABCD matrix representing a component or system relates the output ray to the input according to
formula_1
where the values of the 4 matrix elements are thus given by
formula_2
and
formula_3

This relates the &quot;ray vectors&quot; at the input and output planes by the &quot;ray transfer matrix&quot; () , which represents the optical component or system present between the two reference planes. A thermodynamics argument based on the blackbody radiation can be used to show that the determinant of a RTM is the ratio of the indices of refraction:
formula_4

As a result, if the input and output planes are located within the same medium, or within two different media which happen to have identical indices of refraction, then the determinant of is simply equal to 1.

A different convention for the ray vectors can be employed. Instead of using , the second element of the ray vector is , which is proportional not to the ray angle &quot;per se&quot; but to the transverse component of the wave vector.
This alters the ABCD matrices given in the table below where refraction at an interface is involved.

The use of transfer matrices in this manner parallels the matrices describing electronic two-port networks, particularly various so-called ABCD matrices which can similarly be multiplied to solve for cascaded systems.

== Some examples ==
=== Free space example ===
As one example, if there is free space between the two planes, the ray transfer matrix is given by: formula_5 where is the separation distance (measured along the optical axis) between the two reference planes. The ray transfer equation thus becomes: formula_6 and this relates the parameters of the two rays as: formula_7

=== Thin lens example ===
Another simple example is that of a thin lens. Its RTM is given by: formula_8 where is the focal length of the lens. To describe combinations of optical components, ray transfer matrices may be multiplied together to obtain an overall RTM for the compound optical system. For the example of free space of length followed by a lens of focal length : formula_9

Note that, since the multiplication of matrices is non-commutative, this is not the same RTM as that for a lens followed by free space:
formula_10

Thus the matrices must be ordered appropriately, with the last matrix premultiplying the second last, and so on until the first matrix is premultiplied by the second. Other matrices can be constructed to represent interfaces with media of different refractive indices, reflection from mirrors, etc.

== Eigenvalues ==
A ray transfer matrix can be regarded as a linear canonical transformation. According to the eigenvalues of the optical system, the system can be classified into several classes. Assume the ABCD matrix representing a system relates the output ray to the input according to
formula_11

We compute the eigenvalues of the matrix formula_12 that satisfy eigenequation
formula_13
by calculating the determinant
formula_14

Let formula_15, and we have eigenvalues formula_16.

According to the values of formula_17 and formula_18, there are several possible cases. For example:

# A pair of real eigenvalues: formula_19 and formula_20, where formula_21. This case represents a magnifier formula_22
# formula_23 or formula_24. This case represents unity matrix (or with an additional coordinate reverter) formula_25.
# formula_26. This case occurs if but not only if the system is either a unity operator, a section of free space, or a lens
# A pair of two unimodular, complex conjugated eigenvalues formula_27 and formula_28. This case is similar to a separable Fractional Fourier Transform.

== Matrices for simple optical components ==
== Relation between geometrical ray optics and wave optics ==
The theory of Linear canonical transformation implies the relation between ray transfer matrix (geometrical optics) and wave optics.

== Common decomposition ==
There exist infinite ways to decompose a ray transfer matrix formula_29 into a concatenation of multiple transfer matrices. For example in the special case when formula_30:

# formula_31.
# formula_32
# formula_33
# formula_34

== Resonator stability ==
RTM analysis is particularly useful when modeling the behavior of light in optical resonators, such as those used in lasers. At its simplest, an optical resonator consists of two identical facing mirrors of 100% reflectivity and radius of curvature , separated by some distance . For the purposes of ray tracing, this is equivalent to a series of identical thin lenses of focal length , each separated from the next by length . This construction is known as a &quot;lens equivalent duct&quot; or &quot;lens equivalent waveguide&quot;. The of each section of the waveguide is, as above,
formula_35

 analysis can now be used to determine the &quot;stability&quot; of the waveguide (and equivalently, the resonator). That is, it can be determined under what conditions light traveling down the waveguide will be periodically refocused and stay within the waveguide. To do so, we can find all the &quot;eigenrays&quot; of the system: the input ray vector at each of the mentioned sections of the waveguide times a real or complex factor is equal to the output one. This gives:
formula_36
which is an eigenvalue equation:
formula_37
where formula_38 is the identity matrix.

We proceed to calculate the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix:
formula_39
leading to the characteristic equation
formula_40
where
formula_41
is the trace of the , and
formula_42
is the determinant of the . After one common substitution we have:
formula_43
where
formula_44
is the &quot;stability parameter&quot;. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation. From the quadratic formula we find
formula_45

Now, consider a ray after passes through the system:
formula_46

If the waveguide is stable, no ray should stray arbitrarily far from the main axis, that is, must not grow without limit. Suppose Then both eigenvalues are real. Since one of them has to be bigger than 1 (in absolute value), which implies that the ray which corresponds to this eigenvector would not converge. Therefore, in a stable waveguide, and the eigenvalues can be represented by complex numbers:
formula_47
with the substitution .

For formula_48 let formula_49 and formula_50 be the eigenvectors with respect to the eigenvalues formula_51 and formula_52 respectively, which span all the vector space because they are orthogonal, the latter due to The input vector can therefore be written as
formula_53
for some constants formula_54 and 

After waveguide sectors, the output reads
formula_55
which represents a periodic function.

== Gaussian beams ==
The same matrices can also be used to calculate the evolution of Gaussian beams propagating through optical components described by the same transmission matrices. If we have a Gaussian beam of wavelength radius of curvature (positive for diverging, negative for converging), beam spot size and refractive index , it is possible to define a complex beam parameter by:
formula_56

(, , and are functions of position.) If the beam axis is in the direction, with waist at and Rayleigh range , this can be equivalently written as
formula_57

This beam can be propagated through an optical system with a given ray transfer matrix by using the equation:
formula_58
where is a normalization constant chosen to keep the second component of the ray vector equal to . Using matrix multiplication, this equation expands as
formula_59

Dividing the first equation by the second eliminates the normalization constant:
formula_60

It is often convenient to express this last equation in reciprocal form:
formula_61

=== Example: Free space ===
Consider a beam traveling a distance through free space, the ray transfer matrix is
formula_62
and so 
formula_63
consistent with the expression above for ordinary Gaussian beam propagation, i.e. As the beam propagates, both the radius and waist change.

=== Example: Thin lens ===
Consider a beam traveling through a thin lens with focal length . The ray transfer matrix is
formula_64
and so 
formula_65
formula_66
Only the real part of is affected: the wavefront curvature is reduced by the power of the lens , while the lateral beam size remains unchanged upon exiting the thin lens.

== Higher rank matrices ==
Methods using transfer matrices of higher dimensionality, that is , , and , are also used in optical analysis. In particular, propagation matrices are used in the design and analysis of prism sequences for pulse compression in femtosecond lasers.

<doc id="172318" wikidata="Q1343674" url="?curid=172318" title="Pediculosis">
<text>Pediculosis is an infestation of lice from the sub-order Anoplura, family Pediculidae. Accordingly, the infestation with head lice is named pediculosis capitis, while this with body lice, pediculosis corporis. Although &quot;pediculosis&quot; in humans may properly refer to lice infestation of any part of the body, the term is sometimes used loosely to refer to &quot;pediculosis capitis&quot;, the infestation of the human head with the specific head louse.

== Classification ==
Pediculosis may be divided into the following types:

:* Pediculosis capitis (Head lice infestation)
:* Pediculosis corporis (Body louse infestation, also known as Pediculosis vestimenti, Vagabond&#x27;s disease)
:* Pediculosis pubis (Pubic louse infestation, also known as phthiriasis)

==Head lice==
===Presentation===
Head-lice infestation is most frequent on children aged 3–10 and their families. The CDC estimates that 6 to 12 million children aged 3 to 11 get lice every year. Females aged 3–12 years are most commonly infested. Those of African descent rarely experience infestation due to differences in hair texture.

Head lice are spread through direct head-to-head contact with an infested person. From each egg or &quot;nit&quot; may hatch one nymph that will grow and develop to the adult louse. Lice feed on blood once or more often each day by piercing the skin with their tiny needle-like mouthparts. While feeding they excrete saliva, which irritates the skin and causes itching. Lice cannot burrow into the skin.

===Diagnosis===
To diagnose infestation, the entire scalp should be combed thoroughly with a louse comb and the teeth of the comb should be examined for the presence of living lice after each time the comb passes through the hair. The use of a louse comb is the most effective way to detect living lice.

The most characteristic symptom of infestation is pruritus (itching) on the head that normally intensifies 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation. The bite reaction is very mild and it can be rarely seen between the hairs. Excessive scratching of the infested areas can cause sores, which may become infected.

===Treatment===
The number of diagnosed cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually. There is no product or method that assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However, there are a number of treatment methods that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air, silicone-based lotions, and ethanol (ethyl alcohol).

Pediculosis is commonly treated with permethrin lotion. FDA-approved products include permethrin for children 2 months and older, ivermectin (Sklice) for age 6 months and older, and pyrethrins for age two and older. These products should be applied twice, a week or so apart. Occlusive agents like petrolatum (Vaseline) can kill lice but are not well-studied. Combing with a fine-tooth metal comb is the only way to remove eggs, repeating every two to three days for 2 weeks.

===Epidemiology===
About 14 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. Only a small proportion of those treated, however, may have objective evidence of an extant infestation. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world including Denmark, Sweden, U.K., France and Australia.
Normally head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, brushes, towels, clothing, beds or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service, and many American health agencies, report that lice &quot;prefer&quot; clean hair, because it&#x27;s easier to attach eggs and to cling to the strands.

Head lice (&quot;Pediculus humanus capitis&quot;) are not known to be vectors of diseases, unlike body lice (&quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;), which are known vectors of epidemic or louse-borne typhus (&quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot;), trench fever (&quot;Rochalimaea quintana&quot;) and louse-borne relapsing fever (&quot;Borrelia recurrentis&quot;).

==Body lice==
This condition is caused by body louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Pediculus humanus corporis&quot;), a louse that infests humans and is adapted to lay eggs in clothing, rather than at the base of hairs, and is thus of recent evolutionary origin.

==Pubic lice==
==Other animals==

Pediculosis is more common in cattle than any other type of domesticated animal. This is a significant problem, as it can cause weight loss of 55 to 75 pounds per animal. Some species of lice infesting cattle include the cattle biting louse (&quot;Bovicola bovis&quot;), the shortnosed cattle louse (&quot;Haematopinus eurysternus&quot;), the longnosed cattle louse (&quot;Linognathus vituli&quot;), and the little blue cattle louse (&quot;Solenopotes capillatus&quot;).

== History ==

In the 15th century, topical mercury treatment was used to treat pediculosis.

<doc id="172321" wikidata="Q652744" url="?curid=172321" title="Hand, foot, and mouth disease">
<text>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infection caused by a group of enteroviruses. It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet and mouth and occasionally buttocks and groin. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3–6 days after exposure to the virus. The rash generally resolves on its own in about a week. 
The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact, through the air from coughing, and via the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause, and enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. Other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally, a throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus.
Most people with hand, foot, and mouth disease get better on their own in 7 to 10 days. Most cases require no specific treatment. No antiviral medication or vaccine is available, but development efforts are underway. For fever and for painful mouth sores, over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used, though aspirin should be avoided in children. The illness is usually not serious. Occasionally, intravenous fluids are given to children who are dehydrated. Very rarely, viral meningitis or encephalitis may complicate the disease. Because HFMD is normally mild, some jurisdictions allow children to continue to go to child care and schools as long as they have no fever or uncontrolled drooling with mouth sores, and as long as they feel well enough to participate in classroom activities.
HFMD occurs in all areas of the world. It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. Large outbreaks have been occurring in Asia since 1997. It usually occurs during the spring, summer, and fall months. Typically it occurs in children less than five years old but can occasionally occur in adults. HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof-and-mouth disease), which mostly affects livestock.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Common constitutional signs and symptoms of HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants and toddlers. Skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, buttocks, and sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.

==Cause==
The viruses that cause the disease are of the &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; family. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible.

===Transmission===
HFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal–oral transmission. It is possible to be infectious for days to weeks after the symptoms have resolved.

Childcare settings are the most common places for HFMD to be contracted because of toilet training, diaper changes, and children&#x27;s propensity to put their hands into their mouths. HFMD is contracted through nose and throat secretions such as saliva, sputum, and nasal mucus as well as fluid in blisters, and stool.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture. The common incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from three to six days. Early detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population.

==Prevention==
Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures are effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.

Protective habits include hand washing and disinfecting surfaces in play areas. Breastfeeding has also been shown to decrease rates of severe HFMD, though does not reduce the risk of the infection of the disease.

===Vaccine===
A vaccine known as the EV71 vaccine is available to prevent HFMD in China . No vaccine is currently available in the United States.

==Treatment==
Medications are usually not needed as hand, foot, and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically resolves on its own. Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot, and mouth disease. Disease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately 1 week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers can help decrease body temperature.

A minority of individuals with hand, foot, and mouth disease may require hospital admission due to complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis. Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur.

==Complications==
Complications from the viral infections that cause HFMD are rare but require immediate medical treatment if present. HFMD infections caused by Enterovirus 71 tend to be more severe and are more likely to have neurologic or cardiac complications including death than infections caused by Coxsackievirus A16. Viral or aseptic meningitis can occur with HFMD in rare cases and is characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The condition is usually mild and clears without treatment; however, hospitalization for a short time may be needed. Other serious complications of HFMD include encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or flaccid paralysis in rare circumstances.

Fingernail and toenail loss have been reported in children 4–8 weeks after having HFMD. The relationship between HFMD and the reported nail loss is unclear; however, it is temporary and nail growth resumes without treatment.

Minor complications due to symptoms can occur such as dehydration, due to mouth sores causing discomfort with intake of foods and fluid.

==Epidemiology==
Hand, foot and mouth disease most commonly occurs in children under the age of 10 and more often under the age of 5, but it can also affect adults with varying symptoms. It tends to occur in outbreaks during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. This is believed to be due to heat and humidity improving spread. HFMD is more common in rural areas than urban areas; however, socioeconomic status and hygiene levels need to be considered. Poor hygiene is a risk factor for HFMD.

===Outbreaks===
* In 1997, an outbreak occurred in Sarawak of Malaysia with 600 cases and over 30 children died.
* In 1998, there was an outbreak in Taiwan, affecting mainly children. There were 405 severe complications, and 78 children died. The total number of cases in that epidemic is estimated to have been 1.5 million.
* In 2008 an outbreak in China, beginning in March in Fuyang, Anhui, led to 25,000 infections, and 42 deaths, by May 13. Similar outbreaks were reported in Singapore (more than 2,600 cases as of April 20, 2008), Vietnam (2,300 cases, 11 deaths), Mongolia (1,600 cases), and Brunei (1053 cases from June–August 2008)
* In 2009 17 children died in an outbreak during March and April 2009 in China&#x27;s eastern Shandong Province, and 18 children died in the neighboring Henan Province. Out of 115,000 reported cases in China from January to April, 773 were severe and 50 were fatal.
* In 2010 in China, an outbreak occurred in southern China&#x27;s Guangxi Autonomous Region as well as Guangdong, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. Until March, 70,756 children were infected and 40 died from the disease. By June, the peak season for the disease, 537 had died.
* The World Health Organization reporting between January and October 2011 (1,340,259) states the number of cases in China had dropped by approx 300,000 from 2010 (1,654,866) cases, with new cases peaking in June. There were 437 deaths, down from 2010 (537 deaths).
* In December 2011, the California Department of Public Health identified a strong form of the virus, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), where nail loss in children is common.
* In 2012 in Alabama, United States there was an outbreak of an unusual type of the disease. It occurred in a season when it is not usually seen and affected teenagers and older adults. There were some hospitalizations due to the disease but no reported deaths.
* In 2012 in Cambodia, 52 of 59 reviewed cases of children reportedly dead () due to a mysterious disease were diagnosed to be caused by a virulent form of HFMD. Although a significant degree of uncertainty exists with reference to the diagnosis, the WHO report states, &quot;Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients.&quot;
* HFMD infected 1,520,274 people with up to 431 deaths reported at the end of July in 2012 in China.
* In 2018, more than 50,000 cases occurred through a nationwide outbreak in Malaysia with two deaths also reported.

=== India 2022 ===
An outbreak of an illness referred to as &quot;tomato fever&quot; or &quot;tomato flu&quot; was identified in the Kollam district on May 6, 2022. The illness is endemic to Kerala, India and gets its name because of the red and round blisters it causes, which look like tomatoes. The disease may be a new variant of the viral HFMD or an effect of chikungunya or dengue fever. &quot;Flu&quot; may be a misnomer.

The condition mainly affects children under the age of five. An article in &quot;The Lancet&quot; states that the appearance of the blisters is similar to that seen in Mpox, and the illness is not thought to be related to SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms, treatment and prevention are similar to HFMD.

==History==
HFMD cases were first described clinically in Canada and New Zealand in 1957. The disease was termed &quot;Hand Foot and Mouth Disease&quot;, by Thomas Henry Flewett, after a similar outbreak in 1960.

==Research==
Novel antiviral agents to prevent and treat infection with the viruses responsible for HFMD are currently under development. Preliminary studies have shown inhibitors of the EV-71 viral capsid to have potent antiviral activity.

<doc id="172323" wikidata="Q155857" url="?curid=172323" title="Rubella">
<text>Rubella, also known as German measles or three-day measles, is an infection caused by the rubella virus. This disease is often mild, with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. Joint pain is common in adults. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, encephalitis, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a miscarriage or a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Symptoms of CRS manifest as problems with the eyes such as cataracts, deafness, as well as affecting the heart and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.

Rubella is usually spread from one person to the next through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year. Only humans are infected. Insects do not spread the disease. Once recovered, people are immune to future infections. Testing is available that can verify immunity. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood, throat, or urine. Testing the blood for antibodies may also be useful.

Rubella is preventable with the rubella vaccine, with a single dose being more than 95% effective. Often it is given in combination with the measles vaccine and mumps vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine. When some, but less than 80%, of a population is vaccinated, more women may reach childbearing age without developing immunity by infection or vaccination, thus possibly raising CRS rates. Once infected there is no specific treatment.

Rubella is a common infection in many areas of the world. Each year about 100,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome occur. Rates of disease have decreased in many areas as a result of vaccination. There are ongoing efforts to eliminate the disease globally. In April 2015, the World Health Organization declared the Americas free of rubella transmission. The name &quot;rubella&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;little red&quot;. It was first described as a separate disease by German physicians in 1814, resulting in the name &quot;German measles&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

Rubella has symptoms similar to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days, which is why it is often referred to as three-day measles. The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low-grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.

The swollen glands or lymph nodes can persist for up to a week and the fever rarely rises above 38 °C (100.4 °F). The rash of rubella is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer spots occur in 20% of cases and are characterized by small, red papules on the area of the soft palate.

Rubella can affect anyone of any age. Adult females are particularly prone to arthritis and joint pains.

In children, rubella normally causes symptoms that last two days and include:
* Rash begins on the face which spreads to the rest of the body.
* Low fever of less than .
* Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.

In older children and adults, additional symptoms may be present, including
* Swollen glands
* Coryza (cold-like symptoms)
* Aching joints (especially in young females)

Severe complications of rubella include:
* Brain inflammation (encephalitis)
* Low platelet count
* Ear infection

Coryza in rubella may convert to pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).

===Congenital rubella syndrome===
Rubella can cause congenital rubella syndrome in the newborn, this being the most severe sequela of rubella. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic, and auditory defects. It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hepatitis. The risk of major defects in organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester. CRS is the main reason a vaccine for rubella was developed.

80–90% of mothers who contract rubella within the critical first trimester have either a miscarriage or a stillborn baby. If the fetus survives the infection, it can be born with severe heart disorders (patent ductus arteriosus being the most common), blindness, deafness, or other life-threatening organ disorders. The skin manifestations are called &quot;blueberry muffin lesions&quot;. For these reasons, rubella is included in the TORCH complex of perinatal infections.

About 100,000 cases of this condition occur each year.

==Cause==
The disease is caused by the rubella virus, in the genus Rubivirus from the family Matonaviridae, that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome. The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes. The virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has teratogenic properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them. During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter.

Increased susceptibility to infection might be inherited as there is some indication that HLA-A1 or factors surrounding A1 on extended haplotypes are involved in virus infection or non-resolution of the disease.

==Diagnosis==
Rubella virus specific IgM antibodies are present in people recently infected by rubella virus, but these antibodies can persist for over a year, and a positive test result needs to be interpreted with caution. The presence of these antibodies along with, or a short time after, the characteristic rash confirms the diagnosis.

==Prevention==

Rubella infections are prevented by active immunization programs using live attenuated virus vaccines. Two live attenuated virus vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were effective in the prevention of adult disease. However, their use in prepubertal females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children.

The vaccine is now usually given as part of the MMR vaccine. The WHO recommends the first dose be given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months. Pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on. Women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus.

The immunisation program has been quite successful. Cuba declared the disease eliminated in the 1990s, and in 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of rubella had been eliminated from the United States. The World Health Organization declared Australia rubella free in October 2018.

Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States for all women of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period.

In susceptible people passive immunization, in the form of polyclonal immunoglobulins, appears effective up to the fifth day post-exposure.

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for rubella; however, management is a matter of responding to symptoms to diminish discomfort. Treatment of newborn babies is focused on management of the complications. Congenital heart defects and cataracts can be corrected by direct surgery.

Management for ocular congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is similar to that for age-related macular degeneration, including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required.

==Prognosis==
Rubella infection of children and adults is usually mild, self-limiting, and often asymptomatic. The prognosis in children born with CRS is poor.

==Epidemiology==
Rubella occurs worldwide. The virus tends to peak during the spring in countries with temperate climates. Before the vaccine against rubella was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6–9 years in the United States and 3–5 years in Europe, mostly affecting children in the 5–9 year old age group. Since the introduction of vaccine, occurrences have become rare in those countries with high uptake rates.

Vaccination has interrupted the transmission of rubella in the Americas: no endemic case has been observed since February 2009. Vaccination is still strongly recommended as the virus could be reintroduced from other continents should vaccination rates in the Americas drop. During the epidemic in the US between 1962 and 1965, rubella virus infections during pregnancy were estimated to have caused 30,000 stillbirths and 20,000 children to be born impaired or disabled as a result of CRS. Universal immunisation producing a high level of herd immunity is important in the control of epidemics of rubella.

In the UK, there remains a large population of men susceptible to rubella who have not been vaccinated. Outbreaks of rubella occurred amongst many young men in the UK in 1993 and in 1996 the infection was transmitted to pregnant women, many of whom were immigrants and were susceptible. Outbreaks still arise, usually in developing countries where the vaccine is not as accessible. The complications encountered in pregnancy from rubella infection (miscarriage, fetal death, congenital rubella syndrome) are more common in Africa and Southeast Asia at a rate of 121 per 100,000 live births compared to 2 per 100,000 live births in the Americas and Europe.

In Japan, 15,000 cases of rubella and 43 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases between October 15, 2012, and March 2, 2014, during the 2012–13 rubella outbreak in Japan. They mainly occurred in men aged 31–51 and young adults aged 24–34.

==History==

Rubella was first described in the mid-eighteenth century. German physician and chemist, Friedrich Hoffmann, made the first clinical description of rubella in 1740, which was confirmed by de Bergen in 1752 and Orlow in 1758.

In 1814, George de Maton first suggested that it be considered a disease distinct from both measles and scarlet fever. All these physicians were German, and the disease was known as Rötheln (contemporary German &quot;Röteln&quot;). (&quot;Rötlich&quot; means &quot;reddish&quot; or &quot;pink&quot; in German.) The fact that three Germans described it led to the common name of &quot;German measles.&quot; Henry Veale, an English Royal Artillery surgeon, described an outbreak in India. He coined the name &quot;rubella&quot; (from the Latin word, meaning &quot;little red&quot;) in 1866.

It was formally recognised as an individual entity in 1881, at the International Congress of Medicine in London. In 1914, Alfred Fabian Hess theorised that rubella was caused by a virus, based on work with monkeys. In 1938, Hiro and Tosaka confirmed this by passing the disease to children using filtered nasal washings from acute cases.

In 1940, there was a widespread epidemic of rubella in Australia. Subsequently, ophthalmologist Norman McAllister Gregg found 78 cases of congenital cataracts in infants and 68 of them were born to mothers who had caught rubella in early pregnancy. Gregg published an account, &quot;Congenital Cataract Following German Measles in the Mother&quot;, in 1941. He described a variety of problems now known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and noticed that the earlier the mother was infected, the worse the damage was. Since no vaccine was yet available, some popular magazines promoted the idea of &quot;German measles parties&quot; for infected children to spread the disease to other children (especially girls) to immunize them for life and protect them from later catching the disease when pregnant. The virus was isolated in tissue culture in 1962 by two separate groups led by physicians Paul Douglas Parkman and Thomas Huckle Weller.

There was a pandemic of rubella between 1962 and 1965, starting in Europe and spreading to the United States. In the years 1964–65, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases (1964–1965 rubella epidemic). This led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Of these, 2,100 died as neonates, 12,000 were deaf, 3,580 were blind, and 1,800 were intellectually disabled. In New York alone, CRS affected 1% of all births.

In 1967, the molecular structure of rubella was observed under electron microscopy using antigen-antibody complexes by Jennifer M. Best, June Almeida, J E Banatvala and A P Waterson.

In 1969, a live attenuated virus vaccine was licensed. In the early 1970s, a triple vaccine containing attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) viruses was introduced. By 2006, confirmed cases in the Americas had dropped below 3000 a year. However, a 2007 outbreak in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile pushed the cases to 13,000 that year.

=== Eradication efforts ===
On January 22, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization declared and certified Colombia free of rubella and became the first Latin American country to eliminate the disease within its borders. On April 29, 2015, the Americas became the first WHO region to officially eradicate the disease. The last non-imported cases occurred in 2009 in Argentina and Brazil. The Pan American Health Organization director remarked, &quot;The fight against rubella has taken more than 15 years, but it has paid off with what I believe will be one of the most important pan-American public health achievements of the 21st Century.&quot; The declaration was made after 165 million health records and genetically confirming that all recent cases were caused by known imported strains of the virus. Rubella is still common in some regions of the world and Susan E. Reef, team lead for rubella at the CDC&#x27;s global immunization division, who joined in the announcement, said there was no chance it would be eradicated worldwide before 2020. Rubella is the third disease to be eliminated from the Western Hemisphere with vaccination after smallpox and polio.

==Etymology==
From &quot;rubrum&quot; the Latin for &quot;red&quot;, rubella means &quot;reddish and small&quot;. &quot;German&quot; measles derives from &quot;germanus&quot; which means &quot;similar&quot; in this context.

The name &quot;rubella&quot; is sometimes confused with &quot;rubeola&quot;, an alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries; the diseases are unrelated. In some other European languages, like Spanish, &quot;rubella&quot; and &quot;rubeola&quot; are synonyms, and &quot;rubeola&quot; is not an alternative name for measles. Thus, in Spanish, &quot;rubeola&quot; refers to rubella and &quot;sarampión&quot; refers to measles.

<text>Fußball-Club Bayern München e. V. (FCB, ), commonly known as Bayern Munich (), FC Bayern () or simply Bayern, is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. They are most known for their men&#x27;s professional football team, who play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern are the most successful club in German football and are among the world&#x27;s most decorated, having won a record 33 national titles, including eleven consecutive titles from 2013 to 2023 and a record 20 national cups, alongside numerous European titles.

Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by eleven players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga during its inception in 1963. The club found success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, and it became the second European club to achieve this feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player awards, five European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men&#x27;s Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.

By winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the &quot;sextuple&quot; (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club can win in a calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA&#x27;s main club competitions and the only German club to achieve that. As of November 2024, Bayern Munich are ranked third in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.

Since the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. Bayern Munich has the largest revenue out of any German sports club and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, earning €634.1 million in 2021. In February 2025, Bayern had more than 400,000 official members and 4,070 officially registered fan clubs, with over 318.000 members, most in the world. The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football, with more than 1,100 active members.

==History==
===Early years (1900s–1960s)===

Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), eleven members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against Nordstern, and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship. In the following years, the club won some local trophies, and, in 1910–11, Bayern joined the newly founded &quot;Kreisliga&quot;, the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany. By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had its first German national team player, Max Gablonsky. By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.

In the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later. Its first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard &quot;Little Dombi&quot; Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.

The rise of Adolf Hitler to power put an abrupt end to Bayern&#x27;s development. Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the &quot;Jew&#x27;s club&quot;, while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination. Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of gifted young centre-forward Oskar Rohr to Switzerland. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.

After the end of the Second World War in 1945, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947, and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club&#x27;s president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed the most important figure in Bayern&#x27;s transition to a professional club. In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the &quot;Oberliga&quot; in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.

The club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. President Reitlinger was ousted in the club&#x27;s elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler, who provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga. Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when Wilhelm Neudecker, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.

In 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals 1860 Munich, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement. After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired Zlatko Čajkovski, who in 1962 led 1. FC Köln to the national championship. Fielding a team with young players like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier – who would later be collectively referred to as &quot;the axis&quot;, they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.

===The golden years (1960s–1970s)===

In their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year&#x27;s European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which they won in the final against Scottish club Rangers, Franz Roth scoring the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory. In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern&#x27;s offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of five German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.

Udo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1, so won the title, while also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored. Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay. This title – after winning the Cup Winners&#x27; trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club&#x27;s breakthrough as a force on the international stage.
During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically, but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup final, when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. &quot;We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky&quot;, stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was &quot;very suspicious&quot;. Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years. A year later in the final in Glasgow, another Roth goal helped defeat Saint-Étienne, and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs. The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. &quot;Bayerndusel&quot; was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.

===From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s)===
The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed &quot;FC Breitnigge&quot;, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern, though, finished as runner-up in the European Cups of 1982 and 1987.

Jupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern&#x27;s form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who were the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion during Bayern&#x27;s time playing there. Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.

His successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club&#x27;s high expectations. During this time, Bayern&#x27;s players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname &quot;FC Hollywood&quot;. Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.

===Renewed international success (1990s–2000s)===

After his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld&#x27;s first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match. The following year, in the club&#x27;s centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season. Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties. The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup, but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points. Hitzfeld&#x27;s reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.

Felix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shared with 1860 Munich. On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.

Hitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season in fourth position, meaning no Champions League qualification for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.

===Domestic dominance and continental treble (2000s–2010s)===
For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. Among new signings were 2006 World Cup players such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern won the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund. After the season, Bayern&#x27;s long-term goalkeeper Oliver Kahn retired, which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons. The club&#x27;s coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also retired and Jürgen Klinsmann was chosen as his successor. However, Klinsmann was sacked before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed Wolfsburg in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to Bayer Leverkusen, and were defeated in the quarterfinal of the Champions League by Barcelona, conceding four goals in the first half of the first leg. Jupp Heynckes was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.

For the 2009–10 season, Bayern hired Dutch manager Louis van Gaal, and Dutch forward Arjen Robben joined Bayern. Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern&#x27;s playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo &quot;Robbery&quot;. In addition, David Alaba and Thomas Müller were promoted to the first team. Van Gaal stated: &quot;With me, Müller always plays&quot;, which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years. On the pitch, Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double and losing only in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan. Van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League, again by Inter.

Heynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the 2011–12 season. Although the club had signed Manuel Neuer, ending Bayern&#x27;s quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and Jérôme Boateng for the season, Bayern remained without a title for a second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup. The Champions League final was held at the Allianz Arena and Bayern reached the final in their home stadium but lost to Chelsea on penalties. Bayern Munich went on to win all titles in 2012–13. They set various Bundesliga records along the way, becoming the first German team to win the treble. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only eleven points shy of a perfect season. In what was Bayern&#x27;s third Champions League final appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1. A week later, they completed the treble by winning the DFB-Pokal final against Stuttgart. During the season, the club announced that they would hire Pep Guardiola as coach for the 2013–14 season. Originally, the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but Uli Hoeneß later admitted that it was not Heynckes&#x27;s decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club&#x27;s desire to appoint Guardiola.

Guardiola&#x27;s first season started off well, with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the previous season to 53 matches. An eventual loss to Augsburg came two match days after Bayern had won the league title. During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the cup to complete their tenth domestic double, but lost in the semi-final of the Champions League to Real Madrid. Off the pitch, Bayern&#x27;s president Uli Hoeneß was convicted of tax evasion in March 2014, and sentenced to years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day, and vice-president Karl Hopfner was elected president in May. Under Guardiola, Bayern also won the Bundesliga in 2014–15 and 2015–16, including another double in 2015–16, but did not advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club&#x27;s leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.

Carlo Ancelotti was hired as successor to Guardiola. Off the pitch, Uli Hoeneß had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016. Under Ancelotti, Bayern won a fifth consecutive league title. In July 2017, Bayern announced that 1860 Munich would leave the Allianz for good as the club had been relegated to the fourth-tier Regionalliga. During the 2017–18 season, Bayern&#x27;s performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, and Ancelotti was sacked after a 3–0 loss to Paris St. Germain in the Champions League, early in his second season. Willy Sagnol took over as interim manager for a week, before Jupp Heynckes was announced as coach for the rest of the season, in what was his fourth spell at the club. During the season, the club urged Heynckes—even publicly—to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire after the season. Heynckes led the club to another championship, but lost the cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht&#x27;s coach, Niko Kovač, was named Heynckes&#x27; successor at Bayern. In Kovač&#x27;s first season at Bayern, the club was eliminated by Liverpool in the round of 16 in the Champions League, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarter-final. Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title, however, as they finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry&#x27;s ninth and Robben&#x27;s eighth. A week later, Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal final to win their 19th German Cup and to complete their 12th domestic double.

===Return to German coaches (2019–2024)===
Kovač was sacked after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Hansi Flick being promoted to interim manager in November 2019. After a satisfying spell as interim, Bayern announced a month later that Flick would remain in charge. Under Flick, the club won the league, having played the most successful second half of a Bundesliga season in history, winning all but one match, which was drawn. The club also won the cup, completing the club&#x27;s 13th domestic double. In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, having beaten Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals. Bayern defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0 in the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match. Bayern became the second European club after Barcelona to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons.

Bayern started the 2020–21 season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. Bayern also won the FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Mexican team Tigres 1–0 in the final. Bayern became the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona did so in 2009. The club also won its ninth Bundesliga title in a row. During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller&#x27;s record for most goals scored in a Bundesliga season, having scored 41 times in 29 matches. Flick left at the end of the 2020–21 season to manage the Germany national team, and at Flick&#x27;s request, RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann succeeded him. According to several news reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m as compensation for Nagelsmann&#x27;s services, a world record for a manager.

Under Nagelsmann, Bayern won its 10th consecutive Bundesliga title. In March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced with Thomas Tuchel, who led the club to a record eleventh consecutive title, after winning a close title race with Borussia Dortmund. In August 2023, Bayern broke the German transfer record again, signing England captain and all-time leading goalscorer Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of €110m. In February 2024, Bayern and Tuchel announced the end of their cooperation after the end of the season. The 2023–24 Bundesliga was the first season in a decade Bayern Munich did not win the Bundesliga, losing it to Bayer Leverkusen.

On 29 May 2024, Vincent Kompany was confirmed as the new head coach of Bayern and received a three-year contract. Bayern started the 2024–25 Bundesliga season with a 3–2 win at VfL Wolfsburg.

==Kits==
In the original club constitution, Bayern&#x27;s colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult. For most of the club&#x27;s early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and, in 2000, the club released a traditional all-red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a &quot;Rotwein&quot;-coloured home kit in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.

The club&#x27;s away kit has had a wide range of colours, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the 2013–14 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a &quot;Lederhosen&quot;-inspired white and black &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; away kit, and an all-navy blue international kit.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.

==Crest==

Bayern&#x27;s crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954. The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes &quot;Bayern FA&quot;, whereby &quot;FA&quot; stands for &quot;Fußball-Abteilung&quot;, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.

The modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps. While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.

==Stadiums==

Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC&#x27;s ground at the Leopoldstraße. As the crowds gathering for Bayern&#x27;s home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.

From 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until the Second World War, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as &quot;Sechz&#x27;ger&quot; (&quot;Sixties&quot;) Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern&#x27;s record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000, which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period&#x27;s stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Since 1995, the second teams and youth teams of both clubs played in the stadium.
For the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture, was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world, and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In the following years, the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent. Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium&#x27;s track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.
After much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier, increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council, with the Allianz Arena holding a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).

The stadium&#x27;s most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for Germany national team home games.

In May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.

==Supporters==

At the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members. This made the club the largest fan membership club in the world. Bayern has an average of 75,000 fans at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years. Bayern&#x27;s away games have also been sold out for many years. According to a study by Sport+Markt from 2010, Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, ranking first of all German clubs.

The club&#x27;s most prominent ultra groups are &quot;Schickeria München&quot;, &quot;Inferno Bavaria&quot;, &quot;Red Munichs &#x27;89&quot;, &quot;Südkurve &#x27;73&quot;, &quot;Munichmaniacs 1996&quot;, &quot;Red Angels&quot;, and &quot;Red Sharks&quot;. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia, and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.

Stern des Südens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s, they also used to sing &quot;FC Bayern, Forever Number One&quot;. Another notable song is &quot;Mia San Mia&quot; (Bavarian for &quot;we are who we are&quot;), which is a well-known motto of the club as well. A renowned catchphrase for the team is &quot;&quot;Packmas&quot;, which is a Bavarian phrase for the German &quot;Packen wir es&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;let&#x27;s do it&quot;. The club&#x27;s mascot is an anthropomorphic bear named &quot;Berni&quot; since 2004.

The club also has had a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI, Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria.

==Rivalries==

=== Borussia Dortmund ===
Bayern–Dortmund are two of the most successful teams in German football, having won a combined total of 26 of the past 31 Bundesliga titles as of the 2023–24 season. The two teams fought closely for the Bundesliga title in the early 2010s, and met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The rivalry between the clubs grew during the 1990s, as Dortmund&#x27;s stature increased to challenge perennial title favourites Bayern, winning two Bundesliga titles in 1994–95 and 1995–96.

In 1996, Bayern captain Lothar Matthäus accused Germany teammate Andreas Möller of being a &#x27;crybaby&#x27;, wiping imaginary tears from his face; Möller reacted by slapping Matthäus. At the end of that season, Dortmund won the 1997 UEFA Champions League final which happened to be played at the Olympiastadion, Bayern&#x27;s home ground.

The teams met in the quarter-finals of the next edition of the Champions League, and Dortmund prevailed over two legs thanks to a single goal from Stéphane Chapuisat. That summer, Bayern hired Dortmund&#x27;s successful coach Ottmar Hitzfeld to work for them. Tempers flared twice during Bayern and Dortmund&#x27;s second meeting in the 1998–99 Bundesliga, as Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn first attempted a flying kung-fu kick at Chapuisat, and later appeared to bite Heiko Herrlich&#x27;s ear.

In the early 2000s both clubs remained successful, as Bayern lost one Champions League final (1999) then won another (2001) in addition to more domestic success, while Dortmund won the 2001–02 Bundesliga and reached the UEFA Cup final the same year. An angry 2001 league meeting between the pair was notable for ten yellow cards and three red being shown (a Bundesliga record for indiscipline). However, Dortmund soon fell heavily into debt, and a €2m loan from Bayern in 2004 was a major reason for them being saved from bankruptcy.

On 19 April 2008, the two sides clashed in the 2008 DFB-Pokal final for the first time that took place in Berlin. Luca Toni opened the scoring after eleven minutes, but Mladen Petric drew Dortmund level in stoppage time, forcing thirty additional minutes. The Italian completed his double in extra time, thus lifting Bayern to cup glory.

=== European Rivals ===
Amongst Bayern&#x27;s chief European rivals are FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan, and Manchester United. Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 28 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the &quot;Bestia negra&quot; (&quot;Black Beast&quot;). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.

==Organization and finance==
Bayern is mostly led by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoeneß served as the club&#x27;s president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud. Oliver Kahn was chairman of the executive board of the AG. The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club&#x27;s president and the board&#x27;s chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus Höttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche Börse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).

Professional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation &quot;FC Bayern München AG&quot;. &quot;AG&quot; is short for &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot;, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of &quot;FC Bayern München AG&quot; is owned by the club, the &quot;FC Bayern München e. V.&quot; (&quot;e. V.&quot; is short for &quot;eingetragener Verein&quot;, which translates into &quot;registered association&quot;). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total. Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena. In 2009, Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena. And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule. Bayern&#x27;s other sports departments are run by the club.
Bayern&#x27;s shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern&#x27;s shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season. Previous kit sponsors were Adidas (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco (1978–84), Commodore (1984–89) and Opel (1989–2002). Bayern&#x27;s kit manufacturer is Adidas, who have been Bayern&#x27;s kit manufacturer since 1974. The deal with Adidas runs until the end of the 2029–30 season.

Bayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years. Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern&#x27;s commercial revenue was €348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern&#x27;s matchday revenue trails other top clubs at €103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue). In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranks Bayern as the world&#x27;s fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club&#x27;s value at €2.5 billion.

While other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany. Since the 2010s, Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017, where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014, Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States. In March 2017, Bayern opened an office in Shanghai, China.

==Social engagement and charity==
Bayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami the &quot;FC Bayern – Hilfe e. V.&quot; was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club. At its inception, this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club. The money was, amongst other things, used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka, and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.

The club has also assisted other sport clubs in financial disarray. The club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with player transfers at favourable rates and direct money transfers. When St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game, giving all gate receipts to St. Pauli. In 1993, Alexander Zickler transferred from Dynamo Dresden to Bayern for 2.3 Million DM, with many considering the sum to have been a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund. In 2009, Mark van Bommel&#x27;s home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress; Bayern played a charity game at the Dutch club, gifting them gate receipts. In 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division side Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa&#x27;s licence. In 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach, with all gate receipts going to Kickers Offenbach. Two years later, Bayern played a benefit match against Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern. In March 2020, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In mid-2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football. In 2016, Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children&#x27;s social programme Football for Friendship.

==Training facility==

Bayern Munich headquarters and training facility is called Säbener Straße and it is located in the Untergiesing-Harlaching borough of Munich. The first team and the reserve team train at the facility. There are five grass pitches, two of which have undersoil heating, two artificial grass fields, a beach volleyball court and a multi-functional sports hall.

In August 2017, the club&#x27;s sports complex, FC Bayern Campus, opened at a cost of €70 million. The campus is located north of Munich at Ingolstädter Straße. The campus is 30 hectare and has eight football pitches for youth teams from the U-9s to the U-19s and the women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; teams. The campus also has a 2,500-capacity stadium where the U-17s and the U-19s play their matches. The Allianz Bayern Akademie is located on the campus site, and the academy has 35 apartments for young talents who do not live in the Greater Munich area. The academy building also has offices for youth coaches and staff.

==Honours==

Bayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships and the most cups. They are also Germany&#x27;s most successful team in international competitions, having won fourteen trophies. Bayern is the only club to have won all three major European competitions, to have won three consecutive European Cups and to have won the treble twice, one of which was part of the larger, and more elusive, &quot;sextuple&quot; (2020).

The reserve team, FC Bayern Munich II, serves mainly as the final stepping stone for promising young players before being promoted to the main team. The second team is coached by Sebastian Hoeneß. The team competes in the Regionalliga Bayern, the fourth level of German football. Their greatest achievement to date was winning the 3. Liga in the 2019–20 season. Since the inception of the Regionalliga in 1994, the team played in the Regionalliga Süd, after playing in the Oberliga since 1978. In the 2007–08 season, they qualified for the newly founded 3. Liga, where they lasted until 2011 when they were relegated to the Regionalliga. This ended 33 consecutive years of playing in the highest league that the German Football Association permits the second team of a professional football team to play.
The youth academy has produced some of Europe&#x27;s top football players, including Thomas Hitzlsperger, Owen Hargreaves, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Müller.

<doc id="172327" wikidata="Q1724539" url="?curid=172327" title="Congenital rubella syndrome">
<text>Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) occurs when a human fetus is infected with the rubella virus (German measles) via maternal-fetal transmission and develops birth defects. The most common congenital defects affect the ophthalmologic, cardiac, auditory, and neurologic systems.

Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in various outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to congenital defects to miscarriage and fetal death. If infection occurs 0–11 weeks after conception, the infant has a 90% risk of being affected. If the infection occurs 12–20 weeks after conception, the risk is 20%. Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester. Diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome is made through a series of clinical and laboratory findings and management is based on the infant&#x27;s clinical presentation. Maintaining rubella outbreak control via vaccination is essential in preventing congenital rubella infection and congenital rubella syndrome.

Congenital rubella syndrome was discovered in 1941 by Australian Norman McAlister Gregg.

==Signs and symptoms==

The classic triad for congenital rubella syndrome is:
* Sensorineural deafness (58% of patients)
* Eye abnormalities—especially retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and microphthalmia (43% of patients)
* Congenital heart disease—especially pulmonary artery stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus (50% of patients)

Other manifestations of CRS may include:
* Spleen, liver, or bone marrow problems (some of which may disappear shortly after birth)
* Intellectual disability
* Small head size (microcephaly)
* Low birth weight
* Thrombocytopenic purpura, leading to easy or excessive bleeding or bruising
* Extramedullary hematopoiesis (presents as a characteristic blueberry muffin rash)
* Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)
* Small jaw size (micrognathia)
* Radiolucent bone disease
* Skin lesions 

Children who have been exposed to rubella in the womb should also be watched closely as they age for any indication of:
* Developmental delay
* Autism
* Schizophrenia
* Growth retardation
* Learning disabilities
* Thyroid disorders
* Diabetes mellitus

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome is made based on clinical findings and laboratory criteria. Laboratory criteria includes at least one of the following:
* Detection of the rubella virus via RT-PCR
* Detection of rubella-specific IgM antibody
* Detection of infant rubella-specific IgG antibody at higher levels (and persists for a longer time) than expected for passive maternal transmission
* Isolation of the rubella virus by nasal, blood, throat, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid specimens

Clinical definition is characterized by findings in the following categories:

# Cataracts/congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease (most commonly, patent ductus arteriosus or peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis), hearing impairment, pigmentary retinopathy
# Purpura, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, microcephaly, developmental delay, meningoencephalitis, radiolucent bone disease

A patient is classified into the following cases depending on their clinical and laboratory findings:
* Suspected: A patient that has one or more of the clinical findings listed above but does not meet the definition for probable or confirmed classification
* Probable: A patient that does not have laboratory confirmation of congenital rubella but has either two clinical findings from Group 1 as listed above OR one clinical finding from Group 1 and one clinical finding from Group 2 as listed above
* Confirmed: A patient with at least one laboratory finding and one clinical finding (from either group) as listed above
* Infection only: A patient with no clinical findings as described above but meeting at least one confirmed laboratory criteria

==Prevention==
Vaccinating the majority of the population is effective at preventing congenital rubella syndrome. With the introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969, the number of cases of rubella in the United States has decreased 99%, from 57,686 cases in 1969 to 271 cases in 1999. For women who plan to become pregnant, the MMR (measles mumps, rubella) vaccination is highly recommended, at least 28 days prior to conception. The vaccine should not be given to women who are already pregnant as it contains live viral particles. Other preventative actions can include the screening and vaccinations of high-risk personnel, such as medical and child care professions.

Infants with birth defects suspected to be caused by congenital rubella infection should be investigated thoroughly. Confirmed cases should be reported to the local or state health department to assess control of the virus and isolation of the infant should be maintained.

== Management ==
Infants with known rubella exposure during pregnancy or those with a confirmed or suspected infection should receive close follow-up and supportive care. There are no medications or antivirals that will shorten the clinical course of the virus. Only those with immunity to rubella should have contact with infected infants, as they can shed viral particles in their respiratory secretions though 1 year of age (unless they test with repeated negative viral cultures at age 3 months). Many infants can be born with multiple birth defects that require multidisciplinary management and interventions based on clinical manifestations. Often these infants will require extended period or life-long follow up with medical specialists. Early diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome is important for planning future medical care and educational placement.

=== Auditory Care ===
Many infants with CRS may be born with sensorineural deafness and thus should undergo a newborn hearing evaluation. Hearing loss may not be apparent at birth and thus requires close auditory follow up. Infants with confirmed hearing impairment may require hearing aids and may benefit from an early intervention program.

=== Ophthalmologic Care ===
Eye abnormalities including cataracts, infantile glaucoma and retinopathy are common in infants born with CRS. Infants should undergo eye examinations after birth and during early childhood. Those with congenital eye defects require care from a pediatric ophthalmologist for specialized care and follow up.

=== Cardiac Care ===
Congenital cardiac anomalies including pulmonary artery stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus can be seen in infants with CRS. Infants should undergo cardiac evaluation soon after birth and those with confirmed cardiac lesions will require specialized care with a pediatric cardiologist for any interventions and follow-up care.

<text>Simon Robert Armitage (born 26 May 1963) is an English poet, playwright, musician and novelist. He was appointed Poet Laureate on 10 May 2019. He is professor of poetry at the University of Leeds.

He has published over 20 collections of poetry, starting with &quot;Zoom!&quot; in 1989. Many of his poems concern his home town in West Yorkshire; these are collected in &quot;Magnetic Field: The Marsden Poems&quot;. He has translated classic poems including the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. He has written several travel books including &quot;Moon Country&quot; and &quot;Walking Home: Travels with a Troubadour on the Pennine Way&quot;. He has edited poetry anthologies including one on the work of Ted Hughes. He has participated in numerous television and radio documentaries, dramatisations, and travelogues.

== Early life and education ==

Armitage was born in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and grew up in the village of Marsden, where his family still live. He has an older sister, Hilary. His father Peter was a former electrician, probation officer and firefighter who was well known locally for writing plays and pantomimes for his all-male panto group, &quot;The Avalanche Dodgers&quot;.

He wrote his first poem aged 10 as a school assignment. Armitage first studied at Colne Valley High School, Linthwaite, and went on to study geography at Portsmouth Polytechnic. He was a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester, where his MA thesis concerned the effects of television violence on young offenders. Finding himself jobless after graduation, he decided to train as a probation officer, like his father before him. Around this time he began writing poetry more seriously, though he continued to work as a probation officer in Greater Manchester until 1994.

==Career==

He has lectured on creative writing at the University of Leeds and at the University of Iowa, and in 2008 was a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University. He has made literary, history and travel programmes for BBC Radio 3 and 4; and since 1992 he has written and presented a number of TV documentaries. From 2009 to 2012 he was Artist in Residence at London&#x27;s South Bank, and in February 2011 he became Professor of Poetry at the University of Sheffield. In October 2017 he was appointed as the first Professor of Poetry at the University of Leeds. In 2019 he was appointed Poet Laureate for ten years, following Carol Ann Duffy. He is a trustee of the National Poetry Centre, a charity established in 2022 which plans to open &quot;a new national home for poetry&quot; in Leeds in 2027.

=== Writing ===
Armitage&#x27;s first book-length poetry collection &quot;Zoom!&quot; was published in 1989. As well as some new poems, it contained works published in three pamphlets in 1986 and 1987.
His poetry collections include &quot;Book of Matches&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Dead Sea Poems&quot; (1995). He has written two novels, &quot;Little Green Man&quot; (2001) and &quot;The White Stuff&quot; (2004), as well as &quot;All Points North&quot; (1998), a collection of essays on Northern England. He produced a dramatised version of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and a collection of poetry entitled &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex Versus The Corduroy Kid&quot; (shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize), both published in 2006. Armitage&#x27;s poems feature in multiple British GCSE syllabuses for English Literature. He is characterised by a dry Yorkshire wit combined with &quot;an accessible, realist style and critical seriousness.&quot; His translation of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (2007) was adopted for the ninth edition of &quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;, and he was the narrator of a 2010 BBC documentary about the poem and its use of landscape.

For the Stanza Stones Trail, which runs through of the Pennine region, Armitage composed six new poems on his walks. With the help of local expert Tom Lonsdale and letter-carver Pip Hall, the poems were carved into stones at secluded sites. A book, containing the poems and the accounts of Lonsdale and Hall, has been produced as a record of that journey and has been published by Enitharmon Press. The poems, complemented with commissioned wood engravings by Hilary Paynter, were also published in several limited editions under the title &#x27;In Memory of Water&#x27; by Fine Press Poetry. For National Poetry Day in 2020, BT commissioned him to write &quot;Something clicked&quot;, a reflection on lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023 The National Trust commissioned a poem by Armitage for Brimham Rocks in North Yorkshire. Artist Adrian Riley collaborated with Armitage and stone carver Richard Dawson to create &#x27;Balancing Act&#x27; - a gateway-like public artwork carrying Armitage&#x27;s poem where the rocks meet moorland.

=== Writing as Poet Laureate ===

In 2019 Armitage&#x27;s first poem as Poet Laureate, &quot;Conquistadors&quot;, commemorating the 1969 Moon landing, was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
Armitage&#x27;s second poem as Poet Laureate, &quot;Finishing it&quot;, was commissioned in 2019 by the Institute of Cancer Research. Graham Short ,a micro-engraver, meticulously carved the entire 51-word poem clearly onto a facsimile of a cancer treatment tablet. Armitage wrote &quot;All Right&quot; as part of Northern train operator&#x27;s suicide prevention campaign for Mental Health Awareness Week. Their video has a soundtrack of the poem being read by Mark Addy, while the words also appear on screen. On 21 September 2019 he read his poem &quot;Fugitives&quot;, commissioned by the Association of Areas of Natural Beauty, on Arnside Knott, Cumbria, in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, during an event which included the formation of a heart outlined by people on the hillside. Armitage wrote &quot;Ark&quot; for the naming ceremony of the British Antarctic Survey&#x27;s new ship RRS &quot;Sir David Attenborough&quot; on 26 September 2019. &quot;the event horizon&quot; was written in 2019 to commemorate the opening of The Oglesby Centre, an extension to Hallé St Peter&#x27;s, the Halle orchestra&#x27;s venue for rehearsals, recordings, education and small performances. The poem is incorporated into the building &quot;in the form of a letter-cut steel plate situated in the entrance to the auditorium, the &#x27;event horizon&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Ode to a Clothes Peg&quot; celebrates the bicentenary of John Keats&#x27; six 1819 odes of which Armitage says, &quot;Among his greatest works, the poems are also some of the most famous in the English Language.&quot;

On 12 January 2020, Armitage gave the first reading of his poem &quot;Astronomy for Beginners&quot;, written to celebrate the bicentenary of the Royal Astronomical Society, on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Broadcasting House&quot;. &quot;Lockdown&quot;, first published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 21 March 2020, is a response to the coronavirus pandemic, referencing the Derbyshire &quot;plague village&quot; of Eyam, which self-isolated in 1665 to limit the spread of the Great Plague of London, and the Sanskrit poem &quot;Meghadūta&quot; by Kālidāsa, in which a cloud carries a message from an exile to his distant wife. Armitage read his &quot;Still Life&quot;, another poem about the lockdown, on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme on 20 April 2020. An installation of his &quot;The Omnipresent&quot; was part of an outdoor exhibition &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; at London&#x27;s Southbank Centre in autumn 2020. Huddersfield Choral Society commissioned Armitage to provide lyrics for works by Cheryl Frances-Hoad and Daniel Kidane, resulting in &quot;The Song Thrush and the Mountain Ash&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll Sing&quot;, which were released on video in autumn 2020. Armitage asked members of the choir to send him one word each to represent their experience of lockdown, and worked with these to produce the two lyrics. Armitage read &quot;The Bed&quot; in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 2020 at the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the burial of The Unknown Warrior.

&quot; &#x27;I speak as someone ...&#x27; &quot; was first published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 20 February 2021 and commemorates the 200th anniversary of the death of the poet John Keats, who died in Rome on 23 February 1821. To mark a stage in the easing of lockdown, Armitage wrote &quot;Cocoon&quot; which he read on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; on 29 March 2021. &quot;The Patriarchs – An Elegy&quot; marks the death of Prince Philip and was released on the day of his funeral, 17 April 2021. It refers to the snow on the day of his death, and Armitage has said &quot;I&#x27;ve written about a dozen laureate poems since I was appointed, but this is the first royal occasion and it feels like a big one&quot;. Armitage wrote &quot;70 notices&quot; in 2021 as a commission for the Off the Shelf Festival to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the creation of the Peak District National Park. &quot;Futurama&quot; was Armitage&#x27;s response to the 2021 Cop26 conference held in Glasgow, and he said of it &quot;I was trying to chart the peculiar dream-like state we seem to be in, where the rules and natural laws of the old world feel to be in flux&quot;. In November 2019 Armitage announced that he would donate his salary as poet laureate to create the Poetry School&#x27;s Laurel Prize for a collection of poems &quot;with nature and the environment at their heart&quot;. The prize is to be run by the Poetry School.

Armitage wrote &quot;Resistance&quot;, about the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 12 March 2022. He described it as &quot;a refracted version of what is coming at us in obscene images through the news&quot;. Armitage read his &quot;Only Human&quot; at York Minster on 23 March 2022 during a service on the second annual National Day of Reflection to remember lives lost during the COVID-19 pandemic; the poem will be inscribed in a garden of remembrance at the Minster. For the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in June 2022, Armitage wrote &quot;Queenhood&quot;. It was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 3 June and as a signed limited-edition pamphlet sold through commercial outlets (), and on the royal.uk website. He published &quot;Floral Tribute&quot; on 13 September 2022, to commemorate the death of Elizabeth II; it takes the form of a double acrostic in which the initial letters of the lines of each of its two stanzas spell out &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. Later that day he explained and read the poem on &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;. To celebrate the centenary of the BBC, Armitage wrote &quot;Transmission Report&quot;, which was broadcast on &quot;The One Show&quot; on 24 October 2022, read by a cast of BBC celebrities including Brian Cox, Michael Palin, Mary Berry and Chris Packham, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra. Armitage wrote &quot;The Making of the Flying Scotsman (a phantasmagoria)&quot; to mark the centenary of the locomotive Flying Scotsman, which entered service on 24 February 1923. On World Poetry Day, 21 March 2023, he released his &quot;Plum Tree Among the Skyscrapers&quot;, the first of a series of 10 works to be commissioned by the National Trust and created by Armitage and his band LYR. For the coronation of Charles III and Camilla on 6 May 2023, Armitage wrote &quot;An Unexpected Guest&quot;, telling the tale of a woman invited to attend the coronation in Westminster Abbey, and quoting from Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary entry recording the coronation of Charles II in 1661.

In July 2023, Armitage spent time on Spitsbergen at the British Antarctic Survey&#x27;s Ny-Ålesund research station, and wrote a group of poems relating to his visit. &quot;The Summit&quot; was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2023, ahead of a series of four BBC Radio 4 programmes called &quot;Poet Laureate in the Arctic&quot;, broadcast from 10 October 2023.

=== The laureate&#x27;s library tour ===
In November 2019 Armitage announced that each spring for ten years he would spend a week touring five to seven libraries giving a one-hour poetry reading and perhaps introducing a guest poet. The libraries were to be selected in alphabetical order: in March 2020 he was to visit places or libraries with names starting with &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; (including the British Library), and so on until &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; in 2029. He comments: &quot;The letter X will be interesting – does anywhere in the UK begin with X? I also want to find a way of including alphabet letters from other languages spoken in these islands such as Welsh, Urdu or Chinese, and to involve communities where English might not be the first language.&quot;

After a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first tour took place in 2021. Armitage read in various library buildings for a remote, online, live audience, beginning at Ashby-de-la-Zouch on 26 April and continuing to Belper with Helen Mort; Aberdeen with Mag Dixon; Bacup with Clare Shaw; Bootle with Amina Atiq and Eira Murphy; the British Library with Theresa Lola and Joelle Taylor; and Abington, where he officially opened the volunteer-run library on Saturday 1 May.

The 2022 tour visited libraries with initials C, D, and Welsh Ch and DD. Between 24 March and 1 April Armitage read at Chadderton with Keisha Thompson, Fateha Alam and Lawdy Karim; at Carmarthen with Ifor ap Glyn; at Clevedon with Phoebe Stuckes; at Colyton with Elizabeth-Jane Burnett; at Chatham with Patience Agbabi; at Cambridge University Library with Imtiaz Dharker; at Clydebank with Kathleen Jamie and Tawona Sitholé; and at Taigh Chearsabhagh on North Uist with Kevin MacNeil.

The 2023 tour visited libraries with initials E, F and G from 17 to 23 March. Armitage launched the tour at Exeter library, appearing with his band Land Yacht Regatta. He then read with Jane Lovell, winner of the 2021 Ginkgo Prize, at Glastonbury library; solo at Eastbourne library; with Laurel Prize-winner Matt Howard and Foyle Young Poet Jenna Hunt at Fakenham library; with Hanan Issa at Gladstone&#x27;s Library in Hawarden; and with Canal Laureate Roy McFarlane and representatives of Theatre Porto and Boaty Theatre Company at Ellesmere Port library.

The 2024 tour visited libraries with initials H to K from 5 to 12 March. The launch event was held at Harlesden library, where Somali poet Asha Lul Mohamud Yusuf and her translator Clare Pollard read from her award-winning &quot;The Sea Migrations: Tahriib&quot;. Kent libraries hosted an event where Armitage joined the reading group in HM Prison East Sutton Park. At Haverfordwest library, Armitage read alongside poet, novelist and playwright Owen Sheers and Pushcart Prize nominee Bethany Handley. At The Hive, Worcester, a joint public and academic library and archive centre, Armitage read with Amelie Simon, Worcestershire&#x27;s Young Poet Laureate. Armitage then visited Kirkcudbright library, to read with Lydia McMillan, one of the Scottish Poetry Library&#x27;s Next Generation Young Makars in 2022, and the final event of the tour, in Haltwhistle library, celebrated 100 years of Northumberland&#x27;s library service and ten years of Northumberland National Park&#x27;s status as an International Dark Sky Park, with Katrina Porteous and the National Park&#x27;s writer-in-residence Sheree Mack.

=== Performing arts ===

Armitage is the author of five stage plays, including &quot;Mister Heracles&quot;, a version of Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Madness of Heracles&quot;. &quot;The Last Days of Troy&quot; premiered at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in June 2014. He was commissioned in 1996 by the National Theatre in London to write &quot;Eclipse&quot; for the National Connections series, a play inspired by the real-life disappearance of Lindsay Rimer from Hebden Bridge in 1994, and set at the time of the 1999 solar eclipse in Cornwall.

Most recently Armitage wrote the libretto for an opera scored by Scottish composer Stuart MacRae, &quot;The Assassin Tree&quot;, based on a Greek myth recounted in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. The opera premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival, Scotland, before moving to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (Century Films, BBC2, 1996) – wrote and narrated a fifty-minute poetic commentary to a documentary about nightlife in Leeds, directed by Brian Hill. In 2010, Armitage walked the 264-mile Pennine Way, walking south from Scotland to Derbyshire. Along the route he stopped to give poetry readings, often in exchange for donations of money, food or accommodation, despite the rejection of the free life seen in his 1993 poem &quot;Hitcher&quot;, and has written a book about his journey, called &quot;Walking Home&quot;.

In 2007 he released an album of songs co-written with the musician Craig Smith, under the band name &quot;The Scaremongers&quot;.

In 2016 the arts programme 14–18 NOW commissioned a series of poems by Simon Armitage as part of a five-year programme of new artwork created specifically to mark the centenary of the First World War. The poems are a response to six aerial or panoramic photographs of battlefields from the archive of the Imperial War Museum in London. The poetry collection &quot;Still&quot; premiered at the Norfolk &amp; Norwich Festival and has been published in partnership with Enitharmon Press.

In 2019 he was commissioned by Sky Arts to create an epic poem and film &quot;The Brink&quot; as one of 50 projects in &quot;Art 50&quot; looking at British Identity in the light of Brexit. The Brink looked at the British relationship with Europe, as envisioned from the closest point of the mainland to the rest of the continent – Kent.

In 2020 and 2021 Armitage produced a podcast, &quot;The Poet Laureate Has Gone to His Shed&quot;, also broadcast on BBC Radio 4, in which, while working on the medieval poem &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot;, he invited a series of 20 guests to come and talk to him in his garden writing-shed; a third series began in 2023. Armitage worked with Brian Hill on &quot;Where Did The World Go?&quot;, a &quot;pandemic poem&quot; which &quot;examines life and loss in lockdown and binds the whole narrative with a new, overarching poem from Armitage&quot;, and was shown on BBC Two in June 2021. In December 2020, he was featured walking from Ravenscar, along the old Cinder Track, a disused railway line, past Boggle Hole to Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, in the &quot;Winter Walks&quot; series on BBC Four. In August 2022 Armitage presented &quot;Larkin Revisited&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 series commemorating Philip Larkin&#x27;s centenary, examining a single Larkin poem in each of the ten episodes. In November 2022 Armitage was the narrator in a performance of &quot;The Owl and the Nigtingale&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in with Maxine Peake (owl) and Rachael Stirling (nightingale).

== Personal life ==

Armitage lives in the Holme Valley, West Yorkshire, close to his family home in Marsden. His first wife was Alison Tootell: they married in 1991. He then married radio producer Sue Roberts; they have a daughter, Emmeline, born in 2000. Emmeline won the 2017 SLAMbassadors national youth poetry slam for 13-18-year-olds. Continuing in both her father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s tradition, she is a member of the National Youth Theatre and a singer.

He is a supporter of his local football team, Huddersfield Town, and refers to it many times in his book &quot;All Points North&quot; (1996). He is also a birdwatcher.

== Music ==

Armitage is the first poet laureate who is also a disc jockey. He is a music fan, especially of The Smiths. During what his wife Sue described as &quot;a bit of a mid-life crisis&quot;, Armitage and his college friend Craig Smith founded the band The Scaremongers. Their only album, &quot;Born in a Barn&quot;, was released in 2010. Armitage is the lead singer of LYR (Land Yacht Regatta), a band he is in alongside Richard Walters and Patrick J Pearson. The band is signed to Mercury KX, part of Decca Records. They released their debut album &quot;Call in the Crash Team&quot; in 2020 and a single, &quot;Winter Solstice&quot;, in 2021 featuring Wendy Smith from Prefab Sprout.

In May 2020 Armitage was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His choice of music included David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;; his chosen book was the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and his luxury was a tennis ball.

<text>The gene pool is the set of all genes, or genetic information, in any population, usually of a particular species.

== Description ==
A large gene pool indicates extensive genetic diversity, which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) can cause reduced biological fitness and an increased chance of extinction, although as explained by genetic drift new genetic variants, that may cause an increase in the fitness of organisms, are more likely to fix in the population if it is rather small.

When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait, the population is said to be &#x27;monomorphic&#x27;. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are said to be polymorphic.

== History ==
The Russian geneticist Alexander Sergeevich Serebrovsky first formulated the concept in the 1920s as &quot;genofond&quot; (gene fund), a word that was imported to the United States from the Soviet Union by Theodosius Dobzhansky, who translated it into English as &quot;gene pool.&quot;

== Gene pool concept in crop breeding ==
Harlan and de Wet (1971) proposed classifying each crop and its related species by gene pools rather than by formal taxonomy.
#Primary gene pool (GP-1): Members of this gene pool are probably in the same &quot;species&quot; (in conventional biological usage) and can intermate freely. Harlan and de Wet wrote, &quot;Among forms of this gene pool, crossing is easy; hybrids are generally fertile with good chromosome pairing; gene segregation is approximately normal and gene transfer is generally easy.&quot;. They also advised subdividing each crop gene pool in two:
#*Subspecies A: Cultivated races
#*Subspecies B: Spontaneous races (wild or weedy)
#Secondary gene pool (GP-2): Members of this pool are probably normally classified as different species than the crop species under consideration (the primary gene pool). However, these species are closely related and can cross and produce at least some fertile hybrids. As would be expected by members of different species, there are some reproductive barriers between members of the primary and secondary gene pools:
#*hybrids may be weak
#*hybrids may be partially sterile
#*chromosomes may pair poorly or not at all
#*recovery of desired phenotypes may be difficult in subsequent generations
#*However, &quot;The gene pool is available to be utilized, however, if the plant breeder or geneticist is willing to put out the effort required.&quot;
#Tertiary gene pool (GP-3): Members of this gene pool are more distantly related to the members of the primary gene pool. The primary and tertiary gene pools can be intermated, but gene transfer between them is impossible without the use of &quot;rather extreme or radical measures&quot; such as:
#*embryo rescue (or embryo culture, a form of plant organ culture)
#*induced polyploidy (chromosome doubling)
#*bridging crosses (e.g., with members of the secondary gene pool).

== Gene pool centres ==
Gene pool centres refers to areas on the earth where important crop plants and domestic animals originated. They have an extraordinary range of the wild counterparts of cultivated plant species and useful tropical plants.
Gene pool centres also contain different sub tropical and temperate region species.
