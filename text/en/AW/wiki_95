<text>The European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, commonly referred to as the European Southern Observatory (ESO), is an intergovernmental research organisation made up of 16 member states for ground-based astronomy. Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. The organisation employs over 750 staff members and receives annual member state contributions of approximately €162 million. Its observatories are located in northern Chile.

ESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically advanced telescopes. These include the 3.6 m New Technology Telescope, an early pioneer in the use of active optics, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which consists of four individual 8.2 m telescopes and four smaller auxiliary telescopes which can all work together or separately. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array observes the universe in the millimetre and submillimetre wavelength ranges, and is the world&#x27;s largest ground-based astronomy project to date. It was completed in March 2013 in an international collaboration by Europe (represented by ESO), North America, East Asia and Chile.

Currently under construction is the Extremely Large Telescope. It will use a 39.3-metre-diameter segmented mirror, and become the world&#x27;s largest optical reflecting telescope when operational towards the end of this decade. Its light-gathering power will allow detailed studies of planets around other stars, the first objects in the universe, supermassive black holes, and the nature and distribution of the dark matter and dark energy which dominate the universe.

ESO&#x27;s observing facilities have made astronomical discoveries and produced several astronomical catalogues. Its findings include the discovery of the most distant gamma-ray burst and evidence for a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. In 2004, the VLT allowed astronomers to obtain the first picture of an extrasolar planet (2M1207b) orbiting a brown dwarf 173 light-years away. The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument installed on the older ESO 3.6 m telescope led to the discovery of extrasolar planets, including Gliese 581c—one of the smallest planets seen outside the Solar System.

== History ==

The idea that European astronomers should establish a common large observatory was broached by Walter Baade and Jan Oort at the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands in spring 1953. It was pursued by Oort, who gathered a group of astronomers in Leiden to consider it on 21 June that year. Immediately thereafter, the subject was further discussed at the Groningen conference in the Netherlands. On 26 January 1954, an ESO declaration was signed by astronomers from six European countries expressing the wish that a joint European observatory be established in the southern hemisphere.

At the time, all reflector telescopes with an aperture of 2 metres or more were located in the northern hemisphere. The decision to build the observatory in the southern hemisphere resulted from the necessity of observing the southern sky; some research subjects (such as the central parts of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds) were accessible only from the southern hemisphere.

It was initially planned to set up telescopes in South Africa where several European observatories were located (Boyden Observatory), but tests from 1955 to 1962 demonstrated that a site in the Andes was preferable: When Jürgen Stock enthusiastically reported his observations from Chile, Otto Heckmann decided to leave the South African project on hold. ESO—at that time about to sign the contracts with South Africa—decided to establish their observatory in Chile. The ESO Convention was signed 5 October 1962 by Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. Otto Heckmann was nominated as the organisation&#x27;s first director general on 1 November 1962. On 15 November 1963 Chile was chosen as the site for ESO&#x27;s observatory.
A preliminary proposal for a convention of astronomy organisations in these five countries was drafted in 1954. Although some amendments were made in the initial document, the convention proceeded slowly until 1960 when it was discussed during that year&#x27;s committee meeting. The new draft was examined in detail, and a council member of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) highlighted the need for a convention between governments (in addition to organisations).
The convention and government involvement became pressing due to rapidly rising costs of site-testing expeditions. The final 1962 version was largely adopted from the CERN convention, due to similarities between the organisations and the dual membership of some members.

In 1966, the first ESO telescope at the La Silla site in Chile began operating. Because CERN (like ESO) had sophisticated instrumentation, the astronomy organisation frequently turned to the nuclear-research body for advice and a collaborative agreement between ESO and CERN was signed in 1970. Several months later, ESO&#x27;s telescope division moved into a CERN building in Geneva and ESO&#x27;s Sky Atlas Laboratory was established on CERN property. ESO&#x27;s European departments moved into the new ESO headquarters in Garching (near Munich), Germany, in 1980.

In 2015, Guillem Anglada-Escudé confirmed the existence of Proxima Centauri b at the Southern Observatory.

=== Member states ===


== Chilean observation sites ==

Although ESO is headquartered in Germany, its telescopes and observatories are in northern Chile, where the organisation operates advanced ground-based astronomical facilities:
* La Silla, which hosts the New Technology Telescope (NTT)
* Paranal, where the Very Large Telescope (VLT) is located
* Llano de Chajnantor, where ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is located

These are among the best locations for astronomical observations in the southern hemisphere. An ESO project is the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), a 40-metre-class telescope based on a five-mirror design and the formerly planned Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. The ELT will be the largest visible and near-infrared telescope in the world. ESO began its design in early 2006, and aimed to begin construction in 2012. Construction work at the ELT site started in June 2014. As decided by the ESO council on 26 April 2010, a fourth site (Cerro Armazones) is to be home to ELT.

Each year about 2,000 requests are made for the use of ESO telescopes, for four to six times more nights than are available. Observations made with these instruments appear in a number of peer-reviewed publications annually; in 2017, more than 1,000 reviewed papers based on ESO data were published.

ESO telescopes generate large amounts of data at a high rate, which are stored in a permanent archive facility at ESO headquarters. The archive contains more than 1.5 million images (or spectra) with a total volume of about 65 terabytes (65,000,000,000,000 bytes) of data.

=== La Silla ===
La Silla, located in the southern Atacama Desert north of Santiago de Chile at an altitude of , is the home of ESO&#x27;s original observation site. Like other observatories in the area, La Silla is far from sources of light pollution and has one of the darkest night skies on Earth. In La Silla, ESO operates three telescopes: a 3.6-metre telescope, the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and the 2.2-metre Max-Planck-ESO Telescope.

The observatory hosts visitor instruments, attached to a telescope for the duration of an observational run and then removed. La Silla also hosts national telescopes, such as the 1.2-metre Swiss and the 1.5-metre Danish telescopes.

About 300 reviewed publications annually are attributable to the work of the observatory. Discoveries made with La Silla telescopes include the HARPS-spectrograph detection of the planets orbiting within the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone outside the solar system. Several telescopes at La Silla played a role in linking gamma-ray bursts, the most energetic explosions in the universe since the Big Bang, with the explosions of massive stars. The ESO La Silla Observatory also played a role in the study of supernova SN 1987A.

==== ESO 3.6-metre telescope ====
The ESO 3.6-metre telescope began operations in 1977. It has been upgraded, including the installation of a new secondary mirror. The conventionally designed horseshoe-mount telescope was primarily used for infrared spectroscopy; it now hosts the HARPS spectrograph, used in search of extra-solar planets and for asteroseismology. The telescope was designed for very high long-term radial velocity accuracy (on the order of 1 m/s).

==== New Technology Telescope ====
The New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an altazimuth, 3.58-metre Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, inaugurated in 1989 and the first in the world with a computer-controlled main mirror. The flexible mirror&#x27;s shape is adjusted during observation to preserve optimal image quality. The secondary mirror position is also adjustable in three directions. This technology (developed by ESO and known as active optics) is now applied to all major telescopes, including the VLT and the future ELT.

The design of the octagonal enclosure housing the NTT is innovative. The telescope dome is relatively small and ventilated by a system of flaps directing airflow smoothly across the mirror, reducing turbulence and resulting in sharper images.

==== MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope ====
The 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at La Silla since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the Max Planck Society (, or MPG, in German). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO&#x27;s responsibility.

Its instrumentation includes a 67-million-pixel wide-field imager (WFI) with a field of view as large as the full moon, which has taken many images of celestial objects. Other instruments used are GROND (Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Near-Infrared Detector), which seeks the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts—the most powerful explosions in the universe, and the high-resolution spectrograph FEROS (Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph), used to make detailed studies of stars.

==== Other telescopes ====

La Silla also hosts several national and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among them are the Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.
* The Euler Telescope is a 1.2-metre telescope built and operated by the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. It is used to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements primarily used in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting Gliese 86. Other observing programmes focus on variable stars, asteroseismology, gamma-ray bursts, monitoring active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gravitational lenses.
* The 1.54-metre &quot;Danish National Telescope&quot; was built by Grubb-Parsons and has been in use at La Silla since 1979. The telescope has an off-axis mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. Because of the telescope&#x27;s mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.
* The Rapid Eye Mount telescope is a small rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary mirror. The telescope, in an altazimuth mount, began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite.
* The Belgian TRAPPIST is a joint venture between the University of Liège and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialised in comets, exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a stellar occultation of the dwarf planet Eris, revealing that it may be smaller than Pluto.
* The &quot;Quick-action telescope for transient objects&quot;, TAROT, is a very fast-moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a sub-arc second position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a fireball and its surrounding material. It is operated from the Haute-Provence Observatory in France.

=== Paranal ===
The Paranal Observatory is located atop Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Cerro Paranal is a mountain about south of Antofagasta and from the Pacific coast.

The observatory has seven major telescopes operating in visible and infrared light: the four telescopes of the Very Large Telescope, the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. In addition, there are four auxiliary telescopes forming an array used for interferometric observations. In March 2008, Paranal was the location for several scenes of the 22nd James Bond film, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;.

==== Very Large Telescope ====

The main facility at Paranal is the VLT, which consists of four nearly identical unit telescopes (UTs), each hosting two or three instruments. These large telescopes can also work together in groups of two or three as a giant interferometer. The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than those seen with the individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI with a complex system of mirrors in tunnels, where the light paths must diverge less than 1/1000 mm over 100 metres. The VLTI can achieve an angular resolution of milliarcseconds, equivalent to the ability to see the headlights of a car on the Moon.

The first of the UTs had its first light in May 1998, and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999. The other telescopes followed suit in 1999 and 2000, making the VLT fully operational. Four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes (ATs), installed between 2004 and 2007, have been added to the VLTI for accessibility when the UTs are used for other projects.

Data from the VLT have led to the publication of an average of more than one peer-reviewed scientific paper per day; in 2017, over 600 reviewed scientific papers were published based on VLT data. The VLT&#x27;s scientific discoveries include imaging an extrasolar planet, tracking individual stars moving around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way and observing the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.

At the Paranal inauguration in March 1999, names of celestial objects in the Mapuche language were chosen to replace the technical designations of the four VLT Unit Telescopes (UT1–UT4). An essay contest was prior arranged for schoolchildren in the region concerning the meaning of these names which attracted many entries dealing with the cultural heritage of ESO&#x27;s host country. A 17-year-old adolescent from Chuquicamata, near Calama, submitted the winning essay and was awarded an amateur telescope during the inauguration. The four unit telescopes, UT1, UT2, UT3 and UT4, are since known as &quot;Antu&quot; (sun), &quot;Kueyen&quot; (moon), &quot;Melipal&quot; (Southern Cross), and &quot;Yepun&quot; (Evening Star), with the latter having been originally mistranslated as &quot;Sirius&quot;, instead of &quot;Venus&quot;.

==== Survey telescopes ====
Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) is housed on the peak adjacent to the one hosting the VLT, sharing observational conditions. VISTA&#x27;s main mirror is across, a highly curved mirror for its size and quality. Its deviations from a perfect surface are less than a few thousandths the thickness of a human hair, and its construction and polishing presented a challenge.

VISTA was conceived and developed by a consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by Queen Mary, University of London, and it became an in-kind contribution to ESO as part of the UK&#x27;s ratification agreement. The telescope&#x27;s design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council&#x27;s UK Astronomy Technology Centre (STFC, UK ATC). Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at the December 2009 ceremony at ESO headquarters in Garching, which was attended by representatives of Queen Mary, University of London and STFC. Since then the telescope has been operated by ESO, capturing quality images since it began operation.

The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a state-of-the-art, telescope equipped with OmegaCAM, a 268-megapixel CCD camera with a field of view four times the area of the full moon. It complements VISTA by surveying the sky in visible light. The VST (which became operational in 2011) is the result of a joint venture between ESO and the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte (Naples), a research centre at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics INAF.

The scientific goals of both surveys range from the nature of dark energy to assessing near-Earth objects. Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover most of the southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single picture taken by VISTA has 67 megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268 megapixels. The two survey telescopes collect more data every night than all the other instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.

=== Llano de Chajnantor ===

The Llano de Chajnantor is a plateau in the Atacama Desert, about east of San Pedro de Atacama. The site is higher than the Mauna Kea Observatory and higher than the Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal. It is dry and inhospitable to humans, but a good site for submillimetre astronomy; because water vapour molecules in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorb and attenuate submillimetre radiation, a dry site is required for this type of radio astronomy. The telescopes are:
* Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT; not operated by ESO)
* Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (Operated on behalf of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR))
* Atacama Large Millimeter Array
* Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET; not operated by ESO) 
* POLARBEAR (on the Huan Tran Telescope; not operated by ESO)

ALMA is a telescope designed for millimetre and submillimetre astronomy. This type of astronomy is a relatively unexplored frontier, revealing a universe which cannot be seen in more-familiar visible or infrared light and ideal for studying the &quot;cold universe&quot;; light at these wavelengths shines from vast cold clouds in interstellar space at temperatures only a few tens of degrees above absolute zero. Astronomers use this light to study the chemical and physical conditions in these molecular clouds, the dense regions of gas and cosmic dust where new stars are being born. Seen in visible light, these regions of the universe are often dark and obscure due to dust; however, they shine brightly in the millimetre and submillimetre portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This wavelength range is also ideal for studying some of the earliest (and most distant) galaxies in the universe, whose light has been redshifted into longer wavelengths from the expansion of the universe.

==== Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ====

ESO hosts the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment, APEX, and operates it on behalf of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR). APEX is a diameter telescope, operating at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths—between infrared light and radio waves.

==== Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ====
ALMA is an astronomical interferometer initially composed of 66 high-precision antennas and operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 3.6 mm. Its main array will have 50 antennas acting as a single interferometer. An additional compact array of four 12-metre and twelve antennas, known as the Morita array is also available. The antennas can be arranged across the desert plateau over distances from 150 metres to , which will give ALMA a variable &quot;zoom&quot;. The array will be able to probe the universe at millimetre and submillimeter wavelengths with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, with vision up to ten times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope. These images will complement those made with the VLT Interferometer. ALMA is a collaboration between East Asia (Japan and Taiwan), Europe (ESO), North America (US and Canada) and Chile.

The scientific goals of ALMA include studying the origin and formation of stars, galaxies, and planets with observations of molecular gas and dust, studying distant galaxies towards the edge of the observable universe and studying relic radiation from the Big Bang. A call for ALMA science proposals was issued on 31 March 2011, and early observations began on 3 October.

== Outreach ==
Outreach activities are carried out by the ESO education and Public Outreach Department (ePOD). 

ePOD also manages the ESO Supernova Planetarium &amp; Visitor Centre, an astronomy centre located at the site of the ESO Headquarters in Garching bei München, which was inaugurated 26 April 2018.

<text>Maasmechelen (; ) is a municipality located on the Meuse in the Belgian province of Limburg.

It comprises the former municipalities of Mechelen-aan-de-Maas, Vucht, Leut, Meeswijk, Uikhoven, Eisden, Opgrimbie, Boorsem, and Kotem.

As a result of both Maasmechelen&#x27;s location near the border and its coalmining history, quite a few of its current inhabitants are of Dutch, German, Polish or Mediterranean (mainly Italian) origin.

==History==

===Prehistoric and Roman times===
The plateau of Campine was built up during the ice age with deposits of sand and other material that the Meuse river had eroded in the upstream Ardennes region. The higher elevation and the proximity of fertile river clay made this location an attractive one for the prehistoric tribes who established themselves here in the 2nd millennium BC and for the Celtic peoples who moved in the area in the 1st millennium BC.

In Roman times, this region was at the border between the provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. The main Roman road crossed the river near Maastricht, to the south. Settlements were built where Maasmechelen lies today to service the garrison that was maintained to protect the bridge in Maastricht.

===Middle Ages===
The few centuries that followed the fall of the Roman Empire were marked by a sharp decline in travel and trade. The Franks were now the new masters of the land. International commercial activities resumed on the river around the 7th century. This was also a time when the river progressively moved eastward. The Roman colonies that were originally built on the right bank of the river now found themselves on the left bank. The abundance of streams and wetlands favoured stockbreeding over agriculture. The feudal system and the practice of paying civil servants with land resulted in endless territory subdivisions. Some parcels, including Mechelen-aan-de-Maas and parts of Opgrimbie, were given to the abbey of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. Other parcels came into the hands of local lords, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Yet other parts of the territory came into the possession of local religious communities. Churches and cloisters were built and enlarged to accommodate a growing population.

===19th and 20th century===
The aftermath of the French Revolution brought a series of dramatic changes that include the dismantlement of most religious organizations, the closing of churches, and the reorganization of the territory into new administrative entities. During the 19th century, the area had still an unmistakable rural character.

On May 20, 1901, André Dumont found commercial-grade coal in neighbouring As. This led to the exploitation of coal mines in Eisden from 1923 to 1987. A garden city and a new church dedicated to Saint Barbara, also known as the mining cathedral, were built there. The industrial development attracted workers from all over Europe, which accounts for the numerous international restaurants still found today in Eisden.

==Attractions==
*The largest part of the natural reservation &quot;Nationaal Park Hoge Kempen&quot; is located on Maasmechelen&#x27;s territory. It was established to protect the unique fauna and flora of the plateau of Campine.
*The &quot;Eisdense cité&quot;, a 20th-century garden city with typical cottage-like houses in a park setting, still bear witness to the city&#x27;s mining history. One of the houses has been converted into a museum.
*Maasmechelen Village, an outlet shopping center was built near the old mining district. In 2010, 2.5 million visitors were counted.
*A functional windmill dating from 1801 was recently restored and is open to the public every other Sunday.
*A small carnival museum can also be visited right next to the city&#x27;s main square.

===Events===
*The carnival and parade, where masked people entertain numerous visitors, occur every year on November 11, starting at 11:11 am.

==Sports==

* Well known sports personalities from the Maasmechelen region are:
** athlete Patrick Stevens, a sprinter (olympic finalist on 200 meters in 1996)

<text>Tongeren (; ; ; ) is a city and former municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg, in the southeastern corner of the Flemish region of Belgium. Tongeren is the oldest town in Belgium, as the only Roman administrative capital within the country&#x27;s borders. As a Roman city, it was inhabited by the Tungri, and known as &quot;Atuatuca Tungrorum&quot;, it was the administrative centre of the &quot;Civitas Tungrorum&quot; district. Since 1 January 2025, it is part of the new municipality Tongeren-Borgloon

==History==

===&quot;Atuatuca Tungrorum&quot;===
The Romans referred to Tongeren as &quot;Aduatuca Tungrorum&quot; or &quot;Atuatuca Tongrorum&quot;, and it was the capital of the large Roman province of &quot;Civitas Tungrorum&quot;, an area which covered modern Belgian Limburg, and at least parts of all the areas around it. Before the Roman conquests, this area was inhabited by the group of Belgic tribes known as the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;. (Despite being known as the &quot;Germani&quot;, whether they spoke a Germanic language is debated, and the names of their tribes and their leaders were Celtic.) Specifically the Eburones were the largest of these tribes and the one living around Tongeren.

Caesar referred to the fort of the Eburones as Aduatuca, and this has led to a widely accepted proposal that this can be equated to Tongeren. There are counter arguments that the word &quot;Aduatuca&quot; was probably a general word for a fort in this region, meaning that there might have been more places with the same name, and that Tongeren shows no signs of pre-Roman occupation, nor the hilly terrain described by Caesar. There was also a distinct tribe in the area known as the Aduatuci. On the other hand, it has the same name and function as a local capital, and is in generally the right area. If it is not Tongeren itself, the Aduatuca of the Eburones might be the ancient fortification of Caestert in nearby Riemst.

During Julius Caesar’s campaigns in this part of Gaul in the first century BC, the Belgae revolted against the campaign of Caesar, led by the Eburones. They destroyed a legion that had demanded the right to winter among them in 54 BC. Caesar reported that he sold the Aduatuci into slavery, and annihilated the name of the Eburones, many of whom however he reported having fled successfully, including Ambiorix the leader of the revolt. Instead of risking Roman lives to pursue them he invited tribes from over the Rhine, such as the Sigambri to come and plunder. This back-fired when Eburones pointed out to the Sigambri that the Romans had all the booty at Aduatuca, and were the more attractive target.

The Tungri, not mentioned by Caesar, came to dominate this area in the Roman era, and are the reason for the name of the modern name Tongeren. Tacitus says that Tungri was a new name for the original tribes who had previously been called the &quot;Germani&quot;. But many modern writers believe that the Gallo-Roman population of the area contained a significant amount of more recent Germanic immigrants from across the Rhine. Located on the important road linking Cologne to Bavay via the relay of Liberchies, and surrounded by the fertile lands of the Hesbaye region, Roman Tongeren quickly became one of the largest Gallo-Roman administrative and military towns in the first century. It suffered from a destructive fire during the Batavian siege in 70 AD, which was part of the Batavian revolt. In the second century, it erected a defensive wall, portions of which can still be seen today. Typical Roman buildings were built in town, while villas and mound graves (tumuli) dotted the surrounding area.

In 358 the future emperor Julian met, in Tongeren, a delegation of Salian Franks who had recently settled in Toxandria (the modern Campine region), to the north of Tongeren. They wanted peace but spoke &quot;as if the ground they had seized were rightfully their own&quot;. Julian gave ambiguous replies and then after the meetings sent a surprise attack along the Maas or Meuse river, and &quot;they met him with entreaties rather than with resistance, he received the submission of them and their children&quot;. They became increasingly important after this time. Zosimus reports that Julian used them as part of his forces in fights against other Germanic tribes.

===Middle Ages===

Already in the fourth century, just as the Salian Franks were settling to the north, the city became the center of a Christian diocese under the influence of Saint Servatius, bishop of Tongeren, who died in 384 AD. In the meantime, the Franks to the north and east were pagan and so many areas had to be reconverted over the course of the following centuries, with several missionaries becoming martyrs. The seat of the Tungrian bishopric however eventually moved to nearby Maastricht, after Saint Servatius was buried near the Roman town there. Much later, Liège became the seat of what would become the Roman Catholic Diocese of Liège, the church equivalent to the Civitas Tungrorum. This was the resting place of Saint Lambert of Maastricht, one of the last missionaries in the area, who died about 700 AD. Aduatuca Tungrorum may have been destroyed by the Huns in 451 AD. Tongeren therefore lost some importance during this period.

Significant waves of Germanic settlers and invaders changed the area. The Merovingian period between the fifth and the eighth century is not well documented. The building of a new church and the foundation of a chapter of canons took place in Carolingian times, at the very place where the old bishops’ houses stood, and where the basilica still stands today. The construction of the current basilica started at the beginning of the thirteenth century in the prevalent Gothic style of that period. Other buildings were added to the religious core of the city, including new commercial areas, hospitals and artisans quarters. The thirteenth century also saw the building of the medieval defensive wall, several new churches and cloisters, and the beguinage. The city became one of the “bonnes villes” (&quot;good cities&quot;) of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.

===From seventeenth century until contemporary age===
In 1677, the city was burned almost entirely by Louis XIV’s troops, a catastrophe from which Tongeren never completely recovered. The rebirth of the city dates from after 1830.

In 1977 the neighbouring municipalities of Berg, Diets-Heur, Henis, &#x27;s-Herenelderen, Koninksem, Lauw, Mal, Neerrepen, Nerem, Overrepen, Piringen, Riksingen, Rutten, Sluizen, Vreren and Widooie merged into Tongeren.

Tongeren is currently the judicial capital of the province of Belgian Limburg.

==Main sights==
* The Béguinage, founded in 1257, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. Its enclosure wall was destroyed in the 19th century: it separated the beguinage from the rest of the city and thus guaranteed peace and quiet for the small religion-inspired community. In the 17th century, the beguinage counted some 300 beguines; it was also able to survive the 1677 fire that destroyed most of the city.
* The Basilica of Our Lady (&quot;Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe Basiliek&quot;), built in Gothic style in the 13th century, where recent excavations have produced some of the richest archaeological finds in Flanders. Archaeological excavations have proven the presence of an edifice here starting from the 4th century, while a Carolingian prayer house existed here in the 9th century. The building of the choir of the present basilica began in 1240. Nave, transepts and side chapels were added between the 13th and 15th century. The original Romanesque tower was replaced by the present, Gothic tower from 1442 until 1541. The basilica&#x27;s interior is home to the statue of Our Lady of Tongeren, erected in 1475. The treasury is housed in the former hall of the Chapter and comprises one of the richest collections of religious art in Belgium. The bell tower was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site in 1999.
* Church of St. Catherine, built in Gothic style in 1294, but modified later in different styles. Works of art include the 1711 pulpit by Robrecht Verburgh, the main altarpiece by Gaspar de Crayer (17th century) and a sculpture of the &quot;Suffering Christ&quot;, donated by the beguine Anna de Floz.
* The Gallo-Roman Museum, which houses Celtic gold, Roman glassware, Merovingian filigree work, and a Roman dodecahedron, an unusual Gallo-Roman object found during excavations
* The original Roman wall, dating from the second century, still visible for more than .
* Some of the medieval defensive towers, also still visible today.
* Statue of &quot;Ambiorix&quot;, erected in 1866.
* Several Tumuli are found around the city.
* The Pliniuspark features the Plinius spring, a natural spring described by Pliny the Elder in 77-79 a.d.
* At the location of a former Roman temple in the Keverstraat, a modern representation of that temple can be found. Because no drawings, apart from the floor plans, of the original temple exist, everything has been rebuilt up to high.
* Partly below the Basilica of Our Lady and partly inside the Basilica, the Teseum-museum shows the archaeological findings at the location of the Basilica, as well as exhibitions about the history of the church. 
* Tongeren houses a youth detention center.

==Events==
*The &quot;Kroningsfeesten&quot; (“Coronation Celebrations”) are organized every seven years in commemoration of the crowning of the miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Bishop Doutreloux in 1890. This religious procession, the largest and one of the most impressive in Belgium, took place for the seventeenth time in 2009. The eighteenth edition took place in July 2016.
*A well-attended antiques fair takes place every Sunday. It is the largest of its kind in the Benelux.

==Sports==
* Women&#x27;s volleyball club Datovoc Tongeren plays at the highest level of the Belgian league pyramid.
* Tongeren&#x27;s best known football club is K.S.K. Tongeren.

<doc id="175188" wikidata="Q460479" url="?curid=175188" title="Voeren">
<text>Voeren (; ) is a Flemish Dutch-speaking municipality with facilities for the French-speaking minority, located in the Belgian province of Limburg. Bordering the Netherlands to the north and the Wallonia region&#x27;s Liège Province () to the south, it is geographically detached from the rest of Flanders, making Voeren an exclave of Flanders. Voeren&#x27;s name is derived from that of a small right-bank tributary of the Meuse, the Voer, which flows through the municipality.

The current municipality of Voeren was established by the municipal reform of 1977. On 1 January 2008, Voeren had a total population of 4,207. Its total area is , giving a population density of . About 25% of the population is made up of foreign nationals, most of whom have Dutch nationality.

==Villages==
The municipality consists of the six villages of &#x27;s-Gravenvoeren (), Sint-Pieters-Voeren (), Sint-Martens-Voeren (), Moelingen (), Teuven and Remersdaal (, ). &#x27;s-Gravenvoeren is the most important and most populous village of the municipality. Locally, the three villages are named Sint-Marten (), Sint-Pieter (), and Voeren () for &#x27;s-Gravenvoeren.

==History==
Since the 11th century, two-thirds of the territory of the present municipality of Voeren was in the county of Dalhem, which was a possession of the dukes of Brabant, and the remaining one-third in the Duchy of Limburg, which also belonged to Brabant after 1288. Both of these duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire but they developed a relatively independent regime ruled by powerful dynasties. They successively became part of the Burgundian Netherlands, the Habsburg Netherlands, and after the Dutch Revolt, part of the Spanish, later Austrian controlled, Southern Netherlands.

During the French occupation (1794–1815), the old boundaries of the &quot;ancien regime&quot; were rejected and the French &quot;département&quot; of Ourthe was created. After the defeat of France and the end of Napoleonic wars, this became the modern Belgium&#x27;s Liège Province until 1963 when the Voer Region was detached from Liège, and became part of the province of Limburg, within Flanders.

On 11 or 12 September 1944, during World War II, Voeren was captured by the American 30th Infantry Division. With its capture, the allies had reached the Belgium–Netherlands border and crossed into the Netherlands. Hence, neighbouring Mesch became the first Dutch village to be liberated on 12 September.

==Linguistic and political issues==
Most native people in Voeren speak a variant of Limburgish, a regional language related to Dutch (in the Netherlands referred to as a separate language; in Flanders treated as a Dutch dialect), and German. The same Germanic dialect is also spoken in the neighbouring Walloon municipalities of Blieberg, Welkenraedt and Baelen and has been recognised by the French Community of Belgium as a regional language since 1990.

Voeren is economically dependent on the surrounding provinces of Liège and Dutch Limburg and standard Dutch and French are also generally spoken.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, language use in the area was mixed. People spoke the local dialect in daily life. The government institutions used French, while church and school used German or Dutch. However, some influential inhabitants, such as the local priest, Hendrik Veltmans, argued that Voeren was culturally Flemish and actively tried to bring Voeren into Flanders.

In 1932, with the introduction of new language laws, the linguistic alignment of Voeren was determined (as for all other towns along the language border in Belgium) on the basis of the results of the census of 1930. According to this census, 81.2% of the population of the six villages that now make up Voeren spoke Dutch, and 18.8% declared that they spoke French. Administrative changes were made as a result. The results of the next census, held in 1947, were only made public in 1954 and gave a totally different outcome, with only 42.9% stating that they spoke Dutch and 57.1% French. According to the 1932 legislation, this would have meant that the linguistic status of the villages would have changed from Dutch speaking with a French minority to French speaking with a Dutch-speaking minority.
At that time, however, due to the rising political controversy between the Dutch- and French-speaking communities in Belgium, a parliamentary committee (the so-called centrum Harmel, named after Pierre Harmel) was established to fix, amongst other things, the language boundary once and for all. This committee proposed, notwithstanding the 1947 results (strongly disputed by the Flemish and recognised by the Belgian parliament as useless for determining the language border since the consultation was found to be rigged by nationalist francophones which is why the 1947 results were published in 1954), that the six villages were Dutch speaking with special regulations for the French-speaking minority to be decided after discussion with the town councils.

In 1962 the work of the committee resulted in a law proposed by the French-speaking Minister of the Interior, Arthur Gilson, whereby Voeren would be officially Dutch speaking with language facilities for the French-speaking community, but would remain part of the French-speaking Liège Province. The proposal included a similar system for Mouscron and Comines-Warneton which would be officially French-speaking with language facilities for the Dutch-speaking community, but would remain part of the Dutch-speaking province of West-Flanders.

After fierce debate in parliament, the proposal of minister Gilson was approved but subject to the amendment that Voeren would become part of the Dutch-speaking province of Limburg and Mouscron and Comines-Warneton become part of the French-speaking Hainaut province.

This amendment was introduced by the Walloon socialist politician and former mayor of Liège, Paul Gruselin, who wanted to transfer the Flemish towns with a Francophone majority Comines-Warneton and Mouscron to the Walloon province of Hainaut and offered to transfer the Voer region to the Dutch-speaking province of Limburg as compensation.

In order to understand this proposal of the Walloon socialists of Liège and Mouscron, one must take into account the fact that almost everyone at the time considered that a Dutch dialect was spoken in the Voer Region and that, consequently, their inhabitants would willingly accept this change. The 75,000 inhabitants of the towns Mouscron and Comines-Warneton brought one extra deputy&#x27;s seat while the 4,000 inhabitants of the villages of the Voer Region were far from being worth as much.

This switch from Liège to Limburg was received badly by many local people because of the region&#x27;s dependence on Liège. Francophones in particular campaigned for the region to be returned to the province of Liège. Similarly in Comines-Warneton and Mouscron, the city councils and a large majority of the population wanted to remain part of the Dutch-speaking province of West Flanders or at the very least become a new francophone province together with the city of Tournai, the Tournaisis because they identified as Frenchified Flemings, having shared a history with the other regions of the former County of Flanders and felt culturally closer to French Flanders than to the Hainaut Province.

On 1 January 1977, the six small municipalities were merged into the present-day Voeren municipality. The Francophone and Flemish movements could organize themselves politically more effectively as there was now one, instead of six, municipal council. This resulted in political and linguistic strife between the Francophone &quot;Retour à Liège&quot; (Return to Liège) party and the Flemish &quot;Voerbelangen&quot; (Voeren&#x27;s Best Interests) party. The &quot;Retour à Liège&quot; faction won a majority in the new council. There were also action committees on both sides and gangs who daubed place-name signs and took part in violent demonstrations. The language struggle in Voeren became a national issue, and people from outside the region became involved.

The linguistic struggle came to a head when José Happart was put forward as mayor in 1983. For one thing, he was alleged to have supported the Francophone gangs in Voeren. However, the main problem was the constitutional question of whether someone who could not speak Dutch could become mayor of a Flemish municipality. Happart was dismissed as mayor for refusing to take a Dutch-language test, but appealed against his dismissal, and the question dragged on for years, ultimately causing the Belgian government Martens VI to fall on 19 October 1987.

In 1988, concessions to the Francophone inhabitants were made. The powers of the provincial government of Limburg were curtailed, and more autonomy was given to the municipality. The government of the Walloon Region was allowed to build facilities for Francophones in Voeren.

In the 1994 municipal elections, the Dutch-speaking party (&quot;Voerbelangen&quot;) won a seat more than in earlier elections but was still a minority on the council. In 1995, Mayor Happart was forced to leave office. The national court of arbitration (now Belgian Constitutional Court) declared some of the 1988 concessions unconstitutional (e.g. the Walloon building rights).

EU nationals were given suffrage at the municipal level in 1999. This factor was decisive in the 2000 municipal elections, because of the significant number of Dutch citizens living in Voeren (about 20% of the total population): &quot;Voerbelangen&quot; won a majority of 53% of the votes and 8 out of 15 local council seats. However, the new majority faced budgetary difficulties, since large debts had been incurred by the previous administration. The council had to sell several items of municipal property, such as forests and goods to stabilise its finances. As from 2003 to 2004 the council is viable again, and new projects are being started to fulfill the promises made during the elections. In the 2006 municipal elections &quot;Voerbelangen&quot; won again, gaining 61% of the votes and 9 out of 15 council seats. For the first time, &quot;Voerbelangen&quot; also won the majority of the seats in the council of the OCMW (Public Centre for Social Welfare), the social affairs department of the municipality, for which nationals of other EU countries may not vote.
Though the violence of the 1970s and 1980s has subsided, some activists still daub graffiti on place-name signs. In December 2006, the Flemish Government decided to abolish all official French translations in Flemish municipalities and villages, including municipalities with language facilities. Thus the French names of the Voeren municipality and villages will no longer be used on place-name signs, traffic signs and by municipality and other governments in official documents.

===Results of the linguistic censuses of 1930 and 1947 per village===

Precise figures on the ethnic composition of Belgium are impossible to obtain, for the language question is so controversial that the Belgian census has not included data on linguistic composition of communes since 1947.

<text>Wellen (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. On 1 January 2018, Wellen had a total population of 7,402. The total area is 26.72 km2 with a population density of 266 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Wellen, Berlingen, Herten and Ulbeek. Other population centres and hamlets include: Bos, Beurs, Kukkelberg, Langenakker, Oetersloven, Overbroek, Russelt, and Vrolingen.

== History ==

Archaeological findings suggest the place was inhabited already during the Frankish period (5th to 7th century). Debris from the river Herk on that spot made the soil fertile for farming. However, any mention of the name Wellene or Welnis doesn&#x27;t occur until the second half of the 12th century.

The name Wellen derives from the Middle Dutch &quot;wellene&quot;, meaning &quot;source&quot; or &quot;pit&quot; or, alternately, from Latin &quot;terra Villina&quot;, &quot;agricultural holding&quot;. Wellen was long associated with the abbey of Munsterbilzen, founded around 670.

<text>Toul () is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in north-eastern France.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department.

==Geography==
Toul is between Commercy and Nancy, and the river Moselle and Canal de la Marne au Rhin.

===Climate===

Toul has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Toul is . The average annual rainfall is with June as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Toul was on 11 August 1998; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 9 January 1985.

==History==
Toul was known to the Romans as , and was the capital of the Gaulish tribe of the Leuci.

In 550, King Theudebald convoked a synod at Toul. In 612, King Theudebert II of Austrasia was defeated by King Theuderic II of Burgundy near Toul. By the Treaty of Meerssen of 870, Toul became part of East Francia, the later Holy Roman Empire. During the High Middle Ages, it became a Free Imperial City. Toul was annexed to France by King Henry II in 1552; this was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. It then was a part of the French province of the Three Bishoprics.

Toul was the seat of the bishops of Toul; the diocese was founded around 365 and existed until 1807.

During the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, the last time that Toul&#x27;s defenses were used as a classic fortress, 64 guns opened fire at 6:00 a.m. on 23 September, and the fortress surrendered at 3:00 p.m. after 2,433 shells had been fired.

The city was also the primary base of the Air Service, United States Army, a predecessor organization of the United States Air Force during World War I. As such, it was a base for many of the 45 wartime squadrons of the First Army Air Service, including the squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group, First Army Observation Group and others. The Americans referred to the area around Toul as the Toul Sector. Two large operations were launched from this area: the St. Mihiel Offensive and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, both in September 1918. During World War II, the American 358th Fighter Group used Toul-Croix De Metz Airfield (A-90) during the fall of 1944 and spring of 1945, and Toul-Rosières Air Base (BA 136) was an American NATO air base during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Population==
==Sights==
The most striking features are the impressive stone ramparts. Those that exist today are the work of Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, Louis XIV&#x27;s military engineer. In 1698 he designed a new enclosure and work began in 1699-1700. Several of Vauban&#x27;s fortifications in France are listed as a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although the fortifications at Toul are not in that list they do follow the general defiladed fortification pattern for which Vauban is known. There appears to have been a fortified town at this location since the earliest recorded history. Today, the ramparts encircle and define the old town. They are built of dressed white stone, and topped with grass, and in places are over five metres high.

There is a great deal of Roman archaeology in the area and allegedly some in the town. The Roman fortified town of Grand is some 30 km away, with its great amphitheatre and temple to the Cult of Apollo.

The old town&#x27;s architecture is dominated by past glories in various states of decay, including a major Gothic cathedral, which is in a poor condition and is being slowly restored. Many of the houses were built as canonical residences in the Late Middle Ages and bear vestiges in the form of ornamental stonework. The gothic chapel of the Knights Templar Commandery of Libdeau is undergoing a major restoration.

There is no trace of the monastery, however its wine-cellars still exist, under the shops on the north side of the Rue Gambetta. (Access is possible via the Camera Shop).

==Transportation==
Toul is at the intersection of the river Moselle (which divides into the river proper and the &quot;Moselle Canalisée&quot; just outside the town) with the Canal de la Marne au Rhin, and was once, consequently, an important port. The barges known as &quot;péniches&quot; still navigate these watercourses commercially, typically carrying steel, though in the summer much more of the water traffic is for pleasure.

There is a main-line railway station at Toul, the last major station before the (once vast, and still very large) marshalling yards at Nancy. However, the Paris-Strasbourg TGV line, completed in 2016, passes about 20 km north of Toul, approximately midway between Metz and Nancy.

==Economy==
The surrounding countryside is a wine-growing region, in which the AOC Côtes de Toul vintage is produced. Particularly notable is the &quot;Gris de Toul&quot;.

==Administration==
Toul is the seat and part of the canton of Toul, and of the arrondissement of Toul.

<text>Maximilian Steiner (27 August 1830 – 29 May 1880) was an Austrian actor and theater director and manager. He is known particularly for his leadership of Vienna&#x27;s Theater an der Wien from 1869 to 1880, a period during which the theater reduced the importance of folk plays (dialect drama) and was prominent in developing and promoting the fashion of a Viennese style of operetta. He was the grandfather of Max Steiner.

==Life and career==

Steiner was born in Ofen, now a part of Budapest in Hungary, then a part of the Austrian Empire. In the early 1850s, he began work in the stage crew of the theatre in Temeswar (now in Romania). In 1854, he was engaged by the theater director Friedrich Strampfer as an actor in the German-language theater. He continued to act in that theater and others in the region till 1862, gaining both acting and directing experience, when he followed Strampfer to Vienna, where Steiner became secretary (an executive role) in the Theater an der Wien. Strampfer gave him considerable leeway to develop his own career, and in August 1869 Steiner became manager after Strampfer stepped down. Till 1875 Steiner was co-manager with the actress and singer Marie Geistinger; together, they &quot;set a tone for the repertoire that lasted until the end of the century,&quot; despite criticism from the conservative press. When Geistinger left for Berlin, Steiner led the theater on his own, with help from his sons Franz and Gabor, till his death in 1880. Steiner&#x27;s business acuity helped the Theater stay open after the stock market crash in 1873, but he did lose control for several months in 1877 due to another set of financial difficulties; he gained control again later in the same year with the help of friends and other backers.

Although he and Geistinger came to emphasize operetta more and more, Steiner still built the theater&#x27;s seasons by emphasizing variety: the typical fare included folk plays, burlesques with music, and operetta. He gradually phased out spoken-word dramas, contributing fundamentally to the Viennese operetta boom that continued till well into the twentieth century. He produced both well-proven and new stage works by Offenbach but also discovered young talent such as the playwright Ludwig Anzengruber, the last prominent author of folk plays, and the composer Carl Millöcker, who became the Theater&#x27;s Kapellmeister in 1869.

When the first wife of Johann Strauss, jr., brought some of the composer&#x27;s musical sketches to Steiner, he took on himself responsibility for encouraging Strauss to write operetta. As it happened, Strauss, piqued by the Viennese successes of Jacques Offenbach, had already started working on an operetta, a project that fell through when it was discovered that his intended lead, Josefine Gallmeyer, was unavailable. Steiner then collaborated with Strauss on Indigo and the Forty Thieves, which premiered on 10 February 1871 and for which Steiner wrote the libretto. Strauss&#x27;s second operetta, Die Fledermaus (1874) became a fixture of German-language theaters and has remained in the canon of operetta to this day. The initial production starred Geistinger as Rosalinde. Second and third productions followed in 1875 and 1876. The latter is notable for introducing, as Dr. Falke, Alexander Girardi, who stayed with the Theater&#x27;s company for twenty two years and was a central figure in many successful operetta productions.

Steiner organized a playwright&#x27;s guild, staged yearly benefit shows, and at the time of his death was one of the most popular figures in Vienna. With his wife, Rosa (Kollinsky), he had two sons: Franz Steiner, who took over his functions in the theater in 1880 and remained until 1884; and Gábor Steiner, who also became a theater manager and operator of a music hall. Gábor&#x27;s son was Max Steiner, who worked in London theaters, then in New York, and after 1929 was a Hollywood film composer.

<text>Ath (; , ; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Arbre, Ath, Bouvignies, Ghislenghien, Gibecq, Houtaing, Irchonwelz, Isières, Lanquesaint, Ligne, Maffle, Mainvault, Meslin-l&#x27;Évêque, Moulbaix, Ormeignies, Ostiches, Rebaix, Villers-Notre-Dame, and Villers-Saint-Amand.

Ath is known as the &quot;City of Giants&quot; after the Ducasse d&#x27;Ath festivities which take place every year on the fourth weekend in August. Huge figures representing Goliath, Samson, and other allegoric figures are paraded through the streets, and Goliath&#x27;s wedding and his famous fight with David are re-enacted.

Ath is the point of origin of the river Dender from the merger of its Eastern and Western branches.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Athum&quot; is attested first in 1076. Other spellings include &quot;Aat&quot; and &quot;Aeth.&quot; It may refer to a fortified place on a ford (Celtic origin; cf. Irish name of Dublin, &quot;Baile Átha Cliath&quot;, where &quot;Átha&quot; clearly means the ford, as oft-elsewhere in Ireland where there is a river to cross).

===Pre–1500===
Archeological records show the existence of several Gallo-Roman settlements in the Ath area. The origin of the city of Ath, however, dates from around 1160, when Count Baudouin IV of Hainaut, bought some territory from his liegeman, Gilles de Trazegnies. A few years later, Baldwin built the Burbant Tower – which can still be seen today – to protect his new acquisition. The new city was soon given privileges and its newly built (1325) market hall on the &quot;Grand-Place&quot; began to attract residents.

Ath was the setting of the &quot;Peace of Ath&quot;, signed on June4, 1357, to end the question of the Brabant succession. By then, the weekly Ath market, which took place – and still takes place – on Thursdays, had started attracting sellers from a much larger region. The production of linen, cloth, hide, and luxury items such as gold ware, cabinets, and sculptures was growing fast. The population growth necessitated the building of a second wall, which was completed at the end of the 14th century. In 1416, the city built a school for the study of Latin, which Justus Lipsius attended. The city counted then about 5,000 people.

===1501–present===
In 1667, Ath was conquered in a single day by the army of Louis XIV and became the first French city of the Spanish Netherlands. Soon after, Vauban built new fortifications, which included eight bastions. The city suffered again at the hands of the French army in 1745. At the end of the 18th century, Ath counted about 7,300 inhabitants but the population count decreased in the first half of the 19th century.

In 1816, two military engineering surveys concluded that Ath defences should be improved, the British survey recommended a garrison of 3,000 troops and the building cost would be £143,599. The Dutch wished to spend an additional £266,000. The Duke of Wellington agreed to the Dutch plan. The funding was paid for by England (30%), Holland (30%) and by French war reparations (40%). In 1824, the Dutch under King William I, built the Féron Fort, and the city once more gained strategic value.

A treaty drafted in London on 15 November 1831, which the Netherlands refused to sign, was followed by the Treaty of London (1839), which created the Kingdom of Belgium. Part of the terms of the treaty required the fort, amongst others, to be dismantled.

The freed up land assisted the town for the activities of a growing population. A new growth period took place between 1850 and 1914 driven by the forestry, agricultural (breweries, mills) and textile industries.

In the 20th century, most of these industries went into decline and were replaced by commercial, administrative and educational activities. In the last 30 years, several neighbourhoods have been revitalized and developed, and the city&#x27;s monuments renovated or restored.

=== July 30, 2004 explosions ===
The Ghislenghien industrial park near Ath was the scene of one of Belgium&#x27;s worst ever industrial disasters on July 30, 2004. Around 8:30 am local time, workers constructing a new factory for abrasives firm (a subsidiary of the Electrolux Group) reported a strong smell of gas. It is believed the gas was escaping from a high-pressure underground pipeline conveying natural gas from Zeebrugge to France, operated by gas transportation company Fluxys. Firefighters were soon on the scene and were attempting to clear the area when at least two explosions occurred at around 9:00 am. The strongest of these demolished the partly built Diamant Boart structure, and fires were started in several other buildings. 24 people were killed, with over 120 injured. Five volunteer firemen and one police officer were among the dead.

==Sights==
* The 12th-century &quot;Burbant&quot; tower was built by Baudouin IV and named after the neighbouring Landgraviate of Brabant.
* The town hall dates from the 17th century.
* The church of Saint Julien, rebuilt after a fire in the 19th century, still keeps a Gothic tower and apsidal chapel, as well as a famous 16th-century carillon.
* The church of Saint Martin and the exterior oak calvary both date from the 16th century.

==Festivities==
The “Ducasse” originated from a yearly procession developed in the 15th century (first mentioned in 1399) as a celebration of the consecration of the local Saint Julien church. This procession illustrated stories from the Old Testament, New Testament, Golden Legend, and Carolingian cycle. Today, the “Ducasse” is a very popular celebration that includes various festivities and lasts several days spanning the end of August and beginning of September. The highlight is the cortege of giants (in French: &quot;Cortège des géants&quot;), with David and Goliath as the most famous characters. In 2008, the Ducasse was listed by UNESCO among the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It was delisted in 2022 following complaints about one of the characters that appears in the procession: a &#x27;savage&#x27;, depicted by a white person in blackface, wearing a nose ring and chains.

==Transportation==
Ath is located along the N56 road.

<text>Bernissart (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

On January 1, 2006, Bernissart had a total population of 11,458. The total area is 43.42 km2, which gives a population density of 264 inhabitants per km2.

== The &quot;Iguanodon&quot; mine ==

In 1878, dozens of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; skeletons were discovered in a coal mine, at a depth of 322 m (1,056 ft). At the time, their proximity was considered proof that some dinosaurs were herd animals. They were mounted by Louis Dollo and set the standard that was followed for over a century. Nine of the twenty-nine skeletons are currently on display at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and one at the Bernissart Museum. The two museums even made an error they acknowledge with humour: they displayed the skeletons &quot;standing&quot;, suggesting that the dinosaurs were bipedal, which is not the case. Found alongside the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform &quot;Bernissartia&quot;. The sediments are considered to belong to the Sainte-Barbe Clays Formation.

<text>Flobecq (; ; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It borders to the municipalities of Ellezelles (to the west) and Lessines (to the east) in the same province and to Brakel in the province of East Flanders, on the other side of the language border.

On January 1, 2018, Flobecq had a total population of 3,420. The total area is which gives a population density of .

Flobecq is a tourist village. Each year, on the nearest Friday to 17 January, there is a marvelous local feast based on the adoration of Saint Antony.

Flobecq offers language facilities for Dutch speakers.

== History ==
Flobecq was initially under strong influence of Tournai and, as in Tournai, Picard was spoken there. Since the 13th century, the area was continuously disputed between the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut. Therefore, the region (including neighbouring places like Lessines, Ellezelles, ...) was often called &quot;debate land&quot; (Dutch: &quot;debattenland&quot;; French: &quot;terre des débats&quot;).

In 1963, when the language border was fixed, within the municipality of Flobecq, only the village of La Houppe/D&#x27;Hoppe was Dutch-speaking. However, the village was not transferred to Dutch-speaking East Flanders and remained in French-speaking area. Instead, Flobecq as a whole became a municipality with language facilities for Dutch.

<text>François Ravaillac (; 1578 – 27 May 1610) was a French Catholic who assassinated King Henry IV of France in 1610.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Ravaillac was born in 1578 at Angoulême to an educated family; his grandfather François Ravaillac was the prosecutor in Angoulême, and two of his maternal uncles were canons of the Angoulême Cathedral. His father Jean Ravaillac was a violent man whose many misdeeds caused a public scandal and led to legal difficulties, while his mother Françoise Dubreuil was known for her Catholic piety. He first began working as a servant, later becoming a school teacher. Obsessed with religion, he sought admission to the ascetic Feuillants order, but after a short probation, he was dismissed for being &quot;prey to visions.&quot; An application in 1606 for admission to the Society of Jesus was also unsuccessful.

===Regicide===

In 1609, Ravaillac claimed to have experienced a vision instructing him to convince King Henry IV to convert the Huguenots to Catholicism. Between Pentecost 1609 and May 1610, Ravaillac made three separate trips to Paris to tell his vision to the king, and lodged with Charlotte du Tillet, mistress of Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, duc d&#x27;Épernon. Unable to meet the king, Ravaillac interpreted Henry&#x27;s decision to invade the Spanish Netherlands as the start of a war against the Pope. Determined to stop him, he decided to kill the king.

On 14 May 1610, Ravaillac lay in wait on Rue de la Ferronnerie in Paris (now south of the Forum des Halles); when the king passed, his carriage was halted by a blockage in the street, Ravaillac seized his opportunity, climbed into the coach and stabbed Henry to death. Pierre de l&#x27;Estoile, the chronicler, stated of the king:

Hercule, Duke of Montbazon, riding with Henry, was wounded in the attack. Ravaillac was immediately seized by police and taken to the Hôtel de Retz to avoid a mob lynching. He was transferred to the &quot;Conciergerie&quot;.

===Trial and execution===

During interrogation, Ravaillac was frequently tortured to make him identify accomplices, but he denied that he had any and insisted that he had acted alone. His knowledge of the king&#x27;s route and the blockage of traffic that put the king within reach excited speculation. The king was on his way to visit Maximilien de Béthune, who lay ill in the Arsenal; his purpose was to make final preparations for imminent military intervention in the War of the Jülich Succession after the death of Duke John William. Intervention on behalf of a Calvinist candidate would have brought France into conflict with the Catholic Habsburg dynasty. Ravaillac seems to have learned of the plans; in his tortured mind, &quot;he had seen that the king wanted to make war on the Pope, in order to transfer the Holy See to Paris&quot;.

At the start of the interrogation, Ravaillac said;

On May 27 he was taken to the Place de Grève in Paris and was tortured one last time before being pulled apart by four horses, a method of execution reserved for regicides. Alistair Horne describes the torture Ravaillac suffered: 

Following his execution, Ravaillac&#x27;s parents were forced into exile, and the rest of his family was ordered never to use the name &quot;Ravaillac&quot; again. 

In January 1611, Jacqueline d&#x27;Escoman, who had known Ravaillac, denounced Jean Louis de Nogaret as the one responsible for the death of Henry IV; she was jailed for the rest of her life. Philippe Erlanger, in his book &quot;L&#x27;Étrange Mort de Henri IV&quot; (1957, rev. 1999), reveals Épernon&#x27;s association with Ravaillac through his mistress. He concludes that Ravaillac, the King&#x27;s mistress Henriette d&#x27;Entragues and Charlotte du Tillet planned the assassination. The contrary view, that Ravaillac had no accomplices but his confessors in the church, is expressed by Roland Mousnier in &quot;L&#x27;Assassinat d&#x27;Henri IV: 14 mai 1610&quot; (Paris, 1964).

In later ages Ravaillac was perceived as an evil figure. While only a few Catholics viewed him as a hero, atheist philosopher Jean Meslier praised him as a freedom fighter against tyranny.

<doc id="175205" wikidata="Q1665345" url="?curid=175205" title="Integrated services">
<text>In computer networking, integrated services or IntServ is an architecture that specifies the elements to guarantee quality of service (QoS) on networks. IntServ can for example be used to allow video and sound to reach the receiver without interruption.

IntServ specifies a fine-grained QoS system, which is often contrasted with DiffServ&#x27;s coarse-grained control system.

Under IntServ, every router in the system implements IntServ, and every application that requires some kind of QoS guarantee has to make an individual reservation. &quot;Flow specs&quot; describe what the reservation is for, while &quot;RSVP&quot; is the underlying mechanism to signal it across the network.

==Flow specs ==

There are two parts to a flow spec:

* What does the traffic look like? Done in the Traffic SPECification part, also known as TSPEC.
* What guarantees does it need? Done in the service Request SPECification part, also known as RSPEC.
TSPECs include token bucket algorithm parameters. The idea is that there is a token bucket which slowly fills up with tokens, arriving at a constant rate. Every packet which is sent requires a token, and if there are no tokens, then it cannot be sent. Thus, the rate at which tokens arrive dictates the average rate of traffic flow, while the depth of the bucket dictates how &#x27;bursty&#x27; the traffic is allowed to be.

TSPECs typically just specify the token rate and the bucket depth. For example, a video with a refresh rate of 75 frames per second, with each frame taking 10 packets, might specify a token rate of 750 Hz, and a bucket depth of only 10. The bucket depth would be sufficient to accommodate the &#x27;burst&#x27; associated with sending an entire frame all at once. On the other hand, a conversation would need a lower token rate, but a much higher bucket depth. This is because there are often pauses in conversations, so they can make do with less tokens by not sending the gaps between words and sentences. However, this means the bucket depth needs to be increased to compensate for the traffic being burstier.

RSPECs specify what requirements there are for the flow: it can be normal internet &#x27;best effort&#x27;, in which case no reservation is needed. This setting is likely to be used for webpages, FTP, and similar applications. The &#x27;Controlled Load&#x27; setting mirrors the performance of a lightly loaded network: there may be occasional glitches when two people access the same resource by chance, but generally both delay and drop rate are fairly constant at the desired rate. This setting is likely to be used by soft QoS applications. The &#x27;Guaranteed&#x27; setting gives an absolutely bounded service, where the delay is promised to never go above a desired amount, and packets never dropped, provided the traffic stays within spec.

== RSVP ==

The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is described in RFC 2205. All machines on the network capable of sending QoS data send a PATH message every 30 seconds, which spreads out through the networks. Those who want to listen to them send a corresponding RESV (short for &quot;Reserve&quot;) message which then traces the path backwards to the sender. The RESV message contains the flow specs.

The routers between the sender and listener have to decide if they can support the reservation being requested, and, if they cannot, they send a reject message to let the listener know about it. Otherwise, once they accept the reservation they have to carry the traffic.

The routers then store the nature of the flow, and also police it. This is all done in soft state, so if nothing is heard for a certain length of time, then the reader will time out and the reservation will be cancelled. This solves the problem if either the sender or the receiver crash or are shut down incorrectly without first cancelling the reservation. The individual routers may, at their option, police the traffic to check that it conforms to the flow specs.

== Problems ==
In order for IntServ to work, all routers along the traffic path must support it. Furthermore, many states must be stored in each router. As a result, IntServ works on a small-scale, but as the system scales up to larger networks or the Internet, it becomes resource intensive to track of all of the reservations.

One way to solve the scalability problem is by using a multi-level approach, where per-microflow resource reservation (such as resource reservation for individual users) is done in the edge network, while in the core network resources are reserved for aggregate flows only. The routers that lie between these different levels must adjust the amount of aggregate bandwidth reserved from the core network so that the reservation requests for individual flows from the edge network can be better satisfied.

<doc id="175207" wikidata="Q16148818" url="?curid=175207" title="Act of Uniformity 1662">
<text>The Act of Uniformity 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 4) is an Act of the Parliament of England. (It was formerly cited as 13 &amp; 14 Cha. 2. c. 4, by reference to the regnal year when it was passed on 19 May 1662.) It prescribed the form of public prayers, administration of sacraments, and other rites of the Established Church of England, according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Adherence to this was required in order to hold any office in government or the church, although the new version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; prescribed by the Act was so new that most people had never even seen a copy. The Act also required that the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; &quot;be truly and exactly Translated into the British or Welsh Tongue&quot;. It also explicitly required episcopal ordination for all ministers, i.e. deacons, priests and bishops, which had to be reintroduced since the Puritans had abolished many features of the Church during the Civil War. The act did not explicitly encompass the Isle of Man.

A few sections of this Act were still in force in the United Kingdom at the end of 2010.

==Great Ejection==

As an immediate result of this Act, over 2,000 clergymen refused to take the oath and were expelled from the Church of England in what became known as the Great Ejection of 1662. Although there had already been ministers outside the established church, this created the concept of non-conformity, with a substantial section of English society excluded from public affairs for a century and a half.

==Clarendon Code==
The Act of Uniformity itself is one of four crucial pieces of legislation, known as the Clarendon Code, named after Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, Charles II&#x27;s Lord Chancellor. They are:

*The Corporation Act 1661 – This first of the four statutes which made up the Clarendon Code required all municipal officials to take Anglican communion, and formally reject the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. The effect of this act was to exclude nonconformists from public office. This legislation was rescinded in 1828.
*The Act of Uniformity 1662 – This second statute made use of the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious service. Upwards of 2000 clergy refused to comply with this act, and were forced to resign their livings.
*The Conventicle Act 1664 – This act forbade conventicles (a meeting for unauthorized worship) of more than 5 people who were not members of the same household. The purpose was to prevent dissenting religious groups from meeting.
*The Five Mile Act 1665 – This final act of the Clarendon Code was aimed at Nonconformist ministers, who were forbidden from coming within five miles of incorporated towns or the place of their former livings. They were also forbidden to teach in schools. This act was not rescinded until 1812.

Combined with the Test Act, the Corporation Acts excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.

==Quakers Act 1662==

Another Act, the Quaker Act 1662, required subjects to swear an oath of allegiance to the king, which Quakers did not do out of religious conviction. It set out specific penalties for first (a fine of up to £5, or three months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour), second (a fine of up to £10, or six months imprisonment with hard labour), and third (transportation) offence. It also allowed that should the defendant subsequently agree to swear oaths and not attend unlawful assemblies (as defined by the Act) then all penalties would be cancelled.

==Book of Common Prayer==
The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; introduced by Charles II was substantially the same as Elizabeth&#x27;s version of 1559, itself based on Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s earlier version of 1552. Apart from minor changes this remains the official and permanent legal version of prayer authorised by Parliament and Church.

==Act of Toleration==

The Toleration Act 1688 allowed certain dissenters places and freedom to worship, provided they accept to subscribe to an oath.

==Modified in 1872==
The provisions of the Act of Uniformity 1662 were modified and partly revoked by the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act 1872. This has been repealed by the General Synod.

<text>The Five Mile Act, or Oxford Act, or Nonconformists Act 1665, was an Act of the Parliament of England (17 Cha. 2. c. 2), passed in 1665 with the long title &quot;An Act for restraining Non-Conformists from inhabiting in Corporations&quot;. It was one of the English penal laws that sought to enforce conformity to the established Church of England, and to expel any who did not conform. It forbade clergymen from living, visiting or preaching within five miles (8 km) of a parish from which they had been expelled, or to come within five miles of any city, town or borough that sends Members to Parliament unless they swore an oath never to resist the king, or attempt to alter the government of Church or State. The latter involved swearing to obey the 1662 prayer book. Thousands of ministers were deprived of a living under this act.

As an example, Theodosia Alleine and her husband Joseph Alleine were obliged to move to Taunton after her husband&#x27;s conviction as a non-conformist. They moved, but they were still harassed and had to move and live with friends to escape their critics.

<doc id="175212" wikidata="Q1777306" url="?curid=175212" title="Penal law (British)">
<text>In English history, the penal laws were a series of laws that sought to enforce the State-decreed religious monopoly of the Church of England and, following the 1688 revolution, of Presbyterianism in Scotland, against the continued existence of illegal and underground communities of Catholics, nonjuring Anglicans, and Protestant nonconformists. The Penal laws also imposed various forfeitures, civil penalties, and civil disabilities upon recusants from mandatory attendance at weekly Sunday services of the Established Church. The penal laws in general were repealed in the early 19th-century due to the successful activism of Daniel O&#x27;Connell for Catholic Emancipation. Penal actions are civil in nature and were not English common law.

==Marian persecutions==

In 1553, following the death of her half-brother, Edward VI, and deposing his choice of successor, Lady Jane Grey, Mary I of England seized the throne, and soon after repealed the religious legislation of her brother and father, Henry VIII, through the First Statute of Repeal (1 Mar. Sess. 2. c. 2). Restoring England, Wales and Ireland to the Roman Catholic Church. 

An English inquisition was established to identify, exile, convert, or prosecute non-conforming Catholics, with over 300 Protestant dissenters branded heretics, and killed, and many more exiled in her five-year reign. A list of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation was published soon after her death.
* November 1554 - Mary revived the Heresy Acts (1 &amp; 2 Ph. &amp; M. c. 6), outlawing all Protestant literature and believers, it would be repealed a year after her death.

==Elizabethan==
* The Act of Supremacy 1558 (1 Eliz. 1. c. 1), confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and imposed an Oath of Supremacy which required any person taking public or church office in England to swear allegiance to the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. It also made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign prince, prelate, or other authority, and was aimed at abolishing the authority of the Pope in England. All who maintained the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority of any foreign prelate were to forfeit all goods and chattels, both real and personal, and all benefices for the first offence, or in case the value of these was below 20 pounds, to be imprisoned for one year; they were liable to the forfeitures of &quot;praemunire&quot; for the second offence. The penalties of &quot;praemunire&quot; were: exclusion from the sovereign&#x27;s protection, forfeiture of all lands and goods, arrest to answer to the Sovereign and Council.

* The Act of Uniformity 1558 (1 Eliz. 1. c. 2) set the order of prayer to be used in the English &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and required all persons to go to church once a week or be fined. It punished all clerics who used any other service by deprivation and imprisonment.

* The Supremacy of the Crown Act 1562 (5 Eliz. 1. c. 1) made a second offence of refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy treason.

===Response to &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;===
In 1570 Pope Pius V excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I, citing as his reasons heresy, Caesaropapism, and the religious persecution by the State of the illegal and underground Catholic Church in England and Wales, and in Ireland, by releasing the Papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;. In response:

* 13 Eliz. 1. c. 1 made it high treason to affirm that the queen ought not to enjoy the Crown, or to declare her to be a heretic or schismatic; 
* 13 Eliz. 1. c. 2, which made it high treason to put into effect any papal Bull of absolution, to absolve or reconcile any person to the Catholic Church, or to be so absolved or reconciled, or to procure or publish any papal Bull or writing whatsoever. The penalties of &quot;praemunire&quot; were enacted against all who brought into England or who gave to others &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; or articles blessed by the pope or by any one through faculties from him. 
* 13 Eliz. 1. c. 3, was designed to stop Catholics from taking refuge abroad, and declared that any subject departing the realm without the queen&#x27;s license, and not returning within six months, should forfeit the profits of his lands during life and all his goods and chattels.
* The Act to retain the Queen&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s subjects in their obedience (23 Eliz. 1. c. 1), passed in 1581. This made it high treason to reconcile anyone or to be reconciled to &quot;the Romish religion&quot;, prohibited Mass under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. This act also increased the penalty for not attending the Anglican service to the sum of twenty pounds a month, or imprisonment till the fine be paid, or till the offender went to the Anglican Church. A further penalty of ten pounds a month was inflicted on anyone keeping a schoolmaster who did not attend the Anglican service. The schoolmaster himself was to be imprisoned for one year. 

* The Jesuits, etc. Act 1584 commanded all Roman Catholic priests to leave the country in 40 days or they be punished for high treason, unless within the 40 days they swore an oath to obey the Queen. Those who harboured them, and all those who knew of their presence and failed to inform the authorities would be fined and imprisoned, or where the authorities wished to make an example of them, they might be executed. This statute, under which most of the English martyrs suffered, made it high treason for any Jesuit or any seminary priest to be in England at all, and felony for any one to harbour or relieve them. The penalties of &quot;praemunire&quot; were imposed on all who sent assistance to the seminaries abroad, and a fine of 100 pounds for each offence on those who sent their children overseas without the royal licence.

==Clarendon Code==
While some of the Penal Laws were much older, they took their most drastic shape during the reign of Charles II, especially the laws known as the Clarendon Code and the Test Act. 

The four penal laws collectively known as Clarendon Code are named after Charles II&#x27;s chief minister Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, though Clarendon was neither their author nor fully in favour of them. These included:

*the Corporation Act 1661 required all municipal officials to take Anglican communion, and formally reject the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. The effect of this act was to exclude nonconformists from public office. While the legislation was not rescinded until 1828, the legal power to enforce it lapsed in 1663, and therefore many evicted officials were able to regain their positions after a few years.
*the Act of Uniformity 1662 made use of the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious service. Over two thousand clergy refused to comply and so were forced to resign their livings (the Great Ejection). The provisions of the act were modified by the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act 1872.
*the Conventicle Act 1664 forbade conventicles (a meeting for unauthorized worship) of more than five people who were not members of the same household. The purpose was to prevent dissenting religious groups from meeting.
*the Five Mile Act 1665 forbade nonconformist ministers from coming within five miles of incorporated towns or the place of their former livings. They were also forbidden to teach in schools. Most of the act&#x27;s effects were repealed by 1689, but it was not formally abolished until 1812.

Combined with the Test Act 1673, the Corporation Act 1661 excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.

==Further penal laws in Great Britain==

In the late 17th and 18th centuries, many non-conformist Protestants successfully evaded the political disabilities imposed by the Test Act by taking communion in the Church of England as required, while otherwise attending non-conformist meetings. High churchmen and Tories, empowered late in Queen Anne&#x27;s reign, sought to close this loophole with the passing of the Occasional Conformity Bill in 1711, however the Act was repealed after the Hanoverian Succession with the return to power of the Whig political party, who were generally allied with non-conforming Protestants. This led, as well, to a systematic political purge of both real and suspected Tories.

In the wake of the Jacobite Rising of 1715, the British parliament also passed the Disarming Act 1715.
The (6 Geo. 2. c. 5) was an Act of Parliament passed by the Parliament of Great Britain during the reign of George II. Its long title was &quot;An Act for allowing further time for the Inrolment of Deeds and Wills made by Papists, and for Relief of Protestant Purchasers and Lessees&quot;.

The Whig single party state would continue to dominate the political and religious life of the British Empire until King George III ascended to the throne and allowed the Tories back into the Government in 1763. Even then, the Whig party remained a political monolith and only fragmented in response to the American and French Revolutions.

==Penal laws in Ireland==
The Penal Laws were introduced into Ireland in the year 1695, disenfranchising nonconformists in favour of the minority established Church of Ireland, aligned with the Protestant Church of England. The laws&#x27; principal victims were members of the Catholic Church, numbering over three quarters of the population in the south, and adherents of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a majority of the population in Ulster. These laws included:
*Education Act 1695
*Banishment Act 1697
*Registration Act 1704
*Popery Act 1704 and 1709
*Disenfranchising Act 1728

The laws were eventually repealed, beginning in the 1770s by the 1774 Quebec Act and the Papists Act 1778. The British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was followed in Ireland in 1793. Finally in 1829 Catholic emancipation was enacted, largely due to Irish political agitation organised under Daniel O&#x27;Connell in the 1820s. Sectarianism between Catholics and Protestants persisted through the 20th century, and its effects can still be seen, particularly in Northern Ireland, today.

<text>Kai Nielsen (May 15, 1926 – April 7, 2021) was an American professor of philosophy at the University of Calgary. He specialized in naturalism, metaphilosophy, ethics, analytic philosophy, social and political philosophy. Nielsen also wrote about philosophy of religion, and was an advocate of contemporary atheism. He was also known for his defense of utilitarianism, writing in response to Bernard Williams&#x27;s criticism of it.

==Biography==
Born on May 15, 1926, in Marshall, Michigan, near Battle Creek, Michigan, Kai Edward Nielsen was raised in Moline, Illinois.

His father was from Copenhagen, Denmark, and spoke Danish and Swedish. As he said about his father later, &quot;My father was a Danish immigrant who came to New York City when he was fifteen. He didn’t know a word of English then. They put him into the first grade in school and he hated it. What could he do? He couldn’t speak any English and here he was with these little English-speaking kids. He was fifteen and they were five or six. He left school and just sort of made it on his own, as you could still do then.&quot;

His mother was American but according to Nielsen she &quot;was Métis. Her mother came from Lac St. Jean, though she herself never spoke French. Her mother immigrated early to the United States before she could speak.&quot; He told the following story to illustrate the difference between his mother and his father: &quot;A few years before the Second World War, a friend of my father, who was his subordinate in an insurance company where my father was a superintendent, was invited to our summer home. This was during the Joe Louis/Max Schmeling boxing match. We were at our summer house, which had a big American flag on one wall and a big Danish flag on the other. This friend of my father, whom I called Uncle Percy, began to talk about Hitler – the Louis/Schmeling fight was a big German-American affair – and he said, “Well, there was one good thing Hitler did. He got after the Jews.” My mother got up and walked out of the room and, after he had left, she told my father to never let Uncle Percy into the house again.&quot;

== Upbringing ==
In an interview given later in his life, Nielsen explained what had moved him to the &quot;left (I would never have so called it then)&quot; by telling two stories from his childhood about class and race: &quot;I grew up in a little Midwestern American town during the Great Depression where I saw, as a little boy, a number of things that left their mark on me. My parents did financially well during the Depression, as they had before and did after it. For example, we had a maid to pick up after us, particularly me. But across the ravine from our house lived a bunch of poor people and, as you know kids will do, I used to go home after school with some of my schoolmates to play ball with them. In one of the houses I visited, the only ball they had was something they had tied together with string. I remember that the house was unheated and the mother’s face looked ravaged. There was almost no furniture. The father was away on the road looking for work. Many of the houses in our town were like that. But when I came home, I had a maid that picked up my clothes and books wherever I threw them. I had warmth and comfort and plenty to eat. I couldn’t believe that this difference could be right. I realized then there was something wrong with the kind of society that would allow this. I had various awarenesses of this. Seeing, for example, people that worked on Work Projects Administration (the Roosevelt Administration’s project for creating jobs), standing in lines leaning on their shovels. I remember asking my father (who was conservative, though I, in those days, never thought about this) as we drove by our big car – a predecessor of the Cadillac – “Who are these people?” And he said, “People hired by Roosevelt for the Works Project Administration. They could get real jobs if they wanted them. They don’t have to live off the dole.” It was experiences like this that impressed me and rooted what would become my turn to the left, later my firm socialism. If only my father would have read Upton Sinclair’s &quot;The Jungle&quot;. Another example, this one racial: One of my close schoolboy friends was black – a Negro, as we said then. One day after school, I invited him to come home with me to play. I noticed when we entered the house that our maid, who was Swedish, looked startled when she saw him. When he left, my mother came to me and said, “Don’t ever bring George back here again.” And my father, to stamp this in, called up George’s father and told him not to allow George to come back.&quot;

== Education ==
Nielsen went to middle school, and high school for two years, in Moline. He then switched to St. Ambrose Academy, part of St. Ambrose College (now St. Ambrose University (since 1987)), in nearby Davenport, Iowa, because he wanted to play on their basketball team. After graduating from high school, he spent three months in officers&#x27; training school and served the last two years of the Second World War in the merchant marine, in the Pacific, on a merchant ship. They were attacked once by a Japanese plane but were not hit. After the war, he attended St. Ambrose College for two years. St. Ambrose was a Catholic school. Nielsen was struggling with religious bel belief at the time, after having read some philosophy during the war: &quot;After the war, I went back to St. Ambrose for two years of college before I transferred to the University of North Carolina. So my first college (university) was a Catholic school. There were two people who influenced me there. One was a priest who knew a lot about literature and talked about it in a really interesting way. The other was a layman who came from Montreal and had studied at the University of Toronto – at St. Michael’s College – with Gilson and Maritain. His name was Frederich Flynn and he taught philosophy at this small Catholic college. You had to take a lot of philosophy in Catholic schools back then. Perhaps you still do. It was required and most of the students – most of them Catholics – hated it. Most of these courses at that school were unbelievably boring, taught by priests from scholastic manuals and most of these priests were not very interested in philosophy. I took a course from Flynn who taught Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas. He was very different from the rest. When he talked about Aquinas, instead of just saying the proofs work, he said there were problems with them. And we talked about them and he found that I had an interest in these things. I was by then struggling with religion and he told me I should also read some Scotus, Ockham, and Maimonides and to read the philosophers themselves, not just the manuals. He impressed me and made me interested in philosophy. It was at this time that I also read Santayana and that had a secularizing effect on me. My previous wartime reading of Nietzsche and Dewey had a similar effect. At that time in my life, there were lots of conflicting currents tumbling around in me.&quot;

Nielsen then transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received his A.B. degree, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, with an honors thesis on James Joyce. During his time at Chapel Hill, Nielsen became radicalized: &quot;The University of North Carolina was not only segregated by race but by gender as well. There were only male students at UNC initially (except for graduate school). This was also the case when I taught at Hamilton College and Amherst College. I guess there are only two all-male schools left in the United States now [2012], but back then there were a lot of them. But there was also racial segregation in North Carolina, including at the liberal University of North Carolina. The University of North Carolina and Duke University had no black students at all. That was called “separate but equal.” But that, of course, was not true. By that time, I was sensitized to this, so I joined various challenging movements, particularly radical ones, though in the eyes of the establishment, they were all radical movements. It was a period during which I quickly became very radical.&quot;

In the same interview, Nielsen described being the victim of a racist intimidation: &quot;During a U.S. presidential race, Henry Wallace (not George Wallace), who had been vice president under Truman, formed a new party and ran for president. I joined a student movement supporting Wallace. (Wallace was a kind of social democrat but his party made the tactical mistake of accepting help from the American Communist Party and that finished them.) Paul Robeson, a black and prominent member of the Communist Party, was an articulate supporter of Wallace. I had seen Paul Robeson play the lead part in Othello in San Francisco during the war when I was still in the service. I remember responding then, “Jesus, what is this?” I was spellbound. We students at Chapel Hill arranged for Paul Robeson to come to campus to talk in support of Wallace and this third party. But he was a member of the Communist Party and by that time had been blacklisted. The university, after a lot of liberal dithering, finally said we could not meet in the lecture hall we had planned for and with their initial agreement. So we went to an empty lot that belonged to a gas station in downtown Chapel Hill that had closed for the evening. I introduced Robeson and he talked there. For that I got a cross burned in front of my house that night.&quot;

Nielsen went to graduate school in philosophy at nearby Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, and received his PhD from Duke in 1959. During those years at university he also published a novel.

== Teaching career ==
Nielsen taught at Hamilton College before getting hired at Amherst College, where he taught for three years in the Department of Philosophy and Religion. After a meeting with Sidney Hook at Amherst, he was invited to join the philosophy department at New York University, where he eventually became chair of the department. During the Vietnam War, he moved to the University of Calgary.

Nielsen was a member of the Royal Society of Canada and a past president (in 1983) of the Canadian Philosophical Association.

Nielsen was also one of the founding members of the &quot;Canadian Journal of Philosophy&quot;.

In 1973 Nielsen was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.

He wrote or edited over 40 books on topics such as Marxism, metaphilosophy and ethical and political theory.

In 2007, &quot;Reason and Emancipation: Essays on the Philosophy of Kai Nielsen&quot;, edited by Michel Seymour and Matthias Fritsch, was published, with contributions from Anthony Kenny, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Richard Rorty, and Steven Lukes, among others. This book was published after a conference in honor of Nielsen was held in October 2003 at Concordia University.

Nielsen died in April 2021 at the age of 94.

<doc id="175216" wikidata="Q11146759" url="?curid=175216" title="Pseudohistory">
<text>Pseudohistory is a form of pseudoscholarship that attempts to distort or misrepresent the historical record, often by employing methods resembling those used in scholarly historical research. The related term cryptohistory is applied to pseudohistory derived from the superstitions intrinsic to occultism. Pseudohistory is related to pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology, and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap. Although pseudohistory comes in many forms, scholars have identified many features that tend to be common in pseudohistorical works; one example is that the use of pseudohistory is almost always motivated by a contemporary political, religious, or personal agenda. Pseudohistory also frequently presents sensational claims or a big lie about historical facts which would require unwarranted revision of the historical record.

Another hallmark of pseudohistory is an underlying premise that scholars have a furtive agenda to suppress the promoter&#x27;s thesis—a premise commonly corroborated by elaborate conspiracy theories. Works of pseudohistory often point exclusively to unreliable sources—including myths and legends, often treated as literal historical truth—to support the thesis being promoted while ignoring valid sources that contradict it. Sometimes a work of pseudohistory will adopt a position of historical relativism, insisting that there is really no such thing as historical truth and that any hypothesis is just as good as any other. Many works of pseudohistory conflate mere possibility with actuality, assuming that if something &quot;could&quot; have happened, then it did.

Notable examples of pseudohistory include British Israelism, the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the Irish slaves myth, the witch-cult, Armenian genocide denial, Holocaust denial, the clean Wehrmacht myth, and the claim that the Katyn massacre was not committed by the Soviet NKVD.

==Definition and etymology==
The term &quot;pseudohistory&quot; was coined in the early nineteenth century, which makes the word older than the related terms &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In an attestation from 1815, it is used to refer to the &quot;Contest of Homer and Hesiod&quot;, a purportedly historical narrative describing an entirely fictional contest between the Greek poets Homer and Hesiod. The pejorative sense of the term, labelling a flawed or disingenuous work of historiography, is found in another 1815 attestation. Pseudohistory is akin to pseudoscience in that both forms of falsification are achieved using the methodology that purports to, but does not, adhere to the established standards of research for the given field of intellectual enquiry of which the pseudoscience claims to be a part, and which offers little or no supporting evidence for its plausibility.

Writers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman define pseudohistory as &quot;the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes&quot;. Other writers take a broader definition; Douglas Allchin, a historian of science, contends that when the history of scientific discovery is presented in a simplified way, with drama exaggerated and scientists romanticized, this creates wrong stereotypes about how science works, and in fact constitutes pseudohistory, despite being based on real facts.

==Characteristics==
Robert Todd Carroll has developed a list of criteria to identify pseudo-historic works. He states that:

Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke prefers the term &quot;cryptohistory&quot;. He identifies two necessary elements as &quot;a complete ignorance of the primary sources&quot; and the repetition of &quot;inaccuracies and wild claims&quot;.

Other common characteristics of pseudohistory are:
* The arbitrary linking of disparate events so as to form – in the theorist&#x27;s opinion – a pattern. This is typically then developed into a conspiracy theory postulating a hidden agent responsible for creating and maintaining the pattern. For example, the pseudohistorical &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; links the Knights Templar, the medieval Grail Romances, the Merovingian Frankish dynasty and the artist Nicolas Poussin in an attempt to identify lineal descendants of Jesus.
* Hypothesising the consequences of unlikely events that &quot;could&quot; have happened, thereby assuming tacitly that they did.
* Sensationalism, or shock value
* Cherry picking, or &quot;law office history&quot;, evidence that helps the historical argument being made and suppressing evidence that hurts it.

==Categories and examples==

The following are some common categories of pseudohistorical theory, with examples. Not all theories in a listed category are necessarily pseudohistorical; they are rather categories that seem to attract pseudohistorians.

=== Main categories ===

==== Alternative chronologies ====
An alternative chronology is a revised sequence of events that deviates from the standard timeline of world history accepted by mainstream scholars. An example of an &quot;alternative chronology&quot; is Anatoly Fomenko&#x27;s New Chronology, which claims that recorded history actually began around AD 800 and all events that allegedly occurred prior to that point either never really happened at all or are simply inaccurate retellings of events that happened later. One of its outgrowths is the Tartary conspiracy theory. Other, less extreme examples, are the phantom time hypothesis, which asserts that the years AD 614–911 never took place; and the New Chronology of David Rohl, which claims that the accepted timelines for ancient Egyptian and Israelite history are wrong.

==== Historical falsification ====
In the eighth century, a forged document known as Donation of Constantine, which supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope, became widely circulated. In the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth published the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, a pseudohistorical work purporting to describe the ancient history and origins of the British people. The book synthesises earlier Celtic mythical traditions to inflate the deeds of the mythical King Arthur. The contemporary historian William of Newburgh wrote around 1190 that &quot;it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others&quot;.

==== Historical revisionism ====
The Shakespeare authorship question is a fringe theory that claims that the works attributed to William Shakespeare were actually written by someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.

Another example of historical revisionism is the thesis, found in the writings of David Barton and others, asserting that the United States was founded as an exclusively Christian nation. Mainstream historians instead support the traditional position, which holds that the American founding fathers intended for church and state to be kept separate.

Confederate revisionists (a.k.a. Civil War revisionists), &quot;Lost Cause&quot; advocates, and Neo-Confederates argue that the Confederate States of America&#x27;s prime motivation was the maintenance of states&#x27; rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of slavery.

Connected to the Lost Cause is the Irish slaves myth, a pseudo-historical narrative which conflates the experiences of Irish indentured servants and enslaved Africans in the Americas. This myth, which was historically promoted by Irish nationalists such as John Mitchel, has in the modern-day been promoted by white supremacists in the United States to minimize the mistreatment experienced by African Americans (such as racism and segregation) and oppose demands for slavery reparations. The myth has also been used to obscure and downplay Irish involvement in the transatlantic slave trade.

==== Historical negationism ====
While closely related to previous categories, historical negationism or denialism specifically aims to outright deny the existence of confirmed events, often including various massacres, genocides, and national histories.

Some examples include Holocaust denial, Armenian Genocide denial, as well as Nakba Denial in the 1984 work &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; by Joan Peters.

==== Psychohistory ====

Mainstream historians have categorized psychohistory as pseudohistory. Psychohistory is an amalgam of psychology, history, and related social sciences and the humanities. Its stated goal is to examine the &quot;why&quot; of history, especially the difference between stated intention and actual behavior. It also states as its goal the combination of the insights of psychology, especially psychoanalysis, with the research methodology of the social sciences and humanities to understand the emotional origin of the behavior of individuals, groups and nations, past and present.

==== Pseudoarchaeology ====
Pseudoarchaeology refers to a false interpretation of records, namely physical ones, often by unqualified or otherwise amateur archeologists. These interpretations are often baseless and seldom align with established consensus. Nazi archaeology is a prominent example of this technique. Frequently, people who engage in pseudoarchaeology have a very strict interpretation of evidence and are unwilling to alter their stance, resulting in interpretations that often appear overly simplistic and fail to capture the complexity and nuance of the complete narrative.

=== Various examples of pseudohistory ===
(These following examples can belong to a variety of the above mentioned categories, or ones not mentioned as well).

==== Ancient aliens, ancient technologies, and lost lands ====
Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s books &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; (1950), &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot; (1952), and &quot;Earth in Upheaval&quot; (1955), which became &quot;instant bestsellers&quot;, demonstrated that pseudohistory based on ancient mythology held potential for tremendous financial success and became models of success for future works in the genre.

In 1968, Erich von Däniken published &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;, which claims that ancient visitors from outer space constructed the pyramids and other monuments. He has since published other books in which he makes similar claims. These claims have all been categorized as pseudohistory. Similarly, Zechariah Sitchin has published numerous books claiming that a race of extraterrestrial beings from the Planet Nibiru known as the Anunnaki visited Earth in ancient times in search of gold, and that they genetically engineered humans to serve as their slaves. He claims that memories of these occurrences are recorded in Sumerian mythology, as well as other mythologies all across the globe. These speculations have likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.

The ancient astronaut hypothesis was further popularized in the United States by the History Channel television series &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;. History professor Ronald H. Fritze observed that the pseudohistorical claims promoted by von Däniken and the &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; program have a periodic popularity in the US: &quot;In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions.&quot;

The author Graham Hancock has sold over four million copies of books promoting the pseudohistorical thesis that all the major monuments of the ancient world, including Stonehenge, the Egyptian pyramids, and the moai of Easter Island, were built by a single ancient supercivilization, which Hancock claims thrived from 15,000 to 10,000 BC and possessed technological and scientific knowledge equal to or surpassing that of modern civilization. He first advanced the full form of this argument in his 1995 bestseller &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;, which won popular acclaim, but scholarly disdain. Christopher Knight has published numerous books, including &quot;Uriel&#x27;s Machine&quot; (2000), expounding pseudohistorical assertions that ancient civilizations possessed technology far more advanced than the technology of today.

The claim that a lost continent known as Lemuria once existed in the Pacific Ocean has likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.

Furthermore, similar conspiracy theories promote the idea of embellished, fabricated accounts of historical civilizations, namely Khazaria and Tartaria. 

==== Antisemitic pseudohistory ====
&quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; is a fraudulent work purporting to show a historical conspiracy for world domination by Jews. The work was conclusively proven to be a forgery in August 1921, when &quot;The Times&quot; revealed that extensive portions of the document were directly plagiarized from Maurice Joly&#x27;s 1864 satirical dialogue &quot;The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu&quot;, as well as Hermann Goedsche&#x27;s 1868 anti-Semitic novel &quot;Biarritz&quot;.

The Khazar theory is an academic fringe theory that postulates the belief that the bulk of European Jewry is of Central Asian (Turkic) origin. In spite of the mainstream academic consensus which conclusively rejects it, this theory has been promoted in Anti-Semitic and some Anti-Zionist circles, they argue that Jews are an alien element in both Europe and Palestine.

Holocaust denial in particular and genocide denial in general are widely categorized as pseudohistory. Major proponents of Holocaust denial include David Irving and others, who argue that the Holocaust, the Holodomor, the Armenian genocide, the Assyrian genocide, the Greek genocide and other genocides did not occur, or accounts of them were greatly exaggerated.

==== Ethnocentric or nationalist revisionism ====
Most Afrocentric (i.e. Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories, see Ancient Egyptian race controversy) ideas have been identified as pseudohistorical, alongside the &quot;Indigenous Aryans&quot; theories published by Hindu nationalists during the 1990s and 2000s. The &quot;crypto-history&quot; developed within Germanic mysticism and Nazi occultism has likewise been placed under this categorization. Among leading Nazis, Heinrich Himmler is believed to have been influenced by occultism and according to one theory, developed the SS base at Wewelsburg in accordance with an esoteric plan.

The Sun Language Theory is a pseudohistorical ideology which argues that all languages are descended from a form of proto-Turkish. The theory may have been partially devised in order to legitimize Arabic and Semitic loanwords occurring in the Turkish language by instead asserting that the Arabic and Semitic words were derived from the Turkish ones rather than vice versa.

A large number of nationalist pseudohistorical theories deal with the legendary Ten Lost Tribes of ancient Israel. British-Israelism, also known as Anglo-Israelism, the most famous example of this type, has been conclusively refuted by mainstream historians using evidence from a vast array of different fields of study.

Antiquization or Ancient Macedonism is a nationalistic pseudohistorical theory which postulates direct demographic, cultural and linguistic continuity between ancient Macedonians and the main ethnic group in present-day North Macedonia. The Bulgarian medieval dynasty of the Komitopules, which ruled the First Bulgarian Empire in late 10th and early 11th centuries AD, is presented as &quot;Macedonian&quot;, ruling a &quot;medieval Macedonian state&quot;, because its capitals were located in what was previously the ancient kingdom of Macedonia. North Macedonian historians often replace the ethnonym &quot;Bulgarians&quot; with &quot;Macedonians&quot;, or avoid it. North Macedonian scholars say the theory is intended to forge a national identity distinct from modern Bulgaria, which regards North Macedonia as an artificial nation. The theory is controversial in Greece and sparked mass protests there in 2018. A particular item of dispute is North Macedonian veneration of Alexander the Great; mainstream scholarship holds that Alexander had Greek ancestry, he was born in an area of ancient Macedonia that is now Greece, and he ruled over North Macedonia but never lived there and did not speak the local language. To placate Greece and thereby facilitate the country&#x27;s entry into the European Union and NATO, the Macedonian government formally renounced claims of ancient Macedonian heritage with the 2018 Prespa Agreement.

Dacianism is a Romanian pseudohistorical current that attempts to attribute far more influence over European and world history to the Dacians than that which they actually enjoyed. Dacianist historiography claims that the Dacians held primacy over all other civilizations, including the Romans; that the Dacian language was the origin of Latin and all other languages, such as Hindi and Babylonian; and sometimes that the Zalmoxis cult has structural links to Christianity. Dacianism was most prevalent in National Communist Romania, as the Ceaușescu regime portrayed the Dacians as insurgents defying an &quot;imperialist&quot; Rome; the Communist Party had formally attached &quot;protochronism&quot;, as Dacianism was known, to Marxist ideology by 1974.

==== Matriarchy ====

The consensus among academics is that no unambiguously and strictly matriarchal society is known to have existed, though many societies are known to have or have had some matriarchal features, in particular matrilineality, matrilocality, and/or matrifocality. Anthropologist Donald Brown&#x27;s list of human cultural universals (&quot;viz.&quot;, features shared by nearly all current human societies) includes men being the &quot;dominant element&quot; in public political affairs, which is the contemporary opinion of mainstream anthropology. 
Some societies that are matrilineal or matrifocal may in fact have patriarchal power structures, and thus be misidentified as matriarchal.
The idea that matriarchal societies existed and they preceded patriarchal societies was first raised in the 19th-century among Western academics, but it has since been discredited. 

Despite this however, some second-wave feminists assert that a matriarchy preceded the patriarchy. The Goddess Movement 
and Riane Eisler&#x27;s The Chalice and the Blade cite Venus figurines as evidence that societies of paleolithic and neolithic Europe were matriarchies that worshipped a goddess. This belief is not supported by mainstream academics.

==== Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories ====

Excluding the Norse colonization of the Americas, most theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact have been classified as pseudohistory, including claims that the Americas were actually discovered by Arabs or Muslims. Gavin Menzies&#x27; book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot;, which argues for the idea that Chinese sailors discovered America, has also been categorized as a work of pseudohistory.

==== Racist pseudohistory ====
Josiah Priest and other nineteenth-century American writers wrote pseudohistorical narratives that portrayed African Americans and Native Americans in an extremely negative light. Priest&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Wonders of Nature and Providence, Displayed&quot; (1826). The book is regarded by modern critics as one of the earliest works of modern American pseudohistory. Priest attacked Native Americans in &quot;American Antiquities and Discoveries of the West&quot; (1833) and African-Americans in &quot;Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro&quot; (1843). Other nineteenth-century writers, such as Thomas Gold Appleton, in his &quot;A Sheaf of Papers&quot; (1875), and George Perkins Marsh, in his &quot;The Goths in New England&quot;, seized upon false notions of Viking history to promote the superiority of white people (as well as to oppose the Catholic Church). Such misuse of Viking history and imagery reemerged in the twentieth century among some groups promoting white supremacy.

====Soviet communist pseudohistory====
Supporters of Soviet communist pseudohistory claim, among other things, that Joseph Stalin and other top Soviet leaders did not realize the scope of mass killings perpetrated under the Stalin regime, that executions of prisoners were legally justifiable, and that prisoners in Soviet gulags performed important construction work that helped the Soviet Union economically, particularly during World War II. Scholars point to overwhelming evidence that Stalin directly helped plan mass killings, that many prisoners were sent to gulags or executed extrajudicially, and that many prisoners did no productive work, often being isolated in remote camps or given pointless and menial tasks.

==== Anti-religious pseudohistory ====

The Christ myth theory claims that Jesus of Nazareth never existed as a historical figure and that his existence was invented by early Christians. This argument currently finds very little support among scholars and historians of all faiths and has been described as pseudohistorical.

Likewise, some minority historian views assert that Muhammad either did not exist or was not central to founding Islam. 

==== Religious pseudohistory ====
&quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; (1982) by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln is a book that purports to show that certain historical figures, such as Godfrey of Bouillon, and contemporary aristocrats are the lineal descendants of Jesus. Mainstream historians have widely panned the book, categorizing it as pseudohistory, and pointing out that the genealogical tables used in it are now known to be spurious. Nonetheless, the book was an international best-seller and inspired Dan Brown&#x27;s bestselling mystery thriller novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

Although historians and archaeologists consider the Book of Mormon to be an anachronistic invention of Joseph Smith, many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that it describes ancient historical events in the Americas.

Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark have also been categorized as pseudohistory.

In her books, starting with &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot; (1921), English author Margaret Murray claimed that the witch trials in the early modern period were actually an attempt by chauvinistic Christians to annihilate a secret, pagan religion, which she claimed worshipped a Horned God. Murray&#x27;s claims have now been widely rejected by respected historians. Nonetheless, her ideas have become the foundation myth for modern Wicca, a contemporary Neopagan religion. Belief in Murray&#x27;s alleged witch-cult is still prevalent among Wiccans, but is gradually declining.

===== Hinduism =====
The belief that Ancient India was technologically advanced to the extent of being a nuclear power is gaining popularity in India. Emerging extreme nationalist trends and ideologies based on Hinduism in the political arena promote these discussions. Vasudev Devnani, the education minister for the western state of Rajasthan, said in January 2017 that it was important to &quot;understand the scientific significance&quot; of the cow, as it was the only animal in the world to both inhale and exhale oxygen. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of doctors and medical staff at a Mumbai hospital that the story of the Hindu god Ganesha showed genetic science existed in ancient India. Many new age pseudohistorians who focus on converting mythological stories into history are well received among the crowd. Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy is a related event when Capt. Anand J. Bodas, retired principal of a pilot training facility, claimed that aircraft more advanced than today&#x27;s aircraft existed in ancient India at the Indian Science Congress.

==As a topic of study==

Courses critiquing pseudohistory are offered as undergraduate courses in liberal arts settings, one example being in Claremont McKenna College.

<doc id="175217" wikidata="Q184208" url="?curid=175217" title="Rhizome">
<text>In botany and dendrology, a rhizome ( ) is a modified subterranean plant stem that sends out roots and shoots from its nodes. Rhizomes are also called creeping rootstalks or just rootstalks. Rhizomes develop from axillary buds and grow horizontally. The rhizome also retains the ability to allow new shoots to grow upwards.

A rhizome is the main stem of the plant that runs typically underground and horizontally to the soil surface. Rhizomes have nodes and internodes and auxiliary buds. Roots do not have nodes and internodes and have a root cap terminating their ends. In general, rhizomes have short internodes, send out roots from the bottom of the nodes, and generate new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes. A stolon is similar to a rhizome, but stolon sprouts from an existing stem having long internodes and generating new shoots at the ends, they are often also called runners such as in the strawberry plant.
A stem tuber is a thickened part of a rhizome or stolon that has been enlarged for use as a storage organ. In general, a tuber is high in starch, e.g. the potato, which is a modified stolon. The term &quot;tuber&quot; is often used imprecisely and is sometimes applied to plants with rhizomes.

The plant uses the rhizome to store starches, proteins, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter. If a rhizome is separated, each piece may be able to give rise to a new plant. This is a process known as vegetative reproduction and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants. This also allows for lateral spread of grasses like bamboo and bunch grasses. Examples of plants that are propagated this way include hops, asparagus, ginger, irises, lily of the valley, cannas, and sympodial orchids.

Stored rhizomes are subject to bacterial and fungal infections, making them unsuitable for replanting and greatly diminishing stocks. However, rhizomes can also be produced artificially from tissue cultures. The ability to easily grow rhizomes from tissue cultures leads to better stocks for replanting and greater yields. The plant hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid have been found to help induce and regulate the growth of rhizomes, specifically in rhubarb. Ethylene that was applied externally was found to affect internal ethylene levels, allowing easy manipulations of ethylene concentrations. Knowledge of how to use these hormones to induce rhizome growth could help farmers and biologists to produce plants grown from rhizomes, and more easily cultivate and grow better plants.

Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some &quot;Iris&quot; species as well as ferns, whose spreading stems are rhizomes. Plants with underground rhizomes include gingers, bamboo, snake plant, the Venus flytrap, Chinese lantern, western poison-oak, hops, and &quot;Alstroemeria&quot;, and some grasses, such as Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, and purple nut sedge. Rhizomes generally form a single layer, but in giant horsetails, can be multi-tiered.

Many rhizomes have culinary value, and some, such as &quot;zhe&#x27;ergen&quot;, are commonly consumed raw. Some rhizomes that are used directly in cooking include ginger, turmeric, galangal, fingerroot, and lotus.

<doc id="175220" wikidata="Q152451" url="?curid=175220" title="Jerry Brown">
<text>Edmund Gerald Brown Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American lawyer, author, and politician who served as the 34th and 39th governor of California from 1975 to 1983 and 2011 to 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected secretary of state of California in 1970; Brown later served as mayor of Oakland from 1999 to 2007 and attorney general of California from 2007 to 2011. He was both the oldest and sixth-youngest governor of California due to the 28-year gap between his second and third terms. Upon completing his fourth term in office, Brown became the fourth longest-serving governor in U.S. history, serving 16 years and 5 days in office.

Born in San Francisco, he is the son of Bernice Layne Brown and Pat Brown, who was the 32nd governor of California (1959–1967). After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley and Yale Law School, he practiced law and began his political career as a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees (1969–1971). He was elected to serve as the 23rd secretary of state of California from 1971 to 1975. At 36, Brown was elected to his first term as governor in 1974, making him the youngest California governor in 111 years. In 1978, he won his second term. During his governorship, Brown ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 and 1980. He declined to pursue a third term as governor in 1982, instead making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate that same year, losing to San Diego mayor and future governor Pete Wilson.

After traveling abroad, Brown returned to California and served as the sixth Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989–1991), attempting to run for U.S. president once more in 1992 but losing the Democratic primary to Bill Clinton. He then moved to Oakland, where he hosted a talk radio show; Brown soon returned to public life, serving as mayor of Oakland (1999–2007) and attorney general of California (2007–2011). He ran for his third and fourth terms as governor in 2010 and 2014, his eligibility to do so having stemmed from California&#x27;s constitutional grandfather clause. On October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in the history of California, surpassing Earl Warren.

==Early life, education, and private career==
Brown was born in San Francisco, California, the only son of four children born to district attorney of San Francisco and later governor of California, Edmund Gerald &quot;Pat&quot; Brown Sr., and his wife, Bernice Layne. Brown&#x27;s father was of half Irish and half German descent. His great-grandfather August Schuckman, a German immigrant, settled in California in 1852 during the California Gold Rush.
&quot;My great-grandfather left Germany, he left Hamburg in 1849 on a ship called &quot;Perseverance&quot;.&quot; —Jerry Brown

Brown was a member of the California Cadet Corps at St. Ignatius High School, where he graduated in 1955. In 1955, Brown entered Santa Clara University for a year and left to attend Sacred Heart Novitiate, a Jesuit novice house in Los Gatos, intent on becoming a Catholic priest. Brown resided at the novitiate from August 1956 to January 1960 before enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in classics in 1961. With his tuition paid for by the Louis Lurie Foundation, including a $675 scholarship in 1963, Brown went on to Yale Law School and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1964. After law school, Brown worked as a law clerk for California Supreme Court justice Mathew Tobriner.

Returning to California, Brown took the state bar exam and passed on his second attempt. He then settled in Los Angeles and joined the law firm of Tuttle &amp; Taylor. In 1969, Brown ran for the newly created Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees, which oversaw community colleges in the city; he placed first in a field of 124 and served until 1971.

==California secretary of state (1971–1975)==


In 1970, Brown was elected California secretary of state. Brown argued before the California Supreme Court and won cases against Standard Oil of California, International Telephone and Telegraph, Gulf Oil, and Mobil for election law violations. In addition, he forced legislators to comply with campaign disclosure laws. Brown also drafted and helped to pass the California Political Reform Act of 1974, Proposition 9, passed by 70% of California&#x27;s voters in June 1974. Among other provisions, it established the California Fair Political Practices Commission.

==34th governor of California (1975–1983)==

===First term===
In 1974, Brown ran in a highly contested Democratic primary for Governor of California against speaker of the California Assembly Bob Moretti, San Francisco mayor Joseph L. Alioto, Representative Jerome R. Waldie, and others. Brown won the primary with the name recognition of his father, Pat Brown, whom many people admired for his progressive administration. In the General Election on November 5, 1974, Brown was elected Governor of California over California state controller Houston I. Flournoy; Republicans ascribed the loss to anti-Republican feelings from Watergate, the election being held only ninety days after President Richard Nixon resigned from office. Brown succeeded Republican governor Ronald Reagan, who retired after two terms.

After taking office, Brown gained a reputation as a fiscal conservative. &quot;The American Conservative&quot; later noted he was &quot;much more of a fiscal conservative than Governor Reagan&quot;. His fiscal restraint resulted in one of the biggest budget surpluses in state history, roughly $5 billion. For his personal life, Brown refused many of the privileges and perks of the office, forgoing the newly constructed 20,000 square-foot governor&#x27;s residence in the suburb of Carmichael and instead renting a $275-per-month apartment at 1228 N Street, adjacent to Capitol Park in downtown Sacramento. Rather than riding as a passenger in a chauffeured limousine as previous governors had done, Brown walked to work and drove in a Plymouth Satellite sedan. When Gray Davis, who was chief of staff to Governor Brown, suggested that a hole in the rug in the governor&#x27;s office be fixed, Brown responded: “That hole will save the state at least $500 million, because legislators cannot come down and pound on my desk demanding lots of money for their pet programs while looking at a hole in my rug!”

As governor, Brown took a strong interest in environmental issues. He appointed J. Baldwin to work in the newly created California Office of Appropriate Technology, Sim Van der Ryn as State Architect, Stewart Brand as Special Advisor, John Bryson as chairman of the California State Water Board. Brown also reorganized the California Arts Council, boosting its funding by 1300 percent and appointing artists to the council, and appointed more women and minorities to office than any other previous California governor. In 1977, he sponsored the &quot;first-ever tax incentive for rooftop solar&quot;, among many environmental initiatives. In 1975, Brown obtained the repeal of the &quot;depletion allowance&quot;, a tax break for the state&#x27;s oil industry, despite the efforts of lobbyist Joseph C. Shell, a former intraparty rival to Nixon.

In 1975, Brown opposed Vietnamese immigration to California, saying that the state had enough poor people. He added, “There is something a little strange about saying ‘Let&#x27;s bring in 500,000 more people’ when we can&#x27;t take care of the 1 million (Californians) out of work.”

Brown strongly opposed the death penalty and vetoed it as governor, which the legislature overrode in 1977. He also appointed judges who opposed capital punishment. One of these appointments, Rose Bird as the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, was voted out in 1987 after a strong campaign financed by business interests upset by her &quot;pro-labor&quot; and &quot;pro-free speech&quot; rulings. The death penalty was only &quot;a trumped-up excuse&quot; to use against her, even though the Bird Court consistently upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty. In 1960, he lobbied his father, then governor, to spare the life of Caryl Chessman and reportedly won a 60-day stay for him.

Brown was both in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment and opposed to Proposition 13, the latter of which would decrease property taxes and greatly reduce revenue to cities and counties. When Proposition 13 passed in June 1978, he heavily cut state spending, and along with the Legislature, spent much of the $5 billion surplus to meet the proposition&#x27;s requirements and help offset the revenue losses which made cities, counties, and schools more dependent on the state. His actions in response to the proposition earned him praise from Proposition 13 author Howard Jarvis who went as far as to make a television commercial for Brown just before his successful re-election bid in 1978. The controversial proposition immediately cut tax revenues and required a two-thirds supermajority to raise taxes. Max Neiman, a professor at the Institute of Governmental Studies at University of California, Berkeley, credited Brown for &quot;bailing out local government and school districts&quot;, but felt it was harmful &quot;because it made it easier for people to believe that Proposition 13 wasn&#x27;t harmful&quot;. In an interview in 2014, Brown indicated that a &quot;war chest&quot; would have helped his campaign for an alternative to Proposition 13.

===1976 presidential election===

Brown began his first campaign for the Democratic nomination for president on March 16, 1976, late in the primary season and over a year after some candidates had started campaigning. Brown declared: &quot;The country is rich, but not so rich as we have been led to believe. The choice to do one thing may preclude another. In short, we are entering an era of limits.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s name began appearing on primary ballots in May and he won in Maryland, Nevada, and his home state of California. He missed the deadline in Oregon, but he ran as a write-in candidate and finished in third behind Former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter and Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Brown is often credited with winning the New Jersey and Rhode Island primaries, but in reality, uncommitted slates of delegates that Brown advocated in those states finished first. With support from Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, Brown won a majority of delegates at the Louisiana delegate selection convention; thus, Louisiana was the only southern state to not support Southerners Carter or Alabama governor George Wallace. Despite this success, he was unable to stall Carter&#x27;s momentum, and his rival was nominated on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National Convention. Brown finished third with roughly 300 delegate votes, narrowly behind Congressman Morris Udall and Carter.

===Second term===
Brown won re-election in 1978 against Republican state attorney general Evelle J. Younger. Brown appointed the first openly gay judge in the United States when he named Stephen Lachs to serve on the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1979. In 1981, he also appointed the first openly lesbian judge in the United States, Mary C. Morgan, to the San Francisco Municipal Court. Brown completed his second term having appointed a total of five gay judges, including Rand Schrader and Jerold Krieger. Through his first term as governor, Brown had not appointed any openly gay people to any position, but he cited the failed 1978 Briggs Initiative, which sought to ban homosexuals from working in California&#x27;s public schools, for his increased support of gay rights. The governor also signed AB 489, The Consenting Adult Sex Act, which decriminalized homosexual behavior between adults, adding to this reputation. He did, however, sign AB 607, which barred homosexual couples from receiving civil marriage licenses, in 1977.
Brown championed the Peripheral Canal project to transport water from near Sacramento around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the Central Valley Project and export it to southern California. It was submitted to the voters for approval as a ballot proposition in 1982, but was turned down.

In 1981, Brown, who had established a reputation as a strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious medfly infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. The state&#x27;s agricultural industry advised him, and the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed, and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects&#x27; reproductive cycle.

Ultimately, the infestation was eradicated, but both the governor&#x27;s delay and the scale of the action have remained controversial ever since. Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown&#x27;s chief of staff, B. T. Collins, staged a news conference during which he publicly drank a glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been very toxic to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint.

Brown proposed the establishment of a state space academy and the purchasing of a satellite that would be launched into orbit to provide emergency communications for the state—a proposal similar to one that was indeed eventually adopted. In 1979, an out-of-state columnist, Mike Royko, at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, picked up on the nickname from Brown&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Linda Ronstadt, who was quoted in a 1978 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview humorously calling him &quot;Moonbeam&quot;. A year later, Royko expressed his regret for publicizing the nickname, and in 1991 Royko disavowed it entirely, proclaiming Brown to be just as serious as any other politician.

Some notable figures were given priority correspondence access to him in either advisory or personal roles. These included United Farm Workers of America founder Cesar Chavez, Hewlett-Packard co-founder David Packard, labor leader Jack Henning, and Charles Manatt, then-Chairman of the California State Democratic Party. Mail was routed as VIP to be delivered directly to the governor. However, it is unclear as to exactly how long this may have occurred.

In 1978, San Francisco punk band the Dead Kennedys&#x27; first single, &quot;California über alles&quot;, from the album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, was released; it was performed from the perspective of then-governor Brown painting a picture of a hippie-fascist state, satirizing what they considered his mandating of liberal ideas in a fascist manner, commenting on what lyricist Jello Biafra saw as the corrosive nature of power. The imaginary Brown had become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers. Biafra later said in an interview with &quot;Nardwuar&quot; that he now feels differently about Brown; as it turned out, Brown was not as bad as Biafra thought he would be, and subsequent songs have been written about other politicians deemed worse.

Brown chose not to run for a third term in 1982, and instead ran for the United States Senate, but lost to San Diego mayor Pete Wilson. He was succeeded as governor by George Deukmejian, then state attorney general, on January 3, 1983.

===1980 presidential election===
In 1980, Brown challenged Carter for renomination. The press had anticipated his candidacy ever since he won re-election as governor in 1978 over the Republican Evelle Younger by 1.3 million votes, the largest margin in California history. But Brown had trouble gaining traction in both fundraising and polling for the presidential nomination. This was widely believed to be because of the more prominent candidate Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Brown&#x27;s 1980 platform, which he declared to be the natural result of combining Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s visions of the future and E. F. Schumacher&#x27;s theory of &quot;Buddhist economics&quot;, was much expanded from 1976. His &quot;era of limits&quot; slogan was replaced by a promise to, in his words, &quot;Protect the Earth, serve the people, and explore the universe&quot;.

Three main planks of his platform were a call for a constitutional convention to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment; a promise to increase funds for the space program as a &quot;first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space satellite to provide solar energy for this planet&quot;; and, in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, opposition to nuclear power. On the subject of the 1979 energy crisis, Brown decried the &quot;Faustian bargain&quot; that he claimed Carter had entered into with the oil industry, and declared that he would greatly increase federal funding of research into solar power. He endorsed the idea of mandatory non-military national service for the nation&#x27;s youth. He suggested that the Defense Department cut back on support troops while beefing up the number of combat troops.

Brown opposed Kennedy&#x27;s call for universal national health insurance and opposed Carter&#x27;s call for an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance labeling it socialist. As an alternative, he suggested a program of tax credits for those who do not smoke or otherwise damage their health, saying: &quot;Those who abuse their bodies should not abuse the rest of us by taking our tax dollars.&quot; Brown also called for expanding the use of acupuncture and midwifery.

As Brown&#x27;s campaign began to attract more members of what some more conservative commentators described as &quot;the fringe&quot;, including activists like Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, and Jesse Jackson, his polling numbers began to suffer. Brown received only 10 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, and he was soon forced to announce that his decision to remain in the race would depend on a good showing in the Wisconsin primary. Although he had polled well there throughout the primary season, an attempt to film a live speech in Madison, the state&#x27;s capital, into a special effects-filled, 30-minute commercial (produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola) was disastrous.

==Senate defeat and public life==
In 1982, Brown chose not to seek a third term as governor; instead, he ran for the United States Senate for the seat being vacated by Republican S. I. Hayakawa. He was defeated by Republican San Diego mayor Pete Wilson by a margin of 52% to 45%. After his Senate defeat, Brown was left with few political options. Republican George Deukmejian, a Brown critic, narrowly won the governorship in 1982, succeeding Brown, and was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1986. After his Senate defeat in 1982, many considered Brown&#x27;s political career to be over.

Brown traveled to Japan to study Buddhism, studying with Christian/Zen practitioner Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle under Yamada Koun-roshi. In an interview, he explained, &quot;Since politics is based on illusions, zazen definitely provides new insights for a politician. I then come back into the world of California and politics, with critical distance from some of my more comfortable assumptions.&quot; He also visited Mother Teresa in Calcutta, India, where he ministered to the sick in one of her hospices. He explained, &quot;Politics is a power struggle to get to the top of the heap. Calcutta and Mother Teresa are about working with those who are at the bottom of the heap. And to see them as no different from yourself, and their needs as important as your needs. And you&#x27;re there to serve them, and doing that you are attaining as great a state of being as you can.&quot;

Upon his return from abroad in 1988, Brown announced that he would stand as a candidate to become chairman of the California Democratic Party, and won against investment banker Steve Westly. Although Brown greatly expanded the party&#x27;s donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on grassroots organizing and get out the vote drives, he was criticized for not spending enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990, such as Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s attempt to become the first female governor of California. In early 1991, Brown abruptly resigned his post and announced that he would run for the Senate seat held by the retiring Alan Cranston. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for the third time.

==1992 presidential election==
When Brown announced his intention to run for president against President George H. W. Bush, many in the media and his own party dismissed his campaign as having little chance of gaining significant support. Ignoring them, Brown embarked on a grassroots campaign to, in his own words, &quot;take back America from the confederacy of corruption, careerism, and campaign consulting in Washington&quot;. In his stump speech, first used while announcing his candidacy on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Brown said he would accept campaign contributions from individuals only and that he would not accept more than $100. Continuing with his populist reform theme, he assailed what he dubbed &quot;the bipartisan Incumbent Party in Washington&quot; and called for term limits for members of Congress. Citing various recent scandals on Capitol Hill, particularly the recent House banking scandal and the large congressional pay raises of 1990, he promised to put an end to Congress being a &quot;Stop-and-Shop for the moneyed &quot;.

As Brown campaigned in various primary states, he expanded his platform beyond a policy of strict campaign finance reform. Although he focused on a variety of issues during the campaign, he highlighted his endorsement of living wage laws and opposition to free trade agreements such as NAFTA; he mostly concentrated on his tax policy, which had been created specifically for him by Arthur Laffer, the famous supporter of supply-side economics who created the Laffer curve. This plan, which called for the replacement of the progressive income tax with a flat tax and a value added tax, both at a fixed 13% rate, was decried by his opponents as regressive. Nevertheless, it was endorsed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;Forbes&quot;, and its raising of taxes on corporations and elimination of various loopholes that tended to favor the very wealthy proved popular with voters. Various opinion polls at the time found that as many as three-quarters of Americans believed the current tax code was biased toward the wealthy. Jesse Walker wrote in &quot;The American Conservative&quot; that he &quot;seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field ... [calling] for term limits, a flat tax, reforming social security, and the abolition of the Department of Education&quot;. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.

Due to his limited budget, Brown began to use a mixture of alternative media and unusual fundraising techniques. Unable to pay for actual commercials, he frequently used cable television and talk radio interviews as a form of free media to get his message out. To raise funds, he purchased a toll-free telephone number. During the campaign, Brown&#x27;s repetition of this number and moralistic language led some to call him a &quot;political televangelist&quot; with an &quot;anti-politics gospel&quot;.

Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown won narrow victories in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, but he continued to be considered a small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender in the eyes of the press. On March 17, Brown received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois and Michigan primaries, and Tsongas dropped out of the race. A week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. 

As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: he announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City&#x27;s Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider Jesse Jackson as his running mate. Jackson, who had made a pair of antisemitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City&#x27;s Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted by the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own antisemitic statements, and to Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown&#x27;s polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).

Brown continued to campaign, but won no further primaries. Despite being overwhelmingly outspent, he won upset victories in seven states and his &quot;votes won to the money raised ratio&quot; was by far the best of any candidate&#x27;s in the race. He had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would have deprived Clinton of sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination, possibly bringing about a brokered convention. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in this final primary, 48% to 41%. Brown did not win the nomination, but was able to boast of one accomplishment: at the following month&#x27;s Democratic National Convention, he received the votes of 596 delegates on the first ballot, more than any other candidate but Clinton. He spoke at the convention, and to the national viewing audience, yet without endorsing Clinton, through the device of seconding his own nomination. There was animosity between the Brown and Clinton campaigns, and Brown was the first political figure to criticize Bill Clinton over what became known as the Whitewater controversy.

==Move to Oakland==
After his 1992 presidential bid, Brown had moved from the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco to the Jack London District neighborhood of Oakland, California, an &quot;overwhelmingly minority city of 400,000&quot;. He constructed a multi-million dollar work-live complex, serving both as his residence and as a workspace. Among other features, it included a broadcast studio and a 400-seat auditorium.

Brown launched a national talk radio show from his Oakland complex, which he would continue to produce until October 1997.

In 1995, with Brown&#x27;s political career at a low point, in the motion picture &quot;Jade&quot;, the fictional governor of California tells an assistant district attorney to drop a case, &quot;unless you want as much of a future in this state as Jerry Brown&quot;. The assistant DA responds, &quot;Who&#x27;s Jerry Brown?&quot;

In Oakland, Brown became involved as an activist in local political matters, including bay-front development and campaign finance reform. In 1996, Brown unsuccessfully urged Oakland mayor Elihu Harris to appoint him to a seat on the Oakland Port Commission.

==Mayor of Oakland (1999–2007)==

After Oakland mayor Elihu Harris decided against seeking reelection, Brown ran in the city&#x27;s 1998 mayoral election as an independent &quot;having left the Democratic Party, blasting what he called the &#x27;deeply corrupted&#x27; two-party system&quot;. He won with 59% of the vote in a field of ten candidates.

Prior to taking office, Brown campaigned to get the approval of the electorate to convert Oakland&#x27;s &quot;weak mayor&quot; political structure, which structured the mayor as chairman of the city council and official greeter, to a &quot;strong mayor&quot; structure, where the mayor would act as chief executive over the nonpolitical and thus the various city departments, and break tie votes on the Oakland City Council. In November 1998, Oakland&#x27;s electorate voted by a landslide margin of 3 to 1 in support of Measure X, which would shift the city government to the strong mayor model for a period of six years. A referendum permanently extending Measure X later passed in 2004, after failing to pass in 2002, thus making permanent the city&#x27;s shift to the strong mayor model of governance.

The political left had hoped for some of the more progressive politics from Brown&#x27;s earlier governorship, but found Brown, as mayor, to be &quot;more pragmatic than progressive, more interested in downtown redevelopment and economic growth than political ideology&quot;. As mayor, he invited the U.S. Marine Corps to use Oakland harbor lands for mock military exercises as part of Operation Urban Warrior.

The city was rapidly losing residents and businesses, and Brown is credited with starting the revitalization of the city using his connections and experience to lessen the economic downturn while attracting $1 billion of investments, including refurbishing the Fox Theatre, the Port of Oakland, and Jack London Square. The downtown district was losing retailers, restaurateurs and residential developers, and Brown sought to attract thousands of new residents with disposable income to revitalize the area. Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris&#x27;s public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland&#x27;s 1998 General Plan. Since Brown worked toward the stated goal of bringing an additional 10,000 residents to Downtown Oakland, his plan was known as the &quot;10k Plan&quot;. It has resulted in redevelopment projects in the Jack London District, where Brown himself had earlier purchased and later sold an industrial warehouse which he used as a personal residence, and in the Lakeside Apartments District near Lake Merritt. The 10K plan has touched the historic Old Oakland district, the Chinatown district, the Uptown district, and Downtown. Brown surpassed the stated goal of attracting 10,000 residents according to city records, and built more affordable housing than previous mayoral administrations.

Brown had campaigned on fixing Oakland&#x27;s schools, but &quot;bureaucratic battles&quot; dampened his efforts. He concedes he never had control of the schools, and his reform efforts were &quot;largely a bust&quot;. He focused instead on the creation of two charter schools, the Oakland School for the Arts and the Oakland Military Institute. Defending his support of a military charter school in Oakland, Brown once told KQED reporter Stephen Talbot, &quot;I believe that had I been sent to the military academy, as my mother and father threatened, I would have been president a long time ago.&quot;

Brown sponsored nearly two dozen crime initiatives to reduce the crime rate, although crime decreased by 13 percent overall, the city still suffered a &quot;57 percent spike in homicides his final year in office, to 148 overall&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s largely successful first term as mayor of Oakland was documented in a one-hour KQED documentary, &quot;The Celebrity and the City&quot; (2001) that evaluated his record in dealing with his four stated goals: reducing crime, improving education, attracting 10,000 new residents to a resurgent downtown, and encouraging the arts.

Brown was reelected as mayor in 2002.

==Attorney General of California (2007–2011)==
In 2004, Brown expressed interest to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General of California in the 2006 election, and in May 2004, he formally filed to run. He defeated his Democratic primary opponent, Los Angeles city attorney Rocky Delgadillo, 63% to 37%. In the general election, Brown defeated Republican state senator Charles Poochigian 56.3% to 38.2%, one of the largest margins of victory in any statewide California race. In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, Brown&#x27;s eligibility to run for attorney general was challenged in what Brown called a &quot;political stunt by a Republican office seeker&quot; (Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee chairman and state GOP vice-chair candidate Tom Del Beccaro). Plaintiffs claimed Brown did not meet eligibility according to California Government Code §12503, &quot;No person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney General unless he shall have been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the state for a period of at least five years immediately preceding his election or appointment to such office.&quot; Some legal analysts called the lawsuit frivolous because Brown was admitted to practice law in the State of California on June 14, 1965, and had been so admitted to practice ever since. Although ineligible to practice law because of his voluntary inactive status in the State Bar of California from January 1, 1997, to May 1, 2003, he was nevertheless still admitted to practice. Because of this distinction the case was eventually thrown out.

=== Death penalty ===

As attorney general, Brown represented the state in fighting death-penalty appeals and stated that he would follow the law, regardless of his personal beliefs against capital punishment. Capital punishment by lethal injection was halted in California by federal judge Jeremy D. Fogel until new facilities and procedures were put into place. Brown moved to resume capital punishment in 2010 with the execution of Albert Greenwood Brown after the lifting of a statewide moratorium by a California court. Brown&#x27;s Democratic campaign, which pledged to &quot;enforce the laws&quot; of California, denied any connection between the case and the gubernatorial election. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco, who supported Republican opponent Meg Whitman, said that it would be unfair to accuse Brown of using the execution for political gain as they never discussed the case.

=== Mortgage fraud lawsuit ===

In June 2008, Brown filed a fraud lawsuit claiming mortgage lender Countrywide Financial engaged in &quot;unfair and deceptive&quot; practices to get homeowners to apply for risky mortgages far beyond their means. Brown accused the lender of breaking the state&#x27;s laws against false advertising and unfair business practices. The lawsuit also claimed the defendant misled many consumers by misinforming them about the workings of certain mortgages such as adjustable-rate mortgages, interest-only loans, low-documentation loans and home-equity loans while telling borrowers they would be able to refinance before the interest rate on their loans adjusted. The suit was settled in October 2008 after Bank of America acquired Countrywide. The settlement involved the modifying of troubled &#x27;predatory loans&#x27; up to $8.4 billion.

=== Proposition 8 ===

Proposition 8, a contentious voter-approved amendment to the state constitution that banned same-sex marriage was upheld in May 2009 by the California Supreme Court. In August 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Proposition 8 violated the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Brown and then Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger both declined to appeal the ruling. The state appeals court declined to order the governor or Attorney-General Brown to defend the proposition.

==39th governor of California (2011–2019)==

===Third term===
Brown announced his candidacy for governor on March 2, 2010. First indicating his interest in early 2008, Brown formed an exploratory committee in order to seek a third term as governor in 2010, following the expiration of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s term.

Brown&#x27;s Republican opponent in the election was former eBay president Meg Whitman. Brown was endorsed by the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; &quot;The Sacramento Bee,&quot; the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle,&quot; the &quot;San Jose Mercury News,&quot; and the Service Employees International Union.

Both Whitman and Brown were criticized for negative campaigning during the election. During their final debate at the 2010 Women&#x27;s Conference a week before the election, moderator Matt Lauer asked both candidates to pull attack ads for the rest of the election, which elicited loud cheers from the audience. Brown agreed and picked one ad each of his and Whitman&#x27;s that he thought, if Whitman would agree, should be the only ones run, but Whitman, who had been loudly cheered earlier as the prospective first woman governor of the state, was booed when she stated that she would keep &quot;the ads that talk about where Gov. Brown stands on the issues&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that nearly $250 million was spent on the Governor&#x27;s race. At least two spending records were broken during the campaign. Whitman broke personal spending records by spending $140 million of her own money on the campaign, and independent expenditures exceeded $31.7 million, with almost $25 million of that spent in support of Brown. Despite being significantly outspent by Whitman, Brown won the gubernatorial race 53.8% to Whitman&#x27;s 40.9%.

Brown was sworn in for his third term as governor on January 3, 2011, succeeding Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger who had been officially term-limited. Brown was working on a budget that would shift many government programs from the state to the local level, a reversal of trends from his first tenure as governor.

On June 28, 2012, Brown signed a budget that made deep cuts to social services with the assumption that voters would pass $8 billion in tax increases in November 2012 to close California&#x27;s $15.7-billion budget deficit. Brown stated: &quot;We need budget cuts. We need the continued growth of the economy for a long period of time. We&#x27;re suffering from the mortgage meltdown that killed 600,000 jobs in the construction industry. ... We&#x27;re recovering from a national recession slowly—over 300,000 jobs [gained] since the recession. We&#x27;ve got a million to go. That needs to continue, but that depends not only on Barack Obama and the Congress and the Federal Reserve, but also on [German chancellor Angela] Merkel, China, the European Union, and the self-organizing quality of the world economy.&quot;

In September 2012, Brown signed legislation sponsored by California state senator Ted Lieu that prohibits protesters at funerals within 300 feet, with convicted violators punishable with fines and jail time; the legislation was in response to protests conducted by the Westboro Baptist Church.
In the November 2012 general elections, voters approved Brown&#x27;s proposed tax increases in the form of Proposition 30. Prop 30 raised the state personal income tax increase for seven years among California residents with an annual income over US$250,000 and increased in the state sales tax by 0.25 percent over four years. It allowed the state to avoid nearly $6 billion in cuts to public education.

In 2013, Brown proposed a large, $25 billion Bay Delta Conservation Plan (later renamed the California Water Fix and Eco Restore project) to build two large, four-story tall, long tunnels to carry fresh water from the Sacramento River under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta toward the intake stations for the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project. Unlike his earlier Peripheral Canal project, the two tunnels are to be funded by the agencies and users receiving benefit from the project and do not require voter approval.

In July 2014, Brown traveled to Mexico to hold meetings with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto and Central American leaders about the ongoing children&#x27;s immigration crisis.

On September 16, 2014, Gov. Brown signed a historic package of groundwater legislation. The plan will regulate local agencies and also implement management plans to achieve water sustainability within 20 years.

===Fourth term===
Brown announced his bid for another term on February 27, 2014. On June 3, he came in first place in the primary election by over 1.5 million votes. He received 54.3% of the vote and advanced to the general election with Republican Neel Kashkari, who took 19.38% of the vote.

There was only one gubernatorial debate. When asked to schedule another, Brown ultimately declined. During the debate in Sacramento on September 4, 2014, Kashkari accused Brown of failing to improve California&#x27;s business climate. His leading example was the Tesla Motors factory investment, creating 6,500 manufacturing jobs, going to Nevada rather than California. Brown responded that the cash payment upfront required by the investment would have been unfair to California taxpayers. A range of issues were debated, including recent legislation for a ban on plastic bags at grocery stores that Brown promised to sign and Kashkari thought unimportant.

Brown said that if he were elected to a fourth and final term, he would continue transferring power to local authorities, particularly over education and criminal justice policy, and would resist fellow Democrats&#x27; &quot;gold rush for new programs and spending&quot;.

In the general election, Brown was re-elected with 4,388,368 votes (60.0%) to Kashkari’s 3,645,835. He was sworn in for a final term specifically on January Monday 5, 2015. His stated goals for his unprecedented fourth term in office were to construct the California High-Speed Rail, to create tunnels to shore up the state&#x27;s water system and to curb carbon dioxide emissions. He still had $20 million in campaign funds to advance his ballot measures in case the legislature didn&#x27;t support his plans.

In October 2015, Brown signed off the California End of Life Option Act allowing residents of California who fulfilled strict criteria to exercise the right to die by accessing medical aid in dying. During the sign off he took the unusual step of adding a personal message indicating his dilemma regarding the consideration of the ethical issues involved and stating that he felt unable to deny the right of choice to others.

On December 18, 2015, Brown moved into the Historic Governor&#x27;s Mansion, now part of Governor&#x27;s Mansion State Historic Park.

In 2016, Brown vetoed a bill to exempt feminine hygiene products from state sales taxes, at the same time that he vetoed other bills which would also have exempted diapers, saying that collectively, these exemptions would have reduced state revenues by $300 million annually, and stated “As I said last year, tax breaks are the same as new spending – they both cost the general fund money.”

In the 2018–2019 budget plan that Brown released on January 10, 2018, the governor proposed spending $120 million to establish California&#x27;s first fully online community college by fall 2019.

Legislative accomplishments in Brown&#x27;s final term include passing California Sanctuary Law SB 54, which prevents police from complying with most requests by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold illegal immigrants for deportation; California Senate Bill 32, which requires the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, extending the state&#x27;s cap and trade system (which had originally been outlined by the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) to achieve this goal; and passing the Road Repair and Accountability Act. Brown has opposed the Proposition 6 ballot measure to repeal the Road Repair and Accountability Act, and endorsed Gavin Newsom to eventually succeed him.

Brown has been criticized for his links to the oil and gas industry, notably for contributions from, and his family ties to, Sempra Energy.

By September 2018, Brown had granted more than 1,100 pardons since returning to office in 2011; more pardons than any California governor in recent history. Brown commuted more than 82 sentences, the highest number since at least the 1940s.

==Electoral history==
== Post-public office ==
Following the conclusion of his career in public office, Brown has become increasingly involved with climate cooperation between United States non-state entities (including Michael Bloomberg and the Bloomberg Foundation) and China. Brown has also worked with former Chinese climate minister Xie Zhenhua to establish a new center for California-China climate cooperation at University of California, Berkeley.

Brown lives on a mountain ranch in California that he allows researchers including the California Native Plant Society to use as a meeting point. In 2023 a beetle in the genus &quot;Bembidium&quot; was named &quot;B. brownorum&quot; after Brown and his wife, after it was discovered on the ranch.

==Personal life==

A bachelor in his first two terms as governor and first term as mayor of Oakland, Brown attracted attention for dating famous women, the most notable of whom was singer Linda Ronstadt. In March 2005, Brown announced his engagement to his girlfriend since 1990, Anne Gust, former chief administrative officer for the Gap. They were married on June 18, 2005, in a ceremony officiated by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the Rotunda Building in downtown Oakland. They had a second, religious ceremony later in the day in the Roman Catholic Church in San Francisco where Brown&#x27;s parents had been married. Brown and Gust lived in the Oakland Hills in a home purchased for $1.8 million. , they live on a ranch in Colusa County.
Beginning in 1995, Brown hosted a daily call-in talk show on the local Pacifica Radio station, KPFA-FM, in Berkeley broadcast to major U.S. markets. Both the radio program and Brown&#x27;s political action organization, based in Oakland, were called &quot;We the People&quot;. His programs, usually featuring invited guests, generally explored alternative views on a wide range of social and political issues, from education and health care to spirituality and the death penalty.

The official gubernatorial portrait of Jerry Brown, commemorating his first period as Governor of California, was painted by Don Bachardy and unveiled in 1984. The painting has long been controversial due to its departure from the traditional norms of portraiture.

Brown had a long-term friendship with his aide Jacques Barzaghi, whom he met in the early 1970s and put on his payroll. Author Roger Rapaport wrote in his 1982 Brown biography &quot;California Dreaming: The Political Odyssey of Pat &amp; Jerry Brown&quot;, &quot;This combination clerk, chauffeur, fashion consultant, decorator, and trusted friend had no discernible powers. Yet, late at night, after everyone had gone home to their families and TV consoles, it was Jacques who lingered in the Secretary (of state&#x27;s) office.&quot; Barzaghi and his sixth spouse Aisha lived with Brown in the warehouse in Jack London Square; Barzaghi was brought into Oakland city government upon Brown&#x27;s election as mayor, where Barzaghi first acted as the mayor&#x27;s armed bodyguard. Barzaghi left Brown&#x27;s staff in July 2004, six days after police had responded to his residence over a complaint of domestic violence, and later moved to Morocco and then Normandy. Barzaghi died in 2021.

In April 2011, Brown had surgery to remove a basal-cell carcinoma from the right side of his nose. In December 2012, media outlets reported that Brown was being treated for early stage (the precise stage and grade was not stated) localized prostate cancer with a very good prognosis.

In 2011, Jerry and Anne Gust Brown acquired a Pembroke Welsh corgi, Sutter Brown, dubbed the &quot;first dog&quot; of California. Sutter was frequently seen in the company of the governor, accompanying him to political events and softening the governor&#x27;s cerebral image. In 2015, the couple obtained a second dog, Colusa &quot;Lucy&quot; Brown, a Pembroke Welsh corgi/border collie mix. Sutter had emergency surgery in October 2016 to remove cancerous tissue. Sutter died in December 2016 from cancer at the age of 13.

In 2019, Brown was appointed to be a visiting professor at Berkeley.

Brown&#x27;s accent has been described as reminiscent of the &quot;Mission Brogue&quot;, particularly with his non-rhoticity.

<doc id="175223" wikidata="Q1156229" url="?curid=175223" title="DX encoding">
<text>DX (Digital indeX) encoding is a standard for marking 35 mm and APS photographic film and film cartridges, originally introduced by Kodak in 1983. It includes multiple markings, which are a latent image barcode on the bottom edge of the film, below the sprocket holes, a conductive pattern on the cartridge used by automatic cameras, and a barcode on the cartridge read by photo-finishing machines.

The DX encoding system was incorporated into ANSI PH1.14, which provided standards for 135 film magazines for still picture cameras and was superseded by NAPM IT1.14 in 1994; it is now part of ISO standard 1007, whose latest revision was issued in 2000.

== History ==

In order to simplify the handling of 35 mm film in 135 format cartridges, Kodak introduced the DX encoding method on 3 January 1983. In contrast to the film speed encoding method developed by Fuji in 1977, which used electrical contacts for film speed detection on 135 format cartridges, Kodak&#x27;s DX encoding system immediately met success in the marketplace.

The first DX encoded film to be released was the color print film Kodacolor VR 1000 in March 1983.

The first point-and-shoot cameras to use DX encoding to automatically set film speed were released in 1984, including the Pentax Super Sport 35 / PC 35AF-M and Minolta AF-E / Freedom II. The first single-lens reflex cameras to take advantage of DX encoding were released in 1985, including the Konica TC-X SLR (1985), Pentax A3 / A3000, Minolta 7000 (February 1985) and 9000 (September 1985), and the Nikon F-301 / N2000.

&quot;DX-iX&quot; (data exchange - information exchange) is an expanded DX encoding system introduced in 1996 which was released as part of the Advanced Photo System (APS), which use a different cartridge and film size, also known as IX240 film. APS film and cameras were marketed with numerous brand names, most including an &quot;ix&quot; to emphasize the information exchange aspect, including Advantix (Kodak) and Nexia (Fujifilm).

In 1998, Fujifilm introduced a film identification system for 120 and 220 format roll film called &quot;Barcode System&quot; (with logo &quot;|||B&quot;). The barcode encoding the film format and length as well as the film speed and type is located on the sticker between the emulsion carrying film and the backing paper. This 13-bit barcode is optically scanned by newer medium format cameras like the Fujifilm GA645i Professional, GA645Wi Professional, GA645Zi Professional, GX645AF Professional, GX680III Professional, GX680IIIS Professional, Hasselblad H1, H2, H2F and H3D Model I with HM 16-32 as well as by the Contax 645 AF.

==Implementation==
===DX cartridge barcode===

Next to the film exit lip is an Interleaved 2 of 5 barcode and a printed number. The six digits represent the I3A assigned DX number (middle four digits), the number of exposures (last digit) and a proprietary manufacturer&#x27;s code (first digit). The DX number identifies the manufacturer, film type, and by inference, the necessary developing process type. This is used by automatic photo-finishing machines to correctly process the exposed film.

===DX film edge barcode===

Below the sprockets under each frame of 135 film is the DX film edge barcode. The barcode is invisible until the film has been developed. It is optically imprinted as a latent image during manufacturing. The barcode is used by photo finishers to identify each frame for printing. It consists of two parallel linear barcodes, one for a synchronizing clock called the &quot;clock track&quot;, and the other encoding film data such as type, manufacturer and frame number, called the &quot;data track&quot;. The barcode nearest the film edge (away from the sprocket holes) contains the data track. The data track sequence repeats every half frame, beginning with six start bits, followed by seven bits of DX Number Part 1, one unassigned bit, four bits of DX Number Part 2, a seven-bit frame/half-frame number, one unassigned bit, one parity bit, and finishes with four stop bits. The seven-bit frame/half-frame number is called the &quot;DXN&quot; number (different than the &quot;DX Number Part 1&quot; and &quot;DX Number Part 2&quot;), and is an extension on the original DX edge code, patented by Eastman Kodak in 1990.

Some image processing software utilized by film scanners allow selection of film manufacturer and type to provide automatic color correction. Interpreting the DX film edge barcode may provide this information, permitting accurate color correction to be applied.

===DX Camera Auto Sensing===

The outside of film cartridges are marked with a DX Camera Auto Sensing (CAS) code readable by many cameras. Cameras can then automatically determine the film speed, number of exposures and exposure tolerance. 

With 135 film cartridges, the DX Camera Auto Sensing code uses a 2×6 grid of rectangular contact areas on the side of the metal cartridge surface; these areas are either conductive (bare metal) or non-conductive (painted). The left-most area of both rows (with the spool post on the left) are common (ground) and are thus always bare metal. Electrical contacts in the camera read the bit pattern. Diagramatically (with spool post to the left):

In this scheme:
* &quot;G&quot; are the two common-ground contacts
* &quot;Sx&quot; are the film speed contacts
* &quot;Lx&quot; are the film length contacts
* &quot;Tx&quot; are the exposure tolerance contacts

Most cameras read the film speed only, which is in the first row. Some cameras aimed at the consumer market only read enough bits in the first row to distinguish the most common film speeds. For example, 100, 200, 400, and 800 can be distinguished by reading only S1, S2, and ground.

====Film speed====
The five bits after the ground contact in the top row can be encoded to a maximum of 32 different film speeds, but only the 24 speeds from ISO 25/15° to 5000/38°, inclusive, spaced in intervals of step, are used.

The film speed codes are in binary order if the first three bits (S1, S2, S3) are considered to identify a trio of film speeds and the last two bits (S4 and S5) are considered an adjustment of +0, +, or + stops within that trio. For example, ISO speed 25/15° is encoded as 00010, while 32/16° is 00001 and 40/17° is 00011. These share a common encoding of 000xx for the first three bits, differing only in the last two bits, so 000xx designates the trio of speeds (25-32-40). Similarly, the next group of three speeds are encoded 10010 (50/18°), 10001 (64/19°), and 10011 (80/20°); it is clear from examination these all (ISO 50-64-80) share the same 100xx encoding for the first three bits. By comparison to the preceding set of three speeds, the encoding for 25/15° (00010) and 50/18° (10010) have the same xxx10 encoding for the last two bits; likewise, 32/16° (00001) and 64/19° (10001) share the xxx01 encoding, which indicates + stop compared to the xxx10 encoding, and 40/17° (00011) and 80/20° (10011) share the xxx11 encoding, which indicates + stop compared to the xxx10 encoding.

====Film length====
In the second row, the first three bits represent eight possible film lengths, although in practice only 12, 20, 24 and 36 exposures are encoded.

====Exposure tolerance====
The remaining two bits of the second row give four ranges of exposure tolerance, or latitude.

The complete encoding scheme is illustrated in the truth table below using letters and color.
* &quot;G&quot; is ground.
* &quot;T&quot; means the contact is connected to ground.
* &quot;F&quot; means the contact is disconnected from ground.

<text>Charleroi (, , ; ) is a city and a municipality of Wallonia, located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It is the largest city in both Hainaut and Wallonia. The city is situated in the valley of the Sambre, in the south-west of Belgium, not far from the border with France. By 1 January 2008, the total population of Charleroi was 201,593. The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of with a total population of 522,522 by 1 January 2008, ranking it as the 5th most populous in Belgium after Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, and Ghent. The inhabitants are called &quot;Carolorégiens&quot; or simply &quot;Carolos&quot;.

==History==
The Charleroi area was already settled in the prehistoric period, with traces of metallurgical and commercial activities along the Sambre. Several public buildings, temples and villas were built in the area in the Roman period. Burial places, with jewels and weapons, have been found. The first written mention of a place called Charnoy dates from a 9th-century offering in the Lobbes abbey, which lists various neighboring towns and related tithe duties. During the Middle Ages, Charnoy was one of the many small hamlets in the area, with no more than about 50 inhabitants, part of the County of Namur.

===Foundation===
Spanish territorial losses in the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees left a gap between the key fortresses of Mons and Namur; to fill this, Francisco Castel Rodrigo, then Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, expropriated land around Charnoy to build a fortress near the Sambre. In September 1666, it was renamed Charle-roi, or King Charles, in honour of five-year-old Charles II of Spain; the chronogram FVNDATVR CAROLOREGIVM (MDCLVVVI) can be found in the register of the parish of Charnoy.

Construction had only just begun when the War of Devolution with France began in 1667, and the Spanish withdrew. France retained the town under the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and its fortifications were completed by Vauban. A bridge was built over the Sambre, connecting the &quot;Ville Haute&quot; and &quot;Ville Basse&quot;, with incentives offered to persuade people to settle there. The French relinquished control in 1678, and although it changed hands several times over the next 50 years, the town remained part of the Netherlands until the foundation of modern Belgium.

===1666–1830===

Shortly after its foundation, the new city was in turn besieged by the Dutch, ceded to the Spanish in 1678 (Treaty of Nijmegen), taken by the French in 1693, ceded again to the Spanish in 1698 (Treaty of Rijswijk), then taken by the French, the Dutch and the Austrians in 1714 (Treaty of Baden). The French Prince of Conti took the city again in 1745, but it was ceded back to Austria in 1748, beginning a period of prosperity under Joseph II. Glass, steel and coal industries, which had already sprung up a century earlier, could now flourish.

Trouble began again in 1790, the year of the civil uprising that eventually led to the United States of Belgium. The Austrians occupied the city, were forced out by the French after the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792, and took it back again four months later. On 12 June 1794, the French revolutionary Army of Sambre-et-Meuse under the command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, invested Charleroi and won a decisive victory in the ensuing Battle of Fleurus. The city took the revolutionary name of Libre-sur-Sambre until 1800. After France&#x27;s defeat in 1814, the whole area was annexed to the Netherlands, and new walls were built around the city. Napoleon stayed in Charleroi for a couple of days in June 1815, just before the Battle of Waterloo.

===1830 to present===
The Belgian Revolution of 1830 gave the area its freedom from the Netherlands and ushered in a new era of prosperity, still based mostly on glass, metallurgy and coal, hence the area&#x27;s name, &quot;Pays Noir&quot; (&quot;Black Country&quot;). After the Industrial Revolution, Charleroi benefited from the increased use of coke in the metallurgical industry. People from across Europe were attracted by the economic opportunities, and the population grew rapidly.

Following the Industrial Revolution in Wallonia, Charleroi from the 1850s–1860s became one of the most important places where labor strikes broke out. In 1886, 12 strikers were killed by the Belgian army in Roux. In the 1880s, miners in Hainaut were recruited by the Dominion Coal Company in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. These miners were anxious to flee the repression following bloody strikes and riots in Liège and Charleroi during the Walloon Jacquerie of 1886. Walloon miners from Charleroi also emigrated to Alberta, Canada. The working men of Charleroi always played an important role in Belgian general strikes and particularly during the Belgian general strike of 1936, the general strike against Leopold III of Belgium, and the 1960–1961 winter general strike.

By 1871, the fortified walls around the city were completely torn down.

Heavy fighting took place during World War I due to the city&#x27;s strategic location on the Sambre. The city was badly damaged with further destruction only being prevented by the Couillet Treaty agreed with the German forces which required the payment of 10 million Belgian Francs, foodstuffs, vehicles and armaments. The magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;, which featured the popular cartoon characters Lucky Luke and the Smurfs, was launched by the publishing company Éditions Dupuis in 1938. After World War II, Charleroi witnessed a general decline of its heavy industry. Following the merger with several surrounding municipalities in 1977, the city ranks as the largest city in Wallonia and the 4th largest in Belgium.

===Logotype===
As part of the effort to improve its identity, the city adopted a new logo and graphic charter in early 2015, designed by the Brussels studio Pam and Jenny.

The crown of three triangles above the C has several meanings:

* The triangular shape evokes the slag heaps, yesterday black and today green, which symbolise the city&#x27;s industrial past and its factories.
* It also recalls the crest of the cockerel designed by Pierre Paulus and symbol of Wallonia.
* The crown refers to King Charles II who gave his name to the city at the time of its foundation.
* The typography used is also very similar to that used in the logo of ACEC, a historic company founded, developed and finally closed down in Charleroi in 1989 after more than a century of existence.
==Geography==
The municipality of Charleroi straddles both banks of the river Sambre in an area marked by industrial activities (coal mining and steel industry), which has been nicknamed the &quot;Pays Noir&quot; (&quot;Black Country&quot;), part of the larger &quot;sillon industriel&quot;. Even though most of the factories have closed since the 1950s, the landscape remains dotted with spoil tips and old industrial buildings.

Charleroi lies around south of Brussels.

The municipality comprises:
*I. the central district of Charleroi

and the following former municipalities, now sections, merged into Charleroi in 1977:

*II. Dampremy
*III. Lodelinsart
*IV. Gilly
*V. Montignies-sur-Sambre
*VI. Couillet
*VII. Marcinelle
*VIII. Mont-sur-Marchienne
*IX. Marchienne-au-Pont
*X. Monceau-sur-Sambre
*XI. Goutroux
*XII. Roux
*XIII. Jumet
*XIV. Gosselies
*XV. Ransart
Neighboring municipalities:

* a. Les Bons Villers
* b. Fleurus
* c. Châtelet
* d. Gerpinnes
* e. Ham-sur-Heure-Nalinnes
* f. Montigny-le-Tilleul
* g. Fontaine-l&#x27;Évêque
* h. Courcelles
* i. Pont-à-Celles
===Topography and hydrography===

The topography of Charleroi is influenced by the valley of the river Sambre, which flows from west to east before joining the Meuse at Namur. The Piéton river flows from north to south to join the Sambre at Dampremy. The Charleroi-Brussels canal is dug in the valley of this stream. The Eau d&#x27;Heure river comes from the south and also flows into the Sambre at Marchienne-au-Pont. About twenty streams run through the territory of the municipality.

The altitude ranges from 100 metres (Sambre and Piéton valleys) to over 220 metres at the Bois du Prince in Marcinelle. The level is 132 metres on the Place Charles II. The height of the slag heaps often exceeds 200 metres, the Saint-Charles slag heap in the Bois du Cazier reaches 241 metres.

=== Biodiversity ===
The six slag heaps in the Pays Noir are reservoirs of biodiversity that should be preserved.

Like the calcareous grassland, the slag heaps are habitats created by human activity that are home to many very specific and often threatened animal and plant species. The rarity of these species depends on the rarity of the environment itself (the biotope). Biodiversity is also present in other environments: in a wasteland, a body of water, a meadow, etc. In terms of biodiversity, it is therefore preferable to maintain a mosaic of habitats, hence the interest in preserving different types of environments on the slag heaps.

The Viviers site, for example, is an old mining site located in the east of Charleroi (Gilly). This site has a small conical slag heap and large open areas consisting mainly of pioneer grassland and wasteland. It also includes a small body of water as well as temporary ponds, and some wooded areas on the western and northern edges. This particular biotope is of great biological interest and acts as a refuge for a diverse fauna. The vast reed bed surrounding the pond is home to the red warbler, a passerine bird specific to this type of vegetation. Several species of amphibians can be seen here, including a population of the natterjack toad, as well as certain insects, such as the magnificent blue-winged grasshopper.

The Martinet site, a former colliery on the boundary of the Monceau-sur-Sambre and Roux sections, is in the process of being rehabilitated and reallocated. Like the Viviers slag heap in Gilly, this vast site is of great biological interest.

===Climate===
Similar to the rest of Belgium Charleroi has an oceanic climate as a result of the Gulf Stream influence warming winters, while also moderating summer warmth in spite of its inland position.

==Politics==
Before the merger of municipalities, from Belgian independence in 1830 until 1 January 1977 (with the exception of the period linked to the Second World War), Charleroi only experienced liberal mayors and majorities. The municipal elections in 1976, just before the merger of municipalities, brought an absolute majority for the Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste or PS), and Lucien Harmegnies, previous minister and until then mayor of Marcinelle, became the first socialist mayor of the new entity. Since 1977, the Socialist Party has constantly been part of the political majority within the municipal council, either holding an absolute majority or being in coalition with other parties.

In 2005, numerous judicial affairs put into question Charleroi&#x27;s elected socialist municipal councillors. The media resonance and the impact were significant at local, regional and even national level. At local level, the PS lost its absolute majority as a result of the municipality elections of 8 October 2006.


At the elections of October 2012, the PS, under the leadership of Paul Magnette, regained the absolute majority at the municipal council. Mayor Paul Magnette chose, however, to open the socialist majority and to reconduct the coalition of socialists, liberals and centrists. At the municipal elections of 2018, Magnette, re-elected mayor, opened the socialist city majority to ecologists and centrists (C+).

==Economy==
Charleroi was in the center of a coal basin as well as steel and glass industries. Even so, due to the widespread loss in industrial power in the area since the 1970s, the coal and steel areas experienced a significant decline for most of the 1980s and 1990s.

From these industrial activities, the region of Charleroi has inherited a wide industrial area for electrical engineering and production of iron, steel, glass and chemicals. The conglomerate ArcelorMittal subdivided its Industeel unit to encompass the Charleroi steelworks.

Moreover, from the early 2000s, the overall economy of the area has diversified to include health care, logistics, biotechnologies, energy (Suez), railway transportation (Alstom) and telecommunications (Alcatel).

More recently, other sectors have developed, mainly civil and military aeronautics (SABCA, SONACA), logistics, printing and biotechnology. The aeronautics and space industry is developing rapidly around Charleroi-Brussels-South airport with the foundation of two university research centres: the Center of Excellence in Information Technologies (CETIC) serving as a center of expertise for the development of Walloon companies and founded by UCLouvain with the universities of Namur and Mons, as well as the Cenaero (Centre for research in aeronautics) of the University of Liège (ULiège), the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) and the University of Brussels (ULB).

Likewise, the Brussels South Charleroi Airport has evolved in a major commercial success with a grow of passengers from 210.000 in 1998 to 8.3 millions passengers in 2023. Therefore, it has become the second airport of Belgium for passenger transport which is a substantial asset for the economical and commercial development of the region of Charleroi. The activity of the airport thus generates numerous direct and indirect jobs.

The Intercommunale Igretec is the official body of the region of Charleroi giving assistance and support for the installation and development of high-tech companies around the airport and in the region of Charleroi.

Charleroi is also connected through highways with all the major cities of Belgium and the French border. It has also a port (&quot;Port autonome de Charleroi&quot;) and a river network giving access to three major ports (Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam).

From the 1990s, two big shopping malls (Ville 2 and Rive Gauche), cinemas and even a local craft brewery have been created in and around the city center also bringing back shops and customers downtown.

==Education==
Charleroi is Belgium&#x27;s biggest city without having its own university. In 1966 the University of Louvain began operations in Charleroi with three faculties on its UCLouvain Charleroi campus based in the city center and in Montignies-sur-Sambre, including the Louvain School of Management and, more recently, the Louvain School of Engineering, issuing Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degrees and conducting research. Other universities have since started operations in Charleroi, including the Universities of Namur, Mons and the &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles&quot;.

Thanks to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the European Union, a Campus of Sciences, Art and Trade is currently being developed in downtown Charleroi. This Campus, located on the site of the University of Labor, will constitute a real center of excellence for training - teaching - research in the city center equipped with a Cité des Métiers, a University Center, a Center for Technological Higher Education, a “Design – Innovation” Competence Center.

==Transport==

===Air===
The Brussels South Charleroi Airport in Gosselies, north of the centre, opened in 1919 as a flight school. Later, it housed the Fairey aircraft-factory building.

Gosselies is now used as an alternate airport for Brussels. Low-cost carrier Ryanair is the largest airline to provide service there; others include Wizz Air, Jetairfly. Seasonal holiday charters also use the airport.

A new terminal opened in January 2008, replacing a much smaller building which had exceeded capacity.

Brussels is north of Charleroi Airport.

In October 2021, the extension of the runway was officially opened, bringing it to a total length of .

===Rail===
Charleroi is connected by train to other Belgian major cities through the main Charleroi-Central railway station. The city also has a secondary railway station, Charleroi-West, on the Charleroi-to-Ottignies line.

===River transport===
The Port autonome de Charleroi gives access through the Belgian, Dutch and French canal and river network to three major ports (Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam). Il is composed of twenty-nine ports in the region of Charleroi distributed along the river Sambre and the Brussels-Charleroi canal. It has 8 km of embankments, 5 million tons of goods transported each year, 10.000 containers and a trimodal platform for the containers;
100 companies have a concession and there are 1700 direct and 1000 indirect jobs associated.

===Public transport===
Public transport is provided by TEC (Transport En Commun), the Walloon public transport service. The greater Charleroi region is served by bus lines and a light-rail system, named &quot;Métro Léger de Charleroi&quot;. Part of the latter is famous for incorporating one of the few remnants of the Vicinal, the former Belgian national tramway network.
Charleroi also has a planned four-line S-bahn type suburban rail system, the (Réseau S).

====Charleroi light rail system====
The &quot;Métro Léger de Charleroi&quot; is equally famous for the parts of the system which were never built, partially built or fully completed but not opened. It was planned in the 1960s as a 48 km (30 mi.) light-rail network, operating partly on rapid transit/metro infrastructure, consisting of eight branch lines radiating from a central loop downtown. However, only one line (to Petria), part of another line (to Gilly) and three-quarters of the loop were actually built and opened to traffic, all from 1976 to 1996. Another branch line toward the suburb of Châtelet (Châtelineau) was almost fully built, to the extent of installing power cables, escalators and still-working electric signals in the first three stations but was never opened as passenger numbers would be too low to economically justify the extra staff. The high costs of construction, a decline in Charleroi&#x27;s traditional &quot;smokestack&quot; industries and questioning of the scope of the whole project in proportion to the actual demand for it are cited as reasons for the original plan&#x27;s becoming unfulfilled.

The central loop and the Gilly branch as far as Soleilmont were completed in 2012, with funds from the European Investment Bank. The Gosselies branch opened as a street-level tramline in 2013. In June 2021 it was announced that €60m will be allocated to refurbish and open the long-ago completed but never served inner section of the Châtelet &quot;ghost&quot; line, and extend it to the new hospital development in the area.

in June 2021, the new look of the first renovated tram was presented. This €22 million fleet-wide renovation will be completed by 2026.

<text>Châtelet (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It lies on the river Sambre.

As of January 1, 2018, Châtelet had a total population of 36,101. The total area of the municipality is 27.03 km2 which gives a population density of 1,336 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bouffioulx, Châtelet, and Châtelineau. Châtelet was a long established independent city prior to its fusion with the other entities.

==History==

===Origins and Middle Ages===
The first settlers of the site of Châtelet, dating from paleolithic times, were attracted by the ford on the river, the nearby wooded areas and flint-rich highlands. This region was continuously populated, first by Celtic, then Gallo-Roman peoples, until the Germanic invasions of the 4th and 5th century. In the 9th century, the land was likely part of emperor Louis the Pious’s estate. 

The first occurrence of the name &quot;Châtelet&quot; appears in a text dating from the time when its territory was given to the chapter of the Liège cathedral in the 12th century. Châtelet obtained its charter of rights in 1220, symbolized by the &quot;perron&quot;. 

The protection later afforded by the Prince-Bishopric of Liège made the city into an important administrative, cultural, and economic centre, which could boast four annual trade fairs and a weekly cattle market. It became one of the 23 &quot;bonne villes&quot; (main cities) of the prince-bishopric in 1655. 

While Châtelet&#x27;s economy was dominated by artisanal guilds and trade, that of its neighbours, including Châtelineau and Bouffioulx, remained mostly agricultural. 

===18th century until now===
The 18th century first witnessed the gradual shift of the regional economic power from Châtelet to the newly founded neighbouring city of Charleroi. This was also a time of political instability as the various powers of the day (Spain, France, Austria) fought for supremacy in this region. By the end of the century, the main economic drivers of the whole Sambre valley had become coal and heavy industry. The prosperity that came with the industrial revolution accounts for much of the population growth of the 1800s: Châtelet grew by a factor 5 in less than a century; Châtelineau grew by a factor 20 between 1811 and 1950 to more than 18,000 inhabitants. Many of the current city streets can be dated from that period. Cultural activities and artistic talent flourished as well.

Chatelet, and, in particular, Bouffioux, became well known for the production of its potteries. Originally formed in coal-fired kilns, the works from the region became internationally sought after. Three major producers still exist in the region and continue to produce artistic, as well as useful, pottery, but on a much smaller scale. The 20th century was not kind to the region but despite having witnessed two world wars and the decline of most of its industries, Châtelet is now again a regional center for trade, culture, and educational services.

==Sights==

*The Saint Roch chapel, built in the Baroque style, dates from 1626. The so-called &quot;Spanish House&quot; dates from the same period.
*The Magritte walk in the center of the city features various surrealistic representations, including street lights capped with bowler hats in homage to the artist.
*Châtelet also boasts several green areas, including the Sebastopol reservation, which contains old quarries and an extensive bird population, the municipal woods (&quot;Bois Communal&quot;), with a bat-filled cave, and the municipal park, located at the heart of the city.
*On the Town Hall Square is the Church of S.S. Peter and Paul. The new S.S. Pierre et Paul church was built from 1867 to 1871, according to the plans of the architect E. Carpentier de Beloeil. The fire, which occurred on the night of February 19 to 20, 1937, completely destroyed the decanal church. The religious building was identically rebuilt to the original church.
*At the Grand-Rue is the Château Pirmez, a neo-classical mansion built in 1833 by Victor Pirmez. The building became an orphanage in 1903 and a reception and vocational training center in 1997.
*The Church of the Immaculate Conception is located in the Faubourg district on the Place Franco-Belge, it was built in 1878–1879 in neo-Romanesque style by the architect Elie Pierard.
*The chapel of Calvary, which is located at the corner of rue de la Praye, replaces an old oratory from 1730, a neo-classical chapel in brick and limestone from 1888.

== The mining ==
In 1853, a company, called Société Anonyme des Charbonnages du Nord de Charleroi, was formed to bring together the various concessions located in Courcelles.
The mining capacity was 19,000 tons in 1854. It reached 500,000 tons in 1930.
The shafts were closed one by one and currently, no extraction shaft is in operation on the territory of Courcelles, but we can still see a lot of spoil tips which are now nice places for walking.

<text>Farciennes (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium.

On January 1, 2018, Farciennes had a total population of 11,247. The total area is 10.39 km2 which gives a population density of 1,083 inhabitants per km2. It is located on the entre-Sambre-et-Meuse in the periphery of Charleroi.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Farciennes and Pironchamps. The boroughs of Wainage, Wairchat and Tergnée are part of the district of Farciennes.

In the past, Farciennes was an industrial city. It declined with the closure of the last Walloon coal mine, namely the Sainte-Catherine shaft of the Roton company, and the fall of the iron and steel industries, formerly large employers in the area between Liège and Charleroi. Today, the site of Roton, of which only the tower and the cloakroom remain, has been developed to accommodate small and medium-sized businesses.

<text>Fleurus (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It has been the site of four major battles.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Brye, Heppignies, Fleurus, Lambusart, Saint-Amand, Wagnelée, Wanfercée-Baulet (wa: &quot;Wanfercêye-Bålet&quot;), and Wangenies.

==History==

Traces of agriculture dating back to the Neolithic Age were found in area known as Fleurjoux and Neuve Baraque. Later the site saw the construction of the Chaussée Brunehaut, a road network of uncertain origin, perhaps attributable to the Roman Empire.

In October 1155, Henry IV of Luxembourg, also Count of Namur enfranchised the municipality which became the city of Fleurus. Henry IV had a castle in Heppignies.

The town has given its name to three battles fought in the area :

*The Battle of Fleurus (1622) in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
*The Battle of Fleurus (1690) in the Nine Years&#x27; War.
*The Battle of Fleurus (1794) in the French Revolutionary Wars.

Two days before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Napoleon I defeated the Prussians in what is known as the Battle of Ligny, although the pivotal action took place just north of Fleurus.

The battles have been commemorated in ship names of the countries involved, which in turn has led to Fleurus Island in Antarctica being named after SS &quot;Fleurus&quot;, a Norwegian trawler operated between the Falkland Islands and the whaling station on South Georgia in the 1920s. The &quot;Rue de Fleurus&quot; is on the Left Bank in Paris.

In World War II, the only fighting near Fleurus was a tank battle southwest of the town at Vieux Campinaire in September 1944.

 was added to the municipality&#x27;s area in the early 2000s.

<doc id="175234" wikidata="Q10638321" url="?curid=175234" title="Praemunire">
<text>In English history, praemunire or praemunire facias ( or ) was the assertion or maintenance of papal jurisdiction, or any other foreign jurisdiction or claim of supremacy in England, against the supremacy of the monarch. The 14th-century law prohibiting this was enforced by the &quot;writ of praemunire facias&quot;, a writ of summons from which the law takes its name. 

&quot;Praemunire&quot; may denote the statute, the writ, or the offence. In classical Latin, it means &quot;to fortify&quot; and also &quot;to safeguard&quot; or &quot;to uphold&quot; (munire) &quot;in advance&quot; or &quot;in preference&quot; (prae). From antiquity, munire was also connected, by mistaken etymology, with munera, &quot;duties,&quot; &quot;civic obligations.&quot; In medieval Latin, &quot;praemunire&quot; was confused with and used for &quot;praemonere&quot;, to forewarn, as the writ commanded that the sheriff do (&quot;facias&quot;) warn (&quot;praemunire&quot;) the summoned person to appear before the Court. Another way of understanding the term, more revealing of its sense, and based on its proper meaning, is &quot;to supply support for (munire) something instead of, sooner than or before (prae) its proper object, as someone, for instance, affording support and obedience to the papacy sooner than to the monarchy.

==Background==
A controversy arose between the English kings and the Court of Rome concerning the filling of ecclesiastical benefices by means of papal provisions &quot;by which the Pope, suspending for the time the right of the patron, nominated of his own authority, to the vacant benefice&quot; the papal nominee being called a &quot;provisor&quot;. Pope Gregory IX (1227–1241) pronounced against the propriety of such provisions as interfering with the rights of lay patrons; and Pope Innocent IV expressed, in 1253, general disapprobation of these nominations.

The Statute of Provisors (1306) (25 Edw. 3. Stat. 4), passed in the reign of Edward I, was, according to Sir Edward Coke, the foundation of all subsequent statutes of &quot;praemunire&quot;. This statute enacted &quot;that no tax imposed by any religious persons should be sent out of the country whether under the name of a rent, tallage, tribute or any kind of imposition&quot;. A much greater check on the freedom of action of the popes was imposed by the Statute of Provisors (1351) and the Statute of &quot;Praemunire&quot; passed in the reign of Edward III.

The former of these, after premising &quot;that the Pope of Rome, accroaching to him the seignories of possession and benefices of the holy Church of the realm of England doth give and grant the same benefices to aliens which did never dwell in England, and to cardinals, which might not dwell here, and to others as well aliens as denizens, as if he had been patron or advowee of the said dignities and benefices, as he was not of right by the laws of England&quot;, ordained the free election of all dignities and benefices elective in the manner as they were granted by the king&#x27;s progenitors.

==Origin==
The Statute of Praemunire (16 Ric. 2. c. 5) was passed by the Parliament of England during the reign of Richard II, who purchased various loans from foreign creditors and rulers as well as bulls from Rome in 1392. It was only one of numerous stringent measures passed for the purpose of restraining the Holy See and all forms of papal authority in England and of eliminating in general the influence of foreign powers, especially creditors and the Holy Roman Emperor. Because the Papacy had long claimed a form of temporal supremacy over England and Ireland, from the beginning of the 14th century, papal intervention had been particularly active, more especially in two forms. The one, the disposal of ecclesiastical benefices, before the same became vacant, to men of the pope&#x27;s own choosing; the other, the encouragement of resort to himself and his curia, rather than to the courts of the country, for legal justice.

==Later developments==
The Statute of Praemunire (the first statute so called) (1353), though especially levelled at the pretensions of the Roman Curia, was also levelled against the pretensions of any foreign power and therefore was created to maintain the independence of the crown against all pretensions against it. By it, the king &quot;at the grievous and clamorous complaints of the great men and commons of the realm of England&quot; enacts &quot;that all the people of the king&#x27;s ligeance of what condition that they be, which shall draw any out of the realm in plea&quot; or any matter of which the cognizance properly belongs to the king&#x27;s court shall be allowed two months in which to answer for their contempt of the king&#x27;s rights in transferring their pleas abroad. The penalties which were attached to the offence under this statute involved the loss of all civil rights, forfeiture of lands, goods and chattels, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure.

Many other statutes followed that of 1353, but that which was passed in the sixteenth year of Richard II&#x27;s reign is, as mentioned before, usually referred to as the Statute of Praemunire. This statute, after first stating &quot;that the right of recovering the presentments to churches, prebends, and other benefices ... belongeth only to the king’s court of the old right of his crown, used and approved in the time of all his progenitors kings of England&quot;, proceeds to condemn the practice of papal translation, and after rehearsing the promise of the three estates of the realm to stand with the king in all cases touching his crown and his regality, enacts &quot;that if any purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued in the court of Rome, or elsewhere, any such translations, processes, and sentences of excommunications, bulls, instruments or any other things whatsoever ... he and his notaries, abettors and counsellors&quot; shall be put out of the king&#x27;s protection, and their lands escheat.

Praemunire declined in importance, but experienced a resurgence under Henry VIII as the Protestant Reformation unfolded. First individuals were indicted for &quot;praemunire&quot;, then groups of clergy, and lastly the entire English clergy was accused of being agents of a foreign power (the Pope). The fall of both Lord Chancellor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and Lord Great Chamberlain Thomas Cromwell was precipitated by a charge of praemunire. William Barlow was pardoned by the crown for the crime in 1550 when he made a visitation at Wells deanery. In time, Henry asserted himself as &quot;of the Church of England in Earth under Jesus Christ Supreme Head&quot;, and the clergy of the Church of England no longer answered to a foreign power.

During the 19th century the Camerlengo of the time would on occasion communicate the death of a Pope to the British monarch (along with other rulers), and made occasional other communications. There was some discussion as to whether the Statute of Praemunire meant that no response could be made: the compromises reached included conveying messages on a &#x27;private&#x27; rather than &#x27;official&#x27; level, or going via the Hanoverian minister at London (responding as King of Hanover). Eventually it was decided that there was no legal obstacle to establishing formal diplomatic relations.

The abolition in 1870 of forfeiture as a penalty for treason and felony did not apply to &quot;praemunire&quot; because it was a misdemeanour.

As of the Criminal Law Act 1967 coming into effect, praemunire facias is no longer an offence in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Afterwards, the European Communities Act 1972 extended the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to the United Kingdom, putting a final end to praemunire. Nevertheless, in a speech at the 2018 Conservative Party Conference, during the political controversies associated with the Brexit negotiations, Boris Johnson claimed that the authors of the Chequers plan risked prosecution for &quot;Praemunire&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot;, in a fact-check of Johnson&#x27;s speech, noted that &quot;Praemunire&quot; had been repealed 51 years previously.

<text>Pont-à-Celles (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

On January 1, 2018, Pont-à-Celles had a total population of 17,287. The total area is 55.73 km2 which gives a population density of 310 inhabitants per km2.

==Administration==

The municipality consists of the following districts: Buzet, Liberchies, Luttre, Obaix, Pont-à-Celles, Thiméon, and Viesville.

==Origin of the name==

Pont-à-Celles draws its name from Latin &quot;Cella&quot;, meaning room or cell of monk, probably because of the presence of the monastery founded in the 7th century, by Saint Amand (apostle of Belgium). The jurisdiction on which this primitive monastery was established, and then the priory of the Park, was called Celles, and later Pont-à-Celles.

The name of Pont-à-Celles appears for the first time during the 16th century, when the monks of the Park built a bridge over the Pieton river near the church. The parishioners of Luttre and Hairiamont then had to cross the bridge for going to service (hence bridge to Celles, or Pont-à-Celles in French). Gradually, this name extended to all the parish whose territory covered six seigniories.

When in 1795, the French replaced these six seigniories by a newly created municipality, they adopted the name of the parish (Pont-à-Celles). In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon in Waterloo, its territories were annexed to the Netherlands. With this occasion, the department of Jemappes (to which Pont-à-Celles belonged) became the province of Hainaut.

==Notable people from Pont-à-Celles==
The famous Jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt was born in Liberchies. Every May, the community honors him with the open air Django Reinhardt Jazz Festival.

<text>Seneffe (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

On 1 January 2006 Seneffe had a total population of 10,743. The total area is 62.77 km² which gives a population density of 171 inhabitants per km².

The municipality consists of the following districts: Arquennes, Familleureux, Feluy, Petit-Rœulx-lez-Nivelles, and Seneffe.

The Château de Seneffe, now a museum belonging to the French Community of Belgium, is located in the municipality.

Seneffe was the site of a battle in 1674 between French and Dutch armies during the Franco-Dutch War.

== British Leyland ==
Between 1965 and 1982 Seneffe was the location of a car plant belonging to British Leyland, which in its later years assembled models including the Mini and the Austin Allegro from crated kits shipped from the company&#x27;s Cowley facility. A significant milestone was reached in June 1977 when the plant produced its 500,000th vehicle, an Austin Allegro 1300 Special. The Seneffe plant was closed in 1982 as the company&#x27;s aging model range lost market share across Europe, with further loss of demand resulting from the depressed state of the UK economy at the time. With alternative employment opportunities limited, the plant closure triggered considerable bitterness locally.

* Feluy Castle: Residence of Philippe François de Berghes, 1st Prince of Grimberghen.

<text>Boussu (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

As of January 1, 2006, Boussu had a population of 20,058. The total area is 20.01 km2, which gives a population density of 1,002 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Boussu and Hornu.

== History ==

During the late Middle Ages the town gave his name to an important branch of the House of Hénin. The castle of Boussu was constructed in this period, and important members of this family are buried inside the church. Most famous is the Mausoleum of Maximilien II de Hénin, 5th Count of Bossu.

In the 19th century local industry expanded. A planned industrial city, called le Grand Hornu, was constructed.
Located in Hornu, the buildings are now a museum.

== Etymology ==
As its neighbouring municipality, Hornu, Boussu&#x27;s town is very old and the history of Saint Waudru mentions the existence of a church in the 13th century. In the acts of the past, Boussu conquered very diverse titles: Buxutum, Bussuth, Bussut, Bossut, Boussut. However, the etymology is very simple. This means &quot;the place abundant in boxwood&quot; (in Latin buxus: meaning boxwood or buxutum meaning boxwood coppice).

==Famous inhabitants==
*Marcel Moreau, writer
*Massimo Bruno, Footballer and Belgian youth international

<text>Incense is an aromatic biotic material that releases fragrant smoke when burnt. The term is used for either the material or the aroma. Incense is used for aesthetic reasons, religious worship, aromatherapy, meditation, and ceremonial reasons. It may also be used as a simple deodorant or insect repellent.

Incense is composed of aromatic plant materials, often combined with essential oils. The forms taken by incense differ with the underlying culture, and have changed with advances in technology and increasing number of uses.

Incense can generally be separated into two main types: &quot;indirect-burning&quot; and &quot;direct-burning.&quot; Indirect-burning incense (or &quot;non-combustible incense&quot;) is not capable of burning on its own, and requires a separate heat source. Direct-burning incense (or &quot;combustible incense&quot;) is lit directly by a flame and then fanned or blown out, leaving a glowing ember that smoulders and releases a smoky fragrance. Direct-burning incense is either a paste formed around a bamboo stick, or a paste that is extruded into a stick or cone shape.

==History==

The word &quot;incense&quot; comes from Latin pronunciation: /inˈt͡ʃɛn.de.re/ meaning &#x27;to burn&#x27;.
Combustible bouquets were used by the ancient Egyptians, who employed incense in both pragmatic and mystical capacities. Incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation, but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma. Resin balls were found in many prehistoric Egyptian tombs in El Mahasna, giving evidence for the prominence of incense and related compounds in Egyptian antiquity. One of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the 5th dynasty. The Temple of Deir-el-Bahari in Egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense.

The Babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divine oracles. Incense spread from there to Greece and Rome. Incense burners have been found in the Indus Civilization. Evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma. This was the first usage of subterranean plant parts in incense.

The oldest textual source on incense is the Vedas, specifically the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda. Incense-burning was used to create pleasing aromas as well as a medicinal tool. Its use in medicine is considered the first phase of Ayurveda, which uses incense as an approach to healing. The practice of incense as a healing tool was assimilated into the religious practices of the time. As Hinduism matured and Buddhism was founded in India, incense became an integral part of Buddhism as well. Around 200 CE, a group of wandering Buddhist monks introduced incense stick making to China. Some incense, depending on the contents, may also act as organic insect repellent.

At around 2000 BCE, Ancient China began the use of incense in the religious sense, namely for worship. Incense was used by Chinese cultures from Neolithic times and became more widespread in the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. The earliest documented use of incense comes from the ancient Chinese, who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products (such as cassia, cinnamon, styrax, and sandalwood) as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites. Incense usage reached its peak during the Song dynasty, with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies.

Brought to Japan in the 6th century by Korean Buddhist monks, who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites, the delicate scents of Koh (high-quality Japanese incense) became a source of amusement and entertainment for nobles in the Imperial Court during the Heian Era 200 years later. During the 14th-century Ashikaga shogunate, a samurai warrior might perfume his helmet and armor with incense to achieve an aura of invincibility (as well as to make a noble gesture to whoever might take his head in battle). It was not until the Muromachi period during the 15th and 16th century that incense appreciation (, ) spread to the upper and middle classes of Japanese society.

==Composition==
A variety of materials have been used in making incense. Historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients. For example, sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of North America. Trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the Silk Road and other trade routes, one notably called the Incense Route.

Local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style, but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners, such as clergy and physicians.

===Combustible base===
The combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a self-sustained ember, which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark time. The base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell. Commercially, two types of incense base predominate:
*Fuel and oxidizer mixtures: Charcoal or wood powder provides the fuel for combustion while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense. Fragrant materials are added to the base prior to shaping, as in the case of powdered incense materials, or after, as in the case of essential oils. The formula for charcoal-based incense is superficially similar to black powder, though it lacks the sulfur.
*Natural plant-based binders: Gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together. Mucilaginous material, which can be derived from many botanical sources, is mixed with fragrant materials and water. The mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit. The dry binding powder usually comprises about 10% of the dry weight in the finished incense. These include:
**&quot;Makko&quot; (incense powder) made from the bark of various trees in the genus &quot;Persea&quot; (such as &quot;Persea thunbergii&quot;)
**&quot;Xiangnan pi&quot; (made from the bark of trees of genus &quot;Phoebe&quot; such as &quot;Phoebe nanmu&quot; or &quot;Persea zuihoensis&quot;.
**&quot;Jigit&quot;: a resin based binder used in India
**&quot;Laha&quot; or &quot;Dar&quot;: bark based powders used in Nepal, Tibet, and other East Asian countries.

Typical compositions burn at a temperature between .

==Types==
Incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing. They can generally be separated into &quot;direct-burning&quot; and &quot;indirect-burning&quot; types. Preference for one form over another varies with culture, tradition, and personal taste. The two differ in their composition due to the former&#x27;s requirement for even, stable, and sustained burning.

===Indirect-burning===

Indirect-burning incense, also called &quot;non-combustible incense&quot;, is an aromatic material or combination of materials, such as resins, that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source. Finer forms tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually, having less surface area. Heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers. In the West, the best known incense materials of this type are the resins frankincense and myrrh, likely due to their numerous mentions in the Bible. Frankincense means &quot;pure incense&quot;, though in common usage, it refers specifically to the resin of the boswellia tree.

*Whole: The incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers.
*Powdered or granulated: Incense broken into smaller pieces burns quickly and provides brief but intense odor.
*Paste: Powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky incombustible binder, such as dried fruit, honey, or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles. These may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite. Much Arabian incense, also called &quot;Bukhoor&quot; or &quot;Bakhoor&quot;, is of this type, and Japan has a history of kneaded incense, called nerikō or awasekō, made using this method. Within the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition, raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweet-smelling essential oils.

===Direct-burning===
Direct-burning incense, also called &quot;combustible incense&quot;, is lit directly by a flame. The glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn the rest of the incense without further application of external heat or flame. Direct-burning incense is either extruded, pressed into forms, or coated onto a supporting material. This class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground (or liquid) incense materials and odourless binder. The composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning. The following types are commonly encountered, though direct-burning incense can take nearly any form, whether for expedience or whimsy.

*Coil: Extruded and shaped into a coil without a core, coil incense can burn for an extended period, from hours to days, and is commonly produced and used in Chinese cultures.

*Cone: Incense in this form burns relatively quickly. Incense cones were invented in Japan in the 1800s.
*Cored stick: A supporting core of bamboo is coated with a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core. Higher-quality variations have fragrant sandalwood cores. This type of incense is commonly produced in India and China. When used in Chinese folk religion, these are sometimes known as &quot;joss sticks&quot;.
*Dhoop or solid stick: With no bamboo core, dhoop incense is easily broken for portion control. This is the most commonly produced form of incense in Japan and Tibet.
*Powder: The loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing. Powder incense is typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks.
*Paper: Paper infused with resin or oils extracted from fragrant material, folded accordion style, is lit and blown out. Examples include Carta d&#x27;Armenia and Papier d&#x27;Arménie.
*Rope: The incense powder is rolled into paper sheets, which are then rolled into ropes, twisted tightly, then doubled over and twisted again, yielding a two-strand rope. The larger end is the bight, and may be stood vertically, in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles. The smaller (pointed) end is lit. This type of incense is easily transported and stays fresh for extremely long periods. It has been used for centuries in Tibet and Nepal.

Moxa tablets, which are disks of powdered mugwort used in Traditional Chinese medicine for moxibustion, are not incenses; the treatment is by heat rather than fragrance.

Incense sticks may be termed joss sticks, especially in parts of East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Among ethnic Chinese and Chinese-influenced communities these are traditionally burned at temples, before the threshold of a home or business, before an image of a religious divinity or local spirit, or in shrines, large and small, found at the main entrance of every village. Here the earth god is propitiated in the hope of bringing wealth and health to the village. They can also be burned in front of a door or open window as an offering to heaven, or the devas. The word &quot;joss&quot; is derived from the Latin (god) via the Portuguese through the Javanese , through Chinese pidgin English.

==Production==


The raw materials are powdered and then mixed together with a binder to form a paste, which, for direct burning incense, is then cut and dried into pellets.
Certain proportions are necessary for direct-burning incense:
*Oil content: an excess of oils may prevent incense from smoldering effectively. Resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense are typically balanced with &quot;dry&quot; materials such as wood, bark and leaf powders.
*Oxidizer quantity: Too little oxidizer in gum-bound incense may prevent the incense from igniting, while too much will cause the incense to burn too quickly, without producing fragrant smoke.
*Binder: Water-soluble binders such as &quot;makko&quot; ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry, dilute the mixture.
*Mixture density: Incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing, or over-compressed while being formed, which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture, causing the incense to burn unevenly, too slowly, or too quickly.
*Particulate size: The incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates. Uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burned.

&quot;Dipped&quot; or &quot;hand-dipped&quot; direct-burning incense is created by dipping &quot;incense blanks&quot; made of unscented combustible dust into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil. These are often sold in the United States by flea-market and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles. This form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture, since the blanks are pre-formed in China or South East Asia.

Incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes. Small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough. The incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create &quot;cone&quot; and smaller &quot;coiled&quot; incense, or forced through a hydraulic press for &quot;solid stick&quot; incense. The formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried. Incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried, and as such must be placed in climate-controlled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process.

Traditionally, the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from &quot;Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens&quot; since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick. In a process known as &quot;splitting the foot of the incense stick&quot;, the bamboo is trimmed to length, soaked, peeled, and split in halves until the thin sticks of bamboo have square cross sections of less than 3mm. This process has been largely replaced by machines in modern incense production.

In the case of cored incensed sticks, several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture:
*&quot;Paste rolling&quot;: A wet, malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long, thin coil, using a paddle. Then, a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved. The stick is then cut to the desired length and dried.
*&quot;Powder-coating&quot;: Powder-coating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger &quot;coil&quot; (up to in diameter) or &quot;cored stick&quot; forms. A bundle of the supporting material (typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers) is soaked in water or a thin water/glue mixture for a short time. The thin sticks are evenly separated, then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plant-based binder. The dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the sticks while they are spread apart. The sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks. Three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks, forming a thick layer of incense material on the stick. The coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air. Additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying. Incense sticks produced in this fashion and burned in temples of Chinese folk religion can have a thickness between 2 and 4 millimeters.
*&quot;Compression&quot;: A damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression, similar to the way uncored sticks are formed. This form is becoming more common due to the higher labor cost of producing powder-coated or paste-rolled sticks.

===Orthodox Christian===
Incense of the Eastern Orthodox Christian monastic tradition on Mount Athos is made by powdering frankincense or fir resin, mixing it with essential oils. Floral fragrances are the most common, but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon. The incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately thick and left until the slab has firmed. It is then cut into small cubes, coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion, and allowed to fully harden and dry. In Greece this rolled incense resin is called &#x27;Moskolibano&#x27;, and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance, with pink being rose and green being jasmine.

==Burning incense==
Indirect-burning incense is burned directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible.

In Japan and China, a similar censer called a in Japanese, or a &quot;shǒulú&quot; (手爐) in Chinese, is used by several Buddhist traditions. The /&quot;shǒulú&quot; is usually made of brass, with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method in Japan is known as (religious burning). For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a heat source such as a flame until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. The flame is then fanned or blown out, leaving the incense to smolder.

==Cultural variations==
===Arabian===
In most Arab countries, incense is burned in the form of scented chips or blocks called ( ). Incense is used on special occasions like weddings or on Fridays or generally to perfume the house. The is usually burned in a ( or ), a traditional incense burner (censer) similar to the Somali . It is customary in many Arab countries to pass among the guests in the (, &#x27;congregation&#x27;). This is done as a gesture of hospitality.

===Chinese===

For over two thousand years, the Chinese have used incense in religious ceremonies, ancestor veneration, traditional Chinese medicine, and daily life. Agarwood () and sandalwood () are the two most important ingredients in Chinese incense.

Along with the introduction of Buddhism in China came calibrated incense sticks and incense clocks. The first known record is by poet Yu Jianwu (487–551): &quot;By burning incense we know the o&#x27;clock of the night, With graduated candles we confirm the tally of the watches.&quot; The use of these incense timekeeping devices spread from Buddhist monasteries into Chinese secular society.

Incense-stick burning is an everyday practice in traditional Chinese religion. There are many different types of sticks used for different purposes or on different festive days. Many of them are long and thin. Sticks are mostly coloured yellow, red, or more rarely, black. Thick sticks are used for special ceremonies, such as funerals. Spiral incense, with exceedingly long burn times, is often hung from temple ceilings. In some states, such as Taiwan, Singapore, or Malaysia, where they celebrate the Ghost Festival, large, pillar-like dragon incense sticks are sometimes used. These generate so much smoke and heat that they are only burned outside.

Chinese incense sticks used in popular religion are generally odorless or only use the slightest trace of jasmine or rose, since it is the smoke, not the scent, which is important in conveying the prayers of the faithful to heaven. They are composed of the dried powdered bark of a non-scented species of cinnamon native to Cambodia, &quot;Cinnamomum cambodianum&quot;. Inexpensive packs of 300 are often found for sale in Chinese supermarkets. Though they contain no sandalwood, they often include the Chinese character for sandalwood on the label, as a generic term for incense.

Highly scented Chinese incense sticks are used by some Buddhists. These are often quite expensive due to the use of large amounts of sandalwood, agarwood, or floral scents. The sandalwood used in Chinese incenses does not come from India, its native home, but rather from groves planted within Chinese territory. Sites belonging to Tzu Chi, Chung Tai Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, Xingtian Temple, or City of Ten Thousand Buddhas do not use incense.

===Christian===

The use of incense in Christianity is inspired by passages in the Bible; its use in prayer and worship carries with it a Christian symbolism. Incense is used in Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Old Catholic denominations, as well as in some Methodist, Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Anglican churches. A thurible is used to hold the burning incense. Each thurible consists of a censer section, chains to hold and swing it, a perforated lid, and a crucible in which burning charcoal is placed. The incense is placed directly upon the charcoal, where it melts to produce a sweet smelling smoke. This may be done several times during the religious service as the incense burns quite quickly. The thurible is swung by its chains to fan the charcoal, to produce copious smoke, and to distribute the smoke.

===Indian===
Incense sticks, also known as () and joss sticks, in which an incense paste is rolled or moulded around a bamboo stick, are the main forms of incense in India. The bamboo method originated in India and is distinct from the Nepali, Tibetan, and Japanese methods of stick making without bamboo cores.

The basic ingredients are the bamboo stick, the paste (generally made of charcoal dust and joss/jiggit/gum/tabu powder – an adhesive made from the bark of litsea glutinosa and other trees), and the perfume ingredients - which would be a masala (spice mix) powder of ground ingredients into which the stick would be rolled, or a perfume liquid sometimes consisting of synthetic ingredients into which the stick would be dipped. Perfume is sometimes sprayed on the coated sticks. Stick machines are sometimes used, which coat the stick with paste and perfume, though the bulk of production is done by hand rolling at home. There are about 5,000 incense companies in India that take raw unperfumed sticks hand-rolled by approximately 200,000 women working part-time at home, and then apply their own brand of perfume, and package the sticks for sale. An experienced home-worker can produce 4,000 raw sticks a day. There are about 50 large companies that together account for up to 30% of the market, and around 500 of the companies, including a significant number of the main ones, including Moksh Agarbatti, PremaNature, and Cycle Pure, are based in Mysore.

=== Jewish Temple in Jerusalem ===
Ketoret () was the incense offered in the Temple in Jerusalem and is stated in the Book of Exodus to be a mixture of stacte, onycha, galbanum and frankincense.

===Japanese===


In Japan incense appreciation folklore includes art, culture, history, and ceremony. Incense burning may occasionally take place within the tea ceremony, just like calligraphy, ikebana, and scroll arrangement. , the art of incense appreciation, is generally practiced as a separate art form from the tea ceremony, and usually within a tea room of traditional Zen design.

 and are the two most important ingredients in Japanese incense. The characters in agarwood mean &quot;incense that sinks in water&quot; due to the weight of the resin in the wood. Sandalwood is used in the Japanese tea ceremony. The most valued sandalwood comes from Mysore in the state of Karnataka in India.

Japanese incense companies divide agarwood into six categories depending on its properties and the region from which it is obtained. , a type of agarwood, is currently worth more than its weight in gold.

==Usage==
===Practical===


==== Odorizant ====
Incense fragrances can be of such great strength that they obscure less desirable odours. This utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay. An example, as well as of religious use, is the giant Botafumeiro thurible that swings from the ceiling of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. It is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired, unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.

A similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the post-Reformation Church of England. Although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the Oxford Movement, it was common to have incense (typically frankincense) burned before grand occasions, when the church would be crowded. The frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a &#x27;perfuming pan&#x27;. In iconography of the day, this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat, with a single long handle on one side. The perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible, as the latter would have likely offended the Protestant sensibilities of the 17th and 18th centuries.

Incense is also often used by people who smoke indoors and do not want the smell to linger.

Papier d&#x27;Arménie was originally sold as a disinfectant as well as for the fragrance.

==== Time-keeper ====

The regular burning of direct-burning incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks. These devices can range from a simple trail of incense material calibrated to burn in a specific time period, to elaborate and ornate instruments with bells or gongs, designed to involve multiple senses.

Incense clocks are used to time social, medical and religious practices in parts of eastern Asia. They are primarily used in Buddhism as a timer of meditation and prayer. Different types of incense burn at different rates; therefore, different incense are used for different practices. The duration of burning ranges from minutes to months.

==== Insect repellent ====
Incense made from materials such as citronella can repel mosquitoes and other irritating, distracting, or pestilential insects. This use has been deployed in concert with religious uses by Zen Buddhists, who claim that the incense that is part of their meditative practice is designed to keep bothersome insects from distracting the practitioner.

===Aesthetic===
Many people burn incense to appreciate its smell, without assigning any other specific significance to it; this is in the same way that certain items can be produced or consumed solely for the contemplation or enjoyment of the aroma. An example is the , where raw incense materials such as agarwood, which are frequently costly, are appreciated in a formal setting.

===Religious===
Religious use of incense is prevalent in many cultures and may have roots in the practical and aesthetic uses, considering that many of these religions have little else in common. One common motif is incense as a form of sacrificial offering to a deity. Such use was common in Judaic worship and remains in use for example in the Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches, Taoist and Buddhist Chinese (, &#x27;offer incense [to ancestors/gods]&#x27;), etc. Different cultures have associated rising sweet-smelling smoke with prayer - communication directed towards a deity on high.

===Aphrodisiac===
Incense has been used as an aphrodisiac in some cultures. Both ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian mythology suggest the usage of incense by goddesses and nymphs. Incense is thought to heighten sexual desires and sexual attraction. 

==Health risks from incense smoke==
Incense smoke contains various contaminants including gaseous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (), sulfur oxides (), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and adsorbed toxic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic metals). The solid particles range between around . In a comparison, Indian sandalwood was found to have the highest emission rate, followed by Japanese aloeswood, then Taiwanese aloeswood, while Chinese smokeless sandalwood had the least.

Research carried out in Taiwan in 2001 linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (including benzopyrene) within Buddhist temples. The study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes, which are carcinogenic and mutagenic, in incense smoke. A survey of risk factors for lung cancer, also conducted in Taiwan, noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung, though the finding was not deemed significant.

In contrast, epidemiologists at the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society, Aichi Cancer Center in Nagoya, and several other centers found: &quot;No association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough, chronic sputum, chronic bronchitis, runny nose, wheezing, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or pneumonia among the three populations studied: i.e. primary school children, their non-smoking mothers, or a group of older non-smoking female controls. Incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among non-smokers, but it significantly reduced risk among smokers, even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount.&quot; However, the researchers qualified their findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain low-cancer-risk dietary habits, and concluded that &quot;diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health.&quot;

Although several studies have not shown a link between incense and lung cancer, other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incense. A study published in 2008 in the medical journal &quot;Cancer&quot; found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract, with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer. Those who used incense heavily also were 80% more likely to develop squamous-cell carcinomas. The link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors, including cigarette smoking, diet and drinking habits. The research team noted that &quot;This association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke, and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense, these findings carry significant public health implications.&quot;

In 2015, the South China University of Technology found toxicity of incense to Chinese hamsters&#x27; ovarian cells to be even higher than cigarettes. Incensole acetate, a component of frankincense, has been shown to have anxiolytic-like and antidepressive-like effects in mice, mediated by activation of poorly-understood TRPV3 ion channels in the brain.

<doc id="175257" wikidata="Q2132397" url="?curid=175257" title="DX number">
<text>The DX number is a number which uniquely identifies the type and manufacturer (sensitizer) of a film emulsion. These DX numbers were assigned by the International Imaging Industry Association (I3A), which published and sold a proprietary list of DX numbers for APS and 135 film yearly or as needed. The last edition of the list, entitled &quot;DX Codes for 135-Size Film&quot;, was published in January 2009.

==DX number composition==
A DX number has two parts separated by a dash: &quot;CCC-SS&quot;
# &quot;CCC&quot; is the &quot;combination code&quot;, also known as &quot;DX Number Part 1&quot;, which identifies the manufacturer and emulsion type
# &quot;SS&quot; is the &quot;specifier number&quot;, or &quot;DX Number Part 2&quot;, which distinguishes between different varieties within the same family of emulsions
For example, Agfa Perutz 3-color ISO 200/24° film is assigned 115-4, while the equivalent Perutz 3-color ISO 100/21° film is assigned 115-3.

DX Part 1 numbers, from the 2008 DX Codes document:









==Encoding==
===DX film canister barcode===
The DX film canister barcode is printed in human-readable text and also represented as an Interleaved 2 of 5 barcode, located between the electrically read silver and black DX Camera Auto-Sensing Code and the film cartridge exit lip. The size and position conform to the ANSI/NAPM IT1.14:1994 standard. Some film-processing machines optically scan the barcode when the cartridge is inserted for developing.

This film canister barcode is a six-digit number in the format &quot;PHHHHE&quot;, where:
* &quot;P&quot; = proprietary prefix ranging from 0 to 9, assigned by the manufacturer
* &quot;HHHH&quot; = hashed DX number
* &quot;E&quot; = suffix identifying the number of exposures

For 135 film cartridges the DX number is hashed to produce the four-digit code &quot;HHHH&quot;. To generate this code, the combination code (aka DX Number Part 1) is multiplied by 16 and added to the specifier number (aka DX Number Part 2). The result is prefixed with zeroes, if necessary, to make four digits. For the Agfa film assigned DX number 115-4 above, the hashed 4-digit code would be 1844:

formula_1

The DX number can be recovered from the hashed code by dividing by 16, which gives the Part 1 number as the largest whole integer and the Part 2 number as the remainder:

formula_2

The suffix digit &quot;E&quot; is a code digit for the number of full-frame exposures: 1 is for 12 exposures, 2 for 20 exposures, 3 for 24, 4 for 36, 5 for 48, 6 for 60, 0 for 72 and 7 for non-standard lengths such as 24 + 3.

===DX film edge barcode===

Most film produced since 1983 contains barcodes along the bottom edge of the film, recorded in two parallel tracks. The upper track (closer to the sprocket holes) is called the &quot;clock track&quot; and the lower track (along the edge of the film) is called the &quot;data track&quot;; the data track contains the unhashed DX number. However, unlike the film canister DX number bar code, each frame or half-frame&#x27;s data track code does not provide information about the total number of frames available in the roll.

The data track consists of:
* A six-bit entry code
* A seven-bit film product class identification array (DX Number Part 1)
* One unassigned bit, left blank
* A four-bit film specifier array (DX Number Part 2)
* A six-bit frame number
* One bit to indicate if the position is a &quot;half-frame&quot;
* A second unassigned bit, left blank
* A parity bit
* A four-bit exit code
This information identifies manufacturers and chemistry associated with their various film types. If the manufacturer and type of film negative is unknown, the data track can be examined to identify this information. The frame number and half-frame indicator are extensions to the original data track, added by Kodak in 1990.

For each of the three encoded numerals, the most significant digit is on the left and the least significant digit is on the right; for example, the film class is a seven-bit number encoded in positions 2 through 8; position 8 is the least significant digit, and position 2 is the most significant digit. In this example, the binary number encoded (1001111) for the film class is equal to 79 (base-10). The parity bit is set or left blank to ensure the total number of &quot;1&quot; bits in positions 1 through 12 plus the parity bit is even. In this example, there are nine &quot;1&quot; bits in positions 1 through 12, so the parity bit is set.

<text>Quiévrain (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

On 1 January 2006, the municipality had 6,559 inhabitants. The total area is 21.22 km2, giving a population density of 309 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Audregnies, Baisieux, and Quiévrain.

Quiévrain is the border crossing point on the old main Paris-Brussels railway line. As a result, Belgians humorously refer to France (and vice versa) as &quot;outre-Quiévrain&quot; (&quot;beyond Quiévrain&quot;).

In the closing days of the First World War, Quiévrain was liberated by the Canadian Expeditionary Force on November 7, 1918, and marks the starting point of the Canadian Route of Remembrance in Belgium.

==Revolutions of 1848==
Shortly after the French Revolution of 1848, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Around 6,000 émigrés, coming from Paris, formed the &quot;Belgian Legion&quot;. The legion was armed by some of the administrative authorities of Lille, and intended to penetrate into Belgium to &quot;raise the people&quot; and overthrow the Belgian monarchy. It is likely that the revolutionaries had the support of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Second Republic, which had only recently been installed and was still very militant.

The first group, travelling by train, was stopped and quickly disarmed at Quiévrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed into Belgium and was defeated in the Risquons-Tout incident.

<text>Comines-Warneton (; ; ; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It is contiguous with the identically named Comines on the other side of the border with France.

On 1 January 2006 it had a total population of 17,562. Its total area is which gives a population density of . The name &quot;Comines&quot; is believed to have a Celtic, or Gaulish, origin. Comines-Warneton is a municipality with language facilities for Dutch-speakers.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bas-Warneton, Comines, Houthem, Ploegsteert, and Warneton (including the hamlet of Gheer). They were all transferred in 1963 from the arrondissement of Ypres in the Dutch-speaking province of West Flanders to the newly created arrondissement of Mouscron in French-speaking Hainaut. The five municipalities (Comines, Houthem, Ploegsteert, Bas-Warneton, Warneton) were merged into a single Comines-Warneton municipality in 1977. Since then, the municipality forms an exclave of both Hainaut and Wallonia, being surrounded by the Flemish province of West Flanders and the French department of Nord and not connected to the rest of the French-speaking area of Belgium.

Comines-Warneton is twinned with Hedge End in England and with Argenton-les-Vallées in France.

<text>Mouscron (; Dutch and , ; Picard and Walloon: &quot;Moucron&quot;) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Hainaut, along the border with the French city of Tourcoing, which is part of the Lille metropolitan area. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Dottignies, Herseaux, Luingne, and Mouscron. In accordance with the national law, the municipality offers facilities for the Dutch speaking minority. Kortrijk, in Flanders, is located just to the north of Mouscron.

The city substantially grew during the 19th and early 20th century with the development of the textile industry in the north of France. The symbol of the city is the Hurlu: a character representing Protestant activists, who plundered the countryside during the Wars of Religion (16th century).

== Geography ==
Mouscron is divided into 7 districts: the downtown (le centre), the train station (la gare), Mont-à-Leux, Tuquet, Risquons-Tout, Nouveau-Monde and Coquinie. The municipality of Mouscron now also includes the old municipalities of Dottignies, Luingne, and Herseaux since the Fusion of the Belgian municipalities. The metropolitan area of Mouscron forms a conurbation with the French metropolitan area of Lille and is at the crossroad of three different administrative regions: Wallonia, France and Flanders. Mouscron is located 9 km from Roubaix, 11 km from Kortrijk, 23 km from Lille and 25 km from Tournai. The city has been part of the French-speaking province of Hainaut since 1963 and, as a result, part of the administrative region of Wallonia.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

A few archaeological discoveries were made in this area proving the existence of settlements during Roman times. The name Dottignies – a village that is now part of Mouscron – appeared for the first time in the 9th century, while that of Mouscron only appeared in 1060. In 1066, Baldwin V, Count of Flanders ceded the local buildings and territories to the estate of the Church of Saint-Pierre in Lille. In 1149, the right to collect tithes in the Mouscron area was ceded in part to the Abbey of Saint Martin in Tournai, in part to the Chapter of the Tournai Cathedral. The rights to the neighbouring villages of Herseaux and Luingne – now also part of Mouscron – were also given to the Tournai Cathedral in 1178. In the 14th century, the Seigneury of Mouscron was eventually sold to a lord of Tournai, and in 1430, the Castle of the Counts (&quot;Château des Comtes&quot;) became the lord&#x27;s manor, which can still be seen today. The future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor stopped there for dinner on May 27, 1516.

===16th to 18th centuries===
In 1575, in the middle of the Wars of Religion, the castle was strengthened. It was nevertheless besieged and taken by the Geuzen, locally known as the &quot;Hurlus&quot; in 1579, before being taken back three months later. In 1627, Philip IV of Spain promoted the seigneury to the rank of county. The Franco-Dutch War under Louis XIV devastated this mostly agricultural region. Mouscron and the surrounding area became French after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). Part of it rejoined the Southern Netherlands after the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), which drew the frontier right through its territory. It was finally completely ceded to the Southern Netherlands under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The textile industry started in Mouscron in the 1760s thanks to the imposition by Lille of a ban on the fabrication of &quot;molletons&quot;, a mixture of flax and wool, in Roubaix and Tourcoing. With the Battle of Fleurus (1794), Mouscron went back to France.

===19th and 20th centuries===
At the beginning of the 19th century, the textile industry flourished and added cotton as one of its prime materials. On March 29, 1848, the Belgian army intervened near Mouscron against a troop of French republican sympathizers who were ready to invade Belgium, in what was known as the Risquons-Tout incident. By the end of the century, several cotton mills and carpet plants were built, leading the village to expand into a much larger urban area, especially after the close of World War I.

During World War II, from May 22 to 27, 1940, artillery fire brought British and German soldiers into conflict in the Risquons-Tout district. 15 British soldiers, 10 German soldiers and 5 civilians were killed in the incident.

In 1963, Mouscron was transferred from the province of West Flanders, to the province of Hainaut, to reflect the predominantly francophone population (94% in 1846 and 74% in 1947). Mouscron was officially recognized as a city in 1986.

==Sights==

*The town hall and the main square (&quot;Grand Place&quot;). The town hall was opened in 1890. It was designed by the architect René Aimé Buyck from Bruges and the style may be defined as neo gothic from maritime Flanders. The building is outstanding because of the harmony of its proportions and the fineness of its sculptures.
*The Saint-Barthélémy church
*The medieval castle known as the &quot;Château des Comtes&quot; can still be visited. The oldest extant parts date from the 15th century. Four families of lords lived in it during six centuries. From this big domain remains its courtyard marked by annexes from 16th to 17th centuries and moats.
*Mouscron&#x27;s public park dates back to the 1930s. With its ponds and manicured green areas, it is home to all the plant varieties that can be grown in the local climate and it extends over an area of 7 hectares. It was inaugurated in 1932 by Fernand Cocq.
*The house of Picardy (Maison Picarde). The building was built around 1922. The inside is worth visiting. The painted earthenware that adorns the main hall of the second story were classified as historical artifacts. They depict bucolic scenes which praise the values of socialism, work, empowerment, knowledge and family. They were made by the studio of Jules Biesbroek.
*The Urban Renewal (La Rénovation urbaine). At the beginning of 1980s, a big revitalization project was decided. The old Green Square was transformed and renamed Emmanuel de Neckere Square. The paving is worth looking at in more detail as it depicts the city&#x27;s motto: “Loyal to the King, up to carrying the beggar&#x27;s pouch” (French: “Fidèle au roy, jusqu’à porter la besace”). At the center of this modern atrium, you can see the fountain made by Bernard Verhaeghe, a local artist, in 1987.
*The olympic-size swimming pool (Les dauphins); 
*The cultural center (Marius Staquet); has 3 main facilities: the Raymond Devos theater, the André Demeyère auditorium and the Jacques Brel exhibition hall
*The exhibition hall (Centr’expo); hosts exhibitions, fairs and events
*The Art Gallery; set up in the old swimming pool
*The stadium (Cannonier); can hold 10,830 spectators
*The public library
*The El bar café; hosts concerts
*Studio RQC (Radio qui chifel); the independent radio station of the city

==Festivities==

*The Hurlus Festival (Fête des Hurlus): The Hurlus Festival happens every first weekend of October. On Friday evening, children from across the city gather on the main square for the lantern procession. Children are accompanied by fanfare, musicians and other traditional groups. They walk around the city and sing the main couplet of the traditional song. On Saturday, the inhabitants walk around the downtown to see traditional groups, majorettes, itinerant traders, musicians and craftsmen and a big bowls competition is organized. Then, the historical procession starts in the streets of the city. It is based on two main legendary events: the kidnapping of the Spanish-allied Adins vicar by the Hurlus and the fight in five trials between the Spanish leader (Don Ferrante de la Plancha y otros barrios) and the leader of the Hurlus. If the Hurlu leader wins the reenactment, little Hurlus dolls will be tossed into the crowd. Celebrations are in full swing to the beat of drums and trumpets until Sunday when Hurlus dolls are tossed from a raised platform on the main square.
*The Hand Festival () in Dottignies. Every third week-end of September, a company of Gilles roams the streets of the village and distributes the traditional oranges to passers-by. The festival takes its name from the copper hand, possibly a symbol of fraternity, which tops the steeple of the church of Dottignies. 
* A Christmas Market takes place every year on the &quot;main square&quot;.
*The &quot;vingt-quatre heure de Mouscron&quot; takes place every September. The ultimate goal of the event is to raise money for charity. The event includes groups of sportsmen running around the city for 24 hours.

== The musical period ==
From 1960 to 1980, the city experienced a vibrant period in the music industry.

The studio of Marcel De Keukeleire and Jean Van Loo produced famous European artists like Chocolat&#x27;s (Brasilia Carnaval), Patrick Hernandez (Born to Be Alive), Amadeo (Moving Like A Superstar), J.J. Lionel (Chicken dance) and the Crazy Horse band, which was partly made up of people from Mouscron.

In 1967, Jimi Hendrix gave his only Belgian concert at the Twenty club. Other artists of the 1960s to have performed in the club include: The Animals, The Small Faces, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, Gene Vincent, The Moody Blues. The latter stayed in Mouscron for the writing of their album “Days of Future Passed”. In 1978, their Song “Top rank suite” alludes to the city&#x27;s name with the sentence: “They played a good game of football in Mucron”. The Moody Blues were certainly fans of football but they blatantly forgot how to spell the city&#x27;s name.

Eventually, the beginning of the song “Les Bourgeois” of Jacques Brel, anecdotally mentions the name of “Adrienne du Mont-à-Leux”, who was the owner of a café in the city.

<text>is the protagonist of Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s Heian-era Japanese novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.&quot;Hikaru&quot; means &quot;shining&quot;, deriving from his appearance, hence he is known as the &quot;Shining Prince.&quot; He is portrayed as a superbly handsome man and a genius. Genji is the second son of a Japanese emperor, but he is relegated to civilian life for political reasons and lives as an imperial officer.

The first part of the story concentrates on his romantic life, and in the second, on his and others&#x27; internal agony. He appears from the first volume &quot;Kiritsubo&quot; to the 40th volume &quot;Illusion&quot;.

&quot;Genji&quot; is the surname of a noble demoted from royalty. His given name is never referred to in the story, as is the case with most other characters. He is also referred to as , sometimes abbreviated as . He is often called Genji.

Hikaru Genji was attractive and talented, easily gaining the favor of those around him at a young age. Describing his superlative qualities, Murasaki Shikibu wrote: &quot;but to recount all his virtues would, I fear, give rise to a suspicion that I distort the truth.&quot; His appearance tempted men and women alike, as he had smooth white skin, excellent fashion sense, which increased his fame and popularity.

The character of Hikaru Genji has had several adaptations in other media, from different iterations of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. He is depicted as possessing unrivaled beauty and charisma in all subsequent media adaptations.

While fictitious, Genji is thought to be inspired by historical figures, including Minamoto no Tōru, who was a grandson of Emperor Saga, hence one of the Saga Genji clan.

==Life of Hikaru Genji in &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;==

The ages of characters are counted in , as the story discusses.

It is common to divide the tale into three parts, and this article follows that custom, but the division is not made explicit in the original version of the story written by Lady Murasaki.

=== Part one ===
Hikaru Genji was born the second son of Emperor Kiritsubo (桐壺帝) by his lower ranked consort, . Genji had peerless beauty and genius, even from infancy, and was nicknamed &quot;the Shining Prince&quot;. His mother died when he was only three years old. The pursuit of the feminine ideal represented by his deceased mother is an important element that drives many of his subsequent romantic pursuits.

His father Emperor Kiritsubo considered appointing Hikaru the crown prince. He was however worried that his second son had no support from his maternal line. After being further discouraged by a fortuneteller&#x27;s prediction that the country would be thrown into chaos if Hikaru ascended to the throne, the Emperor lowered Hikaru&#x27;s rank to civilian, giving him the clan name Minamoto (Genji).

Utsusemi, the wife of the Iyo Deputy and stepmother of the Governor of Kii, is memorable as the first woman Genji courts in the tale and also, arguably, as the first to resist him. Frustrated because he cannot reach Utsusemi, Genji beds little Kogimi, Utsusemi&#x27;s younger brother, for Genji &quot;found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister,&quot; as a replacement for her. This episode constitutes the only open reference to homosexuality in the tale.

Genji adored his stepmother , a later favorite consort of Emperor Kiritsubo, because of her close resemblance to the dead Lady Kiritsubo, and that similarity was also the reason that Emperor Kiritsubo had her enter his court. As a result of Fujitsubo and Genji&#x27;s forbidden love, she bore a boy, later , to Genji when he is 19, but almost no one knew the truth of his birth, and the child was raised as a prince and son of Emperor Kiritsubo.

He had two wives in the legal sense during his life; he married Lady Aoi (Aoi no Ue､葵の上) in his youth, and much later 
(meaning &quot;The Third Princess&quot;, called so in Japanese, and known as Nyōsan in the Arthur Waley translation.) Lady Aoi died after she bore a son to Genji. But Genji&#x27;s de facto wife and most beloved one was Lady Murasaki, , a niece of Fujitsubo. Genji met her by chance when she was very young - at the age of 10, and when he was 18 years old. When her grandmother who brought her up died, and before her real father could take her to his mansion, Genji kidnapped Murasaki and brought her up himself. After Aoi died, Genji made her his unofficial wife. Although their marriage didn&#x27;t follow the whole protocol of official marriage, she received as many honours as the factual wife of Genji. But she officially remained his concubine, and that was one of the reasons Genji was offered the opportunity to marry the Third Princess in the second part of the story. Genji couldn&#x27;t reject this offer because of his affection for Fujitsubo, but Onna san no miya was so young that she turned out to be too naïve, and he was very disappointed and had many regrets.

Genji had many love affairs. He even made love to one of his brother&#x27;s de facto consorts . She was nominally the Head of Ladies-in-waiting and no official consort, but it was a scandal, and gave a pretext to political opponents. Genji moved to Suma, in Harima Province, before he could be expelled officially.

In Harima province, Genji met Lady Akashi and had a daughter by her. Later his brother Emperor Suzaku was afflicted by illness and feared it was a result of the wrath of his late father&#x27;s spirit, by his poor treatment of his brother, Genji. Genji was invited to return to Miyako (nowadays Kyoto). He left Lady Akashi and the child, and returned to Kyoto.

After Genji was back in Kyoto, Emperor Suzaku abdicated in favor of the crown prince (Reizei) who was really the son of Genji and Fujitsubo. This prince ascended to the throne, but he learned the secret of his birth by chance, and wanted to abdicate in favor of his real father, Genji. It was however impossible and as the second best, Emperor Reizei later gave Genji nearly the same rank as an abdicated emperor. After rising to this noblest rank, Genji was called , a name taken from his mansion.

Genji wanted his daughter to be the next Empress. He invited Lady Akashi and the child (known as Princess Akashi, 明石の姫君) to Kyoto. Later, Lady Murasaki adopted this girl and raised her. This girl later became a consort of the crown prince and eventually his empress.

=== Part two ===
At the age of forty, he married his niece Onna san no Miya, who was a daughter of his elder half-brother , and her mother was a lady whose half-sister was Empress Fujitsubo, hence another niece. This marriage did not make him happy. , a friend of his son , hence a nephew of Lady Aoi, lusted after Onna san no Miya and sought her love even after her marriage with Genji. Finally he intruded into Rokujoin and raped her. She bore a boy whose father was Kashiwagi. Genji later discovered the secret and became angry, but finally realized it was just what he had done to his father, and it was a punishment for his past treachery to his father and emperor. He decided to keep the secret of the birth of this boy and to bring him up as his real and third child.

After Lady Murasaki died, he became a monk and secreted himself in .

<doc id="175271" wikidata="Q3174329" url="?curid=175271" title="Yorick (programming language)">
<text>Yorick is an interpreted programming language designed for numerics, graph plotting, and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to array syntax, and extensible via C or Fortran routines. It was created in 1996 by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

== Features ==
=== Indexing ===
Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax.

Several elements can be accessed all at once:
&gt; x=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
&gt; x
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
&gt; x(3:6)
[3,4,5,6]
&gt; x(3:6:2)
[3,5]
&gt; x(6:3:-2)
[6,4]
;Arbitrary elements
&gt; x=1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x
1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x([2,1],[1,2])
2,1],[5,4
&gt; list=where(1&lt;x)
&gt; list
[2,3,4,5,6]
&gt; y=x(list)
&gt; y
[2,3,4,5,6]
;Pseudo-index

Like &quot;theading&quot; in PDL and &quot;broadcasting&quot; in Numpy, Yorick has a mechanism to do this:
&gt; x=[1,2,3]
&gt; x
[1,2,3]
&gt; y=1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; y
1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; y(-,)
[1],[2],[3,4],[5],[6]
&gt; x(-,)
1],[2],[3
&gt; x(,-)
1,2,3
&gt; x(,-)/y
1,1,1],[0,0,0
&gt; y=1.,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x(,-)/y
1,1,1],[0.25,0.4,0.5
;Rubber index

&quot;..&quot; is a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array.
&gt; x=1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x
1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x(..,1)
[1,2,3]
&gt; x(1..)
[1,4]
&gt; x(2..,2)
5
&quot;*&quot; is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector.
&gt; x(*)
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
;Tensor multiplication

Tensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick:

 P(,+, )*Q(, +)

means formula_1
&gt; x=1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; x
1,2,3],[4,5,6
&gt; y=7,8],[9,10],[11,12
&gt; x(,+)*y(+,)
39,54,69],[49,68,87],[59,82,105
&gt; x(+,)*y(,+)
58,139],[64,154

<text>The International Imaging Industry Association (I3A) was a trade association created by the merger of the Photographic and Imaging Manufacturers Association (PIMA) and the Digital Imaging Group (DIG) in 2001. It served the photographic industry, which included tracking the market size.

From 2001 through 2010, I3A also served as the sponsor for ANSI and ISO standards for photography, including the Picture Transfer Protocol (ISO 15740) as well as consortia standards such as the Internet Imaging Protocol.

I3A transferred the sponsorship of ANSI and ISO photographic standards to the Society for Imaging Science and Technology in January 2011, and had been disbanded as of October 2013.

==PIMA and NAPM==
The Photographic and Imaging Manufacturers Association, or PIMA, was founded in 1946 under the name National Association of Photographic Manufacturers (NAPM). In 1997 the name was changed to PIMA. NAPM and PIMA served as the sponsor for ANSI and ISO standards for photography from 1946 until 2001, when NAPM merged with DIG to become I3A.

<doc id="175275" wikidata="Q1502300" url="?curid=175275" title="The Tale of Genji (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Waki Yamato. It is a manga adaptation of Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, staying largely faithful to the original plot while incorporating some modern elements. The series was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazines &quot;Mimi&quot; and &quot;Minmi Excellent&quot; from 1979 to 1993, with its chapters compiled into 13 volumes. 

The first ten volumes focus on Hikaru Genji and his life, while the final three volumes shift to two princes—Lord Kaoru and Niou no Miya (the &quot;Royal Prince with Perfumes&quot;)—following Hikaru Genji&#x27;s death.

Kodansha International published four volumes of the series as part of its bilingual manga program from 2000 to 2001. Later, Kodansha USA released the manga digitally in ten volumes between 2019 and 2020.

An anime adaptation was initially planned to air on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block starting in January 2009. However, the producers decided to create the anime directly based on the original &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, resulting in the new title &quot;Genji Monogatari Sennenki&quot;.

The manga series has sold over 18 million copies.

==Characters==
;Hikaru Genji
:Hikaru Genji is a royal prince and the second son of Emperor Kiritsubo. Renowned for his beauty and excellence, he was often referred to as the &quot;Shining Prince.&quot; Due to his mother’s low rank as a concubine, the Emperor established a branch house for him called &quot;Gen&quot;. This effectively removed him from the royal family and stripped him of his right to inherit the throne. As a result, he was called &quot;Gen-ji&quot;, meaning &quot;shining Gen-ji&quot; (&quot;Hikaru Genji&quot;).
;Emperor Kiritsubo
:Emperor Kiritsubo is the father of Hikaru Genji. Although he wished for Genji to become his successor, it was not possible due to the low rank of Genji’s mother, Kiritsubo-koui. In contrast, the mother of his first son, Kokiden-nyougo, held a much higher rank.
;Kiritsubo-koui
:Kiritsubo-koui was a second-class concubine of Emperor Kiritsubo and the mother of Hikaru Genji. She was the Emperor&#x27;s most beloved, but the jealousy and resentment of the other concubines in the palace ultimately led to her untimely death.
;Kokiden-nyougo
:Kokiden-nyougo was a first-class concubine of Emperor Kiritsubo and the mother of his first royal prince, who later became Emperor Suzaku. She was the daughter of the Minister of the Right.
;Fujitsubo-nyougo
:Fujitsubo-nyougo was a royal princess and a first-class concubine of Emperor Kiritsubo. She bore a striking resemblance to the late Kiritsubo-koui, which endeared her to the Emperor, leading to her elevation as the Empress Consort (&quot;Chuuguu&quot;). Lord Genji also secretly loved and adored Fujitsubo, ultimately leading him to commit adultery with her.

<doc id="175279" wikidata="Q1428908" url="?curid=175279" title="Test Acts 1673 &amp; 1678">
<text>The Test Acts were a series of penal laws originating in Restoration England, passed by the Parliament of England, that served as a religious test for public office and imposed various civil disabilities on Catholics and nonconformist Protestants.

The underlying principle was that only people taking communion in the established Church of England were eligible for public employment, and the severe penalties pronounced against recusants, whether Catholic or nonconformist, were affirmations of this principle.

Although theoretically encompassing all who refuse to comply with Anglicanism in a dragnet approach, in practice the nonconformist Protestants had many defenders in Parliament and were often exempted from some of these laws through the regular passage of Acts of Indemnity: in particular, the Indemnity Act 1727 relieved Nonconformists from the requirements in the Test Act 1673 and the Corporation Act 1661 that public office holders must have taken the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper in an Anglican church.

An exception was at Oxbridge, where nonconformists and Catholics could not matriculate (Oxford) or graduate (Cambridge) until 1871.

Similar laws were introduced in Scotland with respect to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and also in Ireland, where the minority Anglican Church of Ireland had penal laws set up in its favour to allow the Anglo-Irish minority to maintain control of land, law and politics as part of the Protestant Ascendancy.

==Corporation Act 1661==

The Naturalisation and Restoration of Blood Act 1609 (7 Jas. 1. c. 2) provided that all such as were naturalized or restored in blood should receive the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (repealed by Naturalization Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 14)) but this did not affect most people born in England.

It was not, however, until the reign of Charles II that actually receiving communion in the Church of England was made a precondition for holding public office. The earliest imposition of this test was by the Corporation Act 1661 requiring that, besides taking the Oath of Supremacy, all members of corporations (i.e. municipal authorities) were, within one year after election, to receive the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper according to the rites of the Church of England. This was targeted at Presbyterians and other non-conformists following the English Civil War and Restoration, though also affected Roman Catholics.

==Test Act 1673==
The Corporation Act 1661 was followed by the Test Act 1673 (25 Cha. 2. c. 2) (the long title of which is &quot;An act for preventing dangers which may happen from popish recusants&quot;). This act enforced upon all persons filling any office, civil, military or religious, the obligation of taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance and subscribing to a declaration against transubstantiation and also of receiving the sacrament within three months after admittance to office. The oath for the Test Act 1673 was:
I, &quot;N&quot;, do declare that I do believe that there is not any transubstantiation in the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, or in the elements of the bread and wine, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever.

The act was passed in the parliamentary session that began on 4 February 1673 (Gregorian calendar). The act is, however, dated 1672 in some accounts due to the Julian calendar then in force in England.

One of the immediate reasons that the &quot;Country Party&quot; (proto-Whigs) in Parliament pushed for this was to break up the Cabal ministry — members of the Court Party of powerful statement under Charles II, who had divergent religious interests — the Catholic Lord Clifford could not accept this oath which ran contrary to his beliefs, so resigned his position in government and the Cabal ministry completely unravelled by 1674. Foreign nations and their agents also had a vested interest in lobbying either way on the issue, as the leaders of the Cabal ministry (Arlington and Clifford) were allied with Catholic France against the Protestant Dutch in the Third Anglo-Dutch War; after the fall of the Cabal ministry, the pro-Dutch First Danby ministry came to power. In addition to this, 1673 was also the year that it became public knowledge that James, Duke of York, heir to the throne, had converted to Catholicism.

==Test Act 1678==

Initially, the act did not extend to peers, but in 1678 the act was extended by a further act, the Parliament Act 1678 (30 Cha. 2. St. 2), which required that all peers and members of the House of Commons should make a declaration against transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrificial nature of the Mass. The effect of this was to exclude Catholics from both houses, and in particular the &quot;Five Popish Lords&quot; from the House of Lords, a change motivated largely by the alleged Popish Plot. The Lords deeply resented this interference with their membership; they delayed passage of the act as long as possible, and managed to greatly weaken it by including an exemption for the future James II, effective head of the Catholic nobility, at whom it was largely aimed.

==Scotland==
In Scotland, a religious test was imposed immediately after the Reformation, and by a 1567 law no one was to be appointed to a public office or to be a notary who did not profess Calvinism. The Scottish Test Act was passed in 1681 but rescinded in 1690. Later attempts to exclude Scotland from the English Test Acts were rejected by the Parliament of Scotland. In 1707, anyone bearing office in any university, college or school in Scotland was to profess and subscribe to the Confession of Faith. All persons were to be free of any oath or test contrary to or inconsistent with the Protestant religion and Presbyterian Church government. The reception of the Eucharist was never a part of the test in Scotland as it was in England and Ireland. The necessity for subscription to the Confession of Faith by persons holding a university office was removed by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1853. The act provided that in place of subscription every person appointed to a university office was to subscribe a declaration according to the form in the act, promising not to teach any opinions opposed to the divine authority of Scripture or to the Confession of Faith, and to do nothing to the prejudice of the Church of Scotland or its doctrines and privileges. All tests were finally abolished by an act of 1889.

==Repeals==

The necessity of receiving the sacrament as a qualification for office was repealed in Ireland in 1780 (19 &amp; 20 Geo. 3. c. 6 (I)) and by the Sacramental Test Act 1828 in England and Wales. Provisions requiring the taking of oaths and declarations against transubstantiation were repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. Sir Robert Peel took the lead for the government in the repeal and collaborated with Anglican Church leaders. The application of the 1828 and 1829 acts to Irish acts was uncertain and so the (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 62) repeated the 1829 repeal more explicitly.

The 1661, 1672 and 1678 acts were repealed by the Promissory Oaths Act 1871, the Statute Law Revision Act 1863 and the Parliamentary Oaths Act 1866 respectively. Religious tests for officers of the ancient universities were repealed by the Universities Tests Act 1871 for England, the University of Dublin Tests Act 1873, and the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889.

<text>The International Ski and Snowboard Federation, also known as FIS (), is the highest international governing body for skiing and snowboarding. It was previously known as the International Ski Federation () until 26 May 2022 when the name was changed to include snowboard.

Founded on 2 February 1924 in Chamonix, France during the inaugural Winter Olympic Games, FIS is responsible for the Olympic skiing disciplines, namely Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing, and snowboarding. The FIS is also responsible for setting the international competition rules. The organization has a membership of 132 national ski associations, and is based in Oberhofen am Thunersee, Switzerland.

== Most World Cup wins ==
At least 50 World Cup wins in all disciplines run by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation for men and women: 


==Ski disciplines==
The federation organises the following ski sport disciplines, for which it oversees the FIS Games as well as World Cup competitions and World Championships:



==FIS Congress history==

===Founding and the first years===

After ski club federations and national associations were created in Norway (1883 and 1908), Russia (1896), Bohemia and Great Britain (1903), Switzerland (1904), United States, Austria and Germany (all in 1905) and Sweden, Finland and Italy (all in 1908), and competitions had begun such as the Nordic Games, early international cross-country races (Adelboden, 1903), international participation at Holmenkollen (1903) and Club Alpin Français (CAF) International Winter Sports Weeks, an international Ski Congress was convened to develop standard rules for international competitive skiing.

The founding of a predecessor association, the International Ski Commission (CIS), was decided on February 18, 1910, in Christiania, Norway by delegates from ten countries to the first International Ski Congress. This Congress then met every year or so to hear from the CIS and refine and adopt rule changes. The commission was to consist of two members - a representative of Scandinavia and Central Europe. Ultimately, two Scandinavians sat on the commission. A year later, in March 1911, the first internationally valid set of rules was approved. At that time, the commission was enlarged to five members, and Oslo was elected as headquarters.

In 1913, the number of members of the commission was increased to seven: two Norwegians, two Swedes, a Swiss, a German and an Austrian.

On February 2, 1924, in Chamonix as part of the &quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot;, which was later to be recognized as the first Olympic Winter Games, 36 delegates from 14 countries (Great Britain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Yugoslavia, Norway, Poland, Romania, US, Switzerland, Sweden, Hungary and Italy) decided to found the FIS, which replaced the CIS.

Initially, the FIS was only responsible for Nordic skiing. FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1925 in Janské Lázně, Czechoslovakia, were given status as the first official World Championships. After the Scandinavian countries had relented, it was decided at the 11th FIS Congress (February 24–26, 1930 in Oslo) to also include alpine skiing (downhill, slalom and alpine combined) in the rules. This was upon a proposal by Great Britain, in which the British ski pioneer Arnold Lunn played a major role as co-founder of the Arlberg-Kandahar races. The simple sentence &quot;Downhill and slalom races may be organized&quot; was written into the rules - a sentence that was to change skiing in the long term. The first FIS Alpine World Ski Championships were held 19–23 February 1931 in Mürren, Switzerland.

Ski flying, a variation of ski jumping, was recognized as a discipline in 1938, but rules were not finalized until after World War II.

<doc id="175283" wikidata="Q610098" url="?curid=175283" title="Mesoamerican ballgame">
<text>The Mesoamerican ballgame (, , ) was a sport with ritual associations played since at least 1650 BC by the pre-Columbian people of Ancient Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modernized version of the game, &quot;ulama&quot;, is still played by the indigenous populations in some places.

The rules of the Mesoamerican ballgame are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were probably similar to racquetball, where the aim is to keep the ball in play. The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.

In the most common theory of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber and weighed as much as 9 lbs (4 kg), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.

The Mesoamerican ballgame had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events. Late in the history of the game, some cultures occasionally seem to have combined competitions with religious human sacrifice. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and may have been played by women as well as men.

Pre-Columbian ballcourts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as for example at Copán, as far south as modern Nicaragua, and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of Arizona. These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with slanted side-walls or vertical walls against which the balls could bounce.

==Name==
The Mesoamerican ballgame is known by a wide variety of names. In English, it is often called &quot;pok-ta-pok&quot; (or &quot;pok-a-tok&quot;). This term originates from a 1932 article by Danish archaeologist Frans Blom, who adapted it from the Yucatec Maya word . 

In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, it was called () or (). In Classical Maya, it was known as . In modern Spanish, it is called (&#x27;Maya ballgame&#x27;), (&#x27;Mesoamerican ballgame&#x27;), or simply (&#x27;Maya ball&#x27;).

==Origins==

It is not known precisely when or where the Mesoamerican ballgame originated, although it is likely that it originated earlier than 2000 BC in the low-lying tropical zones home to the rubber tree.

One candidate for the birthplace of the ballgame is the Soconusco coastal lowlands along the Pacific Ocean. Here, at Paso de la Amada, archaeologists have found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered, dated to approximately 1400 BC.

The other major candidate is the Olmec heartland, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec along the Gulf Coast. The Aztecs referred to their Postclassic contemporaries who then inhabited the region as the &quot;Olmeca&quot; (i.e. &quot;rubber people&quot;) since the region was strongly identified with latex production. The earliest-known rubber balls in the world come from the sacrificial bog at El Manatí, an early Olmec-associated site located in the hinterland of the Coatzacoalcos River drainage system.

Villagers, and archaeologists, have recovered a dozen balls ranging in diameter from 10 to 22 cm from the freshwater spring there. Five of these balls have been dated to the earliest-known occupational phase for the site, approximately 1700–1600 BC. These rubber balls were found with other ritual offerings buried at the site, indicating that even at this early date the game had religious and ritual connotations. A stone &quot;yoke&quot; of the type frequently associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts was also reported to have been found by local villagers at the site, leaving open the distinct possibility that these rubber balls were related to the ritual ballgame, and not simply an independent form of sacrificial offering.

Excavations at the nearby Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán have also uncovered a number of ballplayer figurines, radiocarbon-dated as far back as 1250–1150 BC. A rudimentary ballcourt, dated to a later occupation at San Lorenzo, 600–400 BC, has also been identified.

From the tropical lowlands, the game apparently moved into central Mexico. Starting around 1000 BC or earlier, ballplayer figurines were interred with burials at Tlatilco and similarly styled figurines from the same period have been found at the nearby Tlapacoya site. It was about this period, as well, that the so-called Xochipala-style ballplayer figurines were crafted in Guerrero. Although no ballcourts of similar age have been found in Tlatilco or Tlapacoya, it is possible that the ballgame was indeed played in these areas, but on courts with perishable boundaries or temporary court markers.

By 300 BC, evidence for the game appears throughout much of the Mesoamerican archaeological record, including ballcourts in the Central Chiapas Valley (the next oldest ballcourts discovered, after Paso de la Amada), and in the Oaxaca Valley, as well as ceramic ballgame tableaus from Western Mexico (see photo below).

==Material and formal aspects==
As might be expected with a game played over such a long period of time by many cultures, details varied over time and place, so the Mesoamerican ballgame might be more accurately seen as a family of related games.

In general, the hip-ball version is most popularly thought of as &quot;the&quot; Mesoamerican ballgame, and researchers believe that this version was the primary—or perhaps only—version played within the masonry ballcourt. Ample archaeological evidence exists for games where the ball was struck by a wooden stick (e.g., a mural at Teotihuacan shows a game which resembles field hockey), racquets, bats and batons, handstones, and the forearm, perhaps at times in combination. Each of the various types of games had its own size of ball, specialized gear and playing field, and rules.

Games were played between two teams of players. The number of players per team could vary, from two to four. Some games were played on makeshift courts for simple recreation while others were formal spectacles on huge stone ballcourts leading to human sacrifice.

Even without human sacrifice, the game could be brutal and there were often serious injuries inflicted by the solid, heavy ball. Today&#x27;s hip-&quot;ulama&quot; players are &quot;perpetually bruised&quot; while nearly 500 years ago Spanish chronicler Diego Durán reported that some bruises were so severe that they had to be lanced open. He also reported that players were even killed when the ball &quot;hit them in the mouth or the stomach or the intestines&quot;.

The rules of the Mesoamerican ballgame, regardless of the version, are not known in any detail. In contemporary &quot;ulama&quot;, the game resembles a netless volleyball, with each team confined to one half of the court. In the most widespread version of &quot;ulama&quot;, the ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one team fails to return it or the ball leaves the court.

In the Postclassic period, the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, the object being to pass the ball through one, an innovation that continued into the later Toltec and Aztec cultures.

In the 16th-century Aztec ballgame that the Spaniards witnessed, points were lost by a player who let the ball bounce more than twice before returning it to the other team, who let the ball go outside the boundaries of the court, or who tried and failed to pass the ball through one of the stone rings placed on each wall along the center line. According to 16th-century Aztec chronicler Motolinia, points were gained if the ball hit the opposite end wall, while the decisive victory was reserved for the team that put the ball through a ring. However, placing the ball through the ring was a rare event—the rings at Chichen Itza, for example, were set off the playing field—and most games were likely won on points.

===Clothing and gear===
The game&#x27;s paraphernalia—clothing, headdresses, gloves, all but the stone—are long gone, so knowledge on clothing relies on art—paintings and drawings, stone reliefs, and figurines—to provide evidence for pre-Columbian ballplayer clothing and gear, which varied considerably in type and quantity. Capes and masks, for example, are shown on several Dainzú reliefs, while Teotihuacan murals show men playing stick-ball in skirts.
The basic hip-game outfit consisted of a loincloth, sometimes augmented with leather hip guards. Loincloths are found on the earliest ballplayer figurines from Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, and the Olmec culture, are seen in the Weiditz drawing from 1528 (below), and, with hip guards, are the sole outfit of contemporary &quot;ulama&quot; players (above)—a span of nearly 3,000 years.

In many cultures, further protection was provided by a thick girdle, most likely of wicker or wood covered in fabric or leather. Made of perishable materials, none of these girdles have survived, although many stone &quot;yokes&quot; have been uncovered. Misnamed by earlier archaeologists due to its resemblance to an animal yoke, the stone yoke is thought to be too heavy for actual play and was likely used only before or after the game in ritual contexts. In addition to providing some protection from the ball, the girdle or yoke would also have helped propel the ball with more force than the hip alone. Additionally, some players wore chest protectors called &quot;palmas&quot; which were inserted into the yoke and stood upright in front of the chest.

Kneepads are seen on a variety of players from many areas and eras and are worn by forearm-&quot;ulama&quot; players today. A type of garter is also often seen, worn just below the knee or around the ankle—it is not known what function this served. Gloves appear on the purported ballplayer reliefs of Dainzú, roughly 500 BC, as well as the Aztec players are drawn by Weiditz 2,000 years later (see drawing below). Helmets, likely utilitarian, and elaborate headdresses, likely used only in ritual contexts, are common in ballplayer depictions. Headdresses are particularly prevalent on Maya painted vases or on Jaina Island figurines. Many ballplayers of the Classic era are seen with a right kneepad—no left—and a wrapped right forearm, as shown in the Maya image above.

=== Rubber black balls ===
The sizes or weights of the balls actually used in the ballgame are not known with any certainty. While several dozen ancient balls have been recovered, they were originally laid down as offerings in a sacrificial bog or spring, and there is no evidence that any of these were used in the ballgame. In fact, some of these extant votive balls were created specifically &quot;as&quot; offerings.

However, based on a review of modern-day game balls, ancient rubber balls, and other archaeological evidence, it is presumed by most researchers that the ancient hip-ball was made of a mix from one or another of the latex-producing plants found all the way from the southeastern rain forests to the northern desert. Most balls were made from latex sap of the lowland &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; tree. Someone discovered that by mixing latex with sap from the vine of a species of morning glory (&quot;Calonyction aculeatum&quot;) they could turn the slippery polymers in raw latex into a resilient rubber. The size varied between (measured in hand spans) and weighed . The ball used in the ancient handball or stick-ball game was probably slightly larger and heavier than a modern-day baseball.

Some Maya depictions, such as this relief, show balls or more in diameter. Academic consensus is that these depictions are exaggerations or symbolic, as are, for example, the impossibly unwieldy headdresses worn in the same portrayals.

=== Ballcourt ===


The game was played within a large masonry structure. Built in a form that changed remarkably little during 2,700 years, over 1,300 Mesoamerican ballcourts have been identified, 60% in the last 20 years alone. All ballcourts have the same general shape, a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces. The walls were often plastered and brightly painted. In early ballcourts the alleys were open-ended; later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an -shape when viewed from above.

While the length-to-width ratio remained relatively constant at about four-to-one, there was tremendous variation in ballcourt size: The playing field of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, by far the largest, measures , while the Ceremonial Court at Tikal was only .

Across Mesoamerica, ballcourts were built and used for many generations. Although ballcourts are found within most sizable Mesoamerican ruins, they are not equally distributed across time or geography. For example, the Late Classic site of El Tajín, the largest city of the ballgame-obsessed Classic Veracruz culture, has at least 18 ballcourts, and Cantona, a nearby contemporaneous site, sets the record with 24. In contrast, northern Chiapas and the northern Maya Lowlands have relatively few, and ballcourts are conspicuously absent at some major sites, including Teotihuacan, Bonampak, and Tortuguero, although Mesoamerican ballgame iconography has been found there.

Ancient cities with particularly fine ballcourts in good condition include Tikal, Yaxha, Copán, Coba, Iximche, Monte Albán, Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Yagul, Xochicalco, Mixco Viejo, and Zaculeu.

Ballcourts were public spaces used for a variety of elite cultural events and ritual activities like musical performances and festivals, and, of course, the ballgame. Pictorial depictions often show musicians playing at ballgames, and votive deposits buried at the Main Ballcourt at Tenochtitlan contained miniature whistles, ocarinas, and drums. A pre-Columbian ceramic from western Mexico shows what appears to be a wrestling match taking place on a ballcourt.

==Cultural aspects==

===Proxy for warfare===

The Mesoamerican ballgame was a ritual deeply ingrained in Mesoamerican cultures and served purposes beyond that of a mere sporting event. Fray Juan de Torquemada, a 16th-century Spanish missionary and historian, tells that the Aztec emperor Axayacatl played Xihuitlemoc, the leader of Xochimilco, wagering his annual income against several Xochimilco chinampas. Ixtlilxochitl, a contemporary of Torquemada, relates that Topiltzin, the Toltec king, played against three rivals, with the winner ruling over the losers.

These examples and others are cited by many researchers who have made compelling arguments that the game served as a way to defuse or resolve conflicts without genuine warfare, to settle disputes through a ballgame instead of a battle. Over time, then, the ballgame&#x27;s role would expand to include not only external mediation, but also the resolution of competition and conflict within the society as well.

This &quot;boundary maintenance&quot; or &quot;conflict resolution&quot; theory would also account for some of the irregular distribution of ballcourts. Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between the degree of political centralization and the number of ballcourts at a site. For example, the Aztec Empire, with a strong centralized state and few external rivals, had relatively few ballcourts while Middle Classic Cantona, with 24 ballcourts, had many diverse cultures residing there under a relatively weak state.

Other scholars support these arguments by pointing to the warfare imagery often found at ballcourts:

*The southeast panel of the South Ballcourt at El Tajín shows the protagonist ballplayer being dressed in a warrior&#x27;s garb.
*Captives are a prominent part of ballgame iconography. For example:
:::Several ceramic figurines show war captives holding game balls.
:::The ballcourt at Toniná was decorated with sculptures of bound captives.
:::A captive-within-the-ball motif is seen on the Hieroglyphic Stairs at Structure 33 in Yaxchilan and on Altar 8 at Tikal.
*The modern-day descendant of the ballgame, &quot;ulama&quot;, &quot;until quite recently was connected with warfare and many reminders of that association remain&quot;.

===Human sacrifice===

The association between human sacrifice and the ballgame appears rather late in the archaeological record, no earlier than the Classic era. The association was particularly strong within the Classic Veracruz and the Maya cultures, where the most explicit depictions of human sacrifice can be seen on the ballcourt panels—for example at El Tajín (850–1100 CE) and at Chichen Itza (900–1200 CE)—as well as on the decapitated ballplayer stelae from the Classic Veracruz site of Aparicio (700–900 CE). The Postclassic Maya religious and quasi-historical narrative, the Popol Vuh, also links human sacrifice with the ballgame (see below).

Captives were often shown in Maya art, and it is assumed that these captives were sacrificed after losing a rigged ritual ballgame. Rather than nearly nude and sometimes battered captives, the ballcourts at El Tajín and Chichen Itza show the sacrifice of practiced ballplayers, perhaps the captain of a team. Decapitation is particularly associated with the ballgame—severed heads are featured in much Late Classic ballgame art and appear repeatedly in the Popol Vuh. There has been speculation that the heads and skulls were used as balls.

===Symbolism===
Little is known about the game&#x27;s symbolic contents. Several themes recur in scholarly writing.

*Astronomy. The bouncing ball is thought to have represented the sun. The stone scoring rings are speculated to signify sunrise and sunset, or equinoxes.
*War. This is the most obvious symbolic aspect of the game (see also above, &quot;Proxy for warfare&quot;). Among the Mayas, the ball can represent the vanquished enemy, both in the late-Postclassic K&#x27;iche&#x27; kingdom (Popol Vuh), and in Classic kingdoms such as that of Yaxchilan.
*Fertility. Formative period ballplayer figurines—most likely females—often wear maize icons. At El Tajín, the ballplayer sacrifice ensures the renewal of pulque, an alcoholic maguey beverage.
*Cosmologic duality. The game is seen as a struggle between day and night, or a battle between life and the underworld. Courts were considered portals to the underworld and were built in key locations within the central ceremonial precincts. Playing ball engaged one in the maintenance of the cosmic order of the universe and the ritual regeneration of life.

====Nahua====
According to an important Nahua source, the Leyenda de los Soles, the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the Tlalocs, with precious stones and quetzal feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified the beginning of the end of the Toltec reign.

====Maya====
The Maya Twin myth of the Popol Vuh establishes the importance of the game (referred to in Classic Maya as &quot;pitz&quot;) as a symbol for warfare intimately connected to the themes of fertility and death. The story begins with the Hero Twins&#x27; father, Hun Hunahpu, and uncle, Vucub Hunahpu, playing ball near the underworld, Xibalba. The lords of the underworld became annoyed with the noise from the ball playing and so the primary lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, sent owls to lure the brothers to the ballcourt of Xibalba, situated on the western edge of the underworld. 

Despite the danger the brothers fall asleep and are captured and sacrificed by the lords of Xibalba and then buried in the ballcourt. Hun Hunahpu is decapitated and his head hung in a fruit tree, which bears the first calabash gourds. Hun Hunahpu&#x27;s head spits into the hands of a passing goddess who conceives and bears the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The Hero Twins eventually find the ballgame equipment in their father&#x27;s house and start playing, again to the annoyance of the Lords of Xibalba, who summon the twins to play the ballgame amidst trials and dangers. 

In one notable episode, Hunahpu is decapitated by bats. His brother uses a squash as Hunahpu&#x27;s substitute head until his real one, now used as a ball by the Lords, can be retrieved and placed back on Hunahpu&#x27;s shoulders. The twins eventually go on to play the ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba, defeating them. However, the twins are unsuccessful in reviving their father, so they leave him buried in the ball court of Xibalba.

==The ballgame in Mesoamerican civilizations==

=== Maya civilization ===
In Maya Ballgame, the Hero Twins myth links ballcourts with death and its overcoming. The ballcourt becomes a place of transition, a liminal stage between life and death. The ballcourt markers along the centerline of the Classic playing field depicted ritual and mythical scenes of the ballgame, often bordered by a quatrefoil that marked a portal into another world. The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the Classic forerunner of Vucub Caquix of the Copán ball court, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception.

===Teotihuacan===
No ballcourt has yet been identified at Teotihuacan, making it by far the largest Classic era site without one. In fact, the ballgame seems to have been nearly forsaken not only in Teotihuacan, but in areas such as Matacapan or Tikal that were under Teotihuacano influence.

Despite the lack of a ballcourt, ball games were not unknown there. The murals of the Tepantitla compound at Teotihuacan show a number of small scenes that seem to portray various types of ball games, including:
*A two-player game in an open-ended masonry ballcourt. (See third picture below.)
*Teams using sticks on an open field whose end zones are marked by stone monuments.
*Separate renditions of single players. (See first two details below.)

It has been hypothesized that, for reasons as yet unknown, the stick-game eclipsed the hip-ball game at Teotihuacan and at Teotihuacan-influenced cities, and only after the fall of Teotihuacan did the hip-ball game reassert itself.

===Aztec===
The Aztec version of the ballgame is called &quot;ōllamalitzli&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;ullamaliztli&quot;) and are derived from the word &quot;ōlli&quot; &quot;rubber&quot; and the verb &quot;ōllama&quot; or &quot;to play ball&quot;. The ball itself was called &quot;ōllamaloni&quot; and the ballcourt was called a &quot;tlachtli&quot;. In the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan the largest ballcourt was called &quot;Teotlachco&quot; (&quot;in the holy ballcourt&quot;)—here several important rituals would take place on the festivals of the month Panquetzalitzli, including the sacrifice of four war captives to the honor of Huitzilopochtli and his herald Paynal.

For the Aztecs, the playing of the ballgame also had religious significance, but where the 16th-century K´iche´ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may have seen it as a battle of the sun, personified by Huitzilopochtli, against the forces of night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess Coyolxauhqui and Coatlicue&#x27;s sons the 400 Huitznahuah. But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general, the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.

Young Aztecs would be taught ballplaying in the calmecac school—and those who were most proficient might become so famous that they could play professionally. Games would frequently be staged in the different city wards and markets—often accompanied by large-scale betting. According to Diego Durán, &quot;these wretches... sold their children in order to bet and even staked themselves and became slaves&quot;.

Since the rubber tree &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; was not found in the highlands of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs generally received balls and rubber as tribute from the lowland areas where it was grown. The &quot;Codex Mendoza&quot; gives a figure of 16,000 lumps of raw rubber being imported to Tenochtitlan from the southern provinces every six months, although not all of it was used for making balls.

In 1528, soon after the Spanish conquest, Cortés sent a troupe of &quot;ōllamanime&quot; (ballplayers) to Spain to perform for Charles V where they were drawn by the German Christoph Weiditz. Besides the fascination with their exotic visitors, the Europeans were amazed by the bouncing rubber balls.

===Pacific coast===

Ballcourts, monuments with ballgame imagery and ballgame paraphernalia have been excavated at sites along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador including the Cotzumalhuapa nuclear zone sites of Bilbao and El Baúl and sites right at the southeast periphery of the Mesoamerican region such as Quelepa.

===Caribbean===

Batey, a ball game played on many Caribbean islands in the West Indies, has been proposed as a descendant of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.

<text>In database theory, relational algebra is a theory that uses algebraic structures for modeling data and defining queries on it with well founded semantics. The theory was introduced by Edgar F. Codd.

The main application of relational algebra is to provide a theoretical foundation for relational databases, particularly query languages for such databases, chief among which is SQL. Relational databases store tabular data represented as relations. Queries over relational databases often likewise return tabular data represented as relations.

The main purpose of relational algebra is to define operators that transform one or more input relations to an output relation. Given that these operators accept relations as input and produce relations as output, they can be combined and used to express complex queries that transform multiple input relations (whose data are stored in the database) into a single output relation (the query results).

Unary operators accept a single relation as input. Examples include operators to filter certain attributes (columns) or tuples (rows) from an input relation. Binary operators accept two relations as input and combine them into a single output relation. For example, taking all tuples found in either relation (union), removing tuples from the first relation found in the second relation (difference), extending the tuples of the first relation with tuples in the second relation matching certain conditions, and so forth.

== Introduction ==
Relational algebra received little attention outside of pure mathematics until the publication of E.F. Codd&#x27;s relational model of data in 1970. Codd proposed such an algebra as a basis for database query languages.

Relational algebra operates on homogeneous sets of tuples formula_1 where we commonly interpret &quot;m&quot; to be the number of rows of tuples in a table and &quot;n&quot; to be the number of columns. All entries in each column have the same type.

A relation also has a unique tuple called the header which gives each column a unique name or attribute inside the relation. Attributes are used in projections and selections.

== Set operators ==

The relational algebra uses set union, set difference, and Cartesian product from set theory, and adds additional constraints to these operators to create new ones.

For set union and set difference, the two relations involved must be &quot;union-compatible&quot;—that is, the two relations must have the same set of attributes. Because set intersection is defined in terms of set union and set difference, the two relations involved in set intersection must also be union-compatible.

For the Cartesian product to be defined, the two relations involved must have disjoint headers—that is, they must not have a common attribute name.

In addition, the Cartesian product is defined differently from the one in set theory in the sense that tuples are considered to be &quot;shallow&quot; for the purposes of the operation. That is, the Cartesian product of a set of &quot;n&quot;-tuples with a set of &quot;m&quot;-tuples yields a set of &quot;flattened&quot; -tuples (whereas basic set theory would have prescribed a set of 2-tuples, each containing an &quot;n&quot;-tuple and an &quot;m&quot;-tuple). More formally, &quot;R&quot; × &quot;S&quot; is defined as follows:

formula_2

The cardinality of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities of its factors, that is, |&quot;R&quot; × &quot;S&quot;| = |&quot;R&quot;| × |&quot;S&quot;|.

A projection () is a unary operation written as formula_3 where formula_4 is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the set that is obtained when all tuples in &quot;R&quot; are restricted to the set formula_5.

Note: when implemented in SQL standard the &quot;default projection&quot; returns a multiset instead of a set, and the projection to eliminate duplicate data is obtained by the addition of the codice_1 keyword.

== Selection ==

A generalized selection (σ) is a unary operation written as formula_6 where is a propositional formula that consists of atoms as allowed in the normal selection and the logical operators (and), (or) and (negation). This selection selects all those tuples in &quot;R&quot; for which holds.

To obtain a listing of all friends or business associates in an address book, the selection might be written as formula_7. The result would be a relation containing every attribute of every unique record where is true or where is true.

== Rename ==

A rename (&quot;ρ&quot;) is a unary operation written as formula_8 where the result is identical to &quot;R&quot; except that the &quot;b&quot; attribute in all tuples is renamed to an &quot;a&quot; attribute. This is commonly used to rename the attribute of a relation for the purpose of a join.

To rename the &quot;isFriend&quot; attribute to &quot;isBusinessContact&quot; in a relation, formula_9 might be used.

There is also the formula_10 notation, where &quot;R&quot; is renamed to &quot;x&quot; and the attributes formula_5 are renamed to formula_12.

== Joins and join-like operators ==
=== Natural join ===
Natural join (⨝) is a binary operator that is written as (&quot;R&quot; ⨝ &quot;S&quot;) where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations. The result of the natural join is the set of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that are equal on their common attribute names. For an example consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their natural join:




Note that neither the employee named Mary nor the Production department appear in the result. Mary does not appear in the result because Mary&#x27;s Department, &quot;Human Resources&quot;, is not listed in the Dept relation and the Production department does not appear in the result because there are no tuples in the Employee relation that have &quot;Production&quot; as their DeptName attribute.

This can also be used to define composition of relations. For example, the composition of &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; is their join as shown above, projected on all but the common attribute &quot;DeptName&quot;. In category theory, the join is precisely the fiber product.

The natural join is arguably one of the most important operators since it is the relational counterpart of the logical AND operator. Note that if the same variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value (this is a consequence of the idempotence of the logical AND). In particular, natural join allows the combination of relations that are associated by a foreign key. For example, in the above example a foreign key probably holds from &quot;Employee&quot;.&quot;DeptName&quot; to &quot;Dept&quot;.&quot;DeptName&quot; and then the natural join of &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; combines all employees with their departments. This works because the foreign key holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the foreign key from &quot;Dept&quot;.&quot;Manager&quot; to &quot;Employee&quot;.&quot;Name&quot; then these columns must be renamed before taking the natural join. Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an equijoin.

More formally the semantics of the natural join are defined as follows:

where &quot;Fun(t)&quot; is a predicate that is true for a relation &quot;t&quot; (in the mathematical sense) iff &quot;t&quot; is a function (that is, &quot;t&quot; does not map any attribute to multiple values). It is usually required that &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; must have at least one common attribute, but if this constraint is omitted, and &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; have no common attributes, then the natural join becomes exactly the Cartesian product.

The natural join can be simulated with Codd&#x27;s primitives as follows. Assume that &quot;c&quot;1...,&quot;c&quot;&quot;m&quot; are the attribute names common to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, &quot;r&quot;1...,&quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; are the
attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;s&quot;1...,&quot;s&quot;&quot;k&quot; are the
attribute names unique to &quot;S&quot;. Furthermore, assume that the attribute names &quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; are neither in &quot;R&quot; nor in &quot;S&quot;. In a first step the common attribute names in &quot;S&quot; can be renamed:

Then we take the Cartesian product and select the tuples that are to be joined:

Finally we take a projection to get rid of the renamed attributes:

=== &quot;θ&quot;-join and equijoin ===
Consider tables &quot;Car&quot; and &quot;Boat&quot; which list models of cars and boats and their respective prices. Suppose a customer wants to buy a car and a boat, but she does not want to spend more money for the boat than for the car. The &quot;θ&quot;-join (⋈&quot;θ&quot;) on the predicate &quot;CarPrice&quot; ≥ &quot;BoatPrice&quot; produces the flattened pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate. When using a condition where the attributes are equal, for example Price, then the condition may be specified as &quot;Price&quot;=&quot;Price&quot;
or alternatively (&quot;Price&quot;) itself.




In order to combine tuples from two relations where the combination condition is not simply the equality of shared attributes it is convenient to have a more general form of join operator, which is the &quot;θ&quot;-join (or theta-join). The &quot;θ&quot;-join is a binary operator that is written as formula_13 or formula_14 where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are attribute names, &quot;θ&quot; is a binary relational operator in the set }, &quot;υ&quot; is a value constant, and &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations. The result of this operation consists of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that satisfy &quot;θ&quot;. The result of the &quot;θ&quot;-join is defined only if the headers of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot; are disjoint, that is, do not contain a common attribute.

The simulation of this operation in the fundamental operations is therefore as follows:
: &quot;R&quot; ⋈&quot;θ&quot; &quot;S&quot; = &quot;σθ&quot;(&quot;R&quot; × &quot;S&quot;)

In case the operator &quot;θ&quot; is the equality operator (=) then this join is also called an equijoin.

Note, however, that a computer language that supports the natural join and selection operators does not need &quot;θ&quot;-join as well, as this can be achieved by selection from the result of a natural join (which degenerates to Cartesian product when there are no shared attributes).

In SQL implementations, joining on a predicate is usually called an &quot;inner join&quot;, and the &quot;on&quot; keyword allows one to specify the predicate used to filter the rows. It is important to note: forming the flattened Cartesian product then filtering the rows is conceptually correct, but an implementation would use more sophisticated data structures to speed up the join query.

=== Semijoin ===

The left semijoin (⋉ and ⋊) is a joining similar to the natural join and written as formula_15 where formula_16 and formula_17 are relations. The result is the set of all tuples in formula_16 for which there is a tuple in formula_17 that is equal on their common attribute names. The difference from a natural join is that other columns of formula_17 do not appear. For example, consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their semijoin:




More formally the semantics of the semijoin can be defined as
follows:

formula_21

where formula_22 is as in the definition of natural join.

The semijoin can be simulated using the natural join as follows. If formula_23 are the attribute names of formula_16, then

formula_25

Since we can simulate the natural join with the basic operators it follows that this also holds for the semijoin.

In Codd&#x27;s 1970 paper, semijoin is called restriction.

=== Antijoin ===

The antijoin (▷), written as &quot;R&quot; ▷ &quot;S&quot; where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations, is similar to the semijoin, but the result of an antijoin is only those tuples in &quot;R&quot; for which there is &quot;no&quot; tuple in &quot;S&quot; that is equal on their common attribute names.

For an example consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their
antijoin:




The antijoin is formally defined as follows:

or

where is as in the definition of natural join.

The antijoin can also be defined as the complement of the semijoin, as follows:

Given this, the antijoin is sometimes called the anti-semijoin, and the antijoin operator is sometimes written as semijoin symbol with a bar above it, instead of ▷.

In the case where the relations have the same attributes (union-compatible), antijoin is the same as minus.

=== Division ===
The division (÷) is a binary operation that is written as &quot;R&quot; ÷ &quot;S&quot;. Division is not implemented directly in SQL. The result consists of the restrictions of tuples in &quot;R&quot; to the attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot;, i.e., in the header of &quot;R&quot; but not in the header of &quot;S&quot;, for which it holds that all their combinations with tuples in &quot;S&quot; are present in &quot;R&quot;.

==== Example ====



If &quot;DBProject&quot; contains all the tasks of the Database project, then the result of the division above contains exactly the students who have completed both of the tasks in the Database project.

More formally the semantics of the division is defined as follows:where {&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is the set of attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;t&quot;[&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;] is the restriction of &quot;t&quot; to this set. It is usually required that the attribute names in the header of &quot;S&quot; are a subset of those of &quot;R&quot; because otherwise the result of the operation will always be empty.

The simulation of the division with the basic operations is as follows. We assume that &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; are the attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;b&quot;1...,&quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; are the attribute names of &quot;S&quot;. In the first step we project &quot;R&quot; on its unique attribute names and construct all combinations with tuples in &quot;S&quot;:
: &quot;T&quot; := π&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) × &quot;S&quot;

In the prior example, T would represent a table such that every Student (because Student is the unique key / attribute of the Completed table) is combined with every given Task. So Eugene, for instance, would have two rows, Eugene → Database1 and Eugene → Database2 in T.

:: EG: First, let&#x27;s pretend that &quot;Completed&quot; has a third attribute called &quot;grade&quot;. It&#x27;s unwanted baggage here, so we must project it off always. In fact in this step we can drop &quot;Task&quot; from R as well; the multiply puts it back on.
:: &quot;T&quot; := πStudent(&quot;R&quot;) × &quot;S&quot; // This gives us every possible desired combination, including those that don&#x27;t actually exist in R, and excluding others (eg Fred | compiler1, which is not a desired combination)

 In the next step we subtract &quot;R&quot; from &quot;T&quot; 
relation:
: &quot;U&quot; := &quot;T&quot; − &quot;R&quot;
In &quot;U&quot; we have the possible combinations that &quot;could have&quot; been in &quot;R&quot;, but weren&#x27;t. 
:: EG: Again with projections — &quot;T&quot; and &quot;R&quot; need to have identical attribute names/headers.
:: &quot;U&quot; := &quot;T&quot; − πStudent,Task(&quot;R&quot;) // This gives us a &quot;what&#x27;s missing&quot; list.



 So if we now take the projection on the attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot;
then we have the restrictions of the tuples in &quot;R&quot; for which not
all combinations with tuples in &quot;S&quot; were present in &quot;R&quot;:
: &quot;V&quot; := π&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;U&quot;)
:: EG: Project &quot;U&quot; down to just the attribute(s) in question (Student) 
:: &quot;V&quot; := πStudent(&quot;U&quot;)

So what remains to be done is take the projection of &quot;R&quot; on its
unique attribute names and subtract those in &quot;V&quot;:
: &quot;W&quot; := π&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) − &quot;V&quot;
:: EG: &quot;W&quot; := πStudent(&quot;R&quot;) − &quot;V&quot;.



== Common extensions ==
In practice the classical relational algebra described above is extended with various operations such as outer joins, aggregate functions and even transitive closure.

=== Outer joins ===

Whereas the result of a join (or inner join) consists of tuples formed by combining matching tuples in the two operands, an outer join contains those tuples and additionally some tuples formed by extending an unmatched tuple in one of the operands by &quot;fill&quot; values for each of the attributes of the other operand. Outer joins are not considered part of the classical relational algebra discussed so far.

The operators defined in this section assume the existence of a &quot;null&quot; value, &quot;ω&quot;, which we do not define, to be used for the fill values; in practice this corresponds to the NULL in SQL. In order to make subsequent selection operations on the resulting table meaningful, a semantic meaning needs to be assigned to nulls; in Codd&#x27;s approach the propositional logic used by the selection is extended to a three-valued logic, although we elide those details in this article.

Three outer join operators are defined: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join. (The word &quot;outer&quot; is sometimes omitted.)

==== Left outer join ====

The left outer join (⟕) is written as &quot;R&quot; ⟕ &quot;S&quot; where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations. The result of the left outer join is the set of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that are equal on their common attribute names, in addition (loosely speaking) to tuples in &quot;R&quot; that have no matching tuples in &quot;S&quot;.

For an example consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their left outer join:




In the resulting relation, tuples in &quot;S&quot; which have no common values in common attribute names with tuples in &quot;R&quot; take a &quot;null&quot; value, &quot;ω&quot;.

Since there are no tuples in &quot;Dept&quot; with a &quot;DeptName&quot; of &quot;Finance&quot; or &quot;Executive&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;s occur in the resulting relation where tuples in &quot;Employee&quot; have a &quot;DeptName&quot; of &quot;Finance&quot; or &quot;Executive&quot;.

Let &quot;r&quot;1, &quot;r&quot;2, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the attributes of the relation &quot;R&quot; and let {(&quot;ω&quot;, ..., &quot;ω&quot;)} be the singleton
relation on the attributes that are &quot;unique&quot; to the relation &quot;S&quot; (those that are not attributes of &quot;R&quot;). Then the left outer join can be described in terms of the natural join (and hence using basic operators) as follows:

:formula_26

==== Right outer join ====
The right outer join (⟖) behaves almost identically to the left outer join, but the roles of the tables are switched.

The right outer join of relations &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; is written as &quot;R&quot; ⟖ &quot;S&quot;. The result of the right outer join is the set of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that are equal on their common attribute names, in addition to tuples in &quot;S&quot; that have no matching tuples in &quot;R&quot;.

For example, consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their right outer join:




In the resulting relation, tuples in &quot;R&quot; which have no common values in common attribute names with tuples in &quot;S&quot; take a &quot;null&quot; value, &quot;ω&quot;.

Since there are no tuples in &quot;Employee&quot; with a &quot;DeptName&quot; of &quot;Production&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;s occur in the Name and EmpId attributes of the resulting relation where tuples in &quot;Dept&quot; had &quot;DeptName&quot; of &quot;Production&quot;.

Let &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the attributes of the relation &quot;S&quot; and let {(&quot;ω&quot;, ..., &quot;ω&quot;)} be the singleton
relation on the attributes that are &quot;unique&quot; to the relation &quot;R&quot; (those that are not attributes of &quot;S&quot;). Then, as with the left outer join, the right outer join can be simulated using the natural join as follows:

:formula_27

==== Full outer join ====

The outer join (⟗) or full outer join in effect combines the results of the left and right outer joins.

The full outer join is written as &quot;R&quot; ⟗ &quot;S&quot; where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations. The result of the full outer join is the set of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that are equal on their common attribute names, in addition to tuples in &quot;S&quot; that have no matching tuples in &quot;R&quot; and tuples in &quot;R&quot; that have no matching tuples in &quot;S&quot; in their common attribute names.

For an example consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their full outer join:




In the resulting relation, tuples in &quot;R&quot; which have no common values in common attribute names with tuples in &quot;S&quot; take a &quot;null&quot; value, &quot;ω&quot;. Tuples in &quot;S&quot; which have no common values in common attribute names with tuples in &quot;R&quot; also take a &quot;null&quot; value, &quot;ω&quot;.

The full outer join can be simulated using the left and right outer joins (and hence the natural join and set union) as follows:

:&quot;R&quot; ⟗ &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;R&quot; ⟕ &quot;S&quot;) ∪ (&quot;R&quot; ⟖ &quot;S&quot;)

=== Operations for domain computations ===
There is nothing in relational algebra introduced so far that would allow computations on the data domains (other than evaluation of propositional expressions involving equality). For example, it is not possible using only the algebra introduced so far to write an expression that would multiply the numbers from two columns, e.g. a unit price with a quantity to obtain a total price. Practical query languages have such facilities, e.g. the SQL SELECT allows arithmetic operations to define new columns in the result SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_price FROM t, and a similar facility is provided more explicitly by Tutorial D&#x27;s codice_2 keyword. In database theory, this is called extended projection.

==== Aggregation ====
Furthermore, computing various functions on a column, like the summing up of its elements, is also not possible using the relational algebra introduced so far. There are five aggregate functions that are included with most relational database systems. These operations are Sum, Count, Average, Maximum and Minimum. In relational algebra the aggregation operation over a schema (&quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, ... &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is written as follows:

:formula_28

where each &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;&#x27;, 1 ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;, is one of the original attributes &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.

The attributes preceding the &quot;g&quot; are grouping attributes, which function like a &quot;group by&quot; clause in SQL. Then there are an arbitrary number of aggregation functions applied to individual attributes. The operation is applied to an arbitrary relation &quot;r&quot;. The grouping attributes are optional, and if they are not supplied, the aggregation functions are applied across the entire relation to which the operation is applied.

Let&#x27;s assume that we have a table named with three columns, namely and . We wish to find the maximum balance of each branch. This is accomplished by &quot;G&quot;Max()(). To find the highest balance of all accounts regardless of branch, we could simply write &quot;G&quot;Max()().

Grouping is often written as &quot;ɣ&quot;Max()() instead.

=== Transitive closure ===
Although relational algebra seems powerful enough for most practical purposes, there are some simple and natural operators on relations that cannot be expressed by relational algebra. One of them is the transitive closure of a binary relation. Given a domain &quot;D&quot;, let binary relation &quot;R&quot; be a subset of &quot;D&quot;×&quot;D&quot;. The transitive closure &quot;R+&quot; of &quot;R&quot; is the smallest subset of &quot;D&quot;×&quot;D&quot; that contains &quot;R&quot; and satisfies the following condition:

:formula_29

It can be proved using the fact that there is no relational algebra expression &quot;E&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) taking &quot;R&quot; as a variable argument that produces &quot;R&quot;+.

SQL however officially supports such fixpoint queries since 1999, and it had vendor-specific extensions in this direction well before that.

== Use of algebraic properties for query optimization ==
Relational database management systems often include a query optimizer which attempts to determine the most efficient way to execute a given query. Query optimizers enumerate possible query plans, estimate their cost, and pick the plan with the lowest estimated cost. If queries are represented by operators from relational algebra, the query optimizer can enumerate possible query plans by rewriting the initial query using the algebraic properties of these operators.

Queries can be represented as a tree, where
* the internal nodes are operators,
* leaves are relations,
* subtrees are subexpressions.

The primary goal of the query optimizer is to transform expression trees into equivalent expression trees, where the average size of the relations yielded by subexpressions in the tree is smaller than it was before the optimization. The secondary goal is to try to form common subexpressions within a single query, or if there is more than one query being evaluated at the same time, in all of those queries. The rationale behind the second goal is that it is enough to compute common subexpressions once, and the results can be used in all queries that contain that subexpression.

Here are a set of rules that can be used in such transformations.

=== Selection ===

Rules about selection operators play the most important role in query optimization. Selection is an operator that very effectively decreases the number of rows in its operand, so if the selections in an expression tree are moved towards the leaves, the internal relations (yielded by subexpressions) will likely shrink.

==== Basic selection properties ====

Selection is idempotent (multiple applications of the same selection have no additional effect beyond the first one), and commutative (the order selections are applied in has no effect on the eventual result).

#formula_30
#formula_31

==== Breaking up selections with complex conditions ====

A selection whose condition is a conjunction of simpler conditions is equivalent to a sequence of selections with those same individual conditions, and selection whose condition is a disjunction is equivalent to a union of selections. These identities can be used to merge selections so that fewer selections need to be evaluated, or to split them so that the component selections may be moved or optimized separately.

#formula_32
#formula_33

==== Selection and cross product ====
Cross product is the costliest operator to evaluate. If the input relations have &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; rows, the result will contain formula_34 rows. Therefore, it is important to decrease the size of both operands before applying the cross product operator.

This can be effectively done if the cross product is followed by a selection operator, e.g. formula_35. Considering the definition of join, this is the most likely case. If the cross product is not followed by a selection operator, we can try to push down a selection from higher levels of the expression tree using the other selection rules.

In the above case the condition &quot;A&quot; is broken up in to conditions &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; using the split rules about complex selection conditions, so that formula_36 and &quot;B&quot; contains attributes only from &quot;R&quot;, &quot;C&quot; contains attributes only from &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; contains the part of &quot;A&quot; that contains attributes from both &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot;. Note, that &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; are possibly empty. Then the following holds:
:formula_37

==== Selection and set operators ====
Selection is distributive over the set difference, intersection, and union operators. The following three rules are used to push selection below set operations in the expression tree. For the set difference and the intersection operators, it is possible to apply the selection operator to just one of the operands following the transformation. This can be beneficial where one of the operands is small, and the overhead of evaluating the selection operator outweighs the benefits of using a smaller relation as an operand.

#formula_38
#formula_39
#formula_40

==== Selection and projection ====

Selection commutes with projection if and only if the fields referenced in the selection condition are a subset of the fields in the projection. Performing selection before projection may be useful if the operand is a cross product or join. In other cases, if the selection condition is relatively expensive to compute, moving selection outside the projection may reduce the number of tuples which must be tested (since projection may produce fewer tuples due to the elimination of duplicates resulting from omitted fields).

:formula_41

=== Projection ===

==== Basic projection properties ====

Projection is idempotent, so that a series of (valid) projections is equivalent to the outermost projection.

:formula_42

==== Projection and set operators ====

Projection is distributive over set union.

:formula_43

Projection does not distribute over intersection and set difference. Counterexamples are given by:

:formula_44

:formula_45

and

:formula_46

:formula_47
where &quot;b&quot; is assumed to be distinct from .

=== Rename ===

==== Basic rename properties ====

Successive renames of a variable can be collapsed into a single rename. Rename operations which have no variables in common can be arbitrarily reordered with respect to one another, which can be exploited to make successive renames adjacent so that they can be collapsed.

#formula_48
#formula_49

==== Rename and set operators ====

Rename is distributive over set difference, union, and intersection.

#formula_50
#formula_51
#formula_52

=== Product and union ===

Cartesian product is distributive over union.

#formula_53

== Implementations ==

The first query language to be based on Codd&#x27;s algebra was Alpha, developed by Dr. Codd himself. Subsequently, ISBL was created, and this pioneering work has been acclaimed by many authorities as having shown the way to make Codd&#x27;s idea into a useful language. Business System 12 was a short-lived industry-strength relational DBMS that followed the ISBL example.

In 1998 Chris Date and Hugh Darwen proposed a language called Tutorial D intended for use in teaching relational database theory, and its query language also draws on ISBL&#x27;s ideas. Rel is an implementation of Tutorial D. Bmg is an implementation of relational algebra in Ruby which closely follows the principles of Tutorial D and &quot;The Third Manifesto&quot;.

Even the query language of SQL is loosely based on a relational algebra, though the operands in SQL (tables) are not exactly relations and several useful theorems about the relational algebra do not hold in the SQL counterpart (arguably to the detriment of optimisers and/or users). The SQL table model is a bag (multiset), rather than a set. For example, the expression formula_54 is a theorem for relational algebra on sets, but not for relational algebra on bags.

<text>Tuple calculus is a that was created and introduced by Edgar F. Codd as part of the relational model, in order to provide a declarative database-query language for data manipulation in this data model. It formed the inspiration for the database-query languages QUEL and SQL, of which the latter, although far less faithful to the original relational model and calculus, is now the de facto standard database-query language; a dialect of SQL is used by nearly every relational-database-management system. Michel Lacroix and Alain Pirotte proposed domain calculus, which is closer to first-order logic and together with Codd showed that both of these calculi (as well as relational algebra) are equivalent in expressive power. Subsequently, query languages for the relational model were called &quot;relationally complete&quot; if they could express at least all of these queries.

== Definition ==
=== Relational database ===

Since the calculus is a query language for relational databases we first have to define a relational database. The basic relational building block is the domain (somewhat similar, but not equal to, a data type). A tuple is a finite sequence of attributes, which are ordered pairs of domains and values. A relation is a set of (compatible) tuples. Although these relational concepts are mathematically defined, those definitions map loosely to traditional database concepts. A table is an accepted visual representation of a relation; a tuple is similar to the concept of a row.

We first assume the existence of a set &quot;C&quot; of column names, examples of which are &quot;name&quot;, &quot;author&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, etcetera. We define &quot;headers&quot; as finite subsets of &quot;C&quot;. A &quot;relational database schema&quot; is defined as a tuple &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) where &quot;D&quot; is the domain of atomic values (see relational model for more on the notions of &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;atomic value&quot;), &quot;R&quot; is a finite set of relation names, and

:&quot;h&quot; : &quot;R&quot; → 2&quot;C&quot;

a function that associates a header with each relation name in &quot;R&quot;. (Note that this is a simplification from the full relational model where there is more than one domain and a header is not just a set of column names but also maps these column names to a domain.) Given a domain &quot;D&quot; we define a &quot;tuple&quot; over &quot;D&quot; as a partial function that maps some column names to an atomic value in &quot;D&quot;. An example would be (name : &quot;Harry&quot;, age : 25).

:&quot;t&quot; : &quot;C&quot; ⇸ &quot;D&quot;

The set of all tuples over &quot;D&quot; is denoted as &quot;T&quot;&quot;D&quot;. The subset of &quot;C&quot; for which a tuple &quot;t&quot; is defined is called the &quot;domain&quot; of &quot;t&quot; (not to be confused with the domain in the schema) and denoted as &quot;dom&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

Finally we define a &quot;relational database&quot; given a schema &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) as a function

:&quot;db&quot; : &quot;R&quot; → 2&quot;T&quot;&quot;D&quot;

that maps the relation names in &quot;R&quot; to finite subsets of &quot;T&quot;&quot;D&quot;, such that for every relation name &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and tuple &quot;t&quot; in &quot;db&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) it holds that

:&quot;dom&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;r&quot;).

The latter requirement simply says that all the tuples in a relation should contain the same column names, namely those defined for it in the schema.

=== Atoms ===

For the construction of the formulas we will assume an infinite set &quot;V&quot; of tuple variables. The formulas are defined given a database schema &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) and a partial function &quot;type&quot; : &quot;V&quot; ⇸ 2&quot;C&quot;, called at &quot;type assignment&quot;, that assigns headers to some tuple variables. We then define the &quot;set of atomic formulas&quot; &quot;A&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] with the following rules:

# if &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, &quot;a&quot; in &quot;type&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;type&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) then the formula &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; is in &quot;A&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;],
# if &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, &quot;a&quot; in &quot;type&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) and &quot;k&quot; denotes a value in &quot;D&quot; then the formula &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;k&quot; is in &quot;A&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;], and
# if &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;type&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) then the formula &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) is in &quot;A&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;].

Examples of atoms are:

* (&quot;t&quot;.age = &quot;s&quot;.age) — &quot;t&quot; has an age attribute and &quot;s&quot; has an age attribute with the same value
* (&quot;t&quot;.name = &quot;Codd&quot;) — tuple &quot;t&quot; has a name attribute and its value is &quot;Codd&quot;
* Book(&quot;t&quot;) — tuple &quot;t&quot; is present in relation Book.

The formal semantics of such atoms is defined given a database &quot;db&quot; over &quot;S&quot; and a tuple variable binding &quot;val&quot; : &quot;V&quot; → &quot;T&quot;&quot;D&quot; that maps tuple variables to tuples over the domain in &quot;S&quot;:
# &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; is true if and only if &quot;val&quot;(&quot;v&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;val&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)(&quot;b&quot;)
# &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;k&quot; is true if and only if &quot;val&quot;(&quot;v&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;k&quot;
# &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) is true if and only if &quot;val&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) is in &quot;db&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)

=== Formulas ===

The atoms can be combined into formulas, as is usual in first-order logic, with the logical operators ∧ (and), ∨ (or) and ¬ (not), and we can use the existential quantifier (∃) and the universal quantifier (∀) to bind the variables. We define the &quot;set of formulas&quot; &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] inductively with the following rules:
# every atom in &quot;A&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;]
# if &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 are in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] then the formula &quot;f&quot;1 ∧ &quot;f&quot;2 is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;]
# if &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 are in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] then the formula &quot;f&quot;1 ∨ &quot;f&quot;2 is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;]
# if &quot;f&quot; is in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] then the formula ¬ &quot;f&quot; is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;]
# if &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, &quot;H&quot; a header and &quot;f&quot; a formula in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;[&quot;v&quot;-&gt;&quot;H&quot;]] then the formula ∃ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;], where &quot;type&quot;[&quot;v&quot;-&gt;&quot;H&quot;] denotes the function that is equal to &quot;type&quot; except that it maps &quot;v&quot; to &quot;H&quot;,
# if &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, &quot;H&quot; a header and &quot;f&quot; a formula in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;[&quot;v&quot;-&gt;&quot;H&quot;]] then the formula ∀ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) is also in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;]

Examples of formulas:

* &quot;t&quot;.name = &quot;C. J. Date&quot; ∨ &quot;t&quot;.name = &quot;H. Darwen&quot;
* Book(&quot;t&quot;) ∨ Magazine(&quot;t&quot;)
* ∀ &quot;t&quot; : {author, title, subject} ( ¬ ( Book(&quot;t&quot;) ∧ &quot;t&quot;.author = &quot;C. J. Date&quot; ∧ ¬ ( &quot;t&quot;.subject = &quot;relational model&quot;)))
Note that the last formula states that all books that are written by C. J. Date have as their subject the relational model. As usual we omit brackets if this causes no ambiguity about the semantics of the formula.

We will assume that the quantifiers quantify over the universe of all tuples over the domain in the schema. This leads to the following formal semantics for formulas given a database &quot;db&quot; over &quot;S&quot; and a tuple variable binding &quot;val&quot; : &quot;V&quot; -&gt; &quot;T&quot;&quot;D&quot;:

# &quot;f&quot;1 ∧ &quot;f&quot;2 is true if and only if &quot;f&quot;1 is true and &quot;f&quot;2 is true,
# &quot;f&quot;1 ∨ &quot;f&quot;2 is true if and only if &quot;f&quot;1 is true or &quot;f&quot;2 is true or both are true,
# ¬ &quot;f&quot; is true if and only if &quot;f&quot; is not true,
# ∃ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) is true if and only if there is a tuple &quot;t&quot; over &quot;D&quot; such that &quot;dom&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;H&quot; and the formula &quot;f&quot; is true for &quot;val&quot;[&quot;v&quot;-&gt;&quot;t&quot;], and
# ∀ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) is true if and only if for all tuples &quot;t&quot; over &quot;D&quot; such that &quot;dom&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;H&quot; the formula &quot;f&quot; is true for &quot;val&quot;[&quot;v&quot;-&gt;&quot;t&quot;].

=== Queries ===

Finally we define what a query expression looks like given a schema &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot;):

: { &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; | &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) }

where &quot;v&quot; is a tuple variable, &quot;H&quot; a header and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) a formula in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;S&quot;,&quot;type&quot;] where &quot;type&quot; = { (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;H&quot;) } and with &quot;v&quot; as its only free variable. The result of such a query for a given database &quot;db&quot; over &quot;S&quot; is the set of all tuples &quot;t&quot; over &quot;D&quot; with &quot;dom&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;H&quot; such that &quot;f&quot; is true for &quot;db&quot; and &quot;val&quot; = { (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) }.

Examples of query expressions are:

* { &quot;t&quot; : {name} | ∃ &quot;s&quot; : {name, wage} ( Employee(&quot;s&quot;) ∧ &quot;s&quot;.wage = 50.000 ∧ &quot;t&quot;.name = &quot;s&quot;.name ) }
* { &quot;t&quot; : {supplier, article} | ∃ &quot;s&quot; : {s#, sname} ( Supplier(&quot;s&quot;) ∧ &quot;s&quot;.sname = &quot;t&quot;.supplier ∧ ∃ &quot;p&quot; : {p#, pname} ( Product(&quot;p&quot;) ∧ &quot;p&quot;.pname = &quot;t&quot;.article ∧ ∃ &quot;a&quot; : {s#, p#} ( Supplies(&quot;a&quot;) ∧ &quot;s&quot;.s# = &quot;a&quot;.s# ∧ &quot;a&quot;.p# = &quot;p&quot;.p# ))) }

== Semantic and syntactic restriction ==
=== Domain-independent queries ===

Because the semantics of the quantifiers is such that they quantify over all the tuples over the domain in the schema it can be that a query may return a different result for a certain database if another schema is presumed. For example, consider the two schemas &quot;S1&quot; = ( &quot;D1&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot; ) and &quot;S2&quot; = ( &quot;D2&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot; ) with domains &quot;D1&quot; = { 1 }, &quot;D2&quot; = { 1, 2 }, relation names &quot;R&quot; = { &quot;r1&quot; } and headers &quot;h&quot; = { (&quot;r1&quot;, {&quot;a&quot;}) }. Both schemas have a common instance:
: &quot;db&quot; = { ( &quot;r1&quot;, { (&quot;a&quot;, 1) } ) }
If we consider the following query expression
: { &quot;t&quot; : {a} | &quot;t&quot;.a = &quot;t&quot;.a }
then its result on &quot;db&quot; is either { (a : 1) } under &quot;S1&quot; or { (a : 1), (a : 2) } under &quot;S2&quot;. It will also be clear that if we take the domain to be an infinite set, then the result of the query will also be infinite. To solve these problems we will restrict our attention to those queries that are &quot;domain independent&quot;, i.e., the queries that return the same result for a database under all of its schemas.

An interesting property of these queries is that if we assume that the tuple variables range over tuples over the so-called &quot;active domain&quot; of the database, which is the subset of the domain that occurs in at least one tuple in the database or in the query expression, then the semantics of the query expressions does not change. In fact, in many definitions of the tuple calculus this is how the semantics of the quantifiers is defined, which makes all queries by definition domain independent.

=== Safe queries ===

In order to limit the query expressions such that they express only domain-independent queries a syntactical notion of &quot;safe query&quot; is usually introduced. To determine whether a query expression is safe we will derive two types of information from a query. The first is whether a variable-column pair &quot;t&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is &quot;bound&quot; to the column of a relation or a constant, and the second is whether two variable-column pairs are directly or indirectly equated (denoted &quot;t&quot;.&quot;v&quot; == &quot;s&quot;.&quot;w&quot;).

For deriving boundedness we introduce the following reasoning rules:

# in &quot; &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; &quot; no variable-column pair is bound,
# in &quot; &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;k&quot; &quot; the variable-column pair &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is bound,
# in &quot; &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) &quot; all pairs &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; are bound for &quot;a&quot; in &quot;type&quot;(&quot;v&quot;),
# in &quot; &quot;f&quot;1 ∧ &quot;f&quot;2 &quot; all pairs are bound that are bound either in &quot;f&quot;1 or in &quot;f&quot;2,
# in &quot; &quot;f&quot;1 ∨ &quot;f&quot;2 &quot; all pairs are bound that are bound both in &quot;f&quot;1 and in &quot;f&quot;2,
# in &quot; ¬ &quot;f&quot; &quot; no pairs are bound,
# in &quot; ∃ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) &quot; a pair &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is bound if it is bound in &quot;f&quot; and &quot;w&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;v&quot;, and
# in &quot; ∀ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) &quot; a pair &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is bound if it is bound in &quot;f&quot; and &quot;w&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;v&quot;.

For deriving equatedness we introduce the following reasoning rules (next to the usual reasoning rules for equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity):

# in &quot; &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; &quot; it holds that &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; == &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot;,
# in &quot; &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; = &quot;k&quot; &quot; no pairs are equated,
# in &quot; &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) &quot; no pairs are equated,
# in &quot; &quot;f&quot;1 ∧ &quot;f&quot;2 &quot; it holds that &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; == &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; if it holds either in &quot;f&quot;1 or in &quot;f&quot;2,
# in &quot; &quot;f&quot;1 ∨ &quot;f&quot;2 &quot; it holds that &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; == &quot;w&quot;.&quot;b&quot; if it holds both in &quot;f&quot;1 and in &quot;f&quot;2,
# in &quot; ¬ &quot;f&quot; &quot; no pairs are equated,
# in &quot; ∃ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) &quot; it holds that &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; == &quot;x&quot;.&quot;b&quot; if it holds in &quot;f&quot; and &quot;w&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;v&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;v&quot;, and
# in &quot; ∀ &quot;v&quot; : &quot;H&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ) &quot; it holds that &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; == &quot;x&quot;.&quot;b&quot; if it holds in &quot;f&quot; and &quot;w&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;v&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;v&quot;.

We then say that a query expression { v : H | f(v) } is &quot;safe&quot; if
* for every column name &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot; we can derive that &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is equated with a bound pair in &quot;f&quot;,
* for every subexpression of &quot;f&quot; of the form &quot; ∀ &quot;w&quot; : &quot;G&quot; ( &quot;g&quot; ) &quot; we can derive that for every column name &quot;a&quot; in &quot;G&quot; we can derive that &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is equated with a bound pair in &quot;g&quot;, and
* for every subexpression of &quot;f&quot; of the form &quot; ∃ &quot;w&quot; : &quot;G&quot; ( &quot;g&quot; ) &quot; we can derive that for every column name &quot;a&quot; in &quot;G&quot; we can derive that &quot;w&quot;.&quot;a&quot; is equated with a bound pair in &quot;g&quot;.

The restriction to safe query expressions does not limit the expressiveness since all domain-independent queries that could be expressed can also be expressed by a safe query expression. This can be proven by showing that for a schema &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), a given set &quot;K&quot; of constants in the query expression, a tuple variable &quot;v&quot; and a header &quot;H&quot; we can construct a safe formula for every pair &quot;v&quot;.&quot;a&quot; with &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot; that states that its value is in the active domain. For example, assume that &quot;K&quot;={1,2}, &quot;R&quot;={&quot;r&quot;} and &quot;h&quot; = { (&quot;r&quot;, {&quot;a, &quot;b&quot;}) } then the corresponding safe formula for &quot;v&quot;.b is:
: &quot;v&quot;.b = 1 ∨ &quot;v&quot;.b = 2 ∨ ∃ &quot;w&quot; ( r(w) ∧ ( &quot;v&quot;.b = &quot;w&quot;.a ∨ &quot;v&quot;.b = &quot;w&quot;.b ) )
This formula, then, can be used to rewrite any unsafe query expression to an equivalent safe query expression by adding such a formula for every variable &quot;v&quot; and column name &quot;a&quot; in its type where it is used in the expression. Effectively this means that we let all variables range over the active domain, which, as was already explained, does not change the semantics if the expressed query is domain independent.

<text>Willem Drost (baptized 19 April 1633 – buried 25 February 1659) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and printmaker of history paintings and portraits.

==Biography==
He is a mysterious figure, closely associated with Rembrandt, with very few paintings clearly attributable to him.

He was presumably born in Amsterdam, in what was then known as the United Provinces of the Netherlands, but when and where is unknown. Around 1650, according to the early art historian Houbraken, he became a student of Rembrandt, eventually developing a close working relationship, painting history scenes, biblical compositions, symbolic studies of a solitary figure, as well as portraits. As a student, his 1654 painting titled &quot;Bathsheba&quot; was inspired by Rembrandt&#x27;s painting done in the same year on the same subject and given the same title, though their treatments are rather different; both Drost&#x27;s and Rembrandt&#x27;s paintings are in the Louvre in Paris.

Houbraken described him as a painter of historical allegories and a pupil of Rembrandt. Houbraken saw a &quot;Johannes Predicatie&quot; (Sermon of John) by him that was well composed and painted. He spent a long period in Rome where he became friends with Karel Lot and the well-to-do Utrecht painter Joan vander Meer, who had travelled to Italy in the company of the marine painter Lieve Verschuier in 1653 and became friends with him there.

He was in Amsterdam until 1655 and then travelled to Italy. He influenced the painter Adolf Boy.
Sometime in the mid-1650s, the young artist went to Rome, where, again according to Houbraken, he collaborated with the German artist Johann Carl Loth on a lost series of the Four Evangelists in Venice. He died in the latter city in 1659.

Willem Drost&#x27;s recognized lifetime output of artwork is very small, while Rembrandt is credited with more than 2,000 paintings and etchings, the majority of which are not signed. In recent years, some paintings attributed to Rembrandt have had their authenticity come under question. The importance of these Rembrandt works is such that the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project was established in Amsterdam to review the attribution of all of his works. Scholars have now reattributed a number of Rembrandt&#x27;s paintings to his pupils and associates.

==Legacy==

Drost was one of Rembrandt&#x27;s most talented disciples, so much so that his 1654 painting titled: &quot;Portrait of a Young Woman with her Hands Folded on a Book&quot; was one of the ones attributed to Rembrandt for more than 300 years. As well, when the portrait of a young man on horseback titled &quot;The Polish Rider&quot; was discovered in 1897, it too was attributed to Rembrandt. Acquired by New York City&#x27;s Frick Collection, &quot;The Polish Rider&quot; is one of the Frick Museum&#x27;s most valued treasures. For years, the painting&#x27;s subject matter and purpose was questioned by many scholars, led by the renowned expert Julius S. Held in 1944. Starting in 1984, in a movement led by Dr. Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project, some began to believe this great painting may also be that of Willem Drost as may be several others. The Frick Collection has not changed the attribution, and today it is generally believed that Rembrandt initiated the painting but had others help him finish it. These attributions remain controversial, but a reattribution of a group of &quot;Rembrandt&quot; drawings to Drost is more widely accepted.

<text>In science and philosophy, a paradigm ( ) is a distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitute legitimate contributions to a field. The word &quot;paradigm&quot; is Greek in origin, meaning &quot;pattern&quot;.

==Etymology==

&quot;Paradigm&quot; comes from Greek παράδειγμα (&quot;paradeigma&quot;); &quot;pattern, example, sample&quot;; from the verb παραδείκνυμι (&quot;paradeiknumi&quot;); &quot;exhibit, represent, expose&quot;; and that from παρά (&quot;para&quot;); &quot;beside, beyond&quot;; and δείκνυμι (&quot;deiknumi&quot;); &quot;to show, to point out&quot;.

In classical (Greek-based) rhetoric, a paradeigma aims to provide an audience with an illustration of a similar occurrence. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion; however, it is used to help guide them to get there.

One way of how a &quot;paradeigma&quot; is meant to guide an audience would be exemplified by the role of a personal accountant. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell a client exactly what (and what not) to spend money on, but to aid in guiding a client as to how money should be spent based on the client&#x27;s financial goals. Anaximenes defined &quot;paradeigma&quot; as &quot;actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing&quot;.

The original Greek term &quot;παράδειγμα&quot; (&quot;paradeigma&quot;) was used by scribes in Greek texts (such as Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot;Timaeus&quot; [ 360 BCE] and &quot;Parmenides&quot;) as one possibility for the model or the pattern that the demiurge supposedly used to create the cosmos. 

The English-language term &quot;paradigm&quot; has technical meanings in the fields of grammar (as applied, for example, to declension and conjugation – the 1900 &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; dictionary defines the technical use of &quot;paradigm&quot; only in the context of grammar) and of rhetoric (as a term for an illustrative parable or fable). In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) used &quot;paradigm&quot; to refer to a class of elements with similarities (as opposed to &quot;syntagma&quot; – a class of elements expressing relationship.).

The Merriam-Webster Online dictionary defines one usage of &quot;paradigm&quot; as &quot;a philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated; &quot;broadly: a philosophical or theoretical framework of any kind&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy&quot; (2008) attributes the following description of the term in the history and philosophy of science to Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s 1962 work &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;:
Kuhn suggests that certain scientific works, such as Newton&#x27;s Principia or John Dalton&#x27;s New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808), provide an open-ended resource: a framework of concepts, results, and procedures within which subsequent work is structured. Normal science proceeds within such a framework or paradigm. A paradigm does not impose a rigid or mechanical approach, but can be taken more or less creatively and flexibly.

==Scientific paradigm==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines a &quot;paradigm&quot; as &quot;a pattern or model, an exemplar; a typical instance of something, an example&quot;. The historian of science Thomas Kuhn gave the word its contemporary meaning when he adopted the word to refer to the set of concepts and practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period of time. In his book, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (first published in 1962), Kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as: &quot;universally recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners, i.e.,
* &quot;what&quot; is to be observed and scrutinized
* the kind of &quot;questions&quot; that are supposed to be asked and probed for answers in relation to this subject
* &quot;how&quot; these questions are to be structured
* &quot;what&quot; predictions made by the primary theory within the discipline
* &quot;how&quot; the results of scientific investigations should be interpreted
* &quot;how&quot; an experiment is to be conducted, and &quot;what&quot; equipment is available to conduct the experiment.

In &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, Kuhn saw the sciences as going through alternating periods of &quot;normal science&quot;, when an existing model of reality dominates a protracted period of puzzle-solving, and &quot;revolution&quot;, when the model of reality itself undergoes sudden drastic change. Paradigms have two aspects. Firstly, within normal science, the term refers to the set of exemplary experiments that are likely to be copied or emulated. Secondly, underpinning this set of exemplars are shared preconceptions, made prior to – and conditioning – the collection of evidence. These preconceptions embody both hidden assumptions and elements that Kuhn describes as quasi-metaphysical. The interpretations of the paradigm may vary among individual scientists.

Kuhn was at pains to point out that the rationale for the choice of exemplars is a specific way of viewing reality: that view and the status of &quot;exemplar&quot; are mutually reinforcing. For well-integrated members of a particular discipline, its paradigm is so convincing that it normally renders even the possibility of alternatives unconvincing and counter-intuitive. Such a paradigm is &quot;opaque&quot;, appearing to be a direct view of the bedrock of reality itself, and obscuring the possibility that there might be other, alternative imageries hidden behind it. The conviction that the current paradigm &quot;is&quot; reality tends to disqualify evidence that might undermine the paradigm itself; this in turn leads to a build-up of unreconciled anomalies. It is the latter that is responsible for the eventual revolutionary overthrow of the incumbent paradigm, and its replacement by a new one. Kuhn used the expression &quot;paradigm shift&quot; (see below) for this process, and likened it to the perceptual change that occurs when our interpretation of an ambiguous image &quot;flips over&quot; from one state to another. (The rabbit-duck illusion is an example: it is not possible to see both the rabbit and the duck simultaneously.) This is significant in relation to the issue of &quot;incommensurability&quot; (see below).

An example of a currently accepted paradigm would be the standard model of physics. The scientific method allows for orthodox scientific investigations into phenomena that might contradict or disprove the standard model; however grant funding would be proportionately more difficult to obtain for such experiments, depending on the degree of deviation from the accepted standard model theory the experiment would test for. To illustrate the point, an experiment to test for the mass of neutrinos or the decay of protons (small departures from the model) is more likely to receive money than experiments that look for the violation of the conservation of momentum, or ways to engineer reverse time travel.

Mechanisms similar to the original Kuhnian paradigm have been invoked in various disciplines other than the philosophy of science. These include: the idea of major cultural themes, worldviews (and see below), ideologies, and mindsets. They have somewhat similar meanings that apply to smaller and larger scale examples of disciplined thought. In addition, Michel Foucault used the terms episteme and discourse, mathesis, and taxinomia, for aspects of a &quot;paradigm&quot; in Kuhn&#x27;s original sense.

==Paradigm shifts==

In &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, Kuhn wrote that &quot;the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science&quot; (p. 12).

Paradigm shifts tend to appear in response to the accumulation of critical anomalies as well as in the form of the proposal of a new theory with the power to encompass both older relevant data and explain relevant anomalies. New paradigms tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, a statement generally attributed to physicist Lord Kelvin famously claimed, &quot;There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.&quot; Five years later, Albert Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which challenged the set of rules laid down by Newtonian mechanics, which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years. In this case, the new paradigm reduces the old to a special case in the sense that Newtonian mechanics is still a good model for approximation for speeds that are slow compared to the speed of light. Many philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn&#x27;s model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. Kuhn&#x27;s original model is now generally seen as too limited.

Some examples of contemporary paradigm shifts include:
* In medicine, the transition from &quot;clinical judgment&quot; to evidence-based medicine
* In social psychology, the transition from p-hacking to replication
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm
* In artificial intelligence, the transition from classical AI to data-driven AI

Kuhn&#x27;s idea was, itself, revolutionary in its time. It caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science; and, so, it may be that it caused (or was part of) a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift. Being in the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.
===Paradigm paralysis===
Perhaps the greatest barrier to a paradigm shift, in some cases, is the reality of &quot;paradigm paralysis&quot;: the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking. This is similar to what psychologists term confirmation bias and the Semmelweis reflex. Examples include rejection of Aristarchus of Samos&#x27;, Copernicus&#x27;, and Galileo&#x27;s theory of a heliocentric solar system, the discovery of electrostatic photography, xerography and the quartz clock.

==Incommensurability==

Kuhn pointed out that it could be difficult to assess whether a particular paradigm shift had actually led to progress, in the sense of explaining more facts, explaining more important facts, or providing better explanations, because the understanding of &quot;more important&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, etc. changed with the paradigm. The two versions of reality are thus &quot;incommensurable&quot;. Kuhn&#x27;s version of incommensurability has an important psychological dimension. This is apparent from his analogy between a paradigm shift and the flip-over involved in some optical illusions. However, he subsequently diluted his commitment to incommensurability considerably, partly in the light of other studies of scientific development that did not involve revolutionary change. One of the examples of incommensurability that Kuhn used was the change in the style of chemical investigations that followed the work of Lavoisier on atomic theory in the late 18th century. In this change, the focus had shifted from the bulk properties of matter (such as hardness, colour, reactivity, etc.) to studies of atomic weights and quantitative studies of reactions. He suggested that it was impossible to make the comparison needed to judge which body of knowledge was better or more advanced. However, this change in research style (and paradigm) eventually (after more than a century) led to a theory of atomic structure that accounts well for the bulk properties of matter; see, for example, Brady&#x27;s &quot;General Chemistry&quot;. According to P J Smith, this ability of science to back off, move sideways, and then advance is characteristic of the natural sciences, but contrasts with the position in some social sciences, notably economics.

This apparent ability does not guarantee that the account is veridical at any one time, of course, and most modern philosophers of science are fallibilists. However, members of other disciplines do see the issue of incommensurability as a much greater obstacle to evaluations of &quot;progress&quot;; see, for example, Martin Slattery&#x27;s &quot;Key Ideas in Sociology&quot;.

==Subsequent developments==
Opaque Kuhnian paradigms and paradigm shifts do exist. A few years after the discovery of the mirror-neurons that provide a hard-wired basis for the human capacity for empathy, the scientists involved were unable to identify the incidents that had directed their attention to the issue. Over the course of the investigation, their language and metaphors had changed so that they themselves could no longer interpret all of their own earlier laboratory notes and records.

===Imre Lakatos and research programmes===
However, many instances exist in which change in a discipline&#x27;s core model of reality has happened in a more evolutionary manner, with individual scientists exploring the usefulness of alternatives in a way that would not be possible if they were constrained by a paradigm. Imre Lakatos suggested (as an alternative to Kuhn&#x27;s formulation) that scientists actually work within research programmes. In Lakatos&#x27; sense, a research programme is a sequence of problems, placed in order of priority. This set of priorities, and the associated set of preferred techniques, is the positive heuristic of a programme. Each programme also has a negative heuristic; this consists of a set of fundamental assumptions that – temporarily, at least – takes priority over observational evidence when the two appear to conflict.

This latter aspect of research programmes is inherited from Kuhn&#x27;s work on paradigms, and represents an important departure from the elementary account of how science works. According to this, science proceeds through repeated cycles of observation, induction, hypothesis-testing, etc., with the test of consistency with empirical evidence being imposed at each stage. Paradigms and research programmes allow anomalies to be set aside, where there is reason to believe that they arise from incomplete knowledge (about either the substantive topic, or some aspect of the theories implicitly used in making observations).

===Larry Laudan: Dormant anomalies, fading credibility, and research traditions===
Larry Laudan has also made two important contributions to the debate. Laudan believed that something akin to paradigms exist in the social sciences (Kuhn had contested this, see below); he referred to these as research traditions. Laudan noted that some anomalies become &quot;dormant&quot;, if they survive a long period during which no competing alternative has shown itself capable of resolving the anomaly. He also presented cases in which a dominant paradigm had withered away because its lost credibility when viewed against changes in the wider intellectual milieu.

==In social sciences==
Kuhn himself did not consider the concept of paradigm as appropriate for the social sciences. He explains in his preface to &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; that he developed the concept of paradigm precisely to distinguish the social from the natural sciences. While visiting the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1958 and 1959, surrounded by social scientists, he observed that they were never in agreement about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods. He explains that he wrote this book precisely to show that there can never be any paradigms in the social sciences. Mattei Dogan, a French sociologist, in his article &quot;Paradigms in the Social Sciences&quot;, develops Kuhn&#x27;s original thesis that there are no paradigms at all in the social sciences since the concepts are polysemic, involving the deliberate mutual ignorance between scholars and the proliferation of schools in these disciplines. Dogan provides many examples of the non-existence of paradigms in the social sciences in his essay, particularly in sociology, political science and political anthropology.

However, both Kuhn&#x27;s original work and Dogan&#x27;s commentary are directed at disciplines that are defined by conventional labels (such as &quot;sociology&quot;). While it is true that such broad groupings in the social sciences are usually not based on a Kuhnian paradigm, each of the competing sub-disciplines may still be underpinned by a paradigm, research programme, research tradition, and/ or professional imagery. These structures will be motivating research, providing it with an agenda, defining what is and is not anomalous evidence, and inhibiting debate with other groups that fall under the same broad disciplinary label. (A good example is provided by the contrast between Skinnerian radical behaviourism and personal construct theory (PCT) within psychology. The most significant of the many ways these two sub-disciplines of psychology differ concerns meanings and intentions. In PCT, they are seen as the central concern of psychology; in radical behaviourism, they are not scientific evidence at all, as they cannot be directly observed.)

Such considerations explain the conflict between the Kuhn/ Dogan view, and the views of others (including Larry Laudan, see above), who do apply these concepts to social sciences.

Handa, M.L. (1986) introduced the idea of &quot;social paradigm&quot; in the context of social sciences. He identified the basic components of a social paradigm. Like Kuhn, Handa addressed the issue of changing paradigm; the process popularly known as &quot;paradigm shift&quot;. In this respect, he focused on social circumstances that precipitate such a shift and the effects of the shift on social institutions, including the institution of education. This broad shift in the social arena, in turn, changes the way the individual perceives reality.

Another use of the word &quot;paradigm&quot; is in the sense of &quot;worldview&quot;. For example, in social science, the term is used to describe the set of experiences, beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and responds to that perception. Social scientists have adopted the Kuhnian phrase &quot;paradigm shift&quot; to denote a change in how a given society goes about organizing and understanding reality. A &quot;dominant paradigm&quot; refers to the values, or system of thought, in a society that are most standard and widely held at a given time. Dominant paradigms are shaped both by the community&#x27;s cultural background and by the context of the historical moment. Hutchin outlines some conditions that facilitate a system of thought to become an accepted dominant paradigm:
* Professional organizations that give legitimacy to the paradigm
* Dynamic leaders who introduce and purport the paradigm
* Journals and editors who write about the system of thought. They both disseminate the information essential to the paradigm and give the paradigm legitimacy
* Government agencies who give credence to the paradigm
* Educators who propagate the paradigm&#x27;s ideas by teaching it to students
* Conferences conducted that are devoted to discussing ideas central to the paradigm
* Media coverage
* Lay groups, or groups based around the concerns of lay persons, that embrace the beliefs central to the paradigm
* Sources of funding to further research on the paradigm

==Other uses==
The word &quot;paradigm&quot; is also still used to indicate a pattern or model or an outstandingly clear or typical example or archetype. The term is frequently used in this sense in the design professions. Design Paradigms or archetypes comprise functional precedents for design solutions. The best known references on design paradigms are &quot;Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization&quot;, by Wake, and &quot;Design Paradigms&quot; by Petroski.

This term is also used in cybernetics. Here it means (in a very wide sense) a (conceptual) protoprogram for reducing the chaotic mass to some form of order. Note the similarities to the concept of entropy in chemistry and physics. A paradigm there would be a sort of prohibition to proceed with any action that would increase the total entropy of the system. To create a paradigm requires a closed system that accepts changes. Thus a paradigm can only apply to a system that is not in its final stage.

Beyond its use in the physical and social sciences, Kuhn&#x27;s paradigm concept has been analysed in relation to its applicability in identifying &#x27;paradigms&#x27; with respect to worldviews at specific points in history. One example is Matthew Edward Harris&#x27; book &quot;The Notion of Papal Monarchy in the Thirteenth Century: The Idea of Paradigm in Church History&quot;. Harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms, pointing towards Kuhn&#x27;s second edition of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Although obedience to popes such as Innocent III and Boniface VIII was widespread, even written testimony from the time showing loyalty to the pope does not demonstrate that the writer had the same worldview as the Church, and therefore pope, at the centre. The difference between paradigms in the physical sciences and in historical organisations such as the Church is that the former, unlike the latter, requires technical expertise rather than repeating statements. In other words, after scientific training through what Kuhn calls &#x27;exemplars&#x27;, one could not genuinely believe that, to take a trivial example, the earth is flat, whereas thinkers such as Giles of Rome in the thirteenth century wrote in favour of the pope, then could easily write similarly glowing things about the king. A writer such as Giles would have wanted a good job from the pope; he was a papal publicist. However, Harris writes that &#x27;scientific group membership is not concerned with desire, emotions, gain, loss and any idealistic notions concerning the nature and destiny of humankind...but simply to do with aptitude, explanation, [and] cold description of the facts of the world and the universe from within a paradigm&#x27;.

<doc id="175309" wikidata="Q1520790" url="?curid=175309" title="Bobbin">
<text>A bobbin or spool is a spindle or cylinder, with or without flanges, on which yarn, thread, wire, tape or film is wound. Bobbins are typically found in industrial textile machinery, as well as in sewing machines, fishing reels, tape measures, film rolls, cassette tapes, within electronic and electrical equipment, and for various other applications.

== Industrial textiles ==
Bobbins are used in spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, and lacemaking. In these practices, bobbins were invented to &quot;manage the piles of thread and yarn that would be mechanically woven into cloth,&quot; which would have originally been wound through the use of human power, but which eventually became machine-driven. In these applications, bobbins provide storage, temporary and permanent, for yarn or thread. Historically, bobbins were made out of natural materials such as wood, or bone. While not in principle an invention of the Victorian era - bobbins in the production of textiles were in earlier use - the machinery introduced in that era &quot;were some of [its] greatest inventions&quot; in that they &quot;helped to revolutionize textile manufacturing&quot;. In the machines used in such manufacturing,The automated weaving machines would have hundreds of spindles operating simultaneously, with each spindle holding a bobbin that either released or collected the thread. Most mills had wooden bobbins made specifically for their machinery, which accounts for the many varied shapes and sizes of these spools. In more modern times, natural bobbin materials such as wood are no longer used in textile manufacturing, instead having been replaced by metal and plastic. The traditional bobbins made, for instance, of hardwoods such as ash and birch are unsuitable for the machinery of modern manufacturing, given the higher speeds involved, and the synthetic materials that are used in weaving; as well, bobbins were relatively customised parts made for the specific machines of each mill (and so of varying designs, each uniquely shaped of wood, with metal parts in places of high wear), thus requiring &quot;a great deal of handwork&quot; such that the cost of continuing to make them was unfavorable to modern textile business. 

Since the retirement of the machinery involved, such bobbins and related parts have become items used in craft productions, given the numbers of distinct types, and the fact that &quot;[e]ach... has its own &#x27;battle scars&#x27; that give it unique character&quot;.

==Sewing and lacemaking==

===Sewing===

The lockstitch sewing machine, invented and developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, forms a stitch with two threads: one passed through a needle and another from a bobbin. Each thread stays on the same side of the material being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole thanks to the machine&#x27;s movement. Tension of the bobbin thread is maintained with a &quot;bobbin case&quot;, a metal enclosure with a leaf spring which keeps the thread taut. The bobbin case has to be free-floating (not attached to an axle) in order to allow the top thread to pass around the bobbin completely and hook the bobbin thread. 

Bobbins vary in shape and size, depending on the style of bobbin driver in the machine for which they are intended to be used. Long, narrow bobbins are used in early transverse shuttle and vibrating shuttle machines. These earlier movements were rendered obsolete by the invention of the rotary hook and the shuttle hook, which run faster and quieter with less air resistance. These shorter, wider bobbins are familiar to modern sewers, as the rotary/shuttle hook remains in use on modern machines essentially unchanged.

===Lacemaking===
Bobbin lace requires the winding of yarn onto a temporary storage spindle made of wood (or, in earlier times, bone) often turned on a lathe. Many lace designs require dozens of bobbins at any one time.

Both traditional and contemporary bobbins may be decorated with designs, inscriptions, or pewter or wire inlays. Often, bobbins are &#x27;spangled&#x27; to provide additional weight to keep the thread in tension. A hole is drilled near the base to enable glass beads and other ornaments to be attached by a loop of wire. These spangles provide a means of self-expression in the decoration of a tool of the craft. 

Antique and unique bobbins, sometimes spangled, are highly sought-after by antiques collectors.

== Electrical ==
In electrical applications, transformers, inductors, solenoids, and relay coils use bobbins as permanent containers for the wire to retain shape and rigidity, and to ease assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. (Such coils of wire carrying current create the induced currents and magnetic fields required in these devices.) 

Bobbins in these applications may be made of thermoplastic or thermosetting materials (for example, phenolics); this plastic often has to have a TÜV, UL, or other regulatory agency flammability rating for safety reasons. 

==Furniture==
Bobbin furniture (also known as spool furniture) is a style of table or chair with lathe-turned legs.

==Miscellaneous applications==
Bobbins are also used for fly tying and tidy storage without tangles.

<doc id="175310" wikidata="Q1412369" url="?curid=175310" title="Wavetable synthesis">
<text>Wavetable synthesis is a sound synthesis technique used to create quasi-periodic waveforms often used in the production of musical tones or notes.

== Development == 
Wavetable synthesis was invented by Max Mathews in 1958 as part of MUSIC II. MUSIC II “had four-voice polyphony and was capable of generating sixteen wave shapes via the introduction of a wavetable oscillator.”

Hal Chamberlin discussed wavetable synthesis in Byte&#x27;s September 1977 issue. Wolfgang Palm of Palm Products GmbH (PPG) developed his version in the late 1970s and published it in 1979. The technique has since been used as the primary synthesis method in synthesizers built by PPG and Waldorf Music and as an auxiliary synthesis method by Ensoniq and Access. It is currently used in hardware synthesizers from Waldorf Music and in software synthesizers for PCs and tablets, including apps offered by PPG and Waldorf, among others.

It was also independently developed by Michael McNabb, who used it in his 1978 composition &quot;Dreamsong&quot;.

== Principle ==

Wavetable synthesis is fundamentally based on periodic reproduction of multiple arbitrary, single-cycle waveforms. In wavetable synthesis, some method is employed to vary or modulate the selected waveform in the wavetable. The position in the wavetable selects the single cycle waveform. Digital interpolation between adjacent waveforms allows for dynamic and smooth changes of the timbre of the tone produced. Sweeping the wavetable in either direction can be controlled in a number of ways, for example, by use of an LFO, envelope, pressure or velocity.

Many wavetables used in PPG and Ensoniq synthesizers can simulate the methods used by analog synthesizers, such as pulse-width modulation by utilising a number of square waves of different duty cycles. In this way, when the wavetable is swept, the duty cycle of the pulse wave will appear to change over time. As the early Ensoniq wavetable synthesizers had non resonant filters (the PPG Wave synthesizers used Curtis analogue resonant filters), some wavetables contained highly resonant waveforms to overcome this limitation of the filters.

=== Confusion with sample-based synthesis (S&amp;S) and Digital Wave Synthesis ===

In 1992, with the introduction of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 the term &quot;wavetable&quot; started to be (incorrectly) applied as a marketing term to their sound card. However, these sound cards did not employ any form of wavetable synthesis, but rather PCM samples and FM synthesis.

S&amp;S (Sample and Synthesis) and Digital Wave Synthesis was the main method of sound synthesis utilised by digital synthesizers starting in the mid 1980s with synthesizers such as Sequential Circuits Prophet VS, Korg DW6000/8000 (DW standing for Digital Wave), Roland D50 and Korg M1 through to current synthesizers.

Ableton addressed some confusion in an article:
== User wavetables ==

The creation of new wavetables was previously a difficult process unless supported by specialized editing facilities and (near) real-time playback of edited wavetables on the synthesizer. Such editors often required the use of extra hardware devices like the PPG Waveterm or were only present in expensive models like the Waldorf WAVE. More commonly, pre-computed wavetables could be added via memory cards or sent to the synthesizer via MIDI. Today, wavetables can be created more easily by software and auditioned directly on a computer. Since all waveforms used in wavetable synthesis are periodic, the time-domain and frequency-domain representation are exact equivalents of each other and both can be used simultaneously to define waveforms and wavetables.

=== Practical use ===

During playback, the sound produced can be harmonically changed by moving to another point in the wavetable, usually under the control of an envelope generator or low frequency oscillator but frequently by any number of modulators (matrix modulation). Doing this modifies the harmonic content of the output wave in real time, producing sounds that can imitate acoustic instruments or be totally abstract, which is where this method of sound creation excels. The technique is especially useful for evolving synth pads, where the sound changes slowly over time.

It is often necessary to &#x27;audition&#x27; each position in a wavetable and to scan through it, forwards and backwards, in order to make good use of it, though selecting random wavetables, start positions, end positions and directions of scan can also produce satisfying musical results. It is worth noting that most wavetable synthesizers also employ other synthesis methods to further shape the output waveform, such as subtractive synthesis (filters), phase modulation, frequency modulation and AM (ring) modulation.

== Table-lookup synthesis ==

Table-lookup synthesis (or Wavetable-lookup synthesis) is a class of sound synthesis methods using the waveform tables by table-lookup, called &quot;table-lookup oscillator&quot; technique.
The length of waveforms or samples may be varied by each sound synthesis method, from a single-cycle up to several minutes.

=== Terminologies ===
The term &quot;&quot;waveform table&quot; (or &quot;wave shape table&quot;&quot; as equivalent) is often abbreviated to &quot;wavetable&quot;, and its derived term &quot;&quot;wavetable oscillator&quot; seems to be almost the same as &quot;table-lookup oscillator&quot;&quot; mentioned above, although the word &quot;wave&quot; (or &quot;waveform&quot;, &quot;wave shape&quot;) may possibly imply a nuance of single-cycle waveform.

However, the derived term &quot;&quot;wavetable synthesis&quot; seems slightly confused by the later developments of derived algorithm.

;(1) Wavetable synthesis:Its original meaning is essentially the same as &quot;table-lookup synthesis&quot;, and possibly several actions on waveform(s) may be expected. ⇒&quot;See&quot; (2), (3)

;(2) Wavetable-modification algorithm:For example, Karplus–Strong string synthesis is a simple class of &quot;&quot;wavetable-modification algorithm&quot; known as digital waveguide synthesis.

;(3) Multiple wavetable synthesis:In the late-1970s, Michael McNabb and Wolfgang Palm independently developed the multiple wavetable extension on the table-lookup synthesis which was typically used on PPG Wave and known as &quot;wavetable sweeping&quot;. Later, it was referred as &quot;multiple wavetable synthesis&quot;&quot; by .

;(4) Sample-based synthesis:Simultaneously, since the late-1970s, sample-based synthesis using relatively long samples instead of single-cycle waveforms has become pervasive due to the introduction of the Fairlight CMI and E-mu Emulator.

===Background===
On the above four terminologies for the classes of sound synthesis methods — &quot;i.e.&quot;, (1) &quot;Wavetable synthesis&quot;, (2) &quot;Wavetable-modification algorithm&quot;, (3) &quot;Multiple wavetable synthesis&quot;, and (4) &quot;Sample-based synthesis&quot; — 
if these had been appropriately used to distinguish each other, any confusions could be avoided, but it seems failed historically.
In the 1990s at the latest, several influential sample-based synthesis products were marketed under the trade names similar to &quot;wavetable synthesis&quot; (including Gravis Ultrasound wavetable card, Creative Wave Blaster wavetable daughterboard, and Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth), and these confusions have further affected industry standards (including MPEG-4 Structured Audio &quot;algorithmic and wavetable synthesis&quot;, and AC97 &quot;optional hw acceleration wavetable synth&quot;).
In the mid-2000s, confusion in terminology cropped up yet-again. A subclass of generic wavetable synthesis, &quot;i.e.&quot; McNabb and Palm&#x27;s multiple wavetable synthesis, tends to be erroneously referred as if it was a generic class of whole wavetable synthesis family, exclusively.

As a result, the difficulty of maintaining consistency between concepts and terminology during rapid technological development is noteworthy.
For this reason the term &quot;Table-lookup synthesis&quot; is explained at length in this article.

<doc id="175312" wikidata="Q161296" url="?curid=175312" title="Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine">
<text>Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (abbreviated as UDMH; also known as 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, heptyl or Geptil) is a chemical compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2 that is primarily used as a rocket propellant. At room temperature, UDMH is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammonia-like smell typical of organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is miscible with water, ethanol, and kerosene. At concentrations between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. 

Symmetrical dimethylhydrazine (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) also exists, but it is not as useful. UDMH can be oxidized in air to form many different substances, including toxic ones.

== Synthesis ==
In 1875, UDMH was first prepared by Emil Fischer, who discovered and named the class of hydrazines, by reducing N-Nitrosodimethylamine with zinc in boiling acetic acid. Fischer&#x27;s student Edward Renouf later studied UDMH more extensively as part of his doctoral dissertation. Other historical lab routes include methylation of hydrazine, reduction of nitrodimethylamine and amination of dimethylamine with aminopersulfuric acid.

UDMH is produced industrially by two routes. Based on the Olin Raschig process, one method involves reaction of monochloramine with dimethylamine giving 1,1-dimethylhydrazinium chloride:
:(CH3)2NH + NH2Cl → (CH3)2NNH2 ⋅ HCl

In the presence of suitable catalysts, acetylhydrazine can be N-dimethylated using formaldehyde and hydrogen to give the N,N-dimethyl-N&#x27;-acetylhydrazine, which can subsequently be hydrolyzed:
:CH3C(O)NHNH2 + 2CH2O + 2H2 → CH3C(O)NHN(CH3)2 + 2H2O
:CH3C(O)NHN(CH3)2 + H2O → CH3COOH + H2NN(CH3)2

== Uses ==
UDMH is often used in hypergolic rocket fuels as a bipropellant in combination with the oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide and less frequently with IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid) or liquid oxygen. UDMH is a derivative of hydrazine and is sometimes referred to as a hydrazine. As a fuel, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-25604 in the United States.

UDMH is stable and can be kept loaded in rocket fuel systems for long periods, which makes it appealing for use in many liquid rocket engines, despite its cost. In some applications, such as the OMS in the Space Shuttle or maneuvering engines, monomethylhydrazine is used instead due to its slightly higher specific impulse.
In some kerosene-fueled rockets, UDMH functions as a starter fuel to start combustion and warm the rocket engine prior to switching to kerosene.

UDMH has higher stability than hydrazine, especially at elevated temperatures, and can be used as its replacement or together in a mixture. UDMH is used in many European, Russian, Indian, and Chinese rocket designs. The Russian SS-11 Sego (aka 8K84) ICBM, SS-19 Stiletto (aka 15A30) ICBM, Proton, Kosmos-3M, R-29RMU2 Layner, R-36M, Rokot (based on 15A30) and the Chinese Long March 2 are the most notable users of UDMH (which is referred to as &quot;heptyl&quot; (codename from Soviet era) by Russian engineers). The Titan, GSLV, and Delta rocket families use a mixture of 50% hydrazine and 50% UDMH, called Aerozine 50, in different stages. There is speculation that it is the fuel used in the ballistic missiles that North Korea has developed and tested in 2017.

== Safety ==
Hydrazine and its methyl derivatives are toxic but LD50 values have not been reported. It is a precursor to dimethylnitrosamine, which is carcinogenic.
According to scientific data, usage of UDMH in rockets at Baikonur Cosmodrome has had adverse effects on the environment.
One such instance was the Nedelin catastrophe in 1960 when UDMH and dinitrogen tetroxide leaked from a rocket after an explosion and killed a number of bystanders through burn injuries and its toxicity.

<text>David Hampton (April 28, 1964 – July 18, 2003) was an American con artist and robber who became famous in the 1980s after he convinced a group of wealthy Manhattanites to give him money, food, and shelter under the pretense that he was the son of Sidney Poitier. David Hampton&#x27;s story became the inspiration for a play titled &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; and a film titled by the same name. David Hampton died of AIDS-related complications in 2003.

==Background==
Hampton was born in Buffalo, New York, and was the eldest son of an attorney. He moved to New York City (NYC) in 1981 and stumbled upon his now-famous ruse in 1983 when he and another man were attempting to gain entry into Studio 54. After the club denied Hampton and his partner entry, Hampton&#x27;s partner decided to pose as Gregory Peck&#x27;s son while Hampton assumed the identity of Sidney Poitier&#x27;s son. They were ushered in as celebrities. Thereafter, Hampton adopted the persona of &quot;David Poitier&quot; to obtain free meals in restaurants. He also persuaded at least a dozen well-off people to give him shelter and money, including Melanie Griffith, Gary Sinise, Calvin Klein, John Jay Iselin, the president of WNET; Osborn Elliott, the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism; Leonard Bernstein, and a Manhattan urologist. Hampton used different lies to fool his victims; he convinced some that he was an acquaintance of their children, some that he had just missed a plane to Los Angeles with his luggage still on it, and some that his belongings had been stolen in a mugging.

In October 1983, Hampton was arrested and convicted of fraud and ordered to pay restitution of $4,469 to his various victims. After refusing to comply with these terms, he was sentenced to a term of 18 months to four years in prison.

==&quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;==
Playwright John Guare became interested in Hampton&#x27;s story through his friendship with Inger McCabe Elliott and Osborn Elliott, who had been outraged to find &quot;David Poitier&quot; in bed with another man the morning after they let him into their home. &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; opened at the Lincoln Center in May 1990 and became a long-running success.

Hampton attempted to parlay the play&#x27;s success to his benefit, giving interviews to the press, gate-crashing a producer&#x27;s party, and beginning a campaign of harassment against Guare that included phone calls and death threats. The harassment campaign prompted Guare to apply for a restraining order in April 1991. The restraining order was denied. In the fall of 1991, Hampton filed a $100 million lawsuit, claiming that the play had infringed on the copyright on his persona and his story. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.

==Death==
David Hampton died of AIDS-related complications while being treated for his illness at Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC) in Manhattan.

<text>The revenge of the , also known as the or Akō vendetta, was a historical event in Japan in which a band of &quot;rōnin&quot; (lordless samurai) avenged the death of their former master on 31 January 1703. The incident has since become legendary. It is among the three major vengeance (&quot;adauchi&quot; 仇討ち) incidents in Japan, along with the Revenge of the Soga Brothers and the Igagoe vendetta.

The story tells of a group of samurai after their &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform &quot;seppuku&quot; (ritual suicide) for assaulting a powerful court official (&quot;kōke&quot;) named Kira Yoshinaka, after the court official insulted him. After waiting and planning for a year, the &quot;rōnin&quot; avenged their master&#x27;s honor by killing Kira. Anticipating the authorities&#x27; intolerance of the vendetta&#x27;s completion, they were prepared to face execution as a consequence. However, due to considerable public support in their favor, the authorities compromised by ordering the rōnin to commit &quot;seppuku&quot; as an honorable death for the crime of murder. This true story was popular in Japanese culture as emblematic of loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor (qualities samurai follow called &quot;bushidō&quot;) that people should display in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era, during which Japan underwent rapid modernisation, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.

Fictionalised accounts of the tale of the forty-seven rōnin are known as &quot;Chūshingura&quot;. The story was popularised in numerous plays, including in the genres of &quot;bunraku&quot; and &quot;kabuki&quot;. Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the &quot;Genroku&quot; era, which forbade the portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some, the first &quot;Chūshingura&quot; was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the &quot;Chūshingura&quot; survive.

The &quot;bakufu&quot; censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years after the events in question during the late 18th century when Japanologist Isaac Titsingh first recorded the story of the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; as one of the significant events of the &quot;Genroku&quot; era. To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on 14 December, Sengakuji Temple, where Asano Naganori and the &quot;rōnin&quot; are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.

==Name==
The event is known in Japan as the , sometimes also referred to as the &quot;Akō vendetta&quot;. The participants in the revenge are called the or in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the &quot;forty-seven rōnin&quot;. Literary accounts of the events are known as the .

==Story==
For many years, the version of events retold by A. B. Mitford in &quot;Tales of Old Japan&quot; (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the West. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven rōnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its details are now questioned. Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford&#x27;s work remains a conventional starting point for further study.

Whether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:
Mitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as &quot;proofs&quot; authenticating the factual basis of his story. These documents were:
# ...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira Kōtsukē no Sukē&#x27;s son in return for the head of their lord&#x27;s father, which the priests restored to the family.
# ...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men, dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.
# ...a paper which the Forty-seven Rōnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké.

===Background===
In 1701, two &quot;daimyō&quot;, Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori, the young &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Akō Domain (a small fiefdom in western Honshū), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the Tsuwano Domain, were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of Emperor Higashiyama at Edo Castle, during their &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; service to the &quot;shōgun&quot;.

Asano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi&#x27;s shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly moral Confucian. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific &quot;bakufu&quot; duties, offence was taken.

Initially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei&#x27;s quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.

However, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the &quot;Matsu no Ōrōka&quot;, the main grand corridor that interconnects the &quot;Shiro-shoin&quot; (白書院) and the &quot;Ōhiroma&quot; of the &quot;Honmaru Goten&quot; (本丸御殿) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.

Kira&#x27;s wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a katana, was completely forbidden in Edo Castle. The &quot;daimyō&quot; of Akō had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by &quot;seppuku&quot;. Asano&#x27;s goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made &quot;rōnin&quot; (leaderless).

This news was carried to Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, Asano&#x27;s principal counsellor (&quot;karō&quot;), who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with &quot;bakufu&quot; orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.

===Attack===
After two years, when Ōishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard, and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.

The Ako Incident occurred on 31 January 1703 when the &quot;rōnin&quot; of Asano Naganori stormed the residence of Kira Yoshinaka in Edo. (While the attack was carried out on 31 January, the event is commemorated annually on 14 December in Japan.) According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by Ōishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, Ōishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.

Once Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master&#x27;s tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death. All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which Ōishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.

Ōishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter&#x27;s lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there. He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the &quot;rōnin&quot; climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge (katakiuchi, 敵討ち). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.

After posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, Ōishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira&#x27;s retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but Ōishi Chikara&#x27;s party broke into the back of the house.

Kira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.

Eventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira&#x27;s retainers were subdued; in the process, the &quot;rōnin&quot; killed 16 of Kira&#x27;s men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but Ōishi checked Kira&#x27;s bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.

===Death of Kira===
A renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed. He refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The &quot;rōnin&quot; gathered, and Ōishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira—as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano&#x27;s attack.

Ōishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira&#x27;s high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. Ōishi indicated he personally would act as a &quot;kaishakunin&quot; (&quot;second&quot;, the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself. However, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, Ōishi ordered the other &quot;rōnin&quot; to pin him down and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger. They then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira&#x27;s head.

One of the &quot;rōnin&quot;, the &quot;ashigaru&quot; Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Akō and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon&#x27;s role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the &quot;rōnin&quot; turned themselves in.)

===Aftermath===

As day was breaking, they quickly carried Kira&#x27;s head from his residence to their lord&#x27;s grave in Sengaku-ji temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.

On arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 &quot;rōnin&quot; (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira&#x27;s head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano&#x27;s tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple and gave the abbot of the temple all of the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently and offer prayers and requiems for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different &quot;daimyō&quot;. During this time, two of Kira&#x27;s friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.

The shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate&#x27;s authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the &quot;shōgun&quot; received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the &quot;rōnin&quot;. As expected, the &quot;rōnin&quot; were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the &quot;shōgun&quot; finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit &quot;seppuku&quot; instead of having them executed as criminals. Each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion. Ōishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed &quot;seppuku&quot;.

Each of the 46 &quot;rōnin&quot; killed himself in . This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the &quot;forty-six rōnin&quot;; this refers to the group put to death by the &quot;shōgun&quot;, while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh &quot;rōnin&quot;, identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the &quot;shōgun&quot; (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by &quot;seppuku&quot; were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji, in front of the tomb of their master. The clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any.

The tombs at Sengaku-ji became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.

===Members===

Below are the names of the 47 &quot;rōnin&quot; in the following form: family name – pseudonym (&quot;kemyō&quot;) – real name (&quot;imina&quot;). Alternative readings are listed in italics.
==Criticism==
The &quot;rōnin&quot; spent more than 14 months waiting for the &quot;right time&quot; for their revenge. It was Yamamoto Tsunetomo, author of the &quot;Hagakure&quot;, who asked the well known question: &quot;What if, nine months after Asano&#x27;s death, Kira had died of an illness?&quot; His answer was that the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the &quot;rōnin&quot; to do, writes Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano&#x27;s death. The &quot;rōnin&quot; would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.

Ōishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.

==In the arts==
The tragedy of the forty-seven rōnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.

Immediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master&#x27;s last wishes, the &quot;rōnin&quot; had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one&#x27;s master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.

===Plays===
The incident immediately inspired a succession of &quot;kabuki&quot; and &quot;bunraku&quot; plays; the first, &quot;The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga&quot;, appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in Osaka and Kyoto, farther away from the shogunal capital. Some even took the story as far as Manila, to spread the story to the rest of Asia.

The most successful of the adaptations was a &quot;bunraku&quot; puppet play called &quot;Kanadehon Chūshingura&quot; (now simply called &quot;Chūshingura&quot;, or &quot;Treasury of Loyal Retainers&quot;), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a &quot;kabuki&quot; play, which is still one of Japan&#x27;s most popular.

In the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Takauji. Asano became En&#x27;ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became Kō no Moronao and Ōishi became Ōboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the &quot;rōnin&quot; were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En&#x27;ya&#x27;s wife, and one of the &quot;rōnin&quot; dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).

===Opera===
The story was turned into an opera, &quot;Chūshingura&quot;, by Shigeaki Saegusa in 1997.

===Cinema and television===
The play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan, the earliest starring Onoe Matsunosuke. The film&#x27;s release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying &quot;benshi&quot; narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director Kenji Mizoguchi, who would later direct &quot;Ugetsu&quot; after the war, to make &quot;Genroku Chūshingura&quot;. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar &quot;rekishi geki&quot; (&quot;historical drama&quot;) of &quot;The Loyal 47 Ronin&quot;. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source &quot;Mayama Chūshingura&quot;, a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn&#x27;t shown in America until the 1970s.

The 1958 version, &quot;The Loyal 47 Ronin&quot;, was directed by Kunio Watanabe.

The 1962 film version directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, &quot;&quot;, is most familiar to Western audiences. In it, Toshirō Mifune appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series &quot;Daichūshingura&quot; as Ōishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic &quot;Swords of Vengeance&quot; (&quot;Akō-jō danzetsu&quot;).

Many Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as &quot;Daichūshingura&quot; and the more recent NHK Taiga drama &quot;Genroku Ryōran&quot;, recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the &quot;Chūshingura&quot;, while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, &quot;gaiden&quot; dramatize events and characters not in the &quot;Chūshingura&quot;. Kon Ichikawa directed another version in 1994. In 2004, Mitsumasa Saitō directed a nine-episode mini-series starring Ken Matsudaira, who had also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the &quot;Chūshingura&quot; entitled &quot;Genroku Ryōran&quot;. In Hirokazu Koreeda&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Hana yori mo nao&quot;, the story was used as a backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.

In the 1998 film Ronin (film), Robert De Niro&#x27;s character is told the story by a mysterious Frenchman who is creating an intricately detailed miniature diorama of its original setting. Though the film takes the name from the &#x27;masterless&#x27; samurai of Japan, it has nothing to do with the actual events of the forty-seven ronin.

A comedic adaptation was presented in a 2002 episode of the Canadian television series &quot;History Bites&quot; titled &quot;Samurai Goodfellas&quot;, mingling the story with elements from &quot;The Godfather&quot; film series.

Most recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie titled &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, starring Keanu Reeves, and then again into a more stylized 2015 version titled &quot;Last Knights&quot;.

===Woodblock prints===
The forty-seven rōnin is one of the most popular themes in Japanese woodblock prints, or &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are Utamaro, Toyokuni, Hokusai, Kunisada, Hiroshige, and Yoshitoshi. However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of Kuniyoshi, who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty triptychs.

===Literature===
* The earliest known account of the Akō incident in the West was published in 1822 in Isaac Titsingh&#x27;s posthumously-published book &quot;Illustrations of Japan&quot;.
* The first book of the juvenile Samurai Mystery series by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler, &quot;The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn&quot; (2005), weaves the kabuki play &quot;The Forty-Seven Ronin&quot; into the plot. 
* The incident is the subject of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; short story &quot;The Uncivil Teacher of Court Etiquette Kôtsuké no Suké&quot;, included in the 1935 collection &quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;.
* The legend of the forty-seven rōnin was adapted into two graphic novels published by Dark Horse Comics. The first is &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, a 2014 faithful retelling written by Mike Richardson and illustrated by Stan Sakai. The second Dark Horse Comics adaption is &quot;Seppuku&quot;, the second part of Víctor Santos&#x27; 2017 graphic novel &quot;Rashomon: A Commissioner Heigo Kobayashi Case&quot;, which also adapts &quot;In a Grove&quot;, the Ryūnosuke Akutagawa short story the 1950 film &quot;Rashomon&quot; is based on.

<text>Zog I (born Ahmed Muhtar Zogolli; 8 October 18959 April 1961) was the leader of Albania from 1922 to 1939. At age 27, he first served as Albania&#x27;s youngest ever Prime Minister (1922–1924), then as president (1925–1928), and finally as King (1928–1939).

Born to a beylik family in Ottoman Albania, Zogolli was active in Albanian politics from a young age and fought on the side of Austria-Hungary during the First World War. In 1922, he adopted the name Ahmed Zogu. He held various ministerial posts in the Albanian government before being driven into exile in June 1924, but returned later in the year with Yugoslav and White Russian military support and was subsequently elected prime minister. Zogu was elected president in January 1925 and vested with dictatorial powers, with which he enacted major domestic reforms, suppressed civil liberties, and struck an alliance with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy. In September 1928, Albania was proclaimed a monarchy and he acceded to the throne as Zog I, King of the Albanians. He married Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony in 1938, and their only child, Leka, was born a year later.

Albania fell further under Italian influence during Zog&#x27;s reign, and by the end of the 1930s the country had become almost fully dependent on Italy despite Zog&#x27;s resistance. In April 1939, Italy invaded Albania and the country was rapidly overrun. Mussolini declared Albania an Italian protectorate under King Victor Emmanuel III, forcing Zog into exile. He lived in England during the Second World War but was barred from returning to Albania by the anti-monarchist government led by Enver Hoxha. Zog spent the rest of his life in France and died in April 1961 at the age of 65. His remains were buried at the Thiais Cemetery near Paris, before being transferred to the royal mausoleum in Tirana in 2012.

==Background and early political career==

Zog was born as Ahmed Muhtar Zogolli in Burgajet Castle, near Burrel in northern Albania, third son to Xhemal Pasha Zogolli, and first son by his second wife Sadije Toptani in 1895. His family was a beylik family of landowners, with feudal authority over the region of Mati. His grandfather was Xhelal Pasha Zogolli. His mother&#x27;s Toptani family claimed to be descended from the sister of Albania&#x27;s greatest national hero, the 15th-century general Skanderbeg. He was educated at Galatasaray High School (French: &quot;Lycée Impérial de Galatasaray&quot;) in Beyoğlu, a district of the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1911, Zogolli became governor of Mat, being appointed ahead of his elder half-brother, Xhelal Bey Zogolli.

In 1912, he participated in the Albanian Declaration of Independence as the representative of the Mat District. As a young man during the First World War, Zogolli volunteered on the side of Austria-Hungary. He was detained at Vienna in 1917 and 1918 and in Rome in 1918 and 1919 before returning to Albania in 1919. During his time in Vienna, he grew to enjoy a Western European lifestyle. Upon his return, Zogolli became involved in the political life of the fledgling Albanian government that had been created in the wake of the First World War. His political supporters included many southern feudal landowners called beys, Turkish for &quot;province chieftain&quot; with title variations including Beyg, Begum, Bygjymi. The Bey title refers to the social group to which he belonged, which was also used by noble families in the north, along with merchants, industrialists, and intellectuals. During the early 1920s, Zogolli served as Governor of Shkodër (1920–1921), Minister of the Interior (March–November 1920, 1921–1924), and chief of the Albanian military (1921–1922). His primary rivals were Luigj Gurakuqi and Fan S. Noli. In 1922, Zogolli formally changed his surname from Zogolli to Zogu, which sounds more Albanian.

In 1923, he was shot and wounded in Parliament. A crisis arose in 1924 after the assassination of one of Zogu&#x27;s industrialist opponents, Avni Rustemi; in the aftermath, a leftist revolt forced Zogu, along with 600 of his allies, into exile in June 1924. He returned to Albania with the backing of Yugoslav forces and Yugoslavia-based General Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Russian troops led by Russian Gen Sergei Ulagay and became prime minister.

==President of Albania==

Zogu was officially elected as the first President of Albania by the Constituent Assembly on 21 January 1925, taking office on 1 February for a seven-year term. A new constitution vested Zogu with sweeping executive and legislative powers, to the point that he was effectively a dictator. He had the right to appoint all major government personnel, as well as one-third of the lower house.

Zogu&#x27;s government followed the European model, though large parts of Albania still maintained a social structure unchanged from the days of Ottoman rule, and most villages were serf plantations run by the Beys. On 28 June 1925, Zogu ceded Sveti Naum to Yugoslavia in exchange for Peshkëpi (Pëshkupat) village and other concessions.

Zogu enacted several major reforms. His principal ally during this period was the Kingdom of Italy, which lent his government funds in exchange for a greater role in Albania&#x27;s fiscal policy. His administration was marred by disputes with Kosovo Albanian leaders, primarily Hasan Prishtina and Bajram Curri, among others.

On the debit side, Zogu&#x27;s Albania was a police state in which civil liberties were all but nonexistent and the press was closely censored. Political opponents were imprisoned and often killed. For all intents and purposes, he held all governing power in the nation.

==Albanian king==

On 1 September 1928, Albania was transformed into a kingdom, and President Zogu declared himself to be Zog I, with the title &quot;King of the Albanians&quot;. He appointed as his advisor Mehmed Orhan Efendi, a prince of the recently-abolished Ottoman Empire. He took as his regnal name his surname rather than his forename since the Islamic name &quot;Ahmet&quot; might have had the effect of isolating him on the European stage. He also initially took the parallel name &quot;Skanderbeg III&quot; (Zogu claimed to be a successor of Skanderbeg through descent through Skanderbeg&#x27;s sister; &quot;Skanderbeg II&quot; was taken to be Prince Wied, but this fell out of use).

On the same day as he declared himself king (he was never technically crowned), he also declared himself Field Marshal of the Royal Albanian Army. He proclaimed a constitutional monarchy similar to the contemporary regime in Italy, created a strong police force, and instituted the Zogist salute (flat hand over the heart with palm facing downwards). Zog hoarded gold coins and precious stones, which were used to back Albania&#x27;s first paper currency.
Zog&#x27;s mother, Sadije, was declared Queen Mother of Albania, and Zog also gave his brother and sisters Royal status as Prince and Princesses Zogu. One of his sisters, Senije ( – 1969), married Shehzade Mehmed Abid Efendi, another Ottoman prince and son of Sultan Abdul Hamid II.

Zog&#x27;s constitution forbade any Prince of the Royal House from serving as Prime Minister or a member of the Cabinet, and contained provisions for the potential extinction of the royal family. The constitution also forbade the union of the Albanian throne with that of any other country, a term which would later be violated with the Italian invasion. Under the Zogist constitution, the King of the Albanians, like the King of the Belgians, ascended the throne and exercised Royal powers only after taking an oath before Parliament; Zog himself swore an oath on the Bible and the Quran (the king being Muslim) in an attempt to unify the country. In 1929, King Zog abolished Islamic law in Albania, adopting in its place a civil code based on the Swiss one, as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had done in Turkey in the same decade. 

Although nominally a constitutional monarch, in practice Zog retained the dictatorial powers he had enjoyed as president. Thus, in effect, Albania remained a military dictatorship.

In 1938, as a result of a request from his advisor and friend Constantino Spanchis, Zog opened the borders of Albania to Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany.

===Life as king===

Although born as an aristocrat and hereditary Bey, King Zog was somewhat ignored by other monarchs in Europe because he was a self-proclaimed monarch who had no links to any other European royal families. Nonetheless, he did have strong connections with Muslim royal families in the Arab World, particularly Egypt, whose ruling dynasty had Albanian origins. As king, he was honoured by the governments of Italy, Luxembourg, Egypt, Yugoslavia, France, Romania, Greece, Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Austria.

Zog had been engaged to the daughter of Shefqet Bey Verlaci before he became king. Soon after he became king, however, he broke off the engagement. According to traditional customs of blood vengeance prevalent in Albania at the time, Verlaci had the right and obligation to kill Zog. The king frequently surrounded himself with a personal guard and avoided public appearances. He also feared that he might be poisoned, so the mother of the king assumed supervision of the royal kitchen.

In April 1938, Zog married Countess Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony, a Roman Catholic aristocrat who was half-Hungarian and half-American. The ceremony was broadcast throughout Tirana via Radio Tirana that was officially launched by the monarch five months later. Their only child, Crown Prince Leka, was born in Albania on 5 April 1939.

==Assassination attempts==

About 600 blood feuds reportedly existed against Zog, and during his reign he reputedly survived more than 55 assassination attempts.
One of these occurred inside the corridors of the Albanian Parliament premises on 23 February 1924. Beqir Valteri, originating from the same area as Zog, was waiting for him and opened fire suddenly. Zog was shot twice. Meanwhile, Valteri fled but, surrounded by the militia, took refuge in one of the bathrooms, refusing to surrender and singing patriotic songs. According to the memoirs of Ekrem Vlora, he surrendered after the intervention of Qazim Koculi and Ali Klissura. Zog stepped down briefly from political activity, but promised to forgive Valteri. Valteri, a member of the revolutionary &quot;Bashkimi&quot; (&quot;The union&quot;) committee led by Avni Rustemi, was set free by the Court of Tirana after declaring that it was an individual act. Meanwhile, all rumors pointed to the opposition, specifically to Rustemi. Two weeks later Zog and Valteri would meet in private. Soon after, Rustemi would be shot.

Another attempt occurred on 20 February 1931, while Zog was visiting the Vienna State Opera house for a performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. The attackers (Aziz Çami and Ndok Gjeloshi) struck whilst Zog was getting into his car. The attempt was organized by &quot;National Union&quot; (), a union of Zog opponents in exile which was formed in Vienna (1925) with the initiative of Ali Këlcyra, Sejfi Vllamasi, Xhemal Bushati etc. Zog was in the company of Minister Eqrem Libohova who was wounded, while Zog&#x27;s guard Llesh Topallaj was mistaken for Zog by Gjeloshi, who shot him three times in the back of the head. Çami&#x27;s gun was stuck and did not fire. Zog came out of the event unharmed, thanks also to the prompt intervention of Albanian Consul Zef Serreqi and local police. The Austrian authorities arrested Çami, Gjeloshi, and later Qazim Mulleti, Rexhep Mitrovica, Menduh Angoni, Angjelin Suma, Luigj Shkurti, Sejfi Vllamasi, etc. All the Albanian political &quot;émigrés&quot; in Vienna were subsequently arrested, beside Hasan Prishtina. Most of them were quickly released and expelled from Austria. Gjeloshi was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months of jail, while Çami got 2 years and 6 months.

==Relations with Italy==

The fascist government of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy had supported Zog since early in his presidency; that support had led to increased Italian influence in Albanian affairs. The Italians compelled Zog to refuse to renew the First Treaty of Tirana (1926), although Zog still retained British officers in the Gendarmerie as a counterbalance against the Italians, who had pressured Zog to remove them.

During the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, Zog&#x27;s government became almost completely dependent on Mussolini. Grain had to be imported, many Albanians emigrated, and Italians were allowed to settle in Albania. In 1932 and 1933, Albania could not pay the interest on its loans from the Society for the Economic Development of Albania, and the Italians used this as a pretext for further dominance. They demanded that Tirana put Italians in charge of the Gendarmerie, join Italy in a customs union, and grant the Italian Kingdom control of Albania&#x27;s sugar, telegraph, and electrical monopolies. Finally, Italy called for the Albanian government to establish teaching of the Italian language in all Albanian schools, a demand that was swiftly refused by Zog. In defiance of Italian demands, he ordered the national budget to be slashed by 30 percent, dismissed all Italian military advisers, and nationalized Italian-run Roman Catholic schools in the north of Albania to decrease Italian influence on the population of Albania. In 1934, he tried without success to build ties with France, Germany, and the Balkan states. Albania then drifted back into the Italian orbit.

Two days after the birth of Zog&#x27;s son and heir apparent, on 7 April 1939 (Good Friday), Mussolini&#x27;s Italy invaded, facing no significant resistance. The Albanian army was ill-equipped to resist, as it was almost entirely dominated by Italian advisors and officers and was no match for the Italian Army. The Italians were, however, resisted by small elements in the gendarmerie and general population. The royal family, realising that their lives were in danger, fled into exile, taking with them a considerable amount of gold from the National Bank of Tirana and Durrës. Since the royal family had expected an Italian invasion, the gathering of gold had started in advance. &quot;Oh God, it was so short&quot; were King Zog&#x27;s last words to Geraldine on Albanian soil. Mussolini declared Albania a protectorate under Italy&#x27;s King Victor Emmanuel III. While some Albanians continued to resist, &quot;a large part of the population ... welcomed the Italians with cheers&quot;, according to one contemporary account.

==Former heir presumptive==

Prior to the birth of Prince Leka, the position of heir presumptive was held by Tati Esad Murad Kryziu, Prince of Kosova, who was born on the 24th of December 1923 in Tirana, and who was the son of the King&#x27;s sister, Princess Nafije. He became an honorary General of the Royal Albanian Army in 1928, at age five. He was made Heir Presumptive with the style of His Highness and title of &quot;Prince of Kosova&quot; (&quot;Princ i Kosovës&quot;) in 1931. After the royal house&#x27;s exile, he moved to France, where he died in August 1993, aged 69.

==Life in exile and death==

The royal family fled to Greece. Zog, speaking a few days after his arrival there, characterized Hitler and Mussolini as madmen facing &quot;two fools who sleep&quot;: Chamberlain and Daladier. Zog went on to declare, &quot;We prefer to die, from the littlest child to the oldest man, to show our independence is not for sale.&quot; The world, aware that Zog and his entourage had carried off most of the Albanian treasury&#x27;s gold, was not impressed. After a short stay in Greece, the Zog party went to Istanbul in Turkey, then fled through Romania, Poland, Latvia, Sweden, Norway, Belgium to Paris. Zog and his family lived a time in France and fled when the Germans invaded. Their escape from France was helped by Prince Mehmed Orhan Osmanoğlu from the Ottoman Imperial Dynasty, who was aide-de-camp of Zog I.

The royal family then settled in England. Their first residence was at The Ritz in London. This was followed in 1941 by a brief stay at Forest Ridge, a house in the South Ascot area of Sunninghill in Berkshire, near where Zog&#x27;s nieces had been at school in Ascot. In 1941 they moved to Parmoor House, Parmoor, near Frieth in Buckinghamshire, with some staff of the court living in locations around Lane End.

In 1946, Zog and most of his family left England and went to live in Egypt at the behest of King Farouk. In 1951, Zog bought the Knollwood estate in Muttontown, New York, Long Island but the sixty-room estate was never occupied; it quickly fell into ruin and Zog sold the estate in 1955. Farouk was overthrown in 1952, and the family left for France in 1955.

He made his final home in France, where he died at the Foch Hospital, Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine on 9 April 1961, aged 65, of an undisclosed condition. Zog was said to have regularly smoked 200 cigarettes a day, giving him a possible claim to the title of the world&#x27;s heaviest smoker in 1929, but had been seriously ill for some time. He was survived by his wife and son, and was initially buried at the cimetière parisien de Thiais, near Paris. On his death, his son Leka was pronounced H. M. King Leka of the Albanians by the exiled Albanian community.

His widow, Geraldine, died of natural causes in 2002 at the age of 87 in a military hospital in Tirana.

==Political legacy==


During World War II, three resistance groups were operating in Albania: the nationalists, the royalists and the communists. Some of the Albanian establishment opted for collaboration. The communist partisans refused to co-operate with the other resistance groups and eventually took control of the country. They were able to defeat the Nazi remnants and had full control of Albania in November 1944.

Zog attempted to reclaim his throne after the war. However, when the communist government, successful in its partisan movement, seized power, one of its first acts was to ban Zog from ever returning to Albania. It formally deposed him in 1946.

In 1952, his representatives met with the representatives of the Yugoslavian government over possible collaboration.
Sponsored by MI6 and the CIA, some forces loyal to Zog attempted to mount infiltrations into the country, but most were ambushed due to intelligence sent to the Soviet Union by spy Kim Philby.

A referendum in 1997seven years after the end of Communist ruleproposed to restore the monarchy in the person of Zog&#x27;s son Leka Zogu who, since 1961, had been styled &quot;Leka I, King of the Albanians&quot;. The official but disputed results stated that about two-thirds of voters favoured a continued republican government. Leka, believing the result to be fraudulent, attempted an armed uprising: he was unsuccessful and was forced into exile, although he later returned and lived in Tirana until his death on 30 November 2011. A main street in Tirana was later renamed &quot;Boulevard Zog I&quot; by the Albanian government.

==Repatriation to Albania==

In October 2012, the government of Albania decided to bring back the remains of the former king from France, where he died in 1961. Zog&#x27;s body was exhumed from the Thiais Cemetery, Paris on 15 November 2012. A guard of honour was provided by the French President, in the form of French Legionnaires in ceremonial dress.

Zog&#x27;s remains were returned in a state ceremony on 17 November 2012, coinciding with celebrations for Albania&#x27;s independence centennial. The bodies of the king and his family members now lie in the reconstructed royal mausoleum in the capital Tirana. The interment was attended by the government of Albania, including the President and Prime Minister, and representatives of the former royal families of Romania, Montenegro, Russia and Albania.

==Cultural references==

Zog&#x27;s name was in use by 1972 in the English language palaeontological mnemonic for the names of zonal index fossils in part of the Lower Carboniferous System of Great Britain (namely Cleistopora, which geologists decided to call &#x27;zone k&#x27;, Zaphrentis, Caninia, Seminula and Dibanophylum): &quot;King Zog caught syphilis and died&quot;.

In the James Bond novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, Ian Fleming writes of the villainous Francisco Scaramanga telling his compatriots that the Rastafari of Jamaica &quot;believes it owes allegiance&quot; to the King of Ethiopia, this &quot;King Zog or what-have-you.&quot; Fleming had been assigned with the task of escorting Zog when in exile after Albania was annexed by Italy.

In &quot;Aria&quot;, a 1987 British anthology film, Zog was a character in the first of ten short self-contained segments, each by a different director and each featuring a different opera aria. This segment, entitled &#x27;Un ballo in maschera&#x27; after the Giuseppe Verdi opera, was directed by Nicolas Roeg, with actor Theresa Russell playing King Zog during a fictionalized account of his visit to Vienna in 1931 and the assassination attempt on the steps of that city&#x27;s opera house (as noted earlier, Zog had actually seen a performance of &#x27;Pagliacci&#x27; before the real attack).

In the &quot;new&quot; Doc Savage pulp fiction novel, The Whistling Wraith (July 1993, Bantam/Spectra), from the original notes of Lester Dent (primary writer of the sagas) but now completed as a novel by Will Murray, the life &amp; person of Zog, as well as Albania&#x27;s political problems and foreign policy issues with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy are key to the plot. The story slots into the Doc Savage timeline in 1938 (a few weeks after The Motion Menace, per p. 61). Egil Goz the First is clearly standing in for King Zog I, for both are Muslims and both were first president before being the first king of their Balkan nation. (Italy is Santa Bellanca, which is behaving badly in Africa in the work, a tie to the invasion and conquest of Ethiopia.)

In episode 13 of Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus he is mentioned as a reporter for made-up news show called ProbeAround but suddenly dies.

<text>A summons (also known in England and Wales as a claim form and in the Australian state of New South Wales as a court attendance notice (CAN)) is a legal document issued by a court (a &quot;judicial summons&quot;) or by an administrative agency of government (an &quot;administrative summons&quot;) for various purposes.

==Judicial summons==

A judicial summons is served on a person involved in a legal proceeding. Legal action may be in progress against the person, or the person&#x27;s presence as witness may be required. In the former case, the summons will typically announce to the person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a case has been initiated in the issuing court. In some jurisdictions, it may be drafted in legal English difficult for the layman to understand, while several U.S. states expressly require summonses to be drafted in plain English and that they must start with this phrase: &quot;Notice! You have been sued.&quot;

The summons announces a date by which the person or persons summoned must either appear in court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing party or parties. The summons is the descendant of the writ of the common law. It replaces the former procedure in common-law countries by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the sheriff to arrest the defendant in order for the court to obtain personal jurisdiction in both criminal and civil actions.

==Types of summonses==

===Citation/claim (legal term)===

A citation, traffic violation ticket, or notice to appear is a type of summons prepared and served at the scene of the occurrence by a law enforcement official, compelling the appearance of a defendant before the local magistrate within a certain period of time to answer for a minor traffic infraction, misdemeanor, or other summary offence. Failure to appear within the allotted period of time is a separate crime of failure to appear.

In Australia, minor traffic and some summary offences are known as an infringement notice or a fine and can be dealt with by paying a particular monetary amount depending on the offence. The accused person has the right to have the matter heard in a court; if found not guilty the accused person pays nothing other than his legal costs (if any); if found guilty the accused person faces the prospect of a conviction for the offence and/or a substantial increase in the fine up to the maximum. For example, proceeding through a red light could go from A$353 up to A$2,200 if convicted in NSW. For more serious offences, a field court attendance notice is issued.

In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, law enforcement officials may deal with certain minor offences, such as littering, by issuing a fixed penalty notice, colloquially called an &quot;on-the-spot fine&quot;, although legally they are not fines. They allow the recipient to avoid going to court by paying a penalty fixed by statute. If such a notice is ignored or disputed, a court summons will be issued as for any other offence.

===Civil summons===
A civil summons is most often accompanied by a complaint. Depending on the type of summons, there is often an option to endorse a summons so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a summons will often have these options to endorse:
# as an individual;
# as the person sued under the fictitious name of __________________;
# on behalf of (usually for a company); or
# by personal delivery on __________

===Administrative summons===
One example of an administrative summons is found in the tax law of the United States. The Internal Revenue Code authorizes the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a summons for a taxpayer—or any person having custody of books of account relating to a business of a taxpayer—to appear before the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (generally, this means the IRS employee who issued the summons) at the time and place named in the summons. The person summoned may be required to produce books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony under oath before an IRS employee.

The IRS is also empowered to issue the section 7602 summons for the purpose of &quot;inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws&quot;.

The summons may be enforced by a court order, and the law provides a criminal penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine, or both, for failure to obey the summons, except that the person summoned may, to the extent applicable, assert a privilege against self incrimination or other evidentiary privileges, if applicable.

In the U.S. immigration court system, a &quot;Notice to Appear&quot; is an administrative summons ordering a respondent to appear before an immigration court for removal proceedings.

==Summonses by jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) the service of a court attendance notice can be issued in a number of ways, the most common of which is by the NSW Police Force when charging someone after an arrest is made, a bail court attendance notice (with bail conditions) or regular court attendance notice is issued. Other methods the police use include via a paper form called a field court attendance notice (field CAN) which is issued to the accused person on the spot after an offence has been detected. Or by way of a future court attendance notice (future CAN), which replaced the old court issued summons and is served in person by police or sometimes by mail. In all of these cases, the CAN is filed at the court after it has been served.

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales, the various royal writs traditionally used to commence the forms of action were abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 39). They were consolidated into a writ of summons, which like its predecessors, was traditionally issued in the name of the monarch. 

From 1832 to 1980, a writ of summons in England and Wales began with the name of the court, case number, the word &quot;Between&quot;, and the names of the parties to the case. This was followed by the name and full title of the current monarch, the word &quot;To:&quot;, the defendant&#x27;s name and their city of residence, and then the royal command, starting with the royal we: &quot;WE COMMAND YOU that within 14 days after service of this Writ on you, inclusive of the date of service, you do cause an appearance to be entered for you in an action at the suit of [plaintiff&#x27;s name] and take notice that in default of you so doing the Plaintiff may proceed therein, and judgment may be given in your absence&quot;. Next came the word &quot;Witness,&quot; then the name and title of the Lord Chancellor, and the date on which the writ was issued. 

The traditional writ language was changed in 1980 at the insistence of Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who felt that a command from the monarch was too intimidating for ordinary laypeople.

Therefore, as of 1992, a writ of summons simply gave notice, in lieu of the traditional royal command: &quot;This Writ of Summons has been issued against you by the above-named Plaintiff in respect of the claim set out on the back. Within 14 days after the service of this Writ upon you, counting the day of service, you must either satisfy the claim or return to the Court Office mentioned below the accompanying Acknowledgement of Service stating therein whether you intend to contest these proceedings.&quot; This was followed by a paragraph warning of the risk of entry of default judgment. The writ was no longer witnessed by the Lord Chancellor and in lieu of that simply stated which court office had issued the writ. 

In 1999, the writ of summons was replaced with the &quot;claim form&quot; by the Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (CPR). This was part of the CPR&#x27;s reforms to simplify legal terminology; at the same time, the plaintiff was renamed the &quot;claimant&quot;. Despite its name, the claim form may but is not required to present the details of the claim itself. The statement of claim (which had already replaced the complaint in England and Wales under the Rules of the Supreme Court) was replaced by another document known as &quot;particulars of claim&quot;. The claim form (Form N1) has space for &quot;brief details of claim&quot; on the first page, and then on the third page, the claimant can either provide particulars of claim or indicate by tick box that they are &quot;to follow&quot; (that is, as a separate document). 

Unlike the traditional writ of summons, the notice to the defendant about when to respond is no longer provided on the claim form itself. The CPR is oddly silent about this, but the claimant is generally expected to concurrently serve Form N1C, Notes to defendant on replying to the claim form, which does warn that the defendant must respond within 14 days of service of particulars of claim. 

In criminal matters, either a requisition, summons or warrant is issued to initiate criminal proceedings.

=== Republic of Korea ===
In the Republic of Korea, a criminal summons may come from the Korean Prosecution Services or a Court of Law and is a manner to initiate criminal proceedings or call a witness in for questioning. A summons may be served on an individual within Korea or that is abroad.

===United States===
In most U.S. jurisdictions, the service of a summons is in most cases required for the court to have jurisdiction over the party who is being summoned. The process by which a summons is served is called service of process. The form and content of service in the federal courts is governed by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the rules of many state courts are similar. The federal summons is usually issued by the clerk of the court. In many states, the summons may be issued by an attorney, but some states use filing as the means to commence an action and in those states, the attorney must first file the summons in duplicate before it becomes effective. One or more copies are stamped by the court clerk with the court seal and returned to the attorney, who then uses it to actually serve the defendants. Other jurisdictions may only require that the summons be filed after it is served on the defendants. New York is distinguished by its permissive filing system, in which the summons or complaint need not be filed at all.

Enghien gave its name to a French duchy and to the commune of Enghien-les-Bains, a suburb of Paris, due to a complex series of family successions: in 1487, Mary of Luxembourg (d. 1547), the only heir of Peter II of Luxembourg (d. 1482), Count of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise and member of one of the branches of the House of Luxembourg, married François de Bourbon-Vendôme (d. 1495), the great-grandfather of King Henry IV of France. Mary of Luxembourg brought as her dowry the fief of Condé-en-Brie (Aisne &quot;département&quot;, France) and the county of Enghien, among others. These fiefs passed to her grandson Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, uncle of King Henry IV of France, who started the line of the Princes of Condé, the famous cadet branch of the French royal family.

In 1566, the county of Enghien was elevated to a duchy-peerage. However, the necessary registration process was not completed, so the title became extinct at the death of Louis I de Bourbon in 1569. In 1633, Henry II, Prince of Condé, grandson of Louis I de Bourbon, inherited the duchy of Montmorency, near Paris, after the execution of Henri II de Montmorency, brother of his wife Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency. In 1689, King Louis XIV allowed Henry III, Prince of Condé, grandson of Henry II, Prince of Condé, to rename the duchy of Montmorency as &quot;duchy of Enghien&quot;, in memory of the duchy of Enghien which the Princes of Condé had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon.

The city of Montmorency, at the heart of the duchy, continued to be known as &quot;Montmorency&quot;, despite the official name change, but the name &quot;Enghien&quot; stuck to the nearby lake and marshland that developed later as a spa resort and was incorporated as the commune of Enghien-les-Bains in the 19th century.

<text>La Louvière (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Boussoit, Haine-Saint-Paul, Haine-Saint-Pierre, Houdeng-Aimeries, Houdeng-Gœgnies, La Louvière, Maurage, Saint-Vaast, Strépy-Bracquegnies, and Trivières.

La Louvière is the capital of the &quot;Centre&quot; region, a former coal mining area in the &quot;Sillon industriel&quot;, between the &quot;Borinage&quot; to the West and the &quot;Pays Noir&quot; to the East.

==History==

===Mythical origins===
The legend of a mother wolf nursing a child at La Louvière is reminiscent of the mythical birth of Rome. The true origin of the city, however, dates from the 12th century. At that time, the forested, and presumably wolf-infested, territory of today’s La Louvière was named &quot;Menaulu&quot;, from the Old French meaning “wolf’s lair”. This land was part of the larger community of Saint-Vaast, which itself belonged to the Aulne Abbey.

By 1284, the name of the territory had been translated into Latin, then back into French to its current name of La Louvière. The lords of Saint-Vaast encouraged prospecting on their land, which led to the first extraction of coal in the year 1390. The abbey’s refusal to provide necessary infrastructure, however, delayed large-scale development until the 18th century.

===Birth of La Louvière===
In the 19th century, the construction of roads, canals, and railways finally allowed the local coal production to be exported. Investments also poured into the local industry to take advantage of the abundant source of energy. La Louvière quickly surpassed its overlord Saint-Vaast, both in population and economic wealth. Within fifty years, the territory that was not much more than a place name had become one of the most important cities in Wallonia. La Louvière was recognized as an independent city in 1869. Today, La Louvière is still the fifth largest city in Wallonia, after Charleroi, Liège, Namur, and Mons.

==Sights==
*There are four hydraulic boat lifts on the old Canal du Centre, which connects the river Meuse to the Scheldt. These double elevators date from around 1900 and were designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998.
*The housing complex that was built for the Bois-du-Luc coal workers during the first half of the 19th century has been restored. This is part of the Major Mining Sites of Wallonia, designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2012. One of those houses can be visited, together with a couple of museums retracing the history of the coal mining industry in the &quot;Centre&quot; region.
*La Louvière counts a number of chapels and churches that date from the 13th to the 16th century.
*La Louvière also has one of the best collection of Idel Ianchelevici’s works on display.

==Climate==
La Louvière has an oceanic climate typical of Belgium with moderated seasons even for its inland position at 50° latitude, as a result of Gulf Stream influence.

==Folklore==
The Carnival of La Louvière is called &quot;Laetare&quot;, after the Latin verb meaning “to enjoy” (the introit at mass on the fourth Sunday of Lent begins &quot;Laetare Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Rejoice Jerusalem&quot;). It lasts three days, Sunday to Tuesday, and takes place in the middle of Lent. The Gilles are out on all three days, stomping to the rhythm of their music and distributing oranges to the passers-by. Giant puppets and various other groups also take part in the parades and festivities. Typical of La Louvière’s celebrations is the so-called &quot;Brûlage des Bosses&quot; (“burning of the humps”), where a puppet dressed as a Gilles is burnt to symbolize the end of carnival and beginning of a new life.

==Sports==

La Louvière used to have a top level football club in Belgian First Division: RAA Louviéroise. They won the Belgian Cup in 2003. the club no longer exists as it merged into a team based in another city and its La Louvière playground is now the home of third division semi-amateur club UR La Louvière Centre.

<text>Soignies (; , ; ; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium.

It consists of the following districts: Casteau, Chaussée-Notre-Dame-Louvignies, Horrues, Naast, Neufvilles, Soignies and Thieusies. Casteau is known worldwide because SHAPE, the military headquarters of NATO, has been based at the village since 1967.

The name of Soignies comes from the Latin word &quot;suniacum&quot;, which means &quot;on the Senne&quot;. The spring of the Senne is near Soignies. After Soignies, the river flows through Brussels.

Soignies is also well known for its blue limestone (from the &quot;Carrières du Hainaut&quot;) and its glass industry (Durobor).

==History==

===Saint Vincent===
The known history of the region starts in the 7th century. The Frankish merchant Samo, who founded an empire in Central Europe, may have come from Soignies (Latin: &quot;pagus Senonagus&quot;). In the 670s, Madelgaire, a wealthy former governor under King Dagobert I, and his wife Waltrude decided to separate and devote themselves to a religious life. Both of them founded an abbey, Madelgaire in Soignies and Waltrude in neighbouring Mons. Madelgaire took the religious name of Vincent. Like his wife, he was canonized after his death and later became the patron saint of the city that would eventually grow around the monastery. At that time, a large forest covered the whole area, the remnants of which near Brussels are still called the Sonian Forest (French: &quot;Forêt de Soignes&quot;, Dutch: &quot;Zoniënwoud&quot;) today. The existence of the abbey of Soignies is mentioned for the first time in the Treaty of Meersen, dated August 8, 870, as one of King Charles the Bald&#x27;s possessions.

===The age of the canons===
At the end of the 9th century, a general decline in religious life led to a chapter of powerful canons – who did not take any vow of poverty – taking the place of the monks. These canons would remain in power for eight centuries, until the French Revolution. By the 10th century, the canons started the construction of the Church of St. Vincent (Madelgaire), which was to be completed during the following century in the prevalent Romanesque style of the period. The first known charter by Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut was granted to Soignies in 1142. The fame of the Church of St. Vincent grew in the 13th century, when the bishop of Cambrai granted a 40-day indulgence to every visitor to the church. The settlement grew to urban proportions at around the same time, coinciding with the development of the textile industry and the building of a defensive wall. The first stone quarries mentioned in the archives date from around 1400, but several clues suggest that local stone was already quarried much earlier. The cut-stone industry, however, started only around 1700.

===1789–present===
On 1 September 1796, the revolutionary council disbanded the local administration by the canons, dealing a heavy blow to the local economy. In 1812, only 92 people worked in the quarries on a total population of about 4,000 people. The industry rebounded under the Dutch regime, and even more after the Belgian Revolution of 1830. 

Between 1831 and 1995, Soignies elected its own member of the Chamber of Representatives. Several of the city streets are named after these past representatives.

Today, the cut-stone and glass industries are still active. Soignies is also the center of a vibrant service industry, especially in education and health.

==Sights==
* The Collegiate Church of St. Vincent is one of the earliest specimens of Romanesque churches in Belgium. The choir dates from the beginning of the 11th century while the Gothic west tower dates from around 1250. The cemetery still has tombs of the 13th and 14th century.
* Near the church stands the Cloth Market (in French &quot;Halle aux Draps&quot;), dating from the 16th century.

==Festivities==
* The origins of the &quot;Processio&quot; of Saint Vincent (Madelgaire) are not well known. It is certain, however, that it already took place as early as the 13th century. Today, every Monday of Pentecost, the reliquary of Saint Vincent is carried in a historic procession along a predetermined 11-km-long circuit around town, known as the &quot;Grand Tour Saint Vincent&quot;.
* The Saturday preceding the third Sunday of October is the date of the local carnival. The festivities are known as &quot;La Simpélourd&quot; – from the contraction of two French words meaning simple and heavy – after a cuckold who lived in Soignies more than 200 years ago. This character still takes central stage in the colourful celebration.

==Sport==
Soignies is home to Rugby Union club RC Soignies, winners of the Belgian Cup in 2010.

==People born in Soignies==
*Samo, Frankish merchant and later king (&quot;rex&quot;) of the 7th-century Slavic state known as Samo&#x27;s Empire (Soignies is one of two presumed birthplaces, the other being Sens)
*Guillaume Malbecque, Flemish composer (c. 1400–1465)
*François de Cuvilliés, Rococo architect (1695–1768)

<text>Binche (; ; Dutch: &quot;Bing&quot;) is a city and municipality of Wallonia, in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. Since 1977, the municipality consists of Binche, Bray, Buvrinnes, Épinois, Leval-Trahegnies, Péronnes-lez-Binche, Ressaix, and Waudrez districts.

According to the surveys from 2021, Binche had a total population of 33,416, approximately 550 inhabitants per km2.

The motto of the city is &quot;Plus Oultre&quot; (meaning &quot;Further beyond&quot; in Old French), which was the motto of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who in 1545 gave the medieval Castle of Binche to his sister, Queen Mary of Hungary. Her attention was spent on Binche, which she had rebuilt into Binche Palace under the direction of the architect-sculptor Jacques du Broeucq, remembered today as the first master of Giambologna. This château, intended to rival Fontainebleau, was eventually destroyed by the soldiers of Henry II of France in 1554.

In 2003, the Carnival of Binche was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. In addition, the Belfry and City Hall were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, for its importance in civic functions, architecture, and its testimony to the power and influence of the town.

== History ==

Binche came into being during the Middle Ages, near the Roman road that connected Bagacum, the capital of the Nervii, (now Bavay) to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, (now Cologne). The road influenced trade and communication throughout Binche.

The city was officially founded in the 12th century by Yolande of Gelders, widow of Duke Baldwin III from Hainaut. Their son Baldwin IV fortified the city, which served as a frontier fortress against France. In the 14th century, the city wall was extended to its present size.

The city reached the peak of its economic power when Belgium was under Spanish rule. Binche was the residence of Mary of Hungary, governess of the Netherlands for her brother, Emperor Charles V. She had a magnificent palace built, designed by Jacques Du Broeucq, to compete with that of Fontainebleau. Charles V visited Binche in 1549 on invitation from his sister. For this occasion, she organized magnificent celebrations.

This period of prosperity came to an end in 1554 as the palace, the city, and the surrounding area were plundered by the troops of King Henry II of France. Until the beginning of the 18th century, Hainaut was the site of repeated military conflicts between the kingdoms of France and Spain.

The Industrial Revolution brought renewed prosperity. Coal mines&#x27; slag heaps still shape the landscape. Adding to this were the brickyards, tanneries, glaziers, breweries, lime kilns, and soap factories. Thousands of people worked at home as lace makers, cobblers, and tailors. Post offices and train stations were introduced in the city during this time.

==Carnival==
The three-day Carnival of Binche is one of the best known in Belgium. It takes place around Shrove Tuesday (or Mardi Gras) just before Lent (the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter). Performers known as Gilles wear elaborate costumes in the national colours of red, black and yellow. During the parade, they throw oranges at the crowd. In 2003, it was recognized by UNESCO as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

== Sport==
Each year the town hosts the single day Binche-Chimay-Binche professional cycling race, which is rated as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour.

== Transportation ==
Binche railway station has been the terminus for passenger services on line 108 (Erquelinnes - Mariemont) since 1984. The island platform is out of use.

The large gothic style station building was designed by Leuven architect Pierre Langerock. It has coloured stained glass windows and is a protected monument. There are some inscriptions remaining from the German occupation.

To the front of the station is a square half-encircled by a balustrade. Sculpted in the Neo-classical style from blue stone, it incorporates statues commemorating illustrious figures from Binche’s past, including Charles V, Margaret of York and Mary of Hungary. A monument dedicated to independence was added in 1931. The area has been a heritage quarter since 1978.

Chimay has traditionally hosted an annual motor racing event, run on a street circuit formed from local public roads. From the 1920s to 1960s the event was run for contemporary Grand Prix and sportscar categories, and included the famous Grand Prix des Frontières. In recent times, while the event has persisted it has been run for historic race series. The track briefly lost its licence in 2006 related to safety fears, but has since had it reinstated.

Chimay Trappist beers and cheeses are produced in the town by the Chimay Brewery, run by the Trappist monks of Scourmont Abbey, and are internationally renowned.
