<text>Customs and regulations for shopping hours (times that shops are open) vary between countries and between cities.

==Shopping days and impact of holidays==
Some countries, particularly those with predominantly Christian populations or histories, do not allow Sunday shopping. In Islamic countries, some shops are closed on Fridays for noontime prayers. In Israel many shops are closed on Friday evenings and Saturdays during the daytime for Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath).

Each state in Australia sets its own standard trading hours, but in most of the country the shops are open seven days a week for at least part of the day. These also depends on their day-to-day needs.

For some shops and other businesses in culturally Christian countries, Christmas Day is the only day in the year that they are closed.

In the United States and Canada, nearly all retail stores are open every day of the year except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and Easter Sunday. Some suburban and smaller communities often close on Sundays. For example, Bergen County, New Jersey, next to New York City, completely bans Sunday shopping. Nearly all stores in the United States have restricted hours on Sundays (most often 11 am or noon to 5 - 7 pm), and stores close early on important holidays, such as Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve, New Year&#x27;s Day, and Independence Day. Banks, post offices and other government offices either are closed on weekends, or close early on Saturdays. Many other non-retail establishments remain closed on weekends.

In Islamic countries shops may have special opening hours during Ramadan.

In Israel, many shops are closed on religious holidays other than Shabbat, especially on Yom Kippur when nearly all businesses are closed.

==By country==
===Australia===
Shop trading hours in Australia are regulated by individual states and territories.

The Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, totally or almost totally deregulate shopping hours. All retail businesses in the two territories, regardless of size or product offer, are allowed to decide their trading hours to suit their individual customer demand. Non-essential shops in the three states are required to remain closed on Christmas Day and Good Friday, ANZAC Day (until 1 pm), and in Tasmania and NSW on Easter Sunday, and in NSW on Boxing Day (outside the Sydney special trading precinct). Shops in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory can remain open on any public holiday. The two main supermarket operators, Woolworths and Coles, generally trade between 6 am and midnight every day, although some inner-city shops in Sydney and Melbourne operate twenty-four hours. In Canberra, stores such as Woolworths Kmart and Coles were open 24/7; however during the Covid-19 pandemic store closures, these stores did not reopen with 24/7 shopping hours.

Melbourne generally has the most relaxed rules. Almost all shopping centres in Melbourne now trade until 9 pm on Thursdays and Fridays as well as being open longer hours on Sundays. Interstate late night trading only occurs on either Thursday or Friday rather than both.

Melbourne is also famous for beginning the trend of 36-hour overnight trades in the lead-up to Christmas. Some of the larger shopping centres will open from 8 am December 23 until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Centres often open to 10 pm or midnight on most other nights in the fortnight before Christmas, and the first few days of the annual Boxing Day Sales.

Trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory have been deregulated since the repeal of the Trading Hours Act 1996 [ACT] on 29 May 1997.

Shopping hours in South Australia are still regulated, but there have been numerous changes to relax the laws. Nonetheless, trading laws are still face complicated and confusing: legal trading hours vary depending on size and product offer. Supermarkets that trade with fewer than seven workers and with a trading floor less than 500 m2 are exempt from the laws. Larger supermarkets are required by law to close at 9 pm on Mondays to Fridays, and 5 pm on Saturdays; they are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 9 am to 5 pm, except ANZAC Day, which is 12 noon to 5 pm; they must remain closed on Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.

In all areas of Queensland, trading hours of major supermarkets are Monday to Saturday from 7 am to 9 pm and Sundays and public holidays from 9 am to 6 pm. Most major shopping centres close at 5 pm every day, except for &quot;late night shopping&quot; on one night a week. Supermarkets in major shopping centres must still cease trading at 9 pm, with special access for just the supermarket.

In rural areas of Western Australia below the 27th parallel, local governments nominate shop closing hours to the State government, which, if accepted, are implemented by ministerial order. Shopping hours in the state&#x27;s capital, Perth, are regulated by laws similar to South Australia&#x27;s. Trading hours are stipulated in law, and are based on size and product offer. As in South Australia, smaller, independently operated supermarket retailers are exempted. Chain supermarkets are required to close Monday to Friday at 9 pm, Saturdays at 5 pm, and are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11 am to 5 pm.

===Austria===

The situation in Austria is very similar to that in Germany, with most public holidays being based on Catholic holidays as the country is predominantly Roman Catholic. Until the 1990s, all shops closed around noon on Saturday and did not reopen until Monday morning. Entrepreneurs such as Richard Lugner lobbied for an expansion of shopping hours, and laws are gradually being changed, with more and more exceptions granted. Meanwhile, as in Germany, filling stations and train stations in big cities have taken on the role of &quot;Nahversorger&quot; (&quot;local providers&quot;, supplying the local population with groceries) outside regular shopping hours.

Until very recently, shopping hours remained very restrictive. In 2008 Austria modified its 2003 &quot;Öffnungszeitengesetz&quot; (&quot;opening times law&quot;). The new regulations allow stores to open from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturday until 6:00 p.m. but they are restricted to a total of 72 open hours per week. Bakeries can open 30 minutes earlier at 5:30 a.m. Shops are closed on Sunday, but there are exceptions for tourist locations, train stations, airports, and the Christmas season.

===Canada===
Store hours in Canada are regulated by each province or territory and, in some provinces, individual municipalities as well.

As a general rule, there is little regulation of shopping hours across the country. In the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, as well as all three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), there are no restrictions at all and stores can open 24/7 every day. Nova Scotia permits any store to open every day of the year except Remembrance Day (November 11).

The remaining provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) require stores to close on most major holidays. Furthermore, three provinces have further restrictions on Sunday openings. In Manitoba, stores may open on Sundays only with municipal approval and only between 9 am - 6 pm (although exceptions for essential services apply). New Brunswick allows Sunday opening all year only with both municipal and provincial approval; otherwise it is permitted only from August until the New Year. Some communities in New Brunswick (such as Woodstock, Miramichi, Sussex) restrict Sunday hours of operation to 12 pm - 5 pm.

The province of Quebec is the only province in Canada that regulates shopping hours outside of Sundays and holidays. As a general rule, stores are permitted to open only between 8 am and 9 pm weekdays and 8 am - 5 pm weekends, excluding holidays. There are several exceptions, however, notably several supermarkets in Montreal, which are open later hours or 24 hours a day.

In practice, few stores in Canada (except a few grocery stores) remain open 24 hours. Most shopping centres open from 10 am-9pm Monday to Friday, 9:30 am - 6 pm (or in some cases 9 pm) on Saturday and 12 pm - 5 pm or 6 pm on Sunday. Many larger stores, such as Walmart Canada, and most major grocery stores remain open 8 am - 10 pm Monday to Saturday and 10 am - 6 pm (in some provinces 8 am - 10 pm) on Sunday, except in provinces where further restrictions apply. The Sobeys chain stays open from 7 am - 11 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, though some locations are open twenty-four hours. Many Loblaws brand stores such as Zehrs Markets and Real Canadian Superstore are open from 7 am - 11 pm, 7 days a week.

===China===
Trading hours in China, including Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions, are commercial decisions and are not regulated. Most shops are open on public holidays. Some convenience stores are open twenty-four hours and every day of the year, but only a few large supermarkets are open twenty-four hours a day.

During the Chinese New Year, many shops in China close for a few days, from Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve to the first day of the Chinese New Year. Or more often, to the third day of the Chinese New Year. Some shops in Hong Kong and Macau operate on Chinese New Year holidays, especially supermarket chains.

===Croatia===
Shopping hours in Croatia are currently unregulated after the Constitutional Court struck down a ban on Sunday shopping, which had been in effect from mid-2008 until mid-2009.

Most large out-of-town supermarkets are open between 07:30/08:00-21:00/22:00, Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls usually open at 09:00 and also close at 22:00, every day. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, typically at 13:00. Other shops in urban areas are generally closed on Sundays.

Bakeries and newspaper kiosks often open very early in the morning, at 05:30 or 06:00, and open every day but not twenty-four hours. Filling stations and convenience stores along major roads as well as some pharmacies (at least one in each major city, five in Zagreb) operate twenty-four hours.

===Denmark===
Standard operating hours for most businesses are generally 8:00/8:30 - 17:30. Since 1 October 2012, Danish shops have been allowed to be open every day around the clock, except on public holidays and after 3 pm on Christmas Eve&#x27;s Day and New Year Eve&#x27;s Day. Shops with a turnover of less than DKK 32.2 million (2012 figure, indexed) are allowed to be open every day of the year. Still in many small towns shops are usually closed on Saturday after 2 pm and on Sunday. Some small shops are closed on Monday.

===Finland===
Sunday shopping was first introduced in 1994.

In 1989 shops were allowed to be open on Sundays in sparsely populated areas. In the autumn of 1994 the law was extended to apply to the conurbanations i.e. densely populated areas, but only in December and on six specifically designated Sundays.

In 1997 it was legislated that the grocery shops could be open on Sundays during the whole summer. At the same time the closing hour was set at later; 21:00.

In 2000 small markets — less than 400 m2 in sales area — were encouraged to be open on Sundays all year around, with the exception of four days. Also the legislation concerning (super)markets bigger than 400 m2 in sales area was clarified by discarding the law of six designated Sundays and replacing it with Sunday opening hours from May to August and from November to December.

On 15 December 2015, the Finnish parliament voted to remove all opening hour restrictions for all retailers. The law came into effect on 1 January 2016.

Many stores are open every day. Larger supermarkets and hypermarkets are open from 7:00 or 8:00 to 21:00 or 22:00, and smaller shops from 10:00 to 18:00 or 19:00.

The only stores with regulated hours are the nationally owned Alko alcohol shops, which are open from 9:00 to 21:00 on weekdays and from 9:00 to 18:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays all Alko stores are closed.

The sale of alcoholic beverages of over 2.8% is limited from 9:00 to 21:00 on each day of the week.

===Germany===
In Germany, shopping days and opening hours were previously regulated by a federal law called the &quot;Shop Closing Law&quot; (&quot;Ladenschlussgesetz&quot;), first enacted in 1956 and last revised on 13 March 2003. On 7 July 2006, however, the federal government handed over the authority to regulate shopping hours to the sixteen states (&quot;Länder&quot;). Since then, states have been allowed to pass their own laws regulating opening hours.

The federal &quot;Ladenschlussgesetz&quot; still applies in Bavaria and Saarland, which have not passed their own laws. Under this law, shops may not open prior to 6 am and may not stay open later than 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday. Shops must also stay closed on Sundays and public holidays (both federal and state), and special rules apply concerning Christmas Eve (December 24) should that day fall on a weekday.

There are several exceptions, including petrol stations and shops located in railway stations and airports, which may stay open past the normal hours. Most petrol stations in larger cities, and all situated on Autobahns, are open twenty-four hours. Shops in so-called &quot;tourist zones&quot; may also open outside the normal hours, but they are restricted to selling souvenirs, handcrafted articles and similar tourist items. In connection with fairs and public market days, communities are allowed four days per year (normally Sundays) on which shops may open outside the normal restrictions; such shop openings may not take place during primary church services and they must close by 6 pm. Bakeries may open for business at 5.30 am and may also open for a limited time on Sundays. Restaurants, bars, theatres, and cultural establishments are generally unaffected by the shop opening time restrictions. As most public holidays in Germany are religiously based, and since the religious holidays (Protestant and Catholic) are not uniform across Germany, shops may be closed due to a public holiday in one state, and open in a neighbouring state. Bavaria even differentiates between cities with Protestant or Catholic majorities.

The &quot;Ladenschlussgesetz&quot; has been the subject of controversy, as larger stores (and many of their customers) would prefer to have fewer restrictions on shopping hours, while trade unions, small shop owners and the church are opposed to a further loosening of the rules. On June 9, 2004, the German supreme court (&quot;Bundesverfassungsgericht&quot;) rejected a claim by the German department store chain &quot;Kaufhof AG&quot; that the shop-closing law was unconstitutional. Among other things, the court cited Article 140 of the German constitution &quot;(Grundgesetz)&quot; (which in turn invokes Article 139 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution) protecting Sundays and public holidays as days of rest and recuperation. Nonetheless, the court in effect invited the federal parliament (&quot;Bundestag&quot;) to reconsider whether the states should regulate hours instead of the federal government.

So far, no state has passed a regulation that allows general store opening on Sundays.

*Baden-Württemberg
*Berlin
*Brandenburg
*Bremen
*Hamburg
*Hesse

*Bavaria
*Saarland

===Ireland===
Shops in Ireland may, with few exceptions (such as those involved in the sale of alcohol), open whenever they want, including Sundays and public holidays.

Here are typical hours:

*Monday - Wednesday, Saturday: 8:00/9:00/10:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00
*Thursday - Friday: 8:00/9:00/10:00 - 20:00/21:00/22:00
*Sunday: 9:00/10:00/11:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00

Many supermarkets are open twenty-four hours or have longer opening hours (like 8:00 - 22:00) every day.

Large shopping centres are typically open longer hours every day (e.g. 09:00 - 21:00/22:00 weekdays, 09:00 - 19:00 Saturdays, 10:00 - 19:00 Sundays).

In the two weeks running up to Christmas, it is common for many shops to have extended opening hours; some may operate twenty-four hours however the 24 hr openings are extremely uncommon and would be mainly in the large cities. On Christmas Eve most shops have shut their doors by 6 pm, some close by 3 pm.

Most shops (other than petrol stations or convenience stores) in smaller towns and villages don&#x27;t open at all on Sundays. Almost all shops (except certain petrol stations, convenience stores) are closed on Christmas Day, though most are open on all other holidays.

Convenience stores and some chemists (drugstores) normally open at 09:00 and close between 18:00 and 21:00. New Year&#x27;s Day is also Sunday hours.

In rural areas or in traditional trades, Businesses used to take a half day on Wednesdays, however this no longer happens.

Alcohol is allowed to be sold only between 10:30 and 22:00 from Monday to Saturday and 12:30 to 22:00 on Sundays, but this does not affect opening hours (supermarkets will often block access to alcoholic products outside of these times). Alcohol can now be sold on Good Friday as-well as having the pubs open.

===Japan===
In Japan, most shops open at 10:00, and close at 20:00 (8 pm). Banks are open from 09:00-15:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends; post offices are open from 09:00-17:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends. Convenience stores are open round the clock.

===Mexico===
In Mexico City, in large shopping centers, stores are generally open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., and on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Restaurant and cinema hours are different, as are those of independent shops and markets.

===Netherlands===
Regular opening hours are Monday 11:00 - 18:00; Tuesday-Friday: 09:30 - 18:00; Saturday: 09:30 - 17:00; Sunday (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Almere, Leiden and smaller tourist towns): 12:00 - 18:00. In many other towns shops are open every first Sunday of the month (&quot;koopzondag&quot;).

Shops are allowed to stay open until 22:00 from Monday to Saturday. Except in busy tourist areas, in or near railway stations, or for big box retailers such as Media Markt, most close at 18:00 on weekdays, and 17:00 on Saturdays, unlike Germany where retailers have taken fuller advantage of liberalization laws and most stay open till at least 19:30. Many supermarkets (including outlets of the market leader Albert Heijn, several DIY stores and IKEA) stay open until 20:00, 21:00 or 22:00. Most towns have their weekly shopping evening (&quot;koopavond&quot;), when shops stay open until 21:00, on Thursday or Friday. In touristic towns (like Amsterdam&#x27;s city centre) supermarkets are allowed to open on Sundays between 07:00 and 22:00. Many towns have one or more supermarkets (&quot;avondwinkels&quot;) that are open until later in the evening, occasionally all night. Convenience stores also have longer shopping hours; they are at many larger railway stations (&quot;Albert Heijn to go&quot;) and in some busy streets.

A regular size supermarket that is open until midnight seven days a week is the Albert Heijn at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam (in the landside area of the airport, not just for air travelers).

On public holidays, shops that close on Sundays are usually also closed, and other shops tend to have Sunday opening hours. On Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve almost all shops are closed.

For specific opening hours (&quot;openingstijden&quot;) in the Netherlands there are several websites.

===Serbia===
Shopping hours in Serbia are unregulated. Large supermarkets are usually open from 07:00/07:30/08:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls open at 09:00 or 10:00 and also stay open until 22:00. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, at 15:00 or 16:00.

Unlike neighbouring Croatia, many fast food outlets, bakeries, kiosks and convenience stores in urban areas operate twenty-four hours. Even some hypermarkets, like Tempo and Metro, are open twenty-four hours.

===Singapore===
Shopping hours for shopping malls are usually from 10:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Automotive shops like tire outlets are usually from 09.30 to 19:00. Some supermarkets are open twenty-four hours. Most stores do not open on the first day of Chinese New Year because of low demand patronage. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some shopping malls and stores to shorten their operating hours, a trend that has persisted in certain locations. For instance, several outlets now close as early as 8:30 PM, reflecting changes in consumer behavior and cost management strategies. Despite these adjustments, high footfall areas like Orchard Road continue to maintain extended hours in most establishments to accommodate both locals and tourists.

===Sweden===
In Sweden there is no longer any law regarding shopping hours except for the nationally owned Systembolaget alcohol shops, which close at 20:00 at the latest on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays no alcohol is sold at all, although it is served in restaurants. Shopping centres and food shops are generally open every day; grocery stores often until 22:00 all days of the week and shopping centers usually until 20:00 on weekdays and 18:00 on weekends. Usually shopping centers are closed on New Year&#x27;s Day, Midsummer&#x27;s Day and Christmas Day, but grocery stores are open even those days albeit fewer hours than usual. Although there aren&#x27;t any law that regulate business hours in general, labour laws do not allow work between midnight and 5 am in many professions including grocery stores and most shops.

===Switzerland===
Shopping hours are governed by cantonal law and vary accordingly, the only confederally mandated store holiday being August 1 (the national holiday), as per article 110 III of the Swiss Constitution. Most often, stores will be open from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, 9 pm one day a week (usually a Thursday or a Friday) depending on the region. On Saturday and the day before public holidays, most stores close at around 4 or 5 pm. Stores are also generally closed on Sundays; see Sunday shopping in Switzerland.

===United Kingdom===
In Great Britain, many retail stores are open every day. Some large supermarkets are open for twenty-four hours, (except on Sundays in England and Wales). Most stores do not open on Easter Sunday, New Year&#x27;s Day or Christmas Day and have reduced hours on other public and bank holidays.

Typical store shopping hours:
*Mondays - Saturdays: 9:00 am to 5:30 pm, or 10:00 am to 8:00 pm/10:00 pm.
*Sundays: 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, or 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, or 12 noon to 6:00 pm.

Sunday shopping has become more popular, and most but not all shops in towns and cities are open for business. Shops 280 m2 and larger in England and Wales are allowed to trade for only six hours on Sundays; shops in Northern Ireland may open from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In Scotland, in theory, Sunday is considered the same as any other day, and there are no restrictions. In practice, however, some shops do not open on Sunday or open for only four hours in smaller towns. In some Free Church dominated areas, for example Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Sunday is considered a day of rest and consequently very few if any shops open at all.

===United States===
In the United States, the various levels of government generally do not regulate the hours of the vast majority of retailers (though there are exceptions, such as the blue law), and with the main exception being shops licensed to sell spirits and other alcoholic beverages (for shopping hours, see alcohol sale hours by state) and car dealerships. Shopping hours vary widely based on management considerations and customer needs. Key variables are the size of the metropolitan area, the type of store, and the size of the store.

Las Vegas, Nevada is the notable exception to all the traditions just described. Las Vegas is world-famous for its 24-hour local culture since it is an area with large gaming and tourism industries that operate 24/7. Since many of the employees in the city&#x27;s primary industries work overnight shifts — and because Nevada has few laws in regard to operating hours for any type of commercial activity — many businesses cater to such workers. Thus, Las Vegas is home to many 24-hour car dealerships, dental clinics, auto mechanics, computer shops, and even some smaller clothing stores.

Typical store shopping hours:
* Monday - Saturday 9 - 10 a.m. to 8 - 10 p.m. (9:00 - 10:00 to 20:00 - 22:00)
* Sunday 11 - 12 noon to 5 - 7 p.m. (11:00 - 12:00 to 17:00 - 19:00)

Supermarkets usually open at earlier hours, between 6 or 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (7:00 - 22:00) every day. Boutiques and smaller shops often close early at 5 or 6 p.m. (17:00 or 18:00), and usually close once or twice a week, most often on Sunday.

Nearly all stores are closed on Easter, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In recent years, however, several department stores and discount stores have started opening during the evening on Thanksgiving Day; see Black Friday for more details. Early closing (half days) occur on Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Some stores might have reduced hours on other major holidays.

All malls and department stores, as well as most other stores remain open longer hours between Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas Eve for Christmas and holiday shopping. Many are open until 11 p.m. (23:00), and a few even longer.

Few stores remain open twenty-four hours; the main exceptions to this rule are most Walmarts throughout the country (especially Supercenters, which combine a discount store and full supermarket); many convenience stores, especially those that also sell motor fuel; and some drug stores like CVS, especially in larger cities like New York City and Las Vegas.

Some stores, especially in suburban and rural areas, might remain closed on Sundays for any reason (such as most retail in Bergen County, New Jersey due to the blue law, which is next to New York City, and home to four major malls and has the largest retail in the nation).

<doc id="167183" wikidata="Q2245959" url="?curid=167183" title="Thiotimoline">
<text>Thiotimoline is a fictitious chemical compound conceived by American biochemist and science fiction author Isaac Asimov. It was first described in a spoof scientific paper titled &quot;The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline&quot; in 1948. The major peculiarity of the chemical is its &quot;endochronicity&quot;: it starts dissolving before it makes contact with water.

Asimov went on to write three additional short stories, each describing different properties or uses of thiotimoline.

==Chemical properties==

In Asimov&#x27;s writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule, there is at least one carbon atom such that, while two of the carbon&#x27;s four chemical bonds lie in normal space and time, one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past. Thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the (fictitious) shrub &quot;Rosacea karlsbadensis rufo&quot;, and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen hydroxy groups, two amino groups, and one sulfonic acid group, and possibly one nitro compound group as well. The nature of the hydrocarbon nucleus is unknown, although it seems in part to be an aromatic hydrocarbon.

==Background==
In 1947 Asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and, as part of his experimental procedure, he needed to dissolve catechol in water. As he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water&#x27;s surface, it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble, then it would dissolve &quot;before&quot; it encountered the water.

By that time Asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation. He feared that the experience of writing readable prose for publication (i.e. science fiction) might have impaired his ability to write the turgid prose typical of academic discourse, and decided to practice with a spoof article (including charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles in nonexistent journals) describing experiments on a compound, thiotimoline, that was so soluble that it dissolved in water up to 1.12 seconds before the water was added.

Asimov wrote the article on 8 June 1947, but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable. John W. Campbell, the editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, accepted it for publication on 10 June, agreeing to Asimov&#x27;s request that it appear under a pseudonym in deference to Asimov&#x27;s concern that he might alienate potential doctoral examiners at Columbia University if he were revealed as the author.

Some months later Asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the March 1948 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; under his own name, and copies of the issue circulated at the Columbia chemistry department. Asimov believed that Campbell had done so out of greater wisdom. His examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline, resulting in him having to be led from the room while laughing hysterically with relief. The article made Asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction, as chemists shared copies of the article. He heard that many children went to the New York Public Library trying to find the nonexistent journals.

==&quot;The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline&quot;==
In 1952, Asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called &quot;The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline&quot;. Like the first, it included charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles from fake journals (along with one real citation: Asimov&#x27;s own earlier spoof article from &quot;Astounding&quot;, which was listed tongue-in-cheek as the &quot;Journal of Astounding Science Fiction&quot;). This second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of &quot;certain mental disorders&quot;. It also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline&#x27;s behaviour: namely that the chemical bonds in the compound&#x27;s structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension. According to the second article, thiotimoline&#x27;s time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water. It also claims that one effect is that when people with multiple personalities add the water, some parts of the thiotimoline dissolve before others, due to some of the individual&#x27;s personalities being more determined than others. &quot;The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline&quot; appeared in the December 1953 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;.

The first two thiotimoline &quot;articles&quot; appeared together in Asimov&#x27;s first collection of science essays, &quot;Only a Trillion&quot; (1957), under the joint title &quot;The Marvellous Properties of Thiotimoline&quot;. Asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection &quot;The Early Asimov&quot;. The first article also appeared in &quot;Fifty Years of the Best Science Fiction from Analog &quot; (Davis Publications, 1982).

==&quot;Thiotimoline and the Space Age&quot;==
Asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 November 1959 called &quot;Thiotimoline and the Space Age&quot;. Instead of a fake scientific paper, this third article took the form of an address by Asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the American Chronochemical Society, a nonexistent scientific society. In his address, Asimov &quot;describes&quot; his first experiments with thiotimoline in July 1947, and timing the compound&#x27;s dissolution with the original endochronometer, &quot;the same instrument now at the Smithsonian&quot;. Asimov laments the skepticism with which chronochemistry has been greeted in America, noting with sorrow that his address has only attracted fifteen attendees. He then contrasts the thriving state of chronochemistry in the Soviet Union, with the research town of Khrushchevsk, nicknamed &quot;Tiotimolingrad&quot;, established in the Urals.

According to Asimov, two Scottish researchers have developed a &quot;telechronic battery&quot;, which uses a series of 77,000 interconnected endochronometers to allow a final sample of thiotimoline to dissolve up to a day before water is added to an initial sample. Asimov says there is &quot;strong, if indirect, evidence that the Soviet Union possesses even more sophisticated devices and is turning them out in commercial quantities&quot;. He believes that the Soviets are using telechronic batteries to determine ahead of time whether satellite launches will be successful.

Finally, Asimov describes attempts to create a &quot;Heisenberg failure&quot;, to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it. In every case where the thiotimoline dissolved, some accident occurred that caused some water to be added to it at the proper time. Several attempts to create a Heisenberg failure in the mid-1950s coincided with a series of hurricanes striking New England in such a manner as to suggest that nature would find a way to add water whatever man decided, if man were to be resolute in not adding water. Asimov speculated that Noah&#x27;s flood might have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient Sumerians. He then concludes with some speculation about thiotimoline&#x27;s potential applications as a weapon of mass destruction by deliberately using it to artificially induce hurricanes.

&quot;Thiotimoline and the Space Age&quot; appeared in the October 1960 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;, which was then in the final stages of changing its name to &quot;Analog&quot;. The article was reprinted in full in &quot;Opus 100&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Asimov Chronicles: Fifty Years of Isaac Asimov&quot; (1989).

==&quot;Thiotimoline to the Stars&quot;==
Asimov&#x27;s final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled &quot;Thiotimoline to the Stars&quot;, which he wrote for Harry Harrison&#x27;s anthology &quot;&quot; (1973). In it, Admiral Vernon, Commandant of the Astronautic Academy, gives a speech to the graduating &quot;Class of &#x27;22&quot;. Vernon&#x27;s speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi-mythical scientist named Azimuth or Asymptote, but that serious study of the compound didn&#x27;t begin until the 21st century scientist Almirante worked out the theory of hypersteric hindrance. Later scientists worked out ways to form endochronic molecules into polymers, allowing large structures such as spaceships to be built out of endochronic materials. One effect of endochronicity is that if one fails to add water to an object that has reacted to water, the object will travel into the future in search of water to interact with.

An individual with sufficient inborn talent, Vernon explains, can perfectly balance a starship&#x27;s endochronicity with relativistic time dilation, so that a ship traveling at relativistic speeds can age at the same rate as the rest of the universe, allowing it to return to its starting point within months, rather than centuries, of its departure. Vernon emphasizes that starship pilots are expected to match endochronicity with relativity exactly: a sixty-second difference between the two is regarded as barely acceptable, and a 120-second difference is considered grounds for dismissal. Vernon also emphasizes that endochronic molecules are unstable, and must be renewed before each trip, so that an endochronic ship that finds itself lost might not have sufficient endochronicity to return to its proper time. A ship that finds itself in the future might be able to re-endochronize itself if the technology still exists; a ship that finds itself in the past will be marooned there.

Finally, Vernon reveals that the auditorium where he is giving his speech is actually an endochronic starship, and that during his speech, they have all flown to the outskirts of the Solar System. The graduates felt no acceleration because canceling out time dilation also caused the canceling out of inertia. When Vernon concludes his speech, the graduates will be landing in the United Nations Port at Lincoln, Nebraska, where they will be spending the weekend.

After they land, Vernon receives an awful shock and passes out when his pilot informs him that the ship is surrounded by Indians. Vernon wrongly assumed the pilot meant Red Indians, and thought that they had landed centuries in the past. But the pilot only meant that they had landed at the correct time but near Calcutta, India.

Asimov included &quot;Thiotimoline to the Stars&quot; in his 1975 collection &quot;Buy Jupiter and Other Stories&quot;.

==Other references to thiotimoline==
In Glen Bever&#x27;s story &quot;And Silently Vanish Away&quot; a chemist with the unique ability to use psychokinetic catalysis to speed up difficult reactions is shocked by a lab explosion and the mixture he was working on gets changed. Under analysis the structure never appears to be the same twice and when the substance is injected into lab rats they start to silently and suddenly vanish. It is found that one part of the compound is a molecule which spreads out into four dimensions. The four-dimensional molecule is thiotimoline. The story appeared in the November 1971 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;.

Topi H. Barr&#x27;s story &quot;Antithiotimoline&quot; deals with a chemist who accidentally creates a thiotimoline-like compound which extrudes only into the past, enabling the scientist to create images of past events. The narrator complains that thiotimoline is extremely difficult to obtain, and suspects that the CIA or other agencies are controlling the supply for their own reasons. The story appeared in the December 1977 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;.

Spider Robinson&#x27;s story &quot;Mirror mirror, off the wall&quot;, published in &quot;Time Travelers Strictly Cash&quot; in 1981, also references thiotimoline.

In Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1989 story &quot;The Asenion Solution&quot;, thiotimoline is used to send excess quantities of plutonium-186 to the end of time, where they will fall over the brink into anti-time and lead to the Big Bang. &quot;The Asenion Solution&quot; appeared in the Asimov festschrift &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot;.

The November/December 2001 and March/April 2002 issues of the IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers included spoof articles on the use of thiotimoline for debugging computers.

In the game &quot;We Happy Few&quot;, a mysterious liquid called &quot;motilene&quot; acts as the primary source of electrical power in the setting, and is pumped throughout the city in pipes in lieu of a traditional electrical grid, or alternatively placed into special jars to act as portable batteries. A research note can be found in one location which makes reference to &quot;thiomotilene crystals&quot; and their &quot;endochronic properties&quot;, which in turn strongly suggests motilene&#x27;s name be derived from thiotimoline.

<text>Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep or REMS) is a unique phase of sleep in mammals (including humans) and birds, characterized by random rapid movement of the eyes, accompanied by low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly. The core body and brain temperatures increase during REM sleep and skin temperature decreases to lowest values.

The REM phase is also known as paradoxical sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep or dreamy sleep, because of physiological similarities to waking states including rapid, low-voltage desynchronized brain waves. Electrical and chemical activity regulating this phase seem to originate in the brain stem, and is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of monoamine neurotransmitters histamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. Experiences of REM sleep are not transferred to permanent memory due to absence of norepinephrine.

REM sleep is physiologically different from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as non-REM sleep (NREM sleep, NREMS, synchronized sleep). The absence of visual and auditory stimulation (sensory deprivation) during REM sleep can cause hallucinations. REM and non-REM sleep alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of REM sleep. The transition to REM sleep brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called &quot;ponto-geniculo-occipital waves&quot; (PGO waves) originating in the brain stem. REM sleep occurs 4 times in a 7-hour sleep. Organisms in REM sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.

In 1953, Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye movement and linked it to dreams. REM sleep was further described by researchers, including William Dement and Michel Jouvet. Many experiments have involved awakening test subjects whenever they begin to enter the REM phase, thereby producing a state known as REM deprivation. Subjects allowed to sleep normally again usually experience a modest REM rebound. Techniques of neurosurgery, chemical injection, electroencephalography, positron emission tomography, and reports of dreamers upon waking have all been used to study this phase of sleep.

== Physiology ==

=== Electrical activity in the brain===

REM sleep is called &quot;paradoxical&quot; because of its similarities to wakefulness. Although the body is paralyzed, the brain acts as if it is somewhat awake, with cerebral neurons firing with the same overall intensity as in wakefulness. Electroencephalography during REM deep sleep reveals fast, low amplitude, desynchronized neural oscillation (brainwaves) that resemble the pattern seen during wakefulness, which differ from the slow δ (delta) waves pattern of NREM deep sleep. An important element of this contrast is the 3–10 Hz theta rhythm in the hippocampus and 40–60 Hz gamma waves in the cortex; patterns of EEG activity similar to these rhythms are also observed during wakefulness. The cortical and thalamic neurons in the waking and REM sleeping brain are more depolarized (fire more readily) than in the NREM deep sleeping brain. Human theta wave activity predominates during REM sleep in both the hippocampus and the cortex.

During REM sleep, electrical connectivity among different parts of the brain manifests differently than during wakefulness. Frontal and posterior areas are less coherent in most frequencies, a fact which has been cited in relation to the chaotic experience of dreaming. However, the posterior areas are more coherent with each other; as are the right and left hemispheres of the brain, especially during lucid dreams.

Brain energy use in REM sleep, as measured by oxygen and glucose metabolism, equals or exceeds energy use in waking. The rate in non-REM sleep is 11–40% lower.

==== Brain stem ====
Neural activity during REM sleep seems to originate in the brain stem, especially the pontine tegmentum and locus coeruleus. REM sleep is punctuated and immediately preceded by PGO (ponto-geniculo-occipital) waves, bursts of electrical activity originating in the brain stem. (PGO waves have long been measured directly in cats but not in humans because of constraints on experimentation; however, comparable effects have been observed in humans during &quot;phasic&quot; events which occur during REM sleep, and the existence of similar PGO waves is thus inferred.) These waves occur in clusters about every 6 seconds for 1–2 minutes during the transition from deep to paradoxical sleep. They exhibit their highest amplitude upon moving into the visual cortex and are a cause of the &quot;rapid eye movements&quot; in paradoxical sleep. Other muscles may also contract under the influence of these waves.

==== Forebrain ====

Research in the 1990s using positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed the role of the brain stem and suggested that, within the forebrain, the limbic and paralimbic systems showed more activation than other areas. The areas activated during REM sleep are approximately inverse to those activated during non-REM sleep and display greater activity than in quiet waking. The &quot;anterior paralimbic REM activation area&quot; (APRA) includes areas linked with emotion, memory, fear and sex, and may thus relate to the experience of dreaming during REMS. More recent PET research has indicated that the distribution of brain activity during REM sleep varies in correspondence with the type of activity seen in the prior period of wakefulness.

The superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, and superior parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity in REM sleep as in wakefulness. The amygdala is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental suppression of the amygdala results in less REM sleep. The amygdala may also regulate cardiac function in lieu of the less active insular cortex.

=== Chemicals in the brain ===

Compared to slow-wave sleep, both waking and paradoxical sleep involve higher use of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which may cause the faster brainwaves. The monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine are completely unavailable. Injections of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which effectively increases available acetylcholine, have been found to induce paradoxical sleep in humans and other animals already in slow-wave sleep. Carbachol, which mimics the effect of acetylcholine on neurons, has a similar influence. In waking humans, the same injections produce paradoxical sleep only if the monoamine neurotransmitters have already been depleted.

Two other neurotransmitters, orexin and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), seem to promote wakefulness, diminish during deep sleep, and inhibit paradoxical sleep.

Unlike the abrupt transitions in electrical patterns, the chemical changes in the brain show continuous periodic oscillation.

==== Models of REM regulation ====

According to the activation-synthesis hypothesis proposed by Robert McCarley and Allan Hobson in 1975–1977, control over REM sleep involves pathways of &quot;REM-on&quot; and &quot;REM-off&quot; neurons in the brain stem. REM-on neurons are primarily cholinergic (i.e., involve acetylcholine); REM-off neurons activate serotonin and noradrenaline, which among other functions suppress the REM-on neurons. McCarley and Hobson suggested that the REM-on neurons actually stimulate REM-off neurons, thereby serving as the mechanism for the cycling between REM and non-REM sleep. They used Lotka–Volterra equations to describe this cyclical inverse relationship. Kayuza Sakai and Michel Jouvet advanced a similar model in 1981. Whereas acetylcholine manifests in the cortex equally during wakefulness and REM, it appears in higher concentrations in the brain stem during REM. The withdrawal of orexin and GABA may cause the absence of the other excitatory neurotransmitters; researchers in recent years increasingly include GABA regulation in their models.

=== Eye movements ===
Most of the eye movements in &quot;rapid eye movement&quot; sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration and more likely to loop back to their starting point. About seven such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep, the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem. These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for procedural memory processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the brain processing the eye-related procedural memory.

=== Circulation, respiration, and thermoregulation ===

Generally speaking, the body suspends homeostasis during paradoxical sleep. Heart rate, cardiac pressure, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and breathing rate quickly become irregular when the body moves into REM sleep. In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking.

Erections of the penis (nocturnal penile tumescence or NPT) normally accompany REM sleep in rats and humans. If a male has erectile dysfunction (ED) while awake, but has NPT episodes during REM, it would suggest that the ED is from a psychological rather than a physiological cause. In females, erection of the clitoris (nocturnal clitoral tumescence or NCT) causes enlargement, with accompanying vaginal blood flow and transudation (i.e. lubrication). During a normal night of sleep, the penis and clitoris may be erect for a total time of from one hour to as long as three and a half hours during REM.

Body temperature is not well regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS—but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons that typically activate in response to cold temperatures—triggers for neural thermoregulation—simply do not fire during REM sleep, as they do in NREM sleep and waking.

Consequently, hot or cold environmental temperatures can reduce the proportion of REM sleep, as well as amount of total sleep. In other words, if at the end of a phase of deep sleep, the organism&#x27;s thermal indicators fall outside of a certain range, it will not enter paradoxical sleep lest deregulation allow temperature to drift further from the desirable value. This mechanism can be &#x27;fooled&#x27; by artificially warming the brain.

=== Muscle ===

REM atonia, an almost complete paralysis of the body, is accomplished through the inhibition of motor neurons. When the body shifts into REM sleep, motor neurons throughout the body undergo a process called hyperpolarization: their already-negative membrane potential decreases by another 2–10 millivolts, thereby raising the threshold which a stimulus must overcome to excite them. Muscle inhibition may result from unavailability of monoamine neurotransmitters (restraining the abundance of acetylcholine in the brainstem) and perhaps from mechanisms used in waking muscle inhibition. The medulla oblongata, located between pons and spine, seems to have the capacity for organism-wide muscle inhibition. Some localized twitching and reflexes can still occur. Pupils contract.

Lack of REM atonia causes REM behavior disorder, where those affected physically act out their dreams, or conversely &quot;dream out their acts&quot;, under an alternative theory on the relationship between muscle impulses during REM and associated mental imagery (which would also apply to people without the condition, except that commands to their muscles are suppressed). This is different from conventional sleepwalking, which takes place during slow-wave sleep, not REM. Narcolepsy, by contrast, seems to involve excessive and unwanted REM atonia: cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness while awake, hypnagogic hallucinations before entering slow-wave sleep, or sleep paralysis while waking. Other psychiatric disorders including depression have been linked to disproportionate REM sleep. Patients with suspected sleep disorders are typically evaluated by polysomnogram.

Lesions of the pons to prevent atonia have induced functional &quot;REM behavior disorder&quot; in animals.

== Psychology ==

=== Dreaming ===
Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) has since its discovery been closely associated with dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer, more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. (In fact these could be considered a hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (e.g., experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes, they include elements of the dreamer&#x27;s recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.

Hobson and McCarley proposed that the PGO waves characteristic of &quot;phasic&quot; REM might supply the visual cortex and forebrain with electrical excitement which amplifies the hallucinatory aspects of dreaming. However, people woken up during sleep do not report significantly more bizarre dreams during phasic REMS, compared to tonic REMS. Another possible relationship between the two phenomena could be that the higher threshold for sensory interruption during REM sleep allows the brain to travel further along unrealistic and peculiar trains of thought.

Some dreaming can take place during non-REM sleep. &quot;Light sleepers&quot; can experience dreaming during stage 2 non-REM sleep, whereas &quot;deep sleepers&quot;, upon awakening in the same stage, are more likely to report &quot;thinking&quot; but not &quot;dreaming&quot;. Certain scientific efforts to assess the uniquely bizarre nature of dreams experienced while asleep were forced to conclude that waking thought could be just as bizarre, especially in conditions of sensory deprivation. Because of non-REM dreaming, some sleep researchers have strenuously contested the importance of connecting dreaming to the REM sleep phase. The prospect that well-known neurological aspects of REM do not themselves cause dreaming suggests the need to re-examine the neurobiology of dreaming &quot;per se&quot;. Some researchers (Dement, Hobson, Jouvet, for example) tend to resist the idea of disconnecting dreaming from REM sleep.

==== Effects of SSRIs ====
Previous research has shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have an important effect on REM sleep neurobiology and dreaming. A study at Harvard Medical School in 2000 tested the effects of paroxetine and fluvoxamine on healthy young adult male and females for 31 days: a drug-free baseline week, 19 days on either paroxetine or fluvoxamine with morning and evening doses, and 5 days of absolute discontinuation. Results showed that SSRI treatment decreased the average amount of dream recall frequency in comparison to baseline measurements as a result of serotonergic REM suppression. Fluvoxamine increased the length of dream reporting, bizarreness of dreams as well as the intensity of REM sleep. These effects were the greatest during acute discontinuation compared to treatment and baseline days. However, the &quot;subjective&quot; intensity of dreaming increased and the proclivity to enter REM sleep was decreased during SSRI treatment compared to baseline and discontinuation days.

=== Creativity ===

After waking from REM sleep, the mind seems &quot;hyperassociative&quot;—more receptive to semantic priming effects. People awakened from REM have performed better on tasks like anagrams and creative problem solving.

Sleep aids the process by which creativity forms associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. This occurs in REM sleep rather than in NREM sleep. Rather than being due to memory processes, this has been attributed to changes during REM sleep in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation. High levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from hippocampus to the neocortex, while lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the uncontrolled spread of associational activity within neocortical areas. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. REM sleep through this process adds creativity by allowing &quot;neocortical structures to reorganise associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.&quot;

== Timing ==
In the &quot;ultradian sleep cycle&quot;, an organism alternates between deep sleep (slow, large, synchronized brain waves) and paradoxical sleep (faster, desynchronized waves). Sleep happens in the context of the larger circadian rhythm, which influences sleepiness and physiological factors based on timekeepers within the body. Sleep can be distributed throughout the day or clustered during one part of the rhythm: in nocturnal animals, during the day, and in diurnal animals, at night. The organism returns to homeostatic regulation almost immediately after REM sleep ends.

During a night of sleep, humans usually experience about four or five periods of REM sleep; they are shorter (~15 min) at the beginning of the night and longer (~25 min) toward the end. Many animals and some people tend to wake, or experience a period of very light sleep, for a short time immediately after a bout of REM. The relative amount of REM sleep varies considerably with age. A newborn baby spends more than 80% of total sleep time in REM.

REM sleep typically occupies 20–25% of total sleep in adult humans: about 90–120 minutes of a night&#x27;s sleep. The first REM episode occurs about 70 minutes after falling asleep. Cycles of about 90 minutes each follow, with each cycle including a larger proportion of REM sleep. (The increased REM sleep later in the night is connected with the circadian rhythm and occurs even in people who did not sleep in the first part of the night.)

In the weeks after a human baby is born, as its nervous system matures, neural patterns in sleep begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM sleep. (In faster-developing mammals, this process occurs in utero.) Infants spend more time in REM sleep than adults. The proportion of REM sleep then decreases significantly in childhood. Older people tend to sleep less overall, but sleep in REM for about the same absolute time (and therefore spend a greater proportion of sleep in REM).

Rapid eye movement sleep can be subclassified into tonic and phasic modes. Tonic REM is characterized by theta rhythms in the brain; phasic REM is characterized by PGO waves and actual &quot;rapid&quot; eye movements. Processing of external stimuli is heavily inhibited during phasic REM, and recent evidence suggests that sleepers are more difficult to arouse from phasic REM than in slow-wave sleep.

== Deprivation effects ==
Selective REMS deprivation causes a significant increase in the number of attempts to go into REM stage while asleep. On recovery nights, an individual will usually move to stage 3 and REM sleep more quickly and experience a REM rebound, which refers to an increase in the time spent in REM stage over normal levels. These findings are consistent with the idea that REM sleep is biologically necessary. However, the &quot;rebound&quot; REM sleep usually does not last fully as long as the estimated length of the missed REM periods.
After the deprivation is complete, mild psychological disturbances, such as anxiety, irritability, hallucinations, and difficulty concentrating may develop and appetite may increase. There are also positive consequences of REM deprivation. Some symptoms of depression are found to be suppressed by REM deprivation; aggression may increase, and eating behavior may get disrupted. Higher norepinepherine is a possible cause of these results. Whether and how long-term REM deprivation has psychological effects remains a matter of controversy. Several reports have indicated that REM deprivation increases aggression and sexual behavior in laboratory test animals. Rats deprived of paradoxical sleep die in 4–6 weeks (twice the time before death in case of total sleep deprivation). Mean body temperature falls continually during this period.

It has been suggested that acute REM sleep deprivation can improve certain types of depression—when depression appears to be related to an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters. Although sleep deprivation in general annoys most of the population, it has repeatedly been shown to alleviate depression, albeit temporarily. More than half the individuals who experience this relief report it to be rendered ineffective after sleeping the following night. Thus, researchers have devised methods such as altering the sleep schedule for a span of days following a REM deprivation period and combining sleep-schedule alterations with pharmacotherapy to prolong this effect. Antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and stimulants (such as amphetamine, methylphenidate and cocaine) interfere with REM sleep by stimulating the monoamine neurotransmitters which must be suppressed for REM sleep to occur. Administered at therapeutic doses, these drugs may stop REM sleep entirely for weeks or months. Withdrawal causes a REM rebound. Sleep deprivation stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis much as antidepressants do, but whether this effect is driven by REM sleep in particular is unknown.

==In other animals==

Although it manifests differently in different animals, REM sleep or something like it occurs in all land mammals—as well as in birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM.

The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators experience more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay in REM for longer, possibly because higher thermal inertia of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation. The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats. In utero, mammals spend more than half (50–80%) of a 24-hour day in REM sleep.

Sleeping reptiles do not seem to have PGO waves or the localized brain activation seen in mammalian REM. However, they do exhibit sleep cycles with phases of REM-like electrical activity measurable by EEG. A recent study found periodic eye movements in the central bearded dragon of Australia, leading its authors to speculate that the common ancestor of amniotes may therefore have manifested some precursor to REMS.

Observations of jumping spiders in their nocturnal resting position also suggest a REM sleep-like state characterized by bouts of twitching and retinal movements and hints of muscle atonia (legs curling up as a result of pressure loss caused by muscle atonia in the prosoma).

Sleep deprivation experiments on non-human animals can be set up differently than those on humans. The &quot;flower pot&quot; method involves placing a laboratory animal above water on a platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of brain waves, complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the test animal drifts into REM sleep.

==Possible functions==
Some researchers argue that the perpetuation of a complex brain process such as REM sleep indicates that it serves an important function for the survival of mammalian and avian species. It fulfills important physiological needs vital for survival to the extent that prolonged REM sleep deprivation leads to death in experimental animals. In both humans and experimental animals, REM sleep loss leads to several behavioral and physiological abnormalities. Loss of REM sleep has been noticed during various natural and experimental infections. Survivability of the experimental animals decreases when REM sleep is totally attenuated during infection; this leads to the possibility that the quality and quantity of REM sleep is generally essential for normal body physiology. Further, the existence of a &quot;REM rebound&quot; effect suggests the possibility of a biological need for REM sleep.

While the precise function of REM sleep is not well understood, several theories have been proposed.

===Memory===
Sleep in general aids memory. REM sleep may favor the preservation of certain types of memories: specifically, procedural memory, spatial memory, and emotional memory. In rats, REM sleep increases following intensive learning, especially several hours after, and sometimes for multiple nights. Experimental REM sleep deprivation has sometimes inhibited memory consolidation, especially regarding complex processes (e.g., how to escape from an elaborate maze). In humans, the best evidence for REM&#x27;s improvement of memory pertains to learning of procedures—new ways of moving the body (such as trampoline jumping), and new techniques of problem solving. REM deprivation seemed to impair declarative (i.e., factual) memory only in more complex cases, such as memories of longer stories. REM sleep apparently counteracts attempts to suppress certain thoughts.

According to the &quot;dual-process hypothesis&quot; of sleep and memory, the two major phases of sleep correspond to different types of memory. &quot;Night half&quot; studies have tested this hypothesis with memory tasks either begun before sleep and assessed in the middle of the night, or begun in the middle of the night and assessed in the morning. Slow-wave sleep, part of non-REM sleep, appears to be important for declarative memory. Artificial enhancement of the non-REM sleep improves the next-day recall of memorized pairs of words. Tucker et al. demonstrated that a daytime nap containing solely non-REM sleep enhances declarative memory—but not procedural memory. According to the &quot;sequential hypothesis&quot;, the two types of sleep work together to consolidate memory.

Sleep researcher Jerome Siegel has observed that extreme REM deprivation does not significantly interfere with memory. One case study of an individual who had little or no REM sleep due to a shrapnel injury to the brainstem did not find the individual&#x27;s memory to be impaired. Antidepressants, which suppress REM sleep, show no evidence of impairing memory and may improve it.

Graeme Mitchison and Francis Crick proposed in 1983 that by virtue of its inherent spontaneous activity, the function of REM sleep &quot;is to remove certain undesirable modes of interaction in networks of cells in the cerebral cortex&quot;—a process they characterize as &quot;unlearning&quot;. As a result, those memories which are relevant (whose underlying neuronal substrate is strong enough to withstand such spontaneous, chaotic activation) are further strengthened, whilst weaker, transient, &quot;noise&quot; memory traces disintegrate. Memory consolidation during paradoxical sleep is specifically correlated with the periods of rapid eye movement, which do not occur continuously. One explanation for this correlation is that the PGO electrical waves, which precede the eye movements, also influence memory. REM sleep could provide a unique opportunity for &quot;unlearning&quot; to occur in the basic neural networks involved in homeostasis, which are protected from this &quot;synaptic downscaling&quot; effect during deep sleep.

=== Neural ontogeny ===
REM sleep prevails most after birth, and diminishes with age. According to the &quot;ontogenetic hypothesis&quot;, REM (also known in neonates as &quot;active sleep&quot;) aids the developing brain by providing the neural stimulation that newborns need to form mature neural connections. Sleep deprivation studies have shown that deprivation early in life can result in behavioral problems, permanent sleep disruption, and decreased brain mass. The strongest evidence for the ontogenetic hypothesis comes from experiments on REM deprivation, and from the development of the visual system in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex.

=== Defensive immobilization ===
Ioannis Tsoukalas of Stockholm University has hypothesized that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, cholinergic neurotransmission, paralysis, hippocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.

===Shift of gaze===
According to &quot;scanning hypothesis&quot;, the directional properties of REM sleep are related to a shift of gaze in dream imagery. Against this hypothesis is that such eye movements occur in those born blind and in fetuses in spite of lack of vision. Also, binocular REMs are non-conjugated (i.e., the two eyes do not point in the same direction at a time) and so lack a fixation point. In support of this theory, research finds that in goal-oriented dreams, eye gaze is directed towards the dream action, determined from correlations in the eye and body movements of REM sleep behavior disorder patients who enact their dreams.

===Oxygen supply to cornea===
Dr. David M. Maurice, an eye specialist and former adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep was associated with oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidence, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from the iris had to reach the cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the organism is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the organism is sleeping, REM provides the much needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory is consistent with the observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person&#x27;s REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls experience REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and it is well known that owls&#x27; eyes are nearly immobile.

===Other theories===
Another theory suggests that monoamine shutdown is required so that the monoamine receptors in the brain can recover to regain full sensitivity.

The &quot;sentinel hypothesis&quot; of REM sleep was put forward by Frederick Snyder in 1966. It is based upon the observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.

Jim Horne, a sleep researcher at Loughborough University, has suggested that REM in modern humans compensates for the reduced need for wakeful food foraging.

Other theories are that REM sleep warms the brain, stimulates and stabilizes the neural circuits that have not been activated during waking, or creates internal stimulation to aid development of the CNS; while some argue that REM lacks any purpose, and simply results from random brain activation.

Furthermore, eye movements are also theorized to play a role in certain psychotherapies such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).

<text>Hubli (officially Hubballi) is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka. The twin cities Hubli–Dharwad form the second largest city in the state by area and population and the largest city in North Karnataka. Hubli is in Dharwad district of Karnataka and is the taluk headquarters of Hubli City and Hubli Rural. Although it hosts the HDMC office, the district headquarters is in Dharwad.

It also houses the largest number of government offices outside the state capital. In 2016, Hubli-Dharwad was selected for solar city / green city master plans. In 2017, government of India included Hubli-Dharwad city for a smart city project, a flagship scheme for overall development of infrastructure in the twin-cities.

==Etymology==
The name Hubballi comes from Kannada &quot;Hoovina Balli&quot; which means &quot;Flowering creeper&quot; in Kannada. Hubli is the anglicised version of Hubballi.

==History==
Rayara Hubli, also called &#x27;Eleya Purvada Halli&#x27; or &#x27;Purballi&#x27;, was the old Hubli, and according to an inscription in the Bhavani Shankar Temple, the oldest temple in the city, was founded in the 11th Century. The impressive Chandramauleshwara Temple, Unkal is from Chalukyan times and was built in the 11th or 12th century.

Under Vijayanagara Rayas, Rayara Hubli grew as a commercial centre, famous for trade in cotton, saltpetre and iron. Under the rule of the Adilshahis, the British opened a factory here. The factory was looted by Shivaji in 1673. The Mughals conquered Rayara Hubli and it was then placed under the governance of the Nawab of Savanur, who built a new extension named Majidpura. In 1727, trader Basappa Shettar built the town and fort of new Hubli around the Durgadabail (fort maidan) part of Rayara Hubli.

Hubli&#x27;s famous Moorusavira Matha is claimed to have been established by a Sharana of Basaveshwara&#x27;s period. Hubli was conquered by the Marathas from the Nawab of Savanur in 1755–56. In the following years, Hubli was conquered by Hyder Ali, only to be recaptured by the Marathas in 1790. At this point in time, the old town was administered by a person named Phadke under the Peshwas and the new town was under the administration of the Sangli Patwardhan. The British took Old Hubli from the Peshwas in 1817. The new town, with 47 other villages, was handed over to the British by the Sangli Patwardhan in lieu of subsidy in 1820. Later in 1880, the British started the Railway workshop and with this, Hubli came to be reckoned as an industrial centre in this part of India.

The Sufi shrine, Sayed Fathesha Wali, located near the indipump circle of old Hubli, was visited by Tipu Sultan.

<doc id="167186" wikidata="Q6820548" url="?curid=167186" title="Mersey Ferry">
<text>The Mersey Ferry is a ferry service operating on the River Mersey in northwest England, between Liverpool to the east and Birkenhead and Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula to the west. Ferries have been used on this route since at least the 12th century and continue to be popular for both local people and visitors.

The current fleet consists of two vessels. A third ferry, &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; was in service until 2012. The current ferries originally came into service in the 1960s and were named &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. Both ferries have been extensively refurbished and renamed &quot;Royal Iris of the Mersey&quot; and &quot;Snowdrop&quot;. The ferries share the workload of cross-river ferrying, charter cruises and the Manchester Ship Canal cruise. The service is operated by Merseytravel, under the &quot;Mersey Ferries&quot; brand.

==History==
===Medieval ferries===
In about 1150, the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river. At this time, the Mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to Ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near Otterspool. The only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the Pool, near the site of the present Merseyside Police headquarters. Weather often stopped crossings and passengers were delayed for days, taking shelter at the priory.

In 1317, a royal licence was issued, granting permission to the Priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at Woodside. King Edward II visited Liverpool in 1323, and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to Ince. In 1330, his son Edward III granted a charter to the Priory and its successors forever: &quot;the right of ferry there… for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls&quot;. At the time, there was only a small hamlet at Birkenhead, and a slightly larger village at Liverpool.
The Chester Indictments record criminal activities on the Mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In 1355, Richard, son of Simon de Becheton, was murdered on the ferry; the murderers escaped and took refuge at Shotwick. In 1365, it was recorded that there were four ferryboats operating without a licence, from Bromborough and Eastham. In 1414, William de Stanley, the servant of John Talbot, later Earl of Shrewsbury, was on the ferry between Birkenhead and Liverpool when about 200 men assaulted him and stole his bay horse valued at £5 (current value - over £2,800), a bow and 14 arrows valued at 3s 4d (current value - over £95) and a barge valued at £10 (current value - over £5,700). The thieves were fined.

A licence was issued in 1357 to the Poole family by Edward, the Black Prince, for a ferry from Eastham. The licence then passed to the Abbey of St Werburgh, in Chester, and became known as Job&#x27;s Ferry. Early ferries also existed across the Mersey further upstream, at Ince and at Runcorn.
===From the 16th to the 18th century===
The monks of Birkenhead Priory operated a ferry service until the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the priory&#x27;s destruction by Henry VIII&#x27;s troops in 1536. Ownership reverted to the Crown, and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the Priory properties were bought by Ralph Worsley of Lancashire for £586. 11s. 6d (current value - almost £205,000). The rights later passed to the Molyneux family. By 1541 William Bromley had the licence for ferries at Seacombe, and in 1586, Queen Elizabeth granted John Poole of Sutton the rights at Tranmere.

During this period, the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships. The use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed, but in reality, these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather. The Mersey is famed for its thick fogs, and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate. The frequency depended on demand and the weather.

By the 18th century, the commercial expansion of Liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from Chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river. Ferry services from Rock House on the Wirral – that is, Rock Ferry – were first recorded in 1709. By 1753 the Cheshire side of the Mersey had at least five ferry houses at Ince, Eastham, the Rock, Woodside and Seacombe. The service from New Ferry to Liverpool was first mentioned in 1774.

===Steam ferries===
The first steamship to operate on the Mersey was the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, a wooden paddle steamer, which was introduced in 1815 to operate between Liverpool and Runcorn. There was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel. For the steam ferry &quot;Etna&quot;, which entered service at Tranmere on 17 April 1817, the idea of extension stages was mooted. These were long piers that were mounted on wheels and, by using a steam engine, could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide.

At Woodside, a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth, and in 1822 the paddle steamer &quot;Royal Mail&quot; began commercial operation between Liverpool and Woodside. The town of Birkenhead was just starting to develop at this point. In 1820, the Birkenhead Ferry began operating from a new site just to the south; this closed in 1870. The Woodside, North Birkenhead and Liverpool Steam Ferry Company was formed in 1835, and the slipway at Woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier. In 1838, the Monks Ferry Company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of Woodside, but this service closed in 1878.

From about 1830, steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by James Atherton at New Brighton, and from nearby Egremont. Steam ferries also began operating from Eastham.

By the 1840s, Birkenhead was developing into a busy new town. The railway to Chester had opened, the town was growing quickly, and the docks were under construction. There were also competing ferry services and disputes over the rights granted to the monks, and there was a need to improve the facilities at Woodside. In the early 1840s, the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end. However, this soon became inadequate.

In 1847, the first floating landing stage, which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time, was opened at Liverpool. The first portion, known as the Georges&#x27; landing stage, was designed by William Cubitt and was 500 feet long. It was rebuilt and extended in 1874.

===Corporation years===

Until the establishment of the Mersey Railway in 1886, the ferries were the only means of crossing the river, and so all of the routes were heavily used. All of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under municipal ownership in the mid 19th century. The Woodside ferry was taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners in 1858 and, in 1861, the Wallasey Local Board took over the ferry services at Seacombe, Egremont and New Brighton. At Woodside, land between the Woodside Hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed, and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened. The pontoons were towed into position, moored by chains originally made for the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, and linked to the mainland by two double bridges.

The &quot;Cheshire&quot;, the first passenger ferry steamer to have a saloon, operated from Woodside in 1864. The iron pier at Eastham was built in 1874. On 26 November 1878, the ferry &quot;Gem&quot;, a paddle steamer operated from Seacombe by the Wallasey Local Board, collided with the &quot;Bowfell&quot;, a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the River Mersey; five people died as a result.

In 1886 the Mersey Railway Tunnel was opened, providing competition for the ferry services. The Woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890, which replaced paddle steamers. In 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day. The ferry service at Tranmere, which had operated since mediaeval times, closed in 1897. The pier and landing stage at Rock Ferry was built in 1899, and Birkenhead Corporation also operated the ferry service at New Ferry.
In 1914 King George V and Queen Mary travelled on the ferry &quot;Daffodil&quot; from Wallasey to Liverpool. During the First World War the steamers &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Daffodil&quot; were taken out of service from Wallasey to be used as troop ships in the naval raid on Zeebrugge in Belgium. The ferries had a shallow draft, allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface, and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the North Sea. They both saw action, which was described on 24 April 1918 by Vice–Admiral Sir Roger Keyes of the Royal Navy in a message to the ferries&#x27; manager:

&quot;I am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried Bluejackets and Marines to Zeebrugge, and remained alongside the Mole for an hour, greatly contributing to the success of the operation... The damage caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired&quot;.

Because of their work King George V allowed the vessels to use the word &quot;Royal&quot; in their name. They needed extensive refitting before they could resume peacetime activities.

In the boats themselves, there was quick development. The early incarnations of today&#x27;s modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships, mainly the 1906 pair, &quot;Royal Iris&quot; and &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot;. The Wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs. As built, the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level, however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge, so navigation was all on one level. They were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 knots, which is about the same as today&#x27;s trio of ferries. On early paddlers, the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam, and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different. Birkenhead did not use flying bridges, instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level. Wallasey ferries employed a funnel livery of white and black and Birkenhead red and black. Birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war.

When the railway tunnels were constructed and opened, the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular. It was really the advent of the road tunnels that caused trouble. When the Queensway road tunnel opened in 1934, the ferry service from Seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry. The opening of the road tunnel also had an effect on the luggage boats which were introduced in 1879. Both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats, which carried vehicles and goods across the river. When the road tunnel opened, traffic dropped by 80%. By the 1940s, luggage boat services from both Woodside and Seacombe to Liverpool had ceased. From Woodside in 1941 and from Seacombe 1947.

Due to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage, Birkenhead Corporation gradually closed its southern terminals; New Ferry (officially) on 22 September 1927, Eastham in 1929 and Rock Ferry on 30 June 1939. The closure of Eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river. Wallasey were always trying to close Egremont, but faced stiff opposition from locals who got petitions to keep the ferry open. The chance came to close Egremont during the Second World War for economic reasons, after the pier was damaged in a collision. This was in similar circumstances to the demise of New Ferry twenty years earlier. As a result, the Egremont service never reopened.

In 1941, mines which had drifted into the River Mersey stopped ferry crossings. The &quot;Oxton&quot; and &quot;Bebington&quot; vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload United States aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the Liverpool landing stage. The &quot;Upton&quot; vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in Liverpool Bay.

In 1950, the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year, including 11 million on the Woodside ferries and 15 million on Seacombe ferries, but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million. Night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956.

===The MPTE takes over===

As a result of the Transport Act 1968, the transport functions of both Wallasey and Birkenhead Corporations came under the control of the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (MPTE) on 1 December 1969. By this time, New Brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage, the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971, with the stage and pier subsequently demolished.

In spite of the close proximity of Wallasey and Birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages, each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels. This meant that a Wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at Birkenhead&#x27;s terminal at Woodside, and that a Birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at Seacombe and New Brighton. The Pier Head at Liverpool was obliged to have gangways to suit both sets of ships. When the combined ferry fleet was rationalised, Seacombe Ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the Birkenhead vessels.

The 1970s economic situation in Britain saw costs escalating, with funding limited by the MPTE, which was embarking on an expensive operation to construct the Merseyrail &quot;Liverpool Loop&quot; extension. Compounded with the opening of the Kingsway road tunnel on 28 June 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers (only 4,000-5,000 a day), the future of the service was uncertain. It was sentimental, rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries, after much public protest to keep them. However, service frequency was reduced, with ferry fares being linked to bus and rail fares. During this period, maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably, with the &quot;Woodchurch&quot; being laid up as a salvage for parts for &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Overchurch&quot;. At this time, the large brass helm from &quot;Overchurch&quot; was damaged and was replaced by that from &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. After the damaged helm was repaired, it was placed on &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. This has remained the case, even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt.

1984 was a momentous year for the ferries and can be seen as the beginning of their rise from the slump of the 1970s. For the duration of the International Garden Festival, a special ferry service was provided to Otterspool Promenade. This service was usually operated by the &quot;Overchurch&quot;. The ferries also began to operate summer Manchester Ship Canal cruises, a service which had been popular for many years since the canal opened but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s. Sailing ships from the Tall Ships&#x27; Race visited the river in August 1984, which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days, a level unseen for forty years.

===Bus deregulation and the 1990 changes===

On 26 October 1986 as a result of the Transport Act 1985, bus services were deregulated and restrictions which prevented regular bus services through the Mersey Tunnels were abolished. As a result, many buses which formerly stopped at the Birkenhead Woodside bus/ferry terminal were extended into Liverpool. This was another blow to the Mersey Ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic, which had declined, to tourist needs.

From 1990 a commuter shuttle has operated Monday-Friday peak period with an hourly River Explorer Cruise. At weekends River Explorer cruises operate from 10:00 to 18:00. The morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a Liverpool-Birkehead-Seacombe-Liverpool circuit, but since then only runs every 20 minutes from Liverpool-Seacombe Ferry and back.

The evening peak service runs Liverpool-Seacombe every 20 minutes. The Explorer cruises follow a Liverpool-Seacombe-Birkenhead-Liverpool pattern and sail slightly further upstream with a commentary of what can be seen.

These operations run with a bias towards Seacombe Ferry as the vicinity of Seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of Birkenhead. In the summer there are also cruises up the Manchester Ship Canal.

==Previous and present fleets==
The &quot;Royal&quot; prefix was granted to the ferries &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Daffodil&quot; for their service during the First World War where they were instrumental at the Mole in Zeebrugge. Both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting. Since the original duo&#x27;s withdrawal, there have been other Royals. The of 1934 was hit by a bomb during the May Blitz and sunk at her berth at Seacombe on 8 May 1941. She was later raised and returned to service by 1943, with little of her pre-war splendour. 
===&quot;Royal Iris&quot; (1951)===
Perhaps the most famous Royal is the of 1951. She was the first diesel-powered vessel of the Wallasey fleet, with four diesel generators connected to two Metrovick marine propulsion units. The vessel differed to all the other ferries as she had super smooth lines and a dummy funnel in place. She was the best loved of all the Mersey ferries and played host to hundreds of party cruises, with bands such as Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers, The Searchers, The Beatles and Elvis Costello performing on her. The &quot;Royal Iris&quot; received a major refit in the 1970s and her popular fish and chip cafe - which earned her the name &quot;the fish and chip boat&quot; - was removed and replaced with a steak bar. The Royal Iris was also the setting for the 1979 ITV children&#x27;s program The Mersey Pirate where she was fitted with a temporary geodesic glass dome on her upper deck. The &quot;Royal Iris&quot; remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub. She was then berthed in a deteriorating condition at Woolwich, London. Around 2010 her hull breached, causing her to sink onto the bed of the Thames - which has only served to accelerate the decline in her condition. Attempts to bring her back to Merseyside have come to nothing due to the prohibitive cost of making her fit for a 1,000 mile journey coastwise.

===&quot;Leasowe&quot;, &quot;Egremont&quot; and the &quot;Royal Daffodil II&quot;===

The and were built by Philip and Son in Dartmouth, Devon and entered service in late 1951 and early 1952 respectively. Named after suburbs of Wallasey, both vessels were commissioned by Wallasey Corporation.

They were of a traditional design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough, who are based in Liverpool, but boasted modern equipment including Crossley multi-speed engines for versatile control. They only had one single boarding gangway and their forward saloons extended to the whole width of the ship. This proved somewhat problematic especially at busy periods, so an additional gangway space was added on the promenade deck for use with the high level terminal gangways. The forward saloons also had facility for a bar area and dance floor, which meant the vessels could be used for cruising. The two vessels were primarily used on the Seacombe – Liverpool service, augmenting the New Brighton run during the summer seasons.

&quot;Egremont&quot; differed externally to &quot;Leasowe&quot; in that she had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of &quot;Leasowe&quot; and &quot;Egremont&quot; show them to have deckhead compasses above the wheelhouse and side boxes, which appear to have been removed in the late 1950s. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system and a ship to shore radio system. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the pilot boat &quot;Edmund Gardner&quot; at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The &quot;Leasowe&quot; and &quot;Egremont&quot; were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries.

A second was constructed by James Lamont &amp; Co at Greenock and entered service in 1958. She was larger than the Dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service. The Roman &#x27;II&#x27; was added to her name because of a Thames estuary cruise ship also called which existed from 1939 until 1967. The gross register tonnage of &quot;Royal Daffodil II&quot; was 609. A gross error was the size of her engines, developing a piece she was underpowered and often struggled in strong tides. Aside from the engine order telegraphs, she also had helms in the side boxes meaning that the ship could be steered from them if required. The vessel ran aground on a sandbank in thick fog in September 1967 and was involved in a collision in January 1968. Taking on water from a hole near her bow, she was beached near Seacombe. Repaired at Cammell Laird, she subsequently returned to service. 

During the 1970s the fleet was rationalised, with surplus vessels being put up for sale. &quot;Leasowe&quot; was sold into Greek ownership in 1974 and renamed &quot;Naias II&quot;. By 1980 she had been sold on and was renamed &quot;Cavo Doro&quot;. She remained in service until the early 2000s and is reported to have since been scrapped. 
&quot;Royal Daffodil II&quot; was also sold to Greek owners in 1977 and renamed several times. She sank in heavy seas on 7 November 2007, whilst carrying the name &quot;Dolphin I&quot;, with the loss of her captain and mate. 
The &quot;Egremont&quot; was laid up in Morpeth Dock whilst on sale offer in 1975 and sprang a leak. Her engine room was flooded, ruining her engines and rendering her inoperable. She was stripped of her machinery and used as a floating headquarters for the Island Cruising Club in Salcombe, Devon, not far from her original birthplace. In 2016, the vessel underwent extensive repairs to her hull in Sharpness, Gloucestershire, before being again laid up. As of April 2019, the vessel is no longer in use by the ICC and has been offered for sale.

===&quot;Mountwood&quot;, &quot;Woodchurch&quot; and &quot;Overchurch&quot;===
The current Mersey Ferries fleet comprises two vessels, based on a similar design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough of Liverpool. Until 2012 a third ferry, &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot;, was also in service. Originally named &quot;Mountwood&quot;, &quot;Woodchurch&quot; and &quot;Overchurch&quot; after overspill post-war housing developments of Birkenhead, they were commissioned into service by Birkenhead Corporation.

&quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot; were built at Dartmouth by Philip and Son. The &quot;Mountwood&quot; was launched on the 31 July 1959 and the &quot;Woodchurch&quot; on the 28 October of the same year. They were loosely based on designs of the &quot;Leasowe&quot; and &quot;Egremont&quot; of the Wallasey fleet, although they both weighed considerably more at 464 tonnes, compared with 311 tonnes for the earlier vessels. They are also larger than the older Wallasey pair, being approximately longer, broader and over taller. Both vessels were externally identical in almost every way up until 1991 when the shroud protecting the aft funnel vent on the &quot;Mountwood&quot; was changed from square to rounded.

Compared to the earlier Wallasey twins, the &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot; were highly advanced. They benefited from an injection of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by Chadburns were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs were part of a brand known as &quot;Synchrostep&quot; and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. &quot;Overchurch&quot; had the same telegraph &#x27;heads&#x27; however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were a hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the rubbing strake. In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes.

On the bridge was also a brass talk tube that linked down to the engine room. A prank amongst bridge crews was to call an engineer on the talk tube then pour water down it, thus soaking the engineer at the other end.

The &quot;Mountwood&quot; was used in the film &quot;Ferry Cross The Mersey&quot;, a musical and subsequent Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers song, crossing to Liverpool from Birkenhead. Her near sister &quot;Overchurch&quot; also appeared in the background of several shots. In her early years &quot;Mountwood&quot; was an unreliable ship. She had broken down whilst crossing the river and had to anchor. Her passengers were rescued by &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. She also collided with &quot;Bidston&quot; whilst berthing, due to an error in engine movements.

In 1962, &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot; were joined by a new ferry, the &quot;Overchurch&quot;. Built at the Birkenhead shipyard of Cammell Laird and Co., &quot;Overchurch&quot; was of all welded construction and also had a bridge that was completely enclosed rather than a wheelhouse and navigation boxes like &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. The addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it, whereas on the two sisters there were three, one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes. The &quot;Overchurch&quot; also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units, meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge, rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot;. &quot;Overchurch&quot; had a high funnel immediately behind the bridge and also a small bridge deck, giving the appearance of a somewhat forward top-heavy look, as a result. The &quot;Overchurch&quot; was fitted with the same navigation equipment as her near sisters. She differed slightly by being a few tonnes heavier and a few inches longer. The &quot;Overchurch&quot; also had only one access stairway to the promenade deck unlike the Dartmouth twins which had two. In her first year of service, the &quot;Overchurch&quot; conveyed Princess Alexandra to open the new Cammell Laird dry dock.

The trio of ferries all remained in near constant operation up until 1981, when cost-cutting measures saw &quot;Woodchurch&quot; withdrawn for almost three years. It was rumoured that she was cannibalised to help keep her sisters running. Whilst in lay up at Clarence dry docks, she was offered for sale, with one prospective buyer hoping to use her to operate cruises around the Isle of Man. She was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint &quot;Woodchurch&quot; returned to service in 1983, freeing up &quot;Overchurch&quot; to become the primary ferry to be used on a new Otterspool service, set up for the 1984 International Garden Festival. The ferries all operated on a normal 20 minute route throughout this.

The late 1970s and early 1980s saw very limited budgets for maintenance and the ferries are noted to look in poor condition during this period. 

In 1989, &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot; were withdrawn and extensively refurbished internally which resulted in complete rewiring and main engine repairs. They were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge, although none of the original equipment was removed from the new bridge. They entered service by July 1990 in time for the &quot;QE2&#x27;s&quot; first visit to the Mersey and also operated the new &quot;heritage cruises&quot;. They also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the Garden Festival season of 1984. The &quot;Overchurch&quot; also underwent some refurbishments at Bootle. She was then moved to the ferries&#x27; regular berth on the East Float, where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season. In 1996 the &quot;Overchurch&quot; was given a small refit which involved the enclosing of the promenade deck shelter.

===The Highland Seabird===
During a brief period in 1982, a Western Ferries catamaran by the name of the &quot;Highland Seabird&quot; operated between Woodside, Seacombe and the Pier Head. This was a short lived service and the vessel was sold out of the fleet in 1985 and renamed the &quot;Trident 2&quot;. 

===Liveries===

The ferry companies were identifiable by their different colour liveries displayed on each vessel&#x27;s funnel. Wallasey ferries carried a black and white colour scheme. Early Birkenhead steamers carried red and black, however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s, remaining until the merger of the two fleets under the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive in 1969. When the ferries were taken over by the MPTE, the liveries of Birkenhead and Wallasey were replaced initially with a primrose yellow and powder blue colour scheme. This was followed by a black and green livery, then in 1984 by the colours of the Union Flag for the International Garden Festival celebrations. By the 1990s the vessels carried a red and black colour scheme, similar to that previously used by Birkenhead Corporation.

From January 2015, MV &quot;Snowdrop&quot; had a special livery applied, based on the World War I dazzle camouflage and designed by Peter Blake.

===Refits and renamings===

The &quot;Overchurch&quot; was given her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in Manchester, which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed and returned to service in 1999. &quot;Mountwood&quot; and &quot;Woodchurch&quot; were also refitted and renamed and , respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used helms and binnacles with compasses were placed back on the refurbished bridges. The current two ferries have been in service for over 60 years, with 2019 marking the 60th anniversary of the launching of &quot;Royal Iris of the Mersey&quot; and the &quot;Snowdrop&quot;. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis.

The Wärtsilä engines installed on the ferries during their last major refit are much more economical than the previous engines by Crossley Bros of Manchester. They are also much &#x27;greener&#x27; and produce much less emissions than the original propulsion units.

The ferries&#x27; masts now carry several other navigation lights on their main masts at various points. Prior to refit, they had only a forward-facing white light. This is due to the classification of the ferries.

The &quot;Snowdrop&quot; and &quot;Royal Iris&quot; each carry two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/165 type fog horns. &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; carries two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/195 horns. These are the original horns fitted when the ferries were first built. Both &quot;Royal Iris of the Mersey&quot; and &quot;Snowdrop&quot; have an E-flat tone, and &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot;″s is in F Sharp. When berthing the vessel, the captain uses a combination of rudder positions and engine movements. The ferries all have twin rudders and propellers, making them very manoeuvrable.

The Mersey Ferries used to operate in fog, however, the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor.

==Liverpool 08==
The ferries played a big part in Liverpool&#x27;s European Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. The ferries carried record numbers of passengers, and on the 18–21 July, the Tall Ships returned to the Mersey. A combination of the Tall Ships and the Golf Open at nearby Royal Birkdale ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend, with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries. Sunday 20 July saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night, with the &quot;Snowdrop&quot; being berthed at Woodside and the &quot;Royal Iris&quot; and &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; at Seacombe. All three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend, with the &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on Monday 21 July.

==Future==
In August 2012, it was announced that Merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on Mersey Ferries operations after the service is running at a £1million annual loss. As a result of this review, the ferry &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; was withdrawn from service in January 2013. Another threat to the ferries&#x27; future is the cost of replacing the current ferries, the oldest ever to ply the river, when required.

In December 2015 Merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two Wirral landing stages (possibly Woodside), a later start to commuter services which only operate from Seacombe to Liverpool, and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events, a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 &quot;Royal Iris&quot;.

The Mersey Ferries Long Term Strategy, whilst currently subject to approval, anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020–21. The vessel will be used as the main day to day vessel with &quot;Snowdrop&quot; used as a secondary vessel.

In January 2018, the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram announced that plans had been drawn up for a new vessel. The announcement stated that naval architects had prepared initial designs and there would be a period of public consultation on the designs.

Plans were announced in August 2019 for two new low-carbon ferries to be built and for improvement works to take place at Seacombe ferry terminal by using a share of a £172million &#x27;Transforming Cities Fund&#x27;. In November 2022 a contract for one new vessel was placed jointly with Cammell Laird and Netherlands shipbuilders Damen Group.

<text>The Queensway Tunnel is a road tunnel under the River Mersey, in the north west of England, between Liverpool and Birkenhead. Locally, it is often referred to as the &quot;Birkenhead Tunnel&quot; or &quot;old tunnel&quot;, to distinguish it from the newer Kingsway Tunnel (1971), which serves Wallasey and the M53 motorway traffic. At in length, it is the longest road tunnel in the UK.

==History==

The first tunnel under the River Mersey was for the Mersey Railway in 1886. The first tunnel crossing was proposed in 1825, and again in 1827. A report in 1830 rejected the road tunnel due to concerns about building damage.

During the 1920s there were concerns about the long queues of cars and lorries at the Mersey Ferry terminal, so once royal assent to a parliamentary bill was received, construction of the first Mersey road tunnel started in 1925, to a design by consulting engineer Sir Basil Mott. Mott supervised the construction in association with John Brodie, who, as City Engineer of Liverpool, had co-ordinated the feasibility studies made by consultant Engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. The main contractor was Edmund Nuttall.
In 1928 the two pilot tunnels met to within less than . Construction work continued, and in 1930 Brian Colquhoun was appointed Resident Engineer. The tunnel opened in 1934. From 1933 to 1936 Colquhoun was redesignated &quot;Resident Engineer-in-Charge&quot;.

More than 1.2 million tons of rock, gravel, and clay were excavated; some of it was used to build Otterspool Promenade. Of the 1,700 men who worked on the tunnel during the nine years of its construction, 17 were killed.

At the time of its opening it was the longest road tunnel in the world, a title it held for 14 years until the opening of the Vielha Tunnel in Catalonia, Spain, in 1948, though it remained the longest underwater tunnel as of 1955. The tunnel, which cost a total of £8 million, was opened on 18 July 1934 by King George V; the opening ceremony was watched by 200,000 people. At the time it was known as the eighth wonder of the world.

By the 1960s, traffic volume had increased, and, in 1971, the Kingsway Tunnel opened to relieve congestion.

The lighting inside the tunnel was updated in 1981 to replace the amber fluorescent tubes on the walls of the tunnel. The reason given for the change was that the old lighting was ineffective and inefficient. It also caused a flicker effect on vehicle windscreens, which could induce epileptic reactions in susceptible people.

The tunnel was closed for the day on 17 July 1994 and was used for pedestrians only to celebrate its 60th anniversary.

In April 2004 construction began on seven emergency refuges below the road deck, each capable of holding 180 people, as part of a £9 million project to bring the tunnel into line with the highest European safety standards. Each refuge is long and wide, accessible from the main tunnel walls. The refuges have fire resistant doors, ramps for wheelchair access, a supply of bottled water, a toilet, and a video link to the Mersey Tunnels Police control room. All seven refuges are linked by a walkway below the road surface, with exits at the Liverpool and Birkenhead ends.

In 2012 the tunnel was refurbished, with 5,999 added panels – ceramic steel cladding replacing the old plastic corrugated wall cladding to improve lighting and to give the tunnel a 21st century look.

==Design and facilities==
The tunnel is long. It contains a single carriageway of four lanes, two in each direction. A lower deck, originally intended as a tramway, is used for ventilation and emergency refuges.

The tunnel entrances, toll booths and ventilation building exteriors were designed by architect Herbert James Rowse, who is frequently but incorrectly credited with the whole civil engineering project. Their decoration is by Edmund Thompson. These are Grade II listed buildings.

Different height restrictions apply to the nearside and offside lanes in each direction, because of the curvature of the tunnel. These are and respectively, and there is a 3.5 t weight limit for goods vehicles. All buses are required to use the offside lane, regardless of their height. Lane signals (consisting of an illuminated green arrow or red cross) are displayed at regular intervals, although in normal circumstances none of the lanes are currently used bidirectionally. This is in contrast to the Kingsway Tunnel, where lanes in toll concourse are alternated to prioritise higher traffic in one direction during peak hours.

The tunnel has two branches leading off the main tunnel to the dock areas on both sides of the river. The Birkenhead branch tunnel (known as the Rendel Street branch, or Dock Exit) was closed in 1965. When travelling in the Birkenhead direction, the branch can still be seen inside the tunnel on the right just before the left hand bend towards the Birkenhead exit. The exit of this branch can also be seen on the outside from Rendel Street near the junction with Marcus Street, just north of Cleveland Street in Birkenhead. This branch also carried two-way traffic, single lane each way. It was also controlled by traffic lights inside the tunnel. This branch mainly served Birkenhead docks and for people travelling to the Wirral resort of New Brighton. These are now best served by the Kingsway Tunnel. The Liverpool branch tunnel remains in use, in the exit direction only. It emerges opposite the Liver Building, next to the Atlantic Tower Hotel and Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas. Originally, it carried two-way traffic and the junction inside the tunnel was controlled by traffic lights, but this arrangement was discontinued to reduce the delays brought on by increasing traffic levels. Had it been built, the tunnel would have connected with the Liverpool urban motorway, the planned inner ring road.

===Tolls===

Tolls have been a feature of tunnel use since the Queensway Tunnel opened in 1934. Although residents were originally told tolls would be removed when debts were repaid, this position was dropped long ago. Debts and tolls were increased when the Kingsway Tunnel was built in 1971 to relieve congestion in the first tunnel. The County of Merseyside Act 1980 (c. x) enshrined in law the right to continue collecting tolls once the debts were repaid. The later Mersey Tunnels Act 2004 (c. ii) created a legal position where tolls charged must rise in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) as published in November.

 the toll is £2.10 per journey for a single passenger car of typical size, with progressively higher tolls for larger vehicles; solo motorcycles are free. Average daily traffic through the tunnel currently stands at 35,000 vehicles, which equates to just under £12.8 million per year.

===Ventilation===
As a roadway the tunnel requires ventilation to clear vehicle exhaust fumes. As originally designed the tunnel would have used forced air for ventilation; fumes and noxious gases were simply to be expelled through the tunnel exits. However, in an incident in the Liberty Tunnel in Pittsburgh in May 1924, inadequate ventilation led to a number of drivers being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning, though there were no fatalities; this led the Queensway engineers to re-examine the issue and to conduct experiments in a completed section under Hamilton Square. Extractors were installed in the planned ventilation stations, adding to their size and complexity, and also adding considerably to the budget.

The tunnel currently has six ventilation shafts, three on each side of the river.
On the Wirral side the main shaft is at Woodside, with another (before the main exit) in Sidney Street, while the Dock Exit branch is served by the tower in Taylor Street.
On the Liverpool side the main shaft is at the Pier head, in the George&#x27;s Dock Building, with another (before the main exit) in North John Street, and the Strand Exit branch is served by the tower in Fazakerley Street. The Georges Dock Building also houses offices of the Tunnels Authority and of the Tunnels Police Force.
All the ventilation buildings were designed by Herbert Rowse, chief architect for the Queensway tunnel exteriors, and all are Grade II listed.


==Use in film==

The tunnel was used in the 1993 film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; where Emma Thompson&#x27;s character drives through the tunnel in one of the opening scenes.

In September 2009, a scene from &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; set in the Dartford Crossing was filmed in Queensway Tunnel, where Harry skips on a bus while on Hagrid&#x27;s enchanted motorbike was filmed in the tunnel. 

In 2012 the tunnel was used for the filming of a chase scene for &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot;. 

In March 2018, the tunnel was used for the filming of &quot;Yesterday&quot;, directed by Danny Boyle. The two main characters are frolicking in an empty tunnel when the bright yellow words &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; are rolling through the tunnel. 

Also in 2018 the tunnel was a location for the BBC TV series &quot;The City and the City&quot;, where it served as the gateway between the two cities.

==In popular culture==

The Dubliners popularised the song &quot;I Wish I Was Back in Liverpool&quot;, which includes a verse about the building of the Queensway Tunnel.

<text>The Kingsway Tunnel (or Wallasey Tunnel) is a toll road tunnel under the River Mersey between Liverpool and Wallasey. The tunnel carries the A59. It was built because the Queensway Tunnel – which was built in the 1930s to carry vehicles between Birkenhead and Liverpool – was unable to cope with the rise in postwar traffic.

==History==
Annual vehicle usage of the Queensway Tunnel had exceeded 11 million by 1959, causing severe traffic congestion at peak commute times, partially as a result of low toll costs. It was evident that a significant capacity increase was required, with considerations on various bridge and tunnel schemes ultimately concluding with a second tunnel as the favoured option, funded by tolls. In 1965, parliamentary powers granted construction of a new two-lane tunnel, approximately 1 mile downstream from the existing tunnel. A further bill for the tunnel&#x27;s construction was promoted in 1967 with approval given in 1968, upon which construction started immediately.

===Construction===
The project was authorised by the Mersey Tunnel (Liverpool/Wallasey) &amp;c. Act 1965 (c. xl). Edmund Nuttall Limited. Construction took around five years to fully complete. The approach to the tunnel on the Wirral side uses the former railway cutting that carried the Seacombe branch line. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 June 1971. At first, only the southernmost tunnel was open for traffic, one lane in each direction. The northernmost tunnel was completed in 1974 and opened to traffic on 13 February 1974.

=== Mersey Tunnel 10k ===
There is an annual 10k run that passes through the Kingsway Tunnel, starting in Liverpool city centre with the finish line in New Brighton. This is the only time during the year when one can travel through the tunnel on foot. In 2024, more than 2,000 people registered to take part in the event.

==Operations==
Kingsway comprises identical twin tunnels. Each has two lanes. They carry on average 45,000 vehicles a day (almost 16.4 million per year). , a single car journey through the tunnel cost £2.10. Staffed and automatic tollbooths are located on the Wallasey side. Of the two tunnels crossing the River Mersey, Kingsway is the only one able to take heavy goods vehicles (HGVs).

In a study following the fire in the Mont Blanc Tunnel in 1999, inspectors from the European Union rated the Kingsway Tunnel as &quot;good&quot;, one of fourteen to receive that rating in Europe.

Over of wiring was installed in the tunnel as part of a 2016 upgrade to the lighting, which saw the tunnel fitted with more energy efficient and longer-lasting LED lights.

<text>The Mont Blanc Tunnel (, ) is a highway tunnel between France and Italy, under Mont Blanc in the Alps. It links Chamonix, Haute-Savoie, France with Courmayeur, Aosta Valley, Italy, via the French Route Nationale 205 and the Italian Traforo T1 (forming the European route E25), in particular the motorways serving Geneva (A40 of France) and Turin (A5 of Italy). The passageway is one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes, particularly for Italy, which relies on this tunnel for transporting as much as one-third of its freight to northern Europe. It reduces the route from France to Turin by and to Milan by . Northeast of Mont Blanc&#x27;s summit, the tunnel is about southwest of the tripoint with Switzerland, near Mont Dolent.

The agreement between France and Italy on building a tunnel was signed in 1949. Two operating companies were founded, each responsible for one half of the tunnel: the French &quot;Autoroutes et tunnel du Mont-Blanc&quot; (ATMB), founded on 30 April 1958, and the Italian &quot;Società italiana per azioni per il Traforo del Monte Bianco&quot; (SITMB), founded on 1 September 1957. Drilling began in 1959 and was completed in 1962; the tunnel was opened to traffic on 19 July 1965.

The tunnel is in length, in width, and in height. The passageway is not horizontal, but in a slightly inverted &quot;V&quot;, which assists ventilation. The tunnel consists of a single gallery with a two-lane dual direction road. At the time of its construction, it was twice as long as any existing highway tunnel.

The tunnel passes almost exactly under the summit of the Aiguille du Midi. At this spot, it lies beneath the surface, making it the world&#x27;s second deepest operational tunnel after the Gotthard Base Tunnel.

The Mont Blanc Tunnel was originally managed by the two building companies. Following a fire in 1999 in which 39 people died, which showed how lack of coordination could hamper the safety of the tunnel, all the operations are managed by a single entity: MBT-EEIG, controlled by both ATMB and SITMB together, through a 50–50 shares distribution.

An alternative route for road traffic between France to Italy is the Fréjus Road Tunnel. Road traffic grew steadily until 1994, even with the opening of the Fréjus tunnel. Since then, the combined traffic volume of the former has remained roughly constant.

== Construction statistics ==
* Workforce: five engineers and 350 workmen worked an estimated grand total of 4.6 million man-hours to complete the project
* Explosives: of explosives were used to blast of rock
* Energy: 37 million kilowatt-hours and of fuel for trucks and engines
* Other facts: 771,240 bolts, 6,900 drill rods, and of iron were used to support the vault, of formwork for of cement (mixed with of aggregates)

== History ==

The idea of building a tunnel underneath Mont Blanc to avoid the need for long journeys dates back to the nineteenth century during the heyday of the railway. However, the idea did not receive widespread attention until 1907, when Francesco Farinet, a Member of Parliament of the Aosta Valley, advocated constructing of the tunnel. In 1908, a first design was presented by French engineer Arnold Monod, to much interest from Italian and French politicians.

===Agreement between France and Italy and start of construction by 1959===
Due to political turmoil and World War I and World War II, the project did not start until 1959, when excavations on the tunnel officially began. This was preceded by the signing of a national charter for the tunnel construction, ratified by the parliaments of France (1957) and Italy (1954). That same year, the STMB (&quot;Société du tunnel du Mont Blanc&quot;) was formed, which became ATMB (&quot;Autoroutes et Tunnel du Mont Blanc&quot;) in 1996. In 1962, the French and Italian drilling teams met on 4 August. The opening was successful, with an axis variation of less than .

===Opening===
The tunnel was inaugurated by the French president, Charles de Gaulle, and the Italian President, Giuseppe Saragat on 16 July 1965. The tunnel opened to traffic on 19 July. Surveillance cameras were installed in 1978.

===Updates in the 1990s===
The tunnel underwent extensive modernisation works in 1990, including the addition of safety features such as new video surveillance cameras, 8 pressurized emergency shelters, a sprinkler system and other safety maintenance. In 1997, a fire detection system was installed along with centralized safety equipment management, and new variable message signs.

===1999 fire===
On the morning of 24 March 1999, the engine of a Belgian transport truck carrying volatile freight caught fire in the tunnel. The event expanded into a catastrophe which killed 39 people.

===2002 reopening===
The fire led to a tunnel closure until 9 March 2002. The reopening followed an extensive overhaul of the safety features. The highway trunk from Aosta to the tunnel on the Italian side was completed in 2007.

== Traffic ==

In 2010, the average traffic volume was 4,945 vehicles per day, or around 1.80 million vehicles per year. In 2011, there were an average of 5,113 vehicles per day (about 1.87 million vehicles per year).

Although several lines of vehicles can queue up at the toll station, only a limited number of vehicles per unit time is allowed to transit the tunnel to ensure a safety distance between them.

Within the tunnel, a minimum speed of 50 km/h and a maximum speed of 70 km/h applies, while the prescribed distance between vehicles is 150 m; trucks are allowed to enter in groups of five. These security measures were taken as a consequence of the 1999 tunnel fire.

Pedestrians can cross the tunnel by bus; bicycles can also be carried through the tunnel with a reservation.

== Toll ==

The tunnel crossing is subject to a toll; the toll differs from Italy to France because of their different VAT rates.

In 2013, the one-way ticket for a car was €40.90 (€41.40 on the Italian side), while the return ticket, valid for 7 days, was €51 (€51.60 on the Italian side). In 2016, the one-way ticket for a car cost €43.50 (€44.20 on the Italian side).

<doc id="167191" wikidata="Q678734" url="?curid=167191" title="Phong reflection model">
<text>The Phong reflection model (also called Phong illumination or Phong lighting) is an empirical model of the local illumination of points on a surface designed by the computer graphics researcher Bui Tuong Phong. In 3D computer graphics, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Phong shading&quot;, particularly if the model is used with the interpolation method of the same name and in the context of pixel shaders or other places where a lighting calculation can be referred to as “shading”.

== History ==

The Phong reflection model was developed by Bui Tuong Phong at the University of Utah, who published it in his 1975 Ph.D. dissertation. It was published in conjunction with a method for interpolating the calculation for each individual pixel that is rasterized from a polygonal surface model; the interpolation technique is known as Phong shading, even when it is used with a reflection model other than Phong&#x27;s. Phong&#x27;s methods were considered radical at the time of their introduction, but have since become the de facto baseline shading method for many rendering applications. Phong&#x27;s methods have proven popular due to their generally efficient use of computation time per rendered pixel.

== Concepts ==

Phong reflection is an empirical model of local illumination. It describes the way a surface reflects light as a combination of the diffuse reflection of rough surfaces with the specular reflection of shiny surfaces. It is based on Phong&#x27;s informal observation that shiny surfaces have small intense specular highlights, while dull surfaces have large highlights that fall off more gradually. The model also includes an &quot;ambient&quot; term to account for the small amount of light that is scattered about the entire scene.

For each light source in the scene, components formula_1 and formula_2 are defined as the intensities (often as RGB values) of the specular and diffuse components of the light sources, respectively. A single term formula_3 controls the ambient lighting; it is sometimes computed as a sum of contributions from all light sources.

For each &quot;material&quot; in the scene, the following parameters are defined:

:formula_4, which is a specular reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the specular term of incoming light,
:formula_5, which is a diffuse reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the diffuse term of incoming light (Lambertian reflectance),
:formula_6, which is an ambient reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the ambient term present in all points in the scene rendered, and
:formula_7, which is a &quot;shininess&quot; constant for this material, which is larger for surfaces that are smoother and more mirror-like. When this constant is large the specular highlight is small.

Furthermore, there is

:formula_8, which is the set of all light sources,
:formula_9, which is the direction vector from the point on the surface toward each light source (formula_10 specifies the light source),
:formula_11, which is the normal at this point on the surface,
:formula_12, which is the direction that a perfectly reflected ray of light would take from this point on the surface, and
:formula_13, which is the direction pointing towards the viewer (such as a virtual camera).

Then the Phong reflection model provides an equation for computing the illumination of each surface point formula_14:

:formula_15

where the direction vector formula_12 is calculated as the reflection of formula_9 on the surface characterized by the surface normal formula_11 using

:formula_19

The hats indicate that the vectors are normalized. The diffuse term is not affected by the viewer direction (formula_13). The specular term is large only when the viewer direction (formula_13) is aligned with the reflection direction formula_12. Their alignment is measured by the formula_7 power of the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of the angle between the normalized vectors formula_12 and formula_13 is equal to their dot product. When formula_7 is large, in the case of a nearly mirror-like reflection, the specular highlight will be small, because any viewpoint not aligned with the reflection will have a cosine less than one which rapidly approaches zero when raised to a high power.

Although the above formulation is the common way of presenting the Phong reflection model, each term should only be included if the term&#x27;s dot product is positive. (Additionally, the specular term should only be included if the dot product of the diffuse term is positive.)

When the color is represented as RGB values, as often is the case in computer graphics, this equation is typically modeled separately for R, G and B intensities, allowing different reflection constants formula_27 formula_5 and formula_4 for the different color channels.

When implementing the Phong reflection model, there are a number of methods for approximating the model, rather than implementing the exact formulas, which can speed up the calculation; for example, the Blinn–Phong reflection model is a modification of the Phong reflection model, which is more efficient if the viewer and the light source are treated to be at infinity.

Another approximation that addresses the calculation of the exponentiation in the specular term is the following: Considering that the specular term should be taken into account only if its dot product is positive, it can be approximated as

:formula_30

where formula_31, and formula_32 is a real number which doesn&#x27;t have to be an integer. If formula_33 is chosen to be a power of 2, i.e. formula_34 where formula_35 is an integer, then the expression formula_36 can be more efficiently calculated by squaring formula_37 times, i.e.

:formula_38

This approximation of the specular term holds for a sufficiently large integer formula_33 (typically, 4 or 8 will be enough).

Furthermore, the value formula_40 can be approximated as formula_41, or as formula_42 The latter is much less sensitive to normalization errors in formula_12 and formula_13 than Phong&#x27;s dot-product-based formula_31 is, and practically doesn&#x27;t require formula_12 and formula_13 to be normalized except for very low-resolved triangle meshes.

This method substitutes a few multiplications for a variable exponentiation, and removes the need for an accurate reciprocal-square-root-based vector normalization.

== Inverse model ==

The Phong reflection model in combination with Phong shading is an approximation of shading of objects in real life. This means that the Phong equation can relate the shading seen in a photograph with the surface normals of the visible object. Inverse refers to the wish to estimate the surface normals given a rendered image, natural or computer-made.

The Phong reflection model contains many parameters, such as the surface diffuse reflection parameter (albedo) which may vary within the object. Thus the normals of an object in a photograph can only be determined, by introducing additional information such as the number of lights, light directions and reflection parameters.

For example, we have a cylindrical object, for instance a finger, and wish to compute the normal formula_48 on a line on the object. We assume only one light, no specular reflection, and uniform known (approximated) reflection parameters. We can then simplify the Phong equation to:

:formula_49

With formula_50 a constant equal to the ambient light and formula_51 a constant equal to the diffusion reflection. We can re-write the equation to:

:formula_52

Which can be rewritten for a line through the cylindrical object as:

:formula_53

For instance if the light direction is 45 degrees above the object formula_54 we get two equations with two unknowns.

:formula_55
:formula_56

Because of the powers of two in the equation there are two possible solutions for the normal direction. Thus some prior information of the geometry is needed to define the correct normal direction. The normals are directly related to angles of inclination of the line on the object surface. Thus the normals allow the calculation of the relative surface heights of the line on the object using a line integral, if we assume a continuous surface.

If the object is not cylindrical, we have three unknown normal values formula_57. Then the two equations still allow the normal to rotate around the view vector, thus additional constraints are needed from prior geometric information. For instance in face recognition those geometric constraints can be obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) on a database of depth-maps of faces, allowing only surface normals solutions which are found in a normal population.

== Applications ==

The Phong reflection model is often used together with Phong shading to shade surfaces in 3D computer graphics software. Apart from this, it may also be used for other purposes. For example, it has been used to model the reflection of thermal radiation from the Pioneer probes in an attempt to explain the Pioneer anomaly.

<text>The Kingsway tramway subway is a cut-and-cover tunnel in central London, built by the London County Council, and the only one of its kind in Britain. The decision in 1898 to clear slum districts in the Holborn area provided an opportunity to use the new streets for a tramway connecting the lines in the north and south. Following the pattern of tramways in New York (the Murray Hill Tunnel) and Boston (the MBTA Green Line), it was decided to build this as an underground connection.

The subway opened in 1906 and closed in 1952. Most of the southern end was adapted as a traffic underpass in 1964. The separate northern section was listed at Grade II by Historic England in 1998.

==History==
===1902–1905: Construction===
The London County Council had for many years wanted to connect its &quot;North Side&quot; and &quot;South Side&quot; tramway networks in order to be able to send &quot;North Side&quot; trams for overhaul to the Central Repair Depot at Charlton in South East London. In 1902, it decided to build a subway from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south, from where a surface line would continue over the bridge. Legal problems delayed permission to build the subway and tram route and it was not until 1906 that permission to build was granted, and then not to cross the bridge. Because of a sewer at the northern end and the District Railway to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only. After leaving the subway at the south end, trams turned right along the Embankment to Westminster Bridge or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the Hop Exchange. This latter service was short-lived and the tracks were removed in 1930.

The approach from the north near Southampton Row was a open cutting with a 1 in 10 (10%) gradient. The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the Fleet sewer before rising slightly to enter Holborn tramway station. South from here the subway was built with a steel roof to Aldwych tramway station and, because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here, the tracks leading towards the Strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits.

In the parliamentary session of 1905, plans were submitted for an additional station at the south end of the tunnel, under Wellington Street. The opening of the new tramway along the Embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster Place to enable an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo Bridge and a triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade.

===1906: Opening===
Services opened to the public on 24 February 1906 from Angel to Aldwych, with a ceremonial opening by the chairman of the Highways Committee. The first journey took 12 minutes northbound and 10 minutes to return, despite horse-drawn vehicles also using the roads on the surface part of the route. On 16 November that year the routes were extended north from The Angel to Highbury station. Special trams were constructed from non-flammable materials – wooden trams, common on other routes, were not permitted through the subway.

Through services commenced on 10 April 1908 from Highbury station to Tower Bridge and to Kennington Gate, with a procession of six cars going south from Holborn through to Kennington, then to Elephant and Castle to return through the subway to Angel. The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea which, due to a low bridge, could be operated with single-deck vehicles only. Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station. Drivers on routes through the subway had to have at least two years&#x27; experience on other services to be considered for these routes.

===1929: Double-decker trams===
Service patterns continued to change, especially with the opening of tram lines over Blackfriars Bridge on 14 September 1909, and during the 1920s it was realised that to remain profitable the subway needed to be able to take double-deck trams. In 1929 it was decided to increase the headroom to . Work started on 11 September of that year, resulting in the replacement of the cast iron tubes by a new steel girder-supported roof and the diversion of the sewer. In places the trackbed was lowered by , requiring the underpinning of the walls with concrete. After the last services ran on the night of 2 February 1930 the subway was closed until the formal re-opening on 14 January 1931 using E/3 type tram no. 1931 on new route 31, with public services starting the following day. The two tramway stations were also completely rebuilt. Routes were now Hackney to Wandsworth or Tooting, Leyton to Westminster, Highbury to Waterloo station or Norbury and Archway to Kennington.

A weekend service between Highgate (Archway) and Downham via Brockley ran until 1932. With a distance of , this was the longest tram route entirely within the County of London.

===1935–1940: Introduction of trolleybuses===
The London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933, taking over the London County Council trams. It was decided soon after to replace all trams in London by &quot;more modern vehicles&quot;. The abandonment programme began in 1935 with trams in South-West, West, North-West, North and East London mostly being replaced by trolleybuses. The replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940, when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred, leaving only the South London trams and the subway routes 31, 33 and 35, the only North London tram routes to survive the war.

Prototype Kingsway trolleybus no. 1379, with exits on both sides with folding doors, was constructed for feasibility tests through the subway, but these were unsuccessful as trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway, headroom restrictions making it impossible to use overhead current collection. The vehicle was retained and ran in normal service alongside conventional trolleybuses.

====Waterloo Bridge rebuilding====

In 1937, the rebuilding of Waterloo Bridge required the diversion of the side entrance to the tramway to a new position centrally underneath the bridge, which opened on 21 November of that year. There were metal doors covering this entrance until 2007, when construction began on the London Buddha Bar, which opened in autumn 2008.
===1946–1952: Withdrawal of trams===
In 1946, it was decided to replace London&#x27;s remaining trams &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, this time by diesel buses. The first subway route to be withdrawn was route 31, on 1 October 1950, with the remaining two routes, 33 and 35, being withdrawn after service on Saturday, 5 April 1952, the last public services being &quot;specials&quot; on the Sunday, shortly after midnight. During the early hours of the next morning the remaining trams north of the subway were run through to the depots south of the Thames.

===1952–1957: Closure===
Trams were abandoned in London on 5 July 1952, after which street tracks were lifted, but those in the subway mostly remain in place. In 1953, London Transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches in case they were needed for the Coronation but proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a film studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from October 1957.

After closure, a number of cartoons appeared in London newspapers based on the closed tramway, with ghostly trams or &#x27;lost&#x27; tube trains. On 23 November 1954 an edition of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; entitled &#x27;The Last Tram&#x27; featured a driver and conductress (Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister) who hid in the subway for 2½ years in order to ensure they were London&#x27;s last tram.

===1958 to present: Strand Underpass and other uses===
In June 1958, the London County Council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from Waterloo Bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with Strand and, in April 1962, the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used. Construction began that September and it opened as the Strand Underpass on 21 January 1964.

In an extensive plan for a semi-metro by Timothy Runnacles (1977), it was envisaged that the one line would use the former Kingsway tramway subway.

Until the opening of the Thames Barrier in 1984, a portable building near the north of the tunnel was used as a flood control headquarters for the Greater London Council.

Between 8 October and 8 November 2009, the tunnel hosted a site-specific art installation called &quot;Chord&quot; by the artist Conrad Shawcross.

Although following the same route along Kingsway, it was not envisaged that the proposed Cross River Tram would use the subway. The Cross River Tram project was cancelled in 2008.

In 2012, it was announced that Crossrail&#x27;s tunnel contractor BAM Nuttall/Ferrovial/Kier (BFK) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central London subway. The purpose of the grout shafts was to stabilize the ground in anticipation of the arrival of tunnel boring equipment in 2013. Crossrail agreed to restore the tunnel to its former condition on completion of the tunnel boring project, and a planning application to undertake this restoration was submitted in 2017.

The Greater London Authority publication &quot;Human Streets&quot; in March 2016 contained the proposal that the tunnel could be opened for cycling, in order to connect cyclists using the busy Theobalds Road route with the East-West Cycle Superhighway on the Embankment, thereby avoiding four junctions difficult for cyclists.

In July 2021 it was announced that visitors would be able to tour the tunnel, platforms and halls of the Kingsway station, in a programme organised by the London Transport Museum.

The southern section of the abandoned subway between the Embankment and the Strand Underpass was converted into a branch of the Buddha Bar chain of bar/restaurants. This involved the demolition of the pedestrian subways under Waterloo Bridge and extensive construction in the bridge&#x27;s undercroft. The site is now Proud Cabaret. The remaining Grade II listed structure is currently used as storage for masonry (due to low fire risk) by London Borough of Camden and a fire suppression unit for the adjoining service tunnels which experienced a fire in 2015.

==In popular culture==
*The remaining northern part of the subway is sometimes used in films, for example as itself in the Stephen Poliakoff film &quot;Hidden City,&quot; the secret entrance to the base in the film version of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and a railway tunnel in the film &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot;. It also appeared in &quot;The Escapist&quot;.
*In an episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, Neddie Seagoon discovers that a long-lost tram has been hijacked by its driver Henry Crun and is hidden in the Kingsway tunnel.

The United States started the petroleum reserve in 1975 to mitigate future supply disruptions as part of the international Agreement on an International Energy Program, after oil supplies were interrupted during the 1973–1974 oil embargo.

The current inventory is displayed on the SPR&#x27;s website. , the inventory was . This equates to about days of oil at 2019 daily U.S. consumption levels of or days of oil at 2019 daily U.S. import levels of . However, the maximum total withdrawal capability from the SPR is only , so it would take about days to use the entire inventory. At recent market prices ($58 a barrel as of March 2021), the SPR holds over $14.6 billion in sweet crude and approximately $18.3 billion in sour crude (assuming a $15/barrel discount for sulfur content). In 2012, the total value of the crude in the SPR was approximately $43.5 billion, while the price paid for the oil was $20.1 billion (an average of $28.42 per barrel).

Since 2015 Congress has mandated sales of oil from the reserve to fund federal spending. The U.S. Department of Energy has run at least seven sales since 2017, selling 132 million barrels, or about 18.2% of what had been in the reserve.

On March 31, 2022, President Joe Biden announced that his administration would release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the reserve for the next 180 days, selling it at an average price of $96 per barrel. The 2022 release became the largest ever SPR sale and lowered the SPR to its lowest levels in 40 years. After oil prices declined during the second half of the year, in December the administration announced it would begin replenishing the SPR in early 2023, expecting to purchase oil at a lower price than it was sold, a process that would take months or years to complete. The Biden administration continued to release reserves in 2023, selling off 45% of the SPR by September 2023. The Department of Energy unveiled plans to purchase oil at a price of $79 per barrel or less, but has since purchased oil at higher prices. As of April 2024, further purchases were cancelled due to rising oil prices.

According to legislation already in place, the amount of oil in the reserve could fall to 238 million barrels by 2028. This will be a 67% reduction to the oil in the reservoir since 2010.

== Facilities ==

The SPR management office is located in Elmwood, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans.

The reserve is stored at four sites on the Gulf of Mexico, each located near a major center of petrochemical refining and processing. Each site contains a number of artificial caverns created in salt domes below the surface.

Individual caverns within a site can be up to below the surface. Average dimensions are wide and deep; capacity ranges from . Almost $4 billion was spent on the facilities. The decision to store in caverns was made to reduce costs. The Department of Energy claims that it is approximately ten times more cost effective to store oil below the surface, with the added advantages of no leaks and a constant natural churn of the oil due to a temperature gradient in the caverns. The caverns were created by drilling down and then dissolving the salt with water.

===Existing===
* Bryan Mound: Freeport, Texas. 20 caverns with a storage capacity of with a drawdown capacity of per day.
* Big Hill: Winnie, Texas. Has a capacity of with a drawdown capacity of per day.
* West Hackberry: Lake Charles, Louisiana. Has a capacity of with a drawdown capacity of per day.
* Bayou Choctaw: Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Has a capacity of with a maximum drawdown rate of per day.

===Proposed===
* Richton, Mississippi: This facility, if built as planned, would have had a capacity of with a drawdown capacity of per day. Former Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman announced the creation of this site in February 2007. As of 2008, this site was facing some opposition. According to the DOE: &quot;Activities towards the goal of expansion of the SPR to one billion barrels, as directed by Congress in the 2005 Act, were cancelled in 2011 after Congress rescinded all remaining expansion funds.&quot;

===Retired===
* Weeks Island: Iberia Parish, Louisiana (decommissioned 1999): Capacity of . This facility was a conventional room and pillar near-surface salt mine, formerly owned by Morton Salt. In 1993, a sinkhole formed on the site, allowing fresh water to intrude into the mine. Because of the mine&#x27;s construction in salt deposits, fresh water would erode the ceiling, potentially causing the structure to fail. The mine was backfilled with salt-saturated brine. This process, which allowed for recovery of 98% of the petroleum stored in the facility, reduced the risk of further fresh water intrusion, and helped prevent the remaining oil from leaking into the aquifer that is located over the salt dome.

== History ==
===Background===
The SPR was created following the 1973 energy crisis. On November 18, 1974, the United States became a signatory to the Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP) and a founding member of the International Energy Agency that the IEP established. One of the key commitments made by the treaty&#x27;s signatories is to maintain oil stocks of no less than 90 days of net imports.

Access to the reserve is determined by the conditions written into the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), primarily to counter a severe supply interruption. The maximum removal rate, by physical constraints, is . Oil could begin entering the marketplace 13 days after a presidential order. The Department of Energy says it has about 59 days of import protection in the SPR. This, combined with private sector inventory protection, is estimated to equal 115 days of imports.

The EPCA of December 22, 1975, made it policy for the United States to establish a reserve up to 1 billion barrels (159 million m³) of petroleum. A number of existing storage sites were acquired in 1977. Construction of the first surface facilities began in June 1977. On July 21, 1977, the first oil—approximately of Saudi Arabian light crude—was delivered to the SPR. Fill was suspended in Fiscal Year 1995 to devote budget resources to refurbishing the SPR equipment and extending the life of the complex.

===Domestic actions===
On November 13, 2001, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush announced that the SPR would be filled, saying, &quot;The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an important element of our Nation&#x27;s energy security. To maximize long-term protection against oil supply disruptions, I am directing the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR up to its capacity.&quot; The highest prior level was reached in 1994 with . At the time of President Bush&#x27;s directive, the SPR contained about . Since the directive in 2001, the capacity of the SPR has increased by due to natural enlargement of the salt caverns in which the reserves are stored. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has since directed the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR to the full authorized capacity, a process which will require a physical expansion of the Reserve&#x27;s facilities.

On August 17, 2005, the SPR reached its goal of . Approximately 60% of the crude oil in the reserve is the less desirable sour (high sulfur content) variety. The oil delivered to the reserve is &quot;royalty-in-kind&quot; oil—royalties owed to the U.S. government by operators who acquire leases on the federally owned Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. These royalties were previously collected as cash, but in 1998 the government began testing the effectiveness of collecting royalties &quot;in kind&quot;—or in other words, acquiring the crude oil itself. This mechanism was adopted when refilling the SPR began, and once filling is completed, revenues from the sale of future royalties will be paid into the federal treasury.

On April 25, 2006, President Bush announced a temporary halt to petroleum deposits to the SPR as part of a four-point program to alleviate high fuel prices.

On January 23, 2007, President Bush suggested in his State of the Union speech that Congress should approve expansion of the current reserve capacity to twice its current level.

On May 16, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said it would halt all deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve sometime in July. This announcement came days after Congress voted to direct the Bush administration to do the same.

On January 2, 2009, after a sharp decline in fuel prices, DOE said that it would begin buying approximately of crude oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, replenishing supplies that were sold after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The purchase would be funded by the roughly $600 million received from those emergency sales.

On September 9, 2011, a Notice of Cancellation was published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; after Congress rescinded funding for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reversing the SPR expansion initiative previously directed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

On October 20, 2014, a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended reducing the size of the Reserve. According to the report, the amount of oil held in reserve exceeds the amount required to be kept on hand given the need for imported crude oil had decreased in recent years. The report said the DOE agreed with the GAO recommendation.

On March 19, 2020, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Energy to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to maximum capacity, when oil was priced at $24 per barrel. This directive was given to help support domestic oil producers given the impending economic collapse from COVID-19 and extreme drops in international oil markets. However, funding was blocked by Congress, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer stating that Democrats had blocked a &quot;bailout for big oil&quot;.

In 2022, the Biden administration sold 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over 6 months. The sale lowered the SPR to its lowest levels in 40 years and was the largest ever release of oil from the SPR. SPR drawdowns continued into 2023, lowering the SPR by 45% from January 2021. Since the 2022 sales, the Department of Energy bought back 32.3 million barrels of oil, aiming to purchase at a maximum price of $79 per barrel. However, oil has been purchased exceeding the $79 price cap in March 2024. As of April 2024, further SPR purchases were cancelled due to rising oil prices.

===Emergency sales to Israel===
According to the 1975 Sinai Interim Agreement signed by the United States and Israel, as a precondition for Israel&#x27;s return of the Sinai Peninsula and its associated oil reserves to Egypt, in an emergency the United States was obligated to make oil available for sale to Israel for up to five years. Israel has never invoked the agreement , however. The agreement was extended in 1979, 1994, 2004, and, most recently, in 2015 for a ten-year period.

===International obligations===
As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States must stock an amount of petroleum equivalent to at least 90 days of U.S. imports. The SPR contained an equivalent to 141 days of imports as of September 2016. The United States is also obligated to contribute 43.9% of petroleum in any IEA-coordinated release.

== Limitations ==
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is primarily a crude petroleum reserve, not a stockpile of refined petroleum fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Although the United States maintains some extra supply of refined petroleum fuels, e.g., the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve under the of the Department of Energy (DOE), the government does not maintain gasoline reserves on anything like the scale of the SPR. The SPR is intended to give the United States protection from disruptions in oil supplies. In the event of a major disruption to refinery operations, the United States would have to call on members of the International Energy Agency that stockpile refined products, and use refining capacities outside of the continental United States for relief.

There have been suggestions that the DOE should increase its supplies and stockpile both gasoline and jet fuel.
Some countries and zones have a strategic reserve of both petroleum and petroleum products. In some cases, this includes a strategic reserve of jet fuel.

Former Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman said that the Department would consider new facilities for refined products as part of an expansion of .

== Drawdowns ==

===Petroleum sales - Prior to 2015===
* 1985: Test sale—
* 1990–1991: Desert Storm sale—
** in October 1990 test sale
** in January 1991 presidentially ordered drawdown
* 1996–1997: non-emergency sales for deficit reduction
* July–August 2000: to supply the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.
* September–October 2000: in response to a concern over low distillate levels in the northeastern U.S.
* 2005 Hurricane Katrina sale: —Katrina shut down 95% of crude production and 88% of natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico. This amounted to a quarter of total U.S. output. About 735 oil and natural gas rigs and platforms had been evacuated due to the hurricane.
* 2011 Arab Spring sale: —non-emergency sale to offset disruptions caused by political upheaval in Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East. The amount was matched by IEA countries, for a total of released from stockpiles around the world.

===Petroleum exchanges and loans===
&quot;Note: Loans are made on a case-by-case basis to alleviate supply disruptions. Once conditions return to normal, the loan is returned to the SPR with additional oil as interest.&quot;
* April–May 1996: lent to ARCO to alleviate pipeline blockage.
* August 1998: lent to PEMEX in return for of higher-quality crude.

Purchases of crude oil would then resume in January 2009 using revenues available from the 2005 Hurricane Katrina emergency sale. The DOE purchased at a cost of $553 million.
* January–February 2006: lent to Total Petrochemicals USA due to closure of the Sabine–Neches Waterway to deep-draft vessels after a barge accident in the channel.
* June 2006: of sour crude lent to ConocoPhillips and Citgo due to the closure for several days of the Calcasieu Ship Channel caused by the release of a mixture of storm water and oil. Repaid in early October 2006.
* September 2008: lent to Citgo, Placid Refining, and Marathon Oil due to disruptions from Hurricane Gustav.
* August 2017: 200,000 barrels of sweet crude and 300,000 barrels of sour crude were lent to Phillips 66 due to disruptions from Hurricane Harvey.

===Drawdowns since 2015===

Since 2015, Congress has been selling the oil in the reserve to fund the deficit, in unpublicized sales. The U.S. Department of Energy has run seven sales since 2017, selling more than 132 million barrels, or about 18.2% of what had been in the reserve.

According to legislation already in place, the amount of oil in the reserve could fall to as little as 238 million barrels by 2028. This will be a 67% reduction of oil in the reserve since 2010.

The legislation is summarized below:

* The Bipartisan Budget Act (Section 404), enacted in 2015, includes authorization for funding an SPR modernization program to support improvements deemed necessary to preserve the long-term integrity and utility of SPR&#x27;s infrastructure by selling up to $2 billion worth of SPR crude oil in fiscal years 2017 through 2020. Although the estimated volumes presented in the chart above are based on an assumed oil price of $50 per barrel, the actual final sales volumes will depend on how SPR decides to allocate the sales volumes across those fiscal years and the actual price of crude oil at the time of the sales. For the Section 404 sales, SPR must get an appropriation from Congress to approve its requested sales revenue target.
* Another section of the Bipartisan Budget Act (Section 403), enacted in 2015, mandates SPR crude oil sales for fiscal years 2018 through 2025 on a volumetric basis, rather than on a dollar basis, as specified in Section 404. The revenues from sales authorized under section 403 will be deposited into the general fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
* The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, enacted in December 2015, calls for SPR sales totaling 66 million barrels from fiscal years 2023 through 2025.
* The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, calls for the sale of 25 million barrels of SPR crude oil for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The first portion of these sales is expected in late spring 2017.
* In December 2016, the DOE announced it would begin the sale of in January 2017.
* The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, enacted in December 2017, calls for the sale of 7 million barrels over the two-year period of FY 2026 through FY 2027.
* The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in February 2018, calls for the sale of 30 million barrels over the four-year period of FY 2022 through FY 2025, 35 million barrels in FY 2026, and 35 million barrels in FY 2027.
* In November 2021, the White House announced the release of to address high gasoline prices.
* On March 1, 2022, President Biden announced the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the reserve in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
*On March 31, 2022, President Biden announced that his administration would release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the reserve for the next 180 days.

<text>The acute accent (), , 
is a diacritic used in many modern written languages with alphabets based on the Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. For the most commonly encountered uses of the accent in the Latin and Greek alphabets, precomposed characters are available.

==Uses==

===History===
An early precursor of the acute accent was the apex, used in Latin inscriptions to mark long vowels.

The acute accent was first used in French in 1530 by Geoffroy Tory, the royal printer.

===Pitch===

====Ancient Greek====

The acute accent was first used in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, where it indicated a syllable with a high pitch. In Modern Greek, a stress accent has replaced the pitch accent, and the acute marks the stressed syllable of a word. The Greek name of the accented syllable was and is (&quot;oxeîa&quot;, Modern Greek &quot;oxía&quot;) &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;high&quot;, which was calqued (loan-translated) into Latin as &quot;sharpened&quot;.

=== Stress ===

The acute accent marks the stressed vowel of a word in several languages:
*Asturian
*Belarusian
*Blackfoot uses acute accents to show the place of stress in a word, for example, &quot;soyópokistsi&quot; ().
*Bulgarian: stress, which is variable in Bulgarian, is not usually indicated in Bulgarian except in dictionaries and sometimes in homonyms that are distinguished only by stress. However, Bulgarian usually uses the grave accent to mark the vowel in a stressed syllable, unlike Russian and Ukrainian, which use the acute accent.
*Catalan uses it in stressed vowels: &quot;é&quot;, &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ú&quot;.
*Dutch uses it to mark stress (&quot;vóórkomen&quot; – &quot;voorkómen&quot;, meaning &quot;occur&quot; and &quot;prevent&quot; respectively) or a more closed vowel (&quot;hé&quot; – &quot;hè&quot;, equivalent to English &quot;hey&quot; and &quot;heh&quot;) if it is not clear from context. Sometimes, it is simply used for disambiguation, as in &quot;één&quot; – &quot;een&quot;, meaning &quot;one&quot; and &quot;a(n)&quot;.
*Galician
*Hopi has acute to mark a higher tone.
*Italian The accent is used to indicate the stress in a word, or whether the vowel is &quot;open&quot; or &quot;wide&quot;, or &quot;closed&quot;, or &quot;narrow&quot;. For example, &quot;pèsca&quot; &quot;peach&quot; (&quot;open&quot; or &quot;wide&quot; vowel, as in &quot;pen&quot;) and &quot;pésca&quot; &quot;fishing&quot; (&quot;closed&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot; vowel, as in &quot;pain&quot;). However, in some regional accents, these words can be pronouned the same way, or even with opposite values.
*Lakota. For example, &quot;kákhi&quot; &quot;in that direction&quot; but &quot;kakhí&quot; &quot;take something to someone back there&quot;.
*Leonese uses it for marking stress or disambiguation.
*Modern Greek marks the stressed vowel of every polysyllabic word: (&quot;á&quot;), (&quot;é&quot;), (&quot;í&quot;), (&quot;í&quot;), (&quot;ó&quot;), (&quot;ý&quot;), (&quot;ó&quot;).
*Navajo where the acute marks a higher tone.
*Norwegian, Swedish and Danish use the acute accent to indicate that a terminal syllable with the &quot;e&quot; is stressed and is often omitted if it does not change the meaning: &quot;armen&quot; (first syllable stressed) means &quot;the arm&quot; while &quot;armé(e)n&quot; means &quot;the army&quot;; &quot;ide&quot; (first syllable stressed) means &quot;bear&#x27;s den&quot; in Swedish, while &quot;idé&quot; means &quot;idea&quot;. Also stress-related are the different spellings of the words en/én and et/ét (the indefinite article and the word &quot;one&quot; in Danish and Norwegian). In Norwegian, however, the neuter word &quot;one&quot; is spelled ett. Then, the acute points out that there is one and only one of the object, which derives from the obsolete spelling(s) een and eet. Some loanwords, mainly from French, are also written with the acute accent, such as Norwegian and Swedish &quot;kafé&quot; and Danish &quot;café&quot; (also &quot;cafe&quot;).
*Occitan
*Portuguese: &quot;á&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ú&quot;. It may also indicate height (see below).
*Russian. Syllabic stress is irregular in Russian, and in reference and teaching materials (dictionaries and books for children or foreigners), stress is indicated by an acute accent above the stressed vowel, e.g. &quot;соба́ка&quot; (, dog), as follows: , , , , , , , , . The acute accent can be used both in the Cyrillic and sometimes in the romanised text.
*Spanish marks stressed syllables in polysyllabic words that deviate from the standardized stress patterns. In monosyllabic words, it is used to distinguish homophones, e.g.: &quot;el&quot; (the) and &quot;él&quot; (he).
*Tagalog dictionaries including other Philippine languages use the acute accent to mark a vowel in a syllable with lexical stress &quot;(Diín)&quot; and avoid ambiguity. Combinations include á, í, ó, and ú while é is the rarest one. Since they are not part of the official alphabet, these vowels do not affect the order of each letter. Vowels with a stress at the first syllable are left unwritten and serves as the default word. For example, &quot;baka&quot; (cow) and &quot;baká&quot; (maybe).
*Ukrainian: sometimes added to mark syllabic stress, when it can help to distinguish between homographs: vs. , as follows: , , , , , , , , . Commonly used in dictionaries, readers, and some children&#x27;s books. 
*Welsh: word stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable, but one way of indicating stress on a final (short) vowel is by the use of the acute accent. In the Welsh orthography, it can be on any vowel: &quot;á&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ú&quot;, &quot;ẃ&quot;, or &quot;ý&quot;. Examples: &quot;to hate&quot;, &quot;cigarette&quot;, &quot;umbrella&quot;.

===Height===
The acute accent marks the height of some stressed vowels in various Romance languages.
*To mark high vowels:
**Bislama. One of the two orthographies distinguishes &quot;é&quot; from &quot;e&quot; . The orthography after 1995 does not distinguish these sounds, and has no diacritics.
**Catalan. The acute marks the quality of the vowels &quot;é&quot; (as opposed to &quot;è&quot; ), and &quot;ó&quot; (as opposed to &quot;ò&quot; ).
**French. The acute is used on &quot;é&quot;. It is known as &quot;accent aigu&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;accent grave&quot; which is the accent sloped the other way. It distinguishes &quot;é&quot; from &quot;è&quot; , &quot;ê&quot; , and &quot;e&quot; . Unlike in other Romance languages, the accent marks do not imply stress in French.
**Italian. The acute accent (sometimes called &quot;accento chiuso&quot;, &quot;closed accent&quot; in Italian) is compulsory only in words of more than one syllable stressed on their final vowel (and a few other words). Words ending in stressed -o are never marked with an acute accent (&quot;ó&quot;), but with a grave accent (&quot;ò&quot;). Therefore, only &quot;é&quot; and &quot;è&quot; are normally contrasted, typically in words ending in &quot;-ché&quot;, such as &quot;perché&quot; (&quot;why/because&quot;); in the conjugated copula &quot;è&quot; (&quot;is&quot;); in ambiguous monosyllables such as &quot;né&quot; (&#x27;neither&#x27;) &quot;vs.&quot; &quot;ne&quot; (&#x27;of it&#x27;) and &quot;sé&quot; (&#x27;itself&#x27;) &quot;vs.&quot; &quot;se&quot; (&#x27;if&#x27;); and some verb forms, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;poté&quot; (&quot;he/she/it could&quot; (past tense)). The symbol &quot;ó&quot; can be used in the body of a word for disambiguation, for instance between &quot;bótte&quot; (&quot;barrel&quot;) and &quot;bòtte&quot; (&quot;beating&quot;), though this is not mandatory: in fact standard Italian keyboards lack a dedicated &quot;ó&quot; key.
**Occitan. The acute marks the quality of the vowels &quot;é&quot; (as opposed to &quot;è&quot; ), &quot;ó&quot; (as opposed to &quot;ò&quot; ) and &quot;á&quot; (as opposed to &quot;à&quot; ).
**Scottish Gaelic (a Celtic rather than Romance language) uses/used a system in which &quot;é&quot; is contrasted with &quot;è&quot; and &quot;ó&quot; with &quot;ò&quot; . Both the grave and acute indicate length; &quot;é&quot;/&quot;è&quot; and &quot;ó&quot;/&quot;ò&quot; are thus contrasted with &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; respectively. Besides, &quot;á&quot; appears in the words &quot;á&quot; , &quot;ám&quot; and &quot;ás&quot; in order to distinguish them from &quot;a&quot; , &quot;am&quot; and &quot;as&quot; respectively. The other vowels (&quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot;) only appear either without an accent or with a grave. Since the 1980s the SQA (which sets school standards and thus the &quot;de facto&quot; standard language) and most publishers have abandoned the acute accent, using grave accents in all situations (analogous to the use of the acute in Irish). However, universities, some publishers and many speakers continue to use acute accents.
*To mark low vowels:
**Portuguese. The vowels &quot;á&quot; , &quot;é&quot; and &quot;ó&quot; are stressed low vowels, in opposition to &quot;â&quot; , &quot;ê&quot; and &quot;ô&quot; which are stressed high vowels. However, the accent is only used in words whose stressed syllable is in an unpredictable location within the word: where the location of the stressed syllable is predictable, no accent is used, and the height of the stressed vowel cannot then usually be determined solely from the word&#x27;s spelling.

===Length===

====Long vowels====
*Arabic and Persian: were used in western transliteration of Islamic language texts from the 18th to early 20th centuries. Representing the long vowels, they are typically transcribed with a macron today except in Bahá&#x27;í orthography.
*Classical Latin: sometimes used to represent the apex in modern orthography.
*Czech: are the long versions of . The accent is known as . To indicate a long in the middle or at the end of a word, a (&quot;ring&quot;) is used instead, to form .
*Hungarian: are the long equivalents of the vowels . (see double acute accent) are the long equivalents of . Both types of accents are known as ( means long). The letters and are two long vowels but they are also distinct in quality, rather than being the long equivalents of and (see below in Letter extension).
*Irish: are the long equivalents of the vowels , the accent affects pronunciation and meaning, e.g. (&quot;John&quot;) but (&quot;old&quot;). The accent is known as a (&quot;long (sign)&quot;), which is also used in Hiberno-English.
*Old Norse: are the long versions of . Sometimes, is used as the long version of , but is used more often. Sometimes, the short-lived Old Icelandic long (also written ) is written using an acute-accented form, , or a version with a macron, , but usually it is not distinguished from from which it is derived by u-mutation.
*Slovak: the acute accent is called in Slovak. In addition to the long vowels , dĺžeň is used to mark syllabic consonants , which are the long counterparts of syllabic .

====Short vowels====
*Ligurian: in the official orthography, &quot;é&quot; is used for short , and &quot;ó&quot; is used for short .

=== Palatalization ===
A graphically similar, but not identical, mark is indicative of a palatalized sound in several languages.

In Polish, such a mark is known as a (&quot;stroke&quot;) and is an integral part of several letters: four consonants and one vowel. When appearing in consonants, it indicates palatalization, similar to the use of the in Czech and other Slavic languages (e.g. &quot;six&quot;). However, in contrast to the which is usually used for postalveolar consonants, the denotes alveolo-palatal consonants. In traditional Polish typography, the is more nearly vertical than the acute accent, and placed slightly right of center. A similar rule applies to the Belarusian Latin alphabet . However, for computer use, Unicode conflates the codepoints for these letters with those of the accented Latin letters of similar appearance.

In Serbo-Croatian, as in Polish, the letter is used to represent a voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate .

In the romanization of Macedonian, and represent the Cyrillic letters (Gje) and (Kje), which stand for palatal or alveolo-palatal consonants, though and (or and ) are more commonly used for this purpose. The same two letters are used to transcribe the postulated Proto-Indo-European phonemes and .

 uses the acute for palatalization as in Polish: . Lower also uses , and Lower previously used and , also written as ; these are now spelt as and . 

===Tone===
In the Quốc Ngữ system for Vietnamese, the Yale romanization for Cantonese, the Pinyin romanization for Mandarin Chinese, and the Bopomofo semi-syllabary, the acute accent indicates a rising tone. In Mandarin, the alternative to the acute accent is the number 2 after the syllable: lái = lai2. In Cantonese Yale, the acute accent is either tone 2, or tone 5 if the vowel(s) are followed by &#x27;h&#x27; (if the number form is used, &#x27;h&#x27; is omitted): má = ma2, máh = ma5.

In African languages and Athabaskan languages, it frequently marks a high tone, e.g., Yoruba &quot;apá&quot; &#x27;arm&#x27;, Nobiin &quot;féntí&quot; &#x27;sweet date&#x27;, Ekoti &quot;kaláwa&quot; &#x27;boat&#x27;, Navajo &quot;tʼáá&quot; &#x27;just&#x27;.

The acute accent is used in Serbo-Croatian dictionaries and linguistic publications to indicate a high-rising accent. It is not used in everyday writing.

=== Disambiguation ===
The acute accent is used to disambiguate certain words which would otherwise be homographs in the following languages:

*Catalan. Examples: &quot;són&quot; &quot;they are&quot; vs. &quot;son&quot; &quot;tiredness&quot;, &quot;més&quot; &quot;more&quot; vs. &quot;mes&quot; &quot;month&quot;.
*Danish. Examples: &quot;én&quot; &quot;one&quot; vs. &quot;en&quot; &quot;a/an&quot;; &quot;fór&quot; &quot;went&quot; vs. &quot;for&quot; &quot;for&quot;; &quot;véd&quot; &quot;know(s)&quot; vs. &quot;ved&quot; &quot;by&quot;; &quot;gǿr&quot; &quot;bark(s)&quot; vs. &quot;gør&quot; &quot;do(es)&quot;; &quot;dǿr&quot; &quot;die(s)&quot; vs. &quot;dør&quot; &quot;door&quot;; &quot;allé&quot; &quot;alley&quot; vs. &quot;alle&quot; &quot;everybody&quot;. Furthermore, it is also used for the imperative form of verbs ending in &quot;-ere&quot;, which lose their final &quot;e&quot; and might be mistaken for plurals of a noun (which most often end in &quot;-er&quot;): &quot;analysér&quot; is the imperative form of &quot;at analysere&quot; &quot;to analyse&quot;, &quot;analyser&quot; is &quot;analyses&quot;, plural of the noun &quot;analyse&quot; &quot;analysis&quot;. Using an acute accent is always optional, never required.
*Dutch. Examples: &quot;één&quot; &quot;one&quot; vs. &quot;een&quot; &quot;a/an&quot;; &quot;vóór&quot; &quot;before&quot; vs. &quot;voor&quot; &quot;for&quot;; &quot;vóórkomen&quot; &quot;to exist/to happen&quot; vs. &quot;voorkómen&quot; &quot;to prevent/to avoid&quot;. Using an acute accent is mostly optional.
*Modern Greek. Although all polysyllabic words have an acute accent on the stressed syllable, in monosyllabic words the presence or absence of an accent may disambiguate. The most common case is , the feminine definite article (&quot;the&quot;), versus , meaning &quot;or&quot;. Other cases include (&quot;who&quot;/&quot;which&quot;) versus (&quot;where&quot;) and (&quot;that&quot;, as in &quot;he told me &quot;that&quot;...&quot;) versus (&quot;how&quot;).
*Norwegian. It is used to indicate stress on a vowel otherwise not expected to have stress. Most words are stressed on the first syllable and diacritical marks are rarely used. Although incorrect, it is frequently used to mark the imperative form of verbs ending in &quot;-ere&quot; as it is in Danish: &quot;kontrollér&quot; is the imperative form of &quot;to control&quot;, &quot;kontroller&quot; is the noun &quot;controls&quot;. The simple past of the verb &quot;å fare&quot;, &quot;to travel&quot;, can optionally be written &quot;fór&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;for&quot; (preposition &quot;for&quot; as in English), &quot;fôr&quot; &quot;feed&quot; &quot;n.&quot;/&quot;lining&quot;, or &quot;fòr&quot; (only in Nynorsk) &quot;narrow ditch, trail by plow&quot; (all the diacritics in these examples are optional.)
*Russian. Acute accents (technically, stress marks) are used in dictionaries to indicate the stressed syllable. They may also be optionally used to disambiguate both between minimal pairs, such as за́мок (read as zámak, means &quot;castle&quot;) and замо́к (read as zamók, means &quot;lock&quot;), and between question words and relative pronouns such as что (&quot;what&quot;, stressed, or &quot;that&quot;, unstressed), similarly to Spanish. This is rare, however, as usually meaning is determined by context and no stress mark is written. The same rules apply to Ukrainian, Rusyn, Belarusian and Bulgarian.
*Spanish. Covers various question word / relative pronoun pairs where the first is stressed and the second is a clitic, such as &quot;cómo&quot; (interrogative &quot;how&quot;) and &quot;como&quot; (non-interrogative &quot;how&quot;, comparative &quot;like&quot;, &quot;I eat&quot;), differentiates &quot;qué&quot; (what) from &quot;que&quot; (that), and some other words such as &quot;tú&quot; &quot;you&quot; and &quot;tu&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;té&quot; &quot;tea&quot; and &quot;te&quot; &quot;you&quot; (direct/indirect object), &quot;él&quot; &quot;he/him&quot; and &quot;el&quot; (&quot;the&quot;, masculine). This usage of the acute accent is called &quot;tilde diacrítica&quot;.

=== Emphasis ===
*In Danish, the acute accent can also be used for emphasis, especially on the word &quot;der&quot; (there), as in &quot;Der kan ikke være mange mennesker dér&quot;, meaning &quot;There can&#x27;t be many people &quot;there&quot; or &quot;Dér skal vi hen&quot; meaning &quot;That&#x27;s&quot; where we&#x27;re going&quot;.
* In Dutch, the acute accent can also be used to emphasize an individual word within a sentence. For example, &quot;Dit is ónze auto, niet die van jullie&quot;, &quot;This is &quot;our&quot; car, not yours.&quot; In this example, &quot;ónze&quot; is merely an emphasized form of &quot;onze&quot;. Also in family names like Piét, Piél, Plusjé, Hofsté. The IJ digraph can be stressed with íj́ but is usually stressed as íj for technical reasons.
* In the Armenian script emphasis on a word is marked by an acute accent above the word&#x27;s stressed vowel; it is traditionally grouped with the Armenian question and exclamation marks which are also diacritics applied to the stressed vowel.

=== Letter extension ===
*In Faroese, the acute accent is used on five of the vowels (a, i, o, u and y), but these letters, á, í, ó, ú and ý are considered separate letters with separate pronunciations.
*: á: long , short and before : 
*: í/ý: long , short 
*: ó: long , or , short: , except Suðuroy: 
*:: When ó is followed by the skerping -gv, it is pronounced , except in Suðuroy where it is 
*: ú: long , short 
*:: When ú is followed by the skerping -gv, it is pronounced 
*In Hungarian, the acute accent marks a difference in quality on two vowels, apart from vowel length:
*:The (short) vowel &quot;a&quot; is open back rounded (ɒ), but &quot;á&quot; is open front unrounded (a) (and long).
*:Similarly, the (short) vowel &quot;e&quot; is open-mid front unrounded (ɛ), while (long) &quot;é&quot; is close-mid front unrounded (e).
*:Despite this difference, in most of the cases, these two pairs are arranged as equal in collation, just like the other pairs (see above) that only differ in length.
*In Icelandic the acute accent is used on all 6 of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u and y), and, like in Faroese, these are considered separate letters.
*: á: 
*: é: long , short 
*: í/ý: 
*: ó: 
*: ú: 
*:All can be either short or long, but the pronunciation of &quot;é&quot; is not the same short and long.
*: Etymologically, vowels with an acute accent in these languages correspond to their Old Norse counterparts, which were long vowels but in many cases have become diphthongs. The only exception is é, which in Faroese has become æ.
*In Kashubian, Polish, and Sorbian, the acute on &quot;ó&quot;, historically used to indicate a lengthening of &quot;o&quot; , now indicates higher pronunciation, and , respectively.
*In Turkmen, the letter &quot;ý&quot; is a consonant: .

=== Other uses ===
*In some Basque texts predating Standard Basque, the letters and carry acute accents (an invention by Sabino Arana), which are otherwise indicated by double letters. In such cases, is used to represent (a trilled , this spelling is used even at the end of a syllable, to differentiate from --, an alveolar tap in Basque in word-final positions is always trilled) and for (a palatalized ).
*In transliterating texts written in Cuneiform, an acute accent over the vowel indicates that the original sign is the second representing that value in the canonical lists. Thus &quot;su&quot; is used to transliterate the first sign with the phonetic value , while &quot;sú&quot; transliterates the second sign with the value . 
*In Emilian, &quot;é ó&quot; denote both length and height, representing [e, o].
*In Indonesian dictionaries, is used to represent , while is used to represent .
*In Northern Sámi, an acute accent was placed over the corresponding Latin letter to represent the letters peculiar to this language (&quot;Áá, Čč, Đđ, Ŋŋ, Šš, Ŧŧ, Žž&quot;) when typing when there was no way of entering these letters correctly otherwise.
*Many Norwegian words of French origin retain an acute accent, such as &quot;allé&quot;, &quot;kafé&quot;, &quot;idé&quot;, &quot;komité&quot;. Popular usage can be sketchy and often neglects the accent, or results in the grave accent erroneously being used in its place. Likewise, in Swedish, the acute accent is used only for the letter , mostly in words of French origin and in some names. It is used both to indicate a change in vowel quantity as well as quality and that the stress should be on this, normally unstressed, syllable. Examples include &quot;café&quot; (&quot;café&quot;) and &quot;resumé&quot; (&quot;résumé&quot;, noun). There are two pairs of homographs that are differentiated only by the accent: &quot;armé&quot; (&quot;army&quot;) versus &quot;arme&quot; (&quot;poor; pitiful&quot;, masculine gender) and &quot;idé&quot; (&quot;idea&quot;) versus &quot;ide&quot; (&quot;winter quarters&quot;).
* and are used in Pashto in the Latin alphabet, equivalent to and , respectively.
*In Romagnol, &quot;é ó&quot; denote both length and height, representing [eː, oː].

=== English ===
As with other diacritical marks, a number of (usually French) loanwords are sometimes spelled in English with an acute accent as used in the original language: these include &quot;attaché&quot;, &quot;blasé&quot;, &quot;canapé&quot;, &quot;cliché&quot;, &quot;communiqué&quot;, &quot;café&quot;, &quot;décor&quot;, &quot;déjà vu&quot;, &quot;détente&quot;, &quot;élite&quot;, &quot;entrée&quot;, &quot;exposé&quot;, &quot;mêlée&quot;, &quot;fiancé&quot;, &quot;fiancée&quot;, &quot;papier-mâché&quot;, &quot;passé&quot;, &quot;pâté&quot;, &quot;piqué&quot;, &quot;plié&quot;, &quot;repoussé&quot;, &quot;résumé&quot;, &quot;risqué&quot;, &quot;sauté&quot;, &quot;roué&quot;, &quot;séance&quot;, &quot;naïveté&quot; and &quot;touché&quot;. Retention of the accent is common only in the French ending &quot;é&quot; or &quot;ée&quot;, as in these examples, where its absence would tend to suggest a different pronunciation. Thus the French word &quot;résumé&quot; is commonly seen in English as &quot;&quot;, with only one accent (but also with both or none).

Acute accents are sometimes added to loanwords where a final &quot;e&quot; is not silent, for example, &quot;maté&quot; from Spanish &quot;mate,&quot; the Maldivian capital &quot;Malé,&quot; &quot;saké&quot; from Japanese &quot;sake&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon&quot; from the Japanese compound for &quot;pocket monster,&quot; the last three from languages which do not use the Roman alphabet, and where transcriptions do not normally use acute accents.

For foreign terms used in English that have not been assimilated into English or are not in general English usage, italics are generally used with the appropriate accents: for example, &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, &quot;pièce de résistance&quot;, &quot;crème brûlée&quot; and &quot;ancien régime&quot;.

The acute accent is sometimes (though rarely) used for poetic purposes:

* It can mark stress on an unusual syllable: for example, &quot;caléndar&quot; to indicate (rather than the standard ).
* It can disambiguate stress where the distinction is metrically important: for example, &quot;rébel&quot; (as opposed to &quot;rebél&quot;), or &quot;áll trádes&quot;, to show that the phrase is pronounced as a spondee, rather than the more natural iamb.
* It can indicate the sounding of an ordinarily silent letter: for example, &quot;pickéd&quot; to indicate the pronunciation , rather than standard (the grave accent is more common for this last purpose).

The layout of some European PC keyboards, combined with problematic keyboard-driver semantics, causes some users to use an acute accent or a grave accent instead of an apostrophe when typing in English (e.g. typing or instead of John&#x27;s).

== Typographic form ==

Western typographic and calligraphic traditions generally design the acute accent as going from top to bottom. French even has the definition of acute is the accent (), meaning that it descends from top right to lower left.

In Polish, the diacritic is used instead, which usually has a different shape and style compared to other European languages. It features a more vertical steep form and is moved more to the right side of center line than acute. As Unicode does not differentiate the from acute, letters from Western (computer) fonts and Polish fonts had to share the same set of code points, which make designing the conflicting character (i.e. &quot;o acute&quot;, ) more troublesome. OpenType tried to solve this problem by giving language-sensitive glyph substitution to designers such that the font would automatically switch between Western and Polish based on language settings. New computer fonts are sensitive to this issue and their design for the diacritics tends toward a more &quot;universal design&quot; so that there will be less need for localization, for example Roboto and Noto typefaces.

Pinyin uses the acute accent to mark the second tone (rising or high-rising tone), which indicates a tone rising from low to high, causing the writing stroke of acute accent to go from lower left to top right. This contradicts the Western typographic tradition which makes designing the acute accent in Chinese typefaces a problem. Designers approach this problem in 3 ways: either keep the original Western form of going top right (thicker) to bottom left (thinner) (e.g. Arial/Times New Roman), flip the stroke to go from bottom left (thicker) to top right (thinner) (e.g. Adobe HeiTi Std/SimSun), or just make the accents without stroke variation (e.g. SimHei).

=== Unicode ===
Unicode encodes a number of cases of &quot;letter with acute accent&quot; as precomposed characters and these are displayed below. In addition, many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility ( and ) that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real-world application and are not shown in the table. 
== Keyboard input ==
Computer keyboards sold in many countries have an AltGr (&#x27;alternate graphic&#x27;) key (or Option key) which adds a third and (with the Shift key) fourth effect to most keys. Thus produces and produces . (Most languages require diacritics (&#x27;accents&#x27;) and thus an &#x27;extended&#x27; or national keyboard mapping is required. Where US standard keyboards are supplied, typically it is controlled by a localised keyboard mapping so that the right-Alt key behaves as an AltGr key.)

Because keyboards have only a limited number of keys, US standard keyboards do not have keys for accented characters. An alternative method is the &#x27;dead key&#x27;, a key that modifies the meaning of the next key press. This method was used with typewriters where, when the typist typed an accent, the carriage did not move as usual with the effect that the next letter would be written on the same place on the paper. An appropriate keyboard mapping (such as US-International) provides this function via the right-hand Alt key. Thus (apostrophe) is a dead key so appears to have no effect until the next key is pressed, when it adds the desired acute accent.

<doc id="167201" wikidata="Q545280" url="?curid=167201" title="Double acute accent">
<text>The double acute accent () is a diacritic mark of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is used primarily in Hungarian or Chuvash, and consequently it is sometimes referred to by typographers as hungarumlaut. The signs formed with a regular umlaut are letters in their own right in the Hungarian alphabet—for instance, they are separate letters for the purpose of collation. Letters with the double acute, however, are considered variants of their equivalents with the umlaut, being thought of as having both an umlaut and an acute accent.

==Uses==

===Vowel length===

====History====
Length marks first appeared in Hungarian orthography in the 15th-century Hussite Bible. Initially, only &quot;á&quot; and &quot;é&quot; were marked, since they are different in quality as well as length. Later &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ú&quot; were marked as well.

In the 18th century, before Hungarian orthography became fixed, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;o&quot; with umlaut + acute (ǘ, ö́) were used in some printed documents. 19th century typographers introduced the double acute as a more aesthetic solution.

====Hungarian====
In Hungarian, the double acute is thought of as the letter having both an umlaut and an acute accent. Standard Hungarian has 14 vowels in a symmetrical system: seven short vowels &quot;(a, e, i, o, ö, u, ü)&quot; and seven long ones, which are written with an acute accent in the case of &quot;á, é, í, ó, ú&quot;, and with the double acute in the case of &quot;ő, ű&quot;. Vowel length has phonemic significance in Hungarian, that is, it distinguishes different words and grammatical forms.

====Slovak====
At the beginning of the 20th century, the letter &quot;A̋&quot; (&quot;A&quot; with double acute) was used in Slovak as a long variant of the short vowel &quot;Ä&quot; (&quot;A&quot; with diaeresis), representing the vowel in dialect and some loanwords. The letter is still used for this purpose in Slovak phonetic transcription systems.

===Umlaut===

====Handwriting====
In handwriting in German and Swedish, the umlaut is sometimes written similarly to a double acute. In the Swedish alphabet, &quot;Å&quot;, &quot;Ä&quot; and &quot;Ö&quot; are letters in their own right.

====Chuvash====
The Chuvash language written in the Cyrillic script uses a double-acute Ӳ, ӳ as a front counterpart of Cyrillic letter У, у (see Chuvash vowel harmony), likely after the analogy of handwriting in Latin script languages. In other minority languages of Russia (Khakas, Mari, Altai, and Khanty), the umlauted form &quot;Ӱ&quot; is used instead.

===Faroese===

Classical Danish handwriting uses &quot;ó&quot; for &quot;ø&quot;, which becomes a problem when writing Faroese in the same tradition, as &quot;ó&quot; is a part of the Faroese alphabet. Thus &quot;ő&quot; is sometimes used for &quot;ø&quot; in Faroese.

===Tone===

====International Phonetic Alphabet====
The IPA and many other phonetic alphabets use two systems to indicate tone: a diacritic system and an adscript system. In the diacritic system, the double acute represents an extra high tone.

One may encounter this use as a tone sign in some IPA-derived orthographies of minority languages, such as in the North American Native Tanacross (Athapascan). In line with the IPA usage it denotes the extra-high tone.

== Unicode ==
Unicode encodes a number of cases of &quot;letter with double acute&quot; as precomposed characters and these are displayed below. In addition, many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility () that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real-world application and thus are not shown in the table. 


==Technical notes==

O and U with double acute accents are supported in the Code page 852, ISO 8859-2, and Unicode character sets.

===Code page 852===
Some of the box-drawing characters of the original DOS code page 437 were sacrificed in order to put in more accented letters (all printable characters from ISO 8859-2 are included).

===ISO 8859-2===
In ISO 8859-2, the characters Ő, ő, Ű, and ű take the place of some similar-looking (but distinct, especially at bigger font sizes) letters of ISO 8859-1.
===Unicode===
All occurrences of &quot;double acute&quot; in character names in the Unicode 9.0 standard:
===LaTeX Input===
In LaTeX, the double acute accent is typeset with the \H{} (mnemonic for &quot;Hungarian&quot;) command. For example, the name Paul Erdős (in his native Hungarian: Erdős Pál) would be typeset as
Erd\H{o}s P\&#x27;al.
===X11 Input===
In modern X11 systems (or utilities such as WinCompose on Windows systems), the double acute can be typed by pressing the followed by (the equal sign) and desired letter ( or ).

<text>Twin studies are studies conducted on identical or fraternal twins. They aim to reveal the importance of environmental and genetic influences for traits, phenotypes, and disorders. Twin research is considered a key tool in behavioral genetics and in related fields, from biology to psychology. Twin studies are part of the broader methodology used in behavior genetics, which uses all data that are genetically informative – siblings studies, adoption studies, pedigree, etc. These studies have been used to track traits ranging from personal behavior to the presentation of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

Twins are a valuable source for observation because they allow the study of environmental influence and varying genetic makeup: &quot;identical&quot; or monozygotic (MZ) twins share essentially 100% of their genes, which means that most differences between the twins (such as height, susceptibility to boredom, intelligence, depression, etc.) are due to experiences that one twin has but not the other twin. &quot;Fraternal&quot; or dizygotic (DZ) twins share only about 50% of their genes, the same as any other sibling. Twins also share many aspects of their environment (e.g., uterine environment, parenting style, education, wealth, culture, community) because they are born into the same family. The presence of a given genetic or phenotypic trait in only one member of a pair of identical twins (called discordance) provides a powerful window into environmental effects on such a trait.

Twins are also useful in showing the importance of the unique environment (specific to one twin or the other) when studying trait presentation. Changes in the unique environment can stem from an event or occurrence that has only affected one twin. This could range from a head injury or a birth defect that one twin has sustained while the other remains healthy.

The classical twin design compares the similarity of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. If identical twins are considerably more similar than fraternal twins (which is found for all traits), this implies that genes play an important role in these traits. By comparing many hundreds of families with twins, researchers can then understand more about the roles of genetic effects, shared environment, and unique environment in shaping behavior.

Modern twin studies have concluded that all studied traits are partly influenced by genetic differences, with some characteristics showing a stronger influence (e.g. height), others an intermediate level (e.g. personality traits) and some more complex heritabilities, with evidence for different genes affecting different aspects of the trait – as in the case of autism.

== History ==

Twins have been of interest to scholars since early civilization, including the early physician Hippocrates (5th century BCE), who attributed different diseases in twins to different material circumstances, and the stoic philosopher Posidonius (1st century BCE), who attributed such similarities to shared astrological circumstances. 

Gustav III, King of Sweden was the first to commission a medical study using identical twins. Gustav&#x27;s father, Adolph Frederick had been an opponent of stimulating drinks such as tea and coffee, signing the &quot;Misuse and Excesses Tea and Coffee Drinking Edict&quot; in 1757. Both Gustav III and his father had read and been strongly influenced by a 1715 treatise from a French physician on the dangers of what would later be identified as caffeine in tea and coffee. After assuming the throne in 1771 the king became strongly motivated to demonstrate to his subjects that coffee and tea had deleterious effects on human health. To this end he offered to commute the death sentences of a pair of twin murderers if they participated in a primitive clinical trial. 

Both condemned men agreed and subsequently spent the rest of their lives in prison fulfilling the king&#x27;s demands: that one twin drink three pots of coffee every day and the other three pots of tea. The tea drinking twin died first at the age of 83, long after Gustav III, who was assassinated in 1792. The age of the coffee-drinking twin at his death is unknown, as both doctors assigned by the king to monitor this study predeceased him. The ban on coffee and tea in Sweden was lifted in 1823.

A more recent study is from Sir Francis Galton&#x27;s pioneering use of twins to study the role of genes and environment on human development and behavior. Galton, however, was unaware of the difference between identical and DZ twins. This factor was still not understood when the first study using psychological tests was conducted by Edward Thorndike (1905) using fifty pairs of twins. This paper was an early statement of the hypothesis that family effects decline with age. His study compared twin pairs age 9–10 and 13–14 to normal siblings born within a few years of one another.

Thorndike incorrectly reasoned that his data supported for there being one, not two, twin types. This mistake was repeated by Ronald Fisher (1919), who argued
An early, and perhaps first, study understanding the distinction is from the German geneticist Hermann Werner Siemens in 1924. Chief among Siemens&#x27; innovations was the &quot;polysymptomatic similarity diagnosis&quot;. This allowed him to account for the oversight that had stumped Fisher, and was a staple in twin research prior to the advent of molecular markers.

Wilhelm Weinberg and colleagues in 1910 used the identical-DZ distinction to calculate respective rates from the ratios of same- and opposite-sex twins in a maternity population. They partitioned co-variation amongst relatives into genetic and environmental elements, anticipating the later work of Fisher and Wright, including the effect of dominance on similarity of relatives, and beginning the first classic-twin studies.

A study conducted by Darrick Antell and Eva Taczanowski found that &quot;twins showing the greatest discrepancies in visible aging signs also had the greatest degree of discordance between personal lifestyle choices and habits&quot;, and concluded that &quot;the genetic influences on aging may be highly overrated, with lifestyle choices exerting far more important effects on physical aging.&quot;

==Examples==
Examples of prominent twin studies include the following:
*Maudsley Bipolar Twin Study
*Minnesota Twin Family Study
*Twins Early Development Study
*NASA Twins Study

== Methods ==
The power of twin designs arises from the fact that twins may be either identical (monozygotic (MZ), i.e. developing from a single fertilized egg and therefore sharing all of their polymorphic alleles) or fraternal (dizygotic (DZ), i.e. developing from two fertilized eggs and therefore sharing on average 50% of their alleles, the same level of genetic similarity found in non-twin siblings). These known differences in genetic similarity, together with a testable assumption of equal environments for identical and fraternal twins, creates the basis for the design of twin studies aimed at estimating the overall effects of genes and environment on a phenotype.

The basic logic of the twin study can be understood with very little mathematical knowledge beyond an understanding of the concepts of variance and thence derived correlation.

=== Classical twin method ===
Like all behavior genetic research, the classical twin study begins by assessing the variance of behavior (called a phenotype by geneticists) in a large group, and attempts to estimate how much of this is due to:
* genetic effects (heritability)
* shared environment – events that happen to both twins, affecting them in the same way
* unshared, or unique, or nonshared environment – events that occur to one twin but not the other, or events that affect either twin in a different way.
Typically these three components are called A (additive genetics) C (common environment) and E (unique environment); hence the acronym &quot;ACE&quot;. It is also possible to examine non-additive genetics effects (often denoted D for dominance (ADE model); see below for more complex twin designs).

The ACE model indicates what proportion of variance in a trait is heritable, versus the proportion due to a shared environment or unshared environment. Research is typically carried out using Structural equation modeling (SEM) programs such as OpenMx capable in principle of handling all sorts of complex pedigrees. However the core logic underlying such programs is the same as the one underlying the twin design described here.

Monozygotic (identical – MZ) twins raised in a family share 100% of their genes, and all of their shared environment. Any differences arising between them in these circumstances are random (i.e. due to environmental effects unique to each twin). The correlation between identical twins provides an estimate of &quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot;. Dizygotic (DZ) twins also share C, but share, on average only 50% of their genes: so the correlation between fraternal twins is a direct estimate of ½&quot;A&quot;+&quot;C&quot;. If we denote with &quot;r&quot; the correlation, we can define &quot;r&quot;mz and &quot;r&quot;dz as the correlations of a trait among identical and fraternal twins, respectively. For any particular trait, then:

:&quot;r&quot;mz = &quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot;

:&quot;r&quot;dz = ½&quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot;

Stated again, the difference between these two sums then allows us to solve for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; (and as a consequence, for &quot;E&quot;). As the difference between the identical and fraternal correlations is due entirely to a halving of the genetic similarity, the additive genetic effect &quot;A&quot; is twice the difference between the identical and fraternal correlations:

:&quot;A&quot; = 2 (&quot;r&quot;mz − &quot;r&quot;dz)

given the estimate for &quot;A&quot;, the one for &quot;C&quot; can be derived, for instance, from the first equation:

:&quot;C&quot; = &quot;r&quot;mz − &quot;A&quot;

Finally, since the trait correlation among identical twins reflects the full contribution of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, the residual variation &quot;E&quot; can be estimated by subtracting this correlation from 1

:&quot;E&quot; = 1 − &quot;r&quot;mz.

To summarize therefore, the additive genetic factor &quot;A&quot; is twice the difference between MZ and DZ twin correlations (this is known as Falconer&#x27;s formula), &quot;C&quot; is the MZ twin correlation minus this estimate of &quot;A&quot;, and the random (unique) factor &quot;E&quot; is (1 - &quot;r&quot;mz), i.e. MZ twins differ due to unique environments only (Jinks &amp; Fulker, 1970; Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, &amp; McGuffin, 2001).

=== Modern modeling ===

Beginning in the 1970s, research transitioned to modeling genetic, environmental effects using maximum likelihood methods (Martin &amp; Eaves, 1977). While computationally much more complex, this approach has numerous benefits rendering it almost universal in current research.

An example structural model (for the heritability of height among Danish males) is shown:

Model A on the left shows the raw variance in height. This is useful as it preserves the absolute effects of genes and environments, and expresses these in natural units, such as mm of height change. Sometimes it is helpful to standardize the parameters, so each is expressed as percentage of total variance. Because we have decomposed variance into A, C, and E, the total variance is simply A + C + E. We can then scale each of the single parameters as a proportion of this total, i.e., Standardised–A = A/(A + C + E). Heritability is the standardised genetic effect.

==== Model comparison ====
A principal benefit of modeling is the ability to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the modeler can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can drop and add paths and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, we can ask of the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.

==== Multi-group and multivariate modeling ====
Multivariate modeling can give answers to questions about the genetic relationship between variables that appear independent. For instance: do IQ and long-term memory share genes? Do they share environmental causes? Additional benefits include the ability to deal with interval, threshold, and continuous data, retaining full information from data with missing values, integrating the latent modeling with measured variables, be they measured environments, or, now, measured molecular genetic markers such as SNPs. In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters will lie, as they should, between 0–1 (standardized).

Multivariate, and multiple-time wave studies, with measured environment and repeated measures of potentially causal behaviours are now the norm. Examples of these models include extended twin designs, simplex models, and growth-curve models.

SEM programs such as OpenMx and other applications suited to constraints and multiple groups have made the new techniques accessible to reasonably skilled users.

==== Modeling the environment: MZ discordant designs ====
As MZ twins share both their genes and their family-level environmental factors, any differences between MZ twins reflect E: the unique environment. Researchers can use this information to understand the environment in powerful ways, allowing epidemiological tests of causality that are otherwise typically confounded by factors such as gene–environment covariance, reverse causation and confounding.

An example of a positive MZ discordant effect is shown below on the left. The twin who scores higher on trait 1 also scores higher on trait 2. This is compatible with a &quot;dose&quot; of trait 1 causing an increase in trait 2. Of course, trait 2 might also be affecting trait 1. Disentangling these two possibilities requires a different design (see below for an example). A null result is incompatible with a causal hypothesis.

Take for instance the case of an observed link between depression and exercise (See Figure above on right). People who are depressed also reporting doing little physical activity. One might &quot;hypothesise&quot; that this is a causal link: that &quot;dosing&quot; patients with exercise would raise their mood and protect against depression. The next figure shows what empirical tests of this hypothesis have found: a null result.

Longitudinal discordance designs
As may be seen in the next Figure, this design can be extended to multiple measurements, with consequent increase in the kinds of information that one can learn. This is called a cross-lagged model (multiple traits measured over more than one time).

In the longitudinal discordance model, differences between identical twins can be used to take account of relationships among differences across traits at time one (path A), and then examine the distinct hypotheses that increments in trait1 drive subsequent change in that trait in the future (paths B and E), or, importantly, in other traits (paths C &amp; D). In the example, the hypothesis that the observed correlation where depressed persons often also exercise less than average is causal, can be tested. If exercise is protective against depression, then path D should be significant, with a twin who exercises more showing less depression as a consequence.

=== Assumptions ===

It can be seen from the modeling above, the main assumption of the twin study is that of equal family environments, also known as the equal environments assumption. A special ability to test this assumption occurs where parents believe their twins to be non-identical when in fact they are genetically identical. Studies of a range of psychological traits indicate that these children remain as concordant as MZ twins raised by parents who treated them as identical.

Molecular genetic methods of heritability estimation have tended to produce lower estimates than classical twin studies due to modern SNP arrays not capturing the influence of certain types of variants (e.g., rare variants or repeat polymorphsisms), though some have suggested it is because twin studies overestimate heritability. A 2016 study determined that the assumption that the prenatal environment of twins was equal was largely tenable. Researchers continue to debate whether or not the equal environment assumption is valid.

==== Measured similarity: A direct test of assumptions in twin designs ====
A particularly powerful technique for testing the twin method was reported by Visscher &quot;et al.&quot; Instead of using twins, this group took advantage of the fact that while siblings on average share 50% of their genes, the actual gene-sharing for individual sibling pairs varies around this value, essentially creating a continuum of genetic similarity or &quot;twinness&quot; within families. Estimates of heritability based on direct estimates of gene sharing confirm those from the twin method, providing support for the assumptions of the method.

=== Sex differences ===
Genetic factors, including both gene expression and the range of gene × environment interactions, may differ between the sexes. Fraternal opposite sex twin pairs are invaluable in explicating these effects.

In an extreme case, a gene may only be expressed in one sex (qualitative sex limitation). More commonly, the effects of particular alleles may depend on the sex of the individual. A gene might cause a change of 100 g in weight in males, but perhaps 150 g in females – a quantitative gene effect.

Environments may impact on the ability of genes to express themselves and may do this via sex differences. For instance, genes affecting voting behavior would have no effect in females if females are excluded from the vote. More generally, the logic of sex-difference testing can extend to any defined sub-group of individuals. In cases such as these, the correlation for same and opposite sex DZ twins will differ, betraying the effect of the sex difference.

For this reason, it is normal to distinguish three types of fraternal twins. A standard analytic workflow would involve testing for sex-limitation by fitting models to five groups, identical male, identical female, fraternal male, fraternal female, and fraternal opposite sex. Twin modeling thus goes beyond correlation to test causal models involving potential causal variables, such as sex.

=== Gene × environment interactions ===

Gene effects may often be dependent on the environment. Such interactions are known as &quot;G×E interactions&quot;, in which the effects of a gene allele differ across different environments. Simple examples would include situations where a gene multiplies the effect of an environment: perhaps adding 1 inch to height in high nutrient environments, but only half an inch to height in low-nutrient environments. This is seen in different slopes of response to an environment for different genotypes.

Often researchers are interested in changes in heritability under different conditions: In environments where alleles can drive large phenotypic effects (as above), the relative role of genes will increase, corresponding to higher heritability in these environments.

A second effect is &quot;G × E correlation&quot;, in which certain alleles tend to accompany certain environments. If a gene causes a parent to enjoy reading, then children inheriting this allele are likely to be raised in households with books due to GE correlation: one or both of their parents has the allele and therefore will accumulate a book collection &quot;and&quot; pass on the book-reading allele. Such effects can be tested by measuring the purported environmental correlate (in this case books in the home) directly.

Often the role of environment seems maximal very early in life, and decreases rapidly after compulsory education begins. This is observed for instance in reading
as well as intelligence. This is an example of a G*Age effect and allows an examination of both GE correlations due to parental environments (these are broken up with time), and of G*E correlations caused by individuals actively seeking certain environments.

==== Norms of reaction ====
Studies in plants or in animal breeding allow the effects of experimentally randomized genotypes and environment combinations to be measured. By contrast, human studies are typically observational. This may suggest that norms of reaction cannot be evaluated.

As in other fields such as economics and epidemiology, several designs have been developed to capitalise on the ability to use differential gene-sharing, repeated exposures, and measured exposure to environments (such as children social status, chaos in the family, availability and quality of education, nutrition, toxins etc.) to combat this confounding of causes. An inherent appeal of the classic twin design is that it begins to untangle these confounds. For example, in identical and fraternal twins shared environment and genetic effects are not confounded, as they are in non-twin familial studies. Twin studies are thus in part motivated by an attempt to take advantage of the random assortment of genes between members of a family to help understand these correlations.

While the twin study tells us only how genes and families affect behavior within the observed range of environments, and with the caveat that often genes and environments will covary, this is a considerable advance over the alternative, which is no knowledge of the different roles of genes and environment whatsoever. Twin studies are therefore often used as a method of controlling at least one part of this observed variance: Partitioning, for instance, what might previously have been assumed to be family environment into shared environment and additive genetics using the experiment of fully and partly shared genomes in twins. Additional information is available outside the classic twin design. Adoption designs are a form of natural experiment that tests norms of reaction by placing the same genotype in different environments. Association studies, e.g., allow direct study of allelic effects. Mendelian randomization of alleles also provides opportunities to study the effects of alleles at random with respect to their associated environments and other genes.

=== Extended twin designs and more complex genetic models ===
The basic or classical twin-design contains only identical and fraternal twins raised in their biological family. This represents only a sub-set of the possible genetic and environmental relationships. It is fair to say, therefore, that the heritability estimates from twin designs represent a first step in understanding the genetics of behavior.

The variance partitioning of the twin study into additive genetic, shared, and unshared environment is a first approximation to a complete analysis taking into account gene–environment covariance and interaction, as well as other non-additive effects on behavior. The revolution in molecular genetics has provided more effective tools for describing the genome, and many researchers are pursuing molecular genetics in order to directly assess the influence of alleles and environments on traits.

An initial limitation of the twin design is that it does not afford an opportunity to consider both Shared Environment and Non-additive genetic effects simultaneously. This limit can be addressed by including additional siblings to the design.

A second limitation is that gene–environment correlation is not detectable as a distinct effect unless it is added to the model. Addressing this limit requires incorporating adoption models, or children-of-twins designs, to assess family influences uncorrelated with shared genetic effects.

==== Continuous variables and ordinal variables ====

While concordance studies compare traits either present or absent in each twin, correlational studies compare the agreement in continuously varying traits across twins.

== Criticism ==
The twin method has been subject to criticism from statistical genetics, statistics and psychology, with some researchers, such as Burt &amp; Simons (2014), arguing that conclusions reached via this method are ambiguous or meaningless. Core elements of these criticisms and their rejoinders are listed below.

=== Criticisms of fundamental assumptions ===
Critics of twin studies argue that they are based on false or questionable assumptions, including that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes and the equal environments assumption. On this basis, critics contend that twin studies tend to generate inflated or deflated estimates of heritability due to biological confounding factors and consistent underestimation of environmental variance. Other critics take a more moderate stance, arguing that the equal environments assumption is typically inaccurate, but that this inaccuracy tends to have only a modest effect on heritability estimates.

=== Criticisms of statistical methods ===
Peter Schönemann criticized methods for estimating heritability developed in the 1970s. He has also argued that the heritability estimate from a twin study may reflect factors other than shared genes. Using the statistical models published in Loehlin and Nichols (1976), the narrow HR-heritability of responses to the question &quot;did you have your back rubbed&quot; has been shown to work out to .92 heritable for males and .21 heritable for females, and the question &quot;Did you wear sunglasses after dark?&quot; is 130% heritable for males and 103% for females. Critics also contend that the concept of &quot;heritability&quot; estimated in twin studies is merely a statistical abstraction with no relationship to the underlying DNA and that the statistical underpinnings of twin research are invalid. Statistical critiques argue that heritability estimates used for most twin studies rest on restrictive assumptions that are usually not tested, and if they are, they are often contradicted by the data.

==== Responses to statistical critiques ====

Before computers, statisticians used methods that were computationally tractable, at the cost of known limitations. Since the 1980s these approximate statistical methods have been discarded. Modern twin methods based on structural equation modeling are not subject to the limitations and heritability estimates such as those noted above are mathematically impossible.
Critically, the newer methods allow for explicit testing of the role of different pathways and incorporation and testing of complex effects.

=== Sampling: Twins as representative members of the population ===
Results of twin studies cannot be automatically generalized beyond the population they come from. It is therefore important to understand the particular sample studied, and the nature of twins themselves. Twins are not a random sample of the population, and they differ in their developmental environment. In this sense they are not representative.

For example: Dizygotic (DZ) twin births are affected by many factors. Some women frequently produce more than one egg at each menstrual period and are therefore more likely to have twins. This tendency may run in the family either on the mother&#x27;s or father&#x27;s side, and often runs through both. Women over the age of 35 are more likely to produce two eggs. Women who have three or more children are also likely to have dizygotic twins. Artificial induction of ovulation and in vitro fertilization-embryo replacement can also give rise to fraternal and identical twins.

==== Response to representativeness of twins ====

However, twins differ very little from non-twin siblings. Measured studies on the personality and intelligence of twins suggest that they have scores on these traits very similar to those of non-twins (for instance Deary et al. 2006).

=== Separated twin pairs as representative of other twins ===
Separated twin pairs, identical or fraternal, are generally separated by adoption. This makes their families of origin non-representative of typical twin families in that they give up their children for adoption. The families they are adopted to are also non-representative of typical twin families in that they are all approved for adoption by children&#x27;s protection authorities and that a disproportionally large fraction of them have no biological children. Those who volunteer to studies are not even representative of separated twins in general since not all separated twins agree to be part of twin studies.

=== Detection problems ===
There can be some issues of undetected behaviors in the case of behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal behaviors that are discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it look like it played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, there would have to be either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless. Even if environment plays no role, the numbers would still be skewed.

== Terminology ==

=== Pairwise concordance ===

For a group of twins, &quot;pairwise concordance&quot; is defined as C/(C+D), where C is the number of concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs.

For example, a group of 10 twins have been pre-selected to have one affected member (of the pair). During the course of the study four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a pairwise concordance of 4/(4+6) or 4/10 or 40%.

=== Probandwise concordance ===

For a group of twins in which at least one member of each pair is affected, &quot;probandwise concordance&quot; is a measure of the proportion of twins who have the illness who have an affected twin and can be calculated with the formula of 2C/(2C+D), in which C is the number of concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs.

For example, consider a group of 10 twins that have been pre-selected to have one affected member. During the course of the study, four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a probandwise concordance of 8/(8+6) or 8/14 or 57%.

<doc id="167208" wikidata="Q1148836" url="?curid=167208" title="Cyrix 5x86">
<text>The Cyrix 5x86 is a line of x86 microprocessors designed by Cyrix and released on June 5 of 1995. Cyrix, being a fabless company, had the chips manufactured by IBM. The line came out about 5 months before the more famous Cyrix 6x86. The Cyrix 5x86 was one of the fastest CPUs ever produced for Socket 3 computer systems. With better performance in most applications than an Intel Pentium processor at 75 MHz, the Cyrix Cx5x86 filled a gap by providing a medium-performance processor option for 486 Socket 3 motherboards (which are incapable of handling Intel&#x27;s Pentium CPUs, apart from the Pentium Overdrive).

The IBM 5x86C is an IBM branded and produced version of the Cyrix-designed Cyrix Cx5x86 CPU. Previous IBM x86 processors, IBM 386SLC and IBM 486SLC, were based on modified Intel designs.

==Design==
The Cyrix 5x86 processor, codename &quot;M1sc&quot;, was based on a scaled-down version of the &quot;M1&quot; core used in the Cyrix 6x86, which provided 80% of the performance for a 50% decrease in transistors over the 6x86 design. It had the 32-bit memory bus of an ordinary 486 processor, but internally had much more in common with fifth-generation processors such as the Cyrix 6x86, the AMD K5, and the Intel Pentium, and even the sixth-generation Intel Pentium Pro. The chip featured near-complete support for i486 instructions, but very limited support for Pentium instructions. Some performance-enhancing features of the CPU were intentionally disabled due to potentially stability-threatening bugs which were not fixed before release time (these features can be enabled with freely downloadable software utilities; see below).

The similarly named SGS-Thomson (STMicroelectronics) ST5x86 and IBM 5x86C were licensed rebrandings of the Cyrix design (IBM and ST physically produced Cyrix&#x27;s CPUs for them), marketed separately but identical for practical purposes, apart from the availability of a 75 MHz edition which Cyrix did not bring to market, and slight differences in voltage requirements. The Cyrix 5x86 design, however, should not be confused with the similarly named AMD Am5x86 which was essentially a clock-quadrupled 486 (not an all-new design like the Cyrix part) but which had broadly similar performance, used the same Socket 3, and was introduced at the end of the same year.

Cyrix&#x27;s 5x86 was a very short-lived chip, having a market life of only six months. It is likely Cyrix could have continued to successfully sell processors based on Socket 3, but canned the 5x86 so that it would not compete with its then new 6x86 offerings.
==Controversies and anomalies==

The official Cyrix 5x86 website boasted about several features of the chip that were disabled by default in the final versions. The most controversial of these features was the branch prediction feature, which was enabled in the benchmarks results on the company website when comparing the chip to Intel&#x27;s Pentium processor. While it was possible to enable the extra features using a special software utility, it usually resulted in an unstable system, especially on earlier steppings of the chip when running 32-bit code.

There are also many rumours surrounding a 133 MHz, clock-quadrupled version of the Cyrix 5x86. The 133 MHz version is very rare, however, and producers of upgrade kits were given preferential access to it, notably Gainbery. Some of the 100 and 120 MHz parts also contain support for the 4X multiplier setting, and some of these chips may also work at 133 MHz. However, the 5x86 is not known to overclock well; 120 MHz is generally considered to be pushing the limitations of the process on which it was fabricated. An 80 MHz (2×40 MHz) 5x86 also exists, but is unclear as to whether or not it was ever officially released.

IBM&#x27;s 5x86C was considered to be more conservatively rated than the Cyrix branded parts, and operated at a lower voltage (3.3V). For example: what Cyrix would rate as a 100 MHz part, IBM would mark as 75 MHz. IBM 5x86C was available as 75 MHz and 100 MHz parts. A few examples of 120 MHz parts also exist, but they have early production dates indicating that they may have been produced prior to IBM&#x27;s decision to scale back clock speeds. 5x86C also had a much longer production run than the Cyrix branded parts. IBM continued to produce 5x86C at least until late 1998 (QFP only), whereas Cyrix&#x27;s own part was discontinued in 1996. Parts which implement the 4X multiplier or Stepping 1 Rev 3 cores are not known to exist.

<doc id="167218" wikidata="Q1085141" url="?curid=167218" title="Culture of Albania">
<text>Albanian culture or the culture of Albanians ( ) is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, musical, political and social elements that are representative of ethnic Albanians, which implies not just Albanians of the country of Albania but also Albanians of Kosovo, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where ethnic Albanians are a native population. Albanian culture has been considerably shaped by the geography and history of Albania, Kosovo, parts of Montenegro, parts of North Macedonia, and parts of Northern Greece, traditional homeland of Albanians. It evolved since ancient times in the western Balkans, with its peculiar language, pagan beliefs and practices, way of life and traditions. Albanian culture has also been influenced by the Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans.

The name &#x27;Albanian&#x27; derived from the Illyrian tribe of the Albanoi and their capital in Albanopolis that was noted by Ptolemy in ancient times. Previously, Albanians called their country &quot;Arbëri&quot; or &quot;Arbëni&quot; and referred to themselves as &quot;Arbëreshë&quot; or &quot;Arbëneshë&quot; until the sixteenth century as the toponym &quot;Shqipëria&quot; or &quot;Shqypnia&quot; and the endonym &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; or &quot;Shqyptarë&quot; gradually replaced &quot;Arbëria&quot; and &quot;Arbëresh&quot;. The terms &quot;Shqipëria&quot; and &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; are popularly interpreted respectively as the &quot;Land of Eagles&quot; and &quot;Children of Eagles&quot; / &quot;Eagle-Men&quot;.

The double-headed eagle is the national and ethnic symbol of all Albanian-speaking people. The symbol appears in a stone carving dating from the tenth century as the Principality of Arbanon was established. It is also documented to have been used as a heraldic symbol by numerous noble families in Albania in the Middle Ages. The double-headed eagle appears as a symbol for bravery, valor, freedom and heroism. The symbol is widely used in Albanian traditional art, including jewellery, embroidery, and house carving.

Albanians can be culturally and linguistically separated into two subgroups: the northern Ghegs and the southern Tosks. The line of demarcation between both groups, based on dialect, is the Shkumbin River that crosses Albania from east to west. Outside of Albania, Gheg is mostly spoken by the Albanians of Kosovo, northwestern North Macedonia, Montenegro and Croatia (Arbanasi). On the other hand, Tosk is spoken by the Albanians of Greece (Arvanites, Chams), southwestern North Macedonia and southern Italy (Arbëreshë). The diversity between Ghegs and Tosks can be substantial, both sides identify strongly with the common national and ethnic culture.

Home of Muslims and Christians, religious tolerance is one of the most important values of the tradition of the Albanian people. It is widely accepted, that Albanians are well known about those values, about a peaceful coexistence among the believers of different religious communities in the country. All the aspects of the Albanian tribal society have been directed by the &quot;Kanun&quot;, the Albanian traditional customary law. Orally transmitted across the generations, it reflects many legal practices of great antiquity that find precise echoes in other Indo-European cultures such as Vedic India and ancient Greece and Rome.

Thanks to its long history, Albania is home to many valuable monuments such as among others the remains of Butrint, the medieval cities of Berat and Gjirokastër, the Roman amphitheatre of Durrës, the Illyrian Tombs and Fortress of Bashtovë. Other examples of important contributions to architecture may be found in Apollonia, Byllis, Amantia, Phoenice, Shkodër and many others.

Despite being a small country, Albania has three sites on the UNESCO World Heritage Site List and one Intangible Cultural Heritage element. The Codices of Berat are eminently important for the global community and as well the development of ancient Biblical, liturgical and hagiographical literature. Therefore, it was inscribed on the UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2005.

== Lifestyle ==

=== Kanun ===

The Kanun, a comprehensive compilation of Albanian traditional customs and cultural practices, was codified by Lekë Dukagjini in the Middle Ages. Scholars have conjectured that the Kanun might have derived from Illyrian tribal laws, while others have suggested that it has retained elements from Indo-European Prehistoric eras. The Kanun reflects notably the historic development of Albanians through its turbulent history and encompasses in a real statute regulating various aspects of life including customs, traditions and wisdom in Albania.

Besa, &quot;to keep the promise&quot;, is the Albanian code of honor and a major component of Albanian culture. It is among the highest and most important concept of the Kanun with a moral and ethic connotation. The term contains the given word or keeping of a promise or obligation and the guaranteed agreement among honorable men.

Most notably, Besa means taking care of those in need and being hospitable to every single person. Albania saved and protected almost 2000 Jewish people during the Holocaust. Rather than hiding the Jews in attics or the woods, the Albanians gave them clothes, gave them Albanian names and treated them as part of the family.

=== Fis (clan) ===
The traditional Albanian social structure is based on clans () characterized by a common culture, often common ancestry and shared social ties. In past times most of them defended their territory and interests against other clans and external forces.

The Albanian tribal society clearly crystallized in the mountains of northern Albania and adjacent areas of Montenegro, and it was also present in a less developed system in southern Albania. One of the most particular elements of the Albanian tribal structure is its dependence on the &quot;Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot;.

This social structure was inherited from the ancient Illyrians, thrived until the early years of the 20th century, and remained largely intact until the rise to power of communist regime in 1944.

=== Oda ===
&quot;Oda&quot; is a typical large room in an Albanian traditional house used by the host to receive and entertain the guests. Traditionally, the host and the guests in the &quot;oda&quot; are old men and married men. Till the end of the 20th century, woman and young boys were not allowed to enter the room. In the &quot;oda&quot;, the men talk, take political discussions and sing epic songs until late hours. During an &quot;oda&quot; &quot;session&quot;, historical events and traditions are transmitted orally through discussions and songs.

=== Holidays ===


In consideration to the long and eventful history of Albania, there are several cultural and religious holidays throughout the country. Albanians, either in Albania, Kosovo and other countries, celebrate their Independence and Flag Day on November 28. Various ceremonies, festivals and concerts take place to celebrate the historic day in major cities amongst them in Tirana and Pristina, holding festive and military parades.

Christmas is celebrated by those following the religion of Christianity. Bajram is considered by Muslims as the holiday of forgiveness, moral victory and peace, fellowship and unity. They sacrifice a sheep for this holiday, giving the meat to their family, friends and to the poor people.

Another pagan holiday is Dita e Verës, particularly popular in Elbasan and Gjirokastër. It is celebrated on March 14 and is intended to commemorate the end of winter, the rebirth of nature and a rejuvenation of spirit amongst the Albanians. The ritual of the day begins on the previous day with the preparation of sweets such as ballokume cooked in a wood oven. During the evening ballokume, dried figs, walnuts, turkey legs, boiled eggs and simite are distributed to members of the family.

Dita e Mësuesit is celebrated on March 7 since 1887 and is regarded by many Albanians as one of the most important holidays of the country. It honors the opening of the first school that taught lessons in Albanian in Korçë.

=== Cuisine ===

The Albanian cuisine, a representative of the Mediterranean cuisine, has developed through the centuries of social and economic changes and more importantly referable to different factors that stands in close interaction with each other such as the small and mountainous territory of the country with virgin forests, narrow valleys, vast plains and a favourable climate that offers excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. 
Food is for Albanians an important component of their culture and is deeply rooted in the history, traditions and values of the country. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse and nevertheless olive oil is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, which has been produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts.

Albanian cuisine uses a variety of ingredients which include a wider availability of vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, cabbages and spinach, as well as cereals such as wheat, sweetcorn, barley and rye. Herbs and spices include oregano, mint, garlic, onion and basil. Widely used meat varieties are lamb, goat, beef, veal, chicken and other poultry. Considering the direct proximity to the sea, seafood specialties are particularly popular along the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea Coasts.

Hospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is an integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honor, called Besa, resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.

Christianity, Islam and Judaism are the traditional religions of Albania. The constitution extends freedom of religion to all citizens and the government generally respects this right in practice. Albania have always been considered as a unique country in terms of religion and religious tolerance is one of the main characteristics of Albanians.
Christianity has a long and eventful history in the country whereby it belongs to one of the most ancient countries of Christianity. There are thought to have been about seventy Christian families in Durrës as early as the time of the Apostles. Paul the Apostle was the founder of the Archbishopric of Durrës while he was preaching in Illyria and Epirus. In the eleventh century, Albanians first appeared in Byzantine sources and at this point, they were already fully Christianized. The first known bishop of Albania was the Bishop of Scutari founded in 387 in Shkodër. In the late seventeenth century, Pope Clement XI served as the Pope from 1700 to 1721. He was born to an Albanian father descended from the noble Albani family from the region of Malësi e Madhe in Albania.

The history of Judaism in the country can be traced back to the classical era. Jewish migration from the Roman Empire is considered the most likely source of the first Jews on the country&#x27;s territory. It may have first arrived in Albania in the first century BC. They build the first synagogue in Sarandë in the early fifth century. In the sixteenth century, there were Jewish settlements in most of major cities such as Berat, Elbasan, Vlorë, Durrës and as well as in Kosovo region.

Albania was the only country during the Holocaust in Europe where Jewish population experienced growth. After the mass emigration to Israel following the fall of communist regime, only 200 Albanian Jews are left in the country today. In 2010, a new synagogue &quot;Hechal Shlomo&quot; started providing services for the Jewish community in Tirana.

Islam arrived for the first time in the ninth century to the region, when Muslim Arabs raided the eastern Adriatic Sea. In the fifteenth century, Islam emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After declaration of independence on November 28, 1912, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later the communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom.

== Arts ==

=== Painting ===


The art of Albania has a long and memorable history, represented in many forms such as painting, sculpture, mosaic and architecture. It show a great variety in style, in different regions and periods. Nonetheless, the country also has a tolerable heritage in visual arts, specifically in frescoes, murals and icons, which often can be seen in many of the older structures in the country.
The surviving monuments of Illyrian, Ancient Greek and Roman art are notable for a tradition concentrating on the human figure and decorations. Through the many archaeological discoveries, in different areas of Albania have been found numerous of pottery, terracotta and metalworking belonging to the Illyrians and several sculptures and mosaics belonging to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. 
Albanian medieval art started with the Byzantine Empire that ruled the great majority of Albania and the Balkan Peninsula. The first paintings have been icons and frescoes with an admirable use of colour and gold. The most famous representative of Albanian medieval art were Onufri who was distinguished for its rich use of colours and decorative shades with certain ethnographic national elements that are more visible with his successors David Selenica, Kostandin Shpataraku and the Zografi Brothers.

Illuminated manuscripts were another significant feature of Albanian medieval art. The Codices of Berat are two ancient Gospels from Berat that dates from the sixth and ninth centuries. They represent one of the most valuable treasures of the Albanian cultural heritage that was inscribed on the UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2005.


In the fifteenth century, during the Ottoman invasion many Albanians migrated out of the area to escape either various socio-political and economic difficulties. Among them, the medieval painters Marco Basaiti and Viktor Karpaçi, sculptor and architect Andrea Nikollë Aleksi and art collector Alessandro Albani from the Albani family.

The Ottoman Empire ruled over the country and most of the Balkans for nearly five centuries. This influence were absorbed and reinterpreted with an extensive construction of mosques that opened a new section in Albanian art, that of Islamic art. 
In the nineteenth century a significant era for Albanian art begins. The great liberation acts starting with League of Prizren in 1878, that led to the Independence in 1912, established the climate for a new artistic movement, which would reflect life and history more realistically and Impressionism and Realism came into dominance.

Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist postmodernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally.
=== Architecture ===

The country&#x27;s architecture reflect a rich variety of architectural styles and is rooted in its history, culture and religion. Influences from distant social, religious and exotic communities have contributed to the variety of the architectural landscape in Albania that is richly revealed by archaeological finds that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. 
Some of the earliest productions, notably from Illyrians, Ancient Greeks and Romans, are found scattered throughout the country. The best collection of Ancient architecture can be found in Butrint in the southwest, Apollonia, Durrës and Byllis in the west and Amantia and Phoenice in the south. Religion and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning of these towns at that time.
In the Middle Ages a variety of architecture styles developed in the form of dwelling, defense, worship and engineering structures. The consolidation of Albanian principalities gave rise to Varosha, or neighborhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are centred in Petrele, Krujë, Tepelenë and Lezhë originating from the feudal castle. Some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading Ottoman forces. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.

Much earlier, the introduction of Christianity brought churches and monasteries which otherwhile became the center of most towns and cities in the country. Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques are also on the best examples and legacies of Byzantines and Ottomans, which are specifically exemplified in Berat, Gjirokastër and Korçë region.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities. This can be particularly seen in Tirana and Korçë. They introduced architectural styles such as Historicism, Art Nouveau, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism.

=== Clothing ===

Traditional Albanian clothing developed as a result of long processes that has differentiated the country from other countries. Its recorded history of clothing goes back to the classical times. It includes more than two hundred different forms of clothing in all Albania and neighbouring countries that includes without limitation the Albanians in Kosovo, Western North Macedonia, Southern Montenegro, Italy and Greece.

Nothing less than each cultural and geographical region of Albania has its own specific variety of clothing being particularly colorful and rich in detail. The costumes are often decorated with pagan symbolic elements of Illyrians among others suns, eagles, moons, stars and snakes, but predominantly the zig-zag and concentric circles decoration, found in ancient times throughout the Balkans but also in national costumes of other Balkan peoples.

These clothes are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings and by dancing groups. Some conservative old men and women mainly from the high northern as well as southern lands wear those traditional clothes in their daily lives.

They were made mainly of products from the local agriculture and livestock such as leather, wool, linen, hemp fiber and silk. The textiles nowadays are still embroidered in very elaborate ancient patterns. Among the most important parts of clothing includes the Qeleshe, or also known as Plis, the Albanian hat, the Qylafë, the Fustanella, the Xhubleta, the Xhamadan, the Brez, the Çorape, the Opinga and many others.

One of obvious common cultural trait of Gheg, Tosk and Cham Albanians is the predominance of white color in their national dress/costume, with variations in the shapes and designs (Gheg Albanians traditionally wore white trousers while Tosk and Cham Albanians traditionally wore white kilt). The white color seems to have a special place in Albanian culture, as many phrases include the term &quot;white&quot; ( alb. &quot;bardh&quot;), both literally and figuratively ( &quot;fatbardh&quot; -lit. &quot;white fate&quot;- fig. &quot;good luck&quot;, &quot;faqe bardh&quot; - lit. &quot;white&quot; face - fig. &quot;clean face&quot; - &quot;intact honor&quot;, &quot;rrofsh sa male te bardha&quot; - &quot;May you live as long as white mountains&quot; - &quot;snow-peaked mountains&quot;, etc.).
The white Albanian scull cap, popularly knows as qeleshe, or plis, etymologically related to Greek Pilos or Pileus cap, is one of the well known Albanian cultural brands.

=== Music ===

The Albanian music is very diverse and comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. Folk music is a prominent part of the national identity with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the northern Ghegs and southern Labs and Tosks. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south. Albanian folk music has been influential in neighboring areas such as Kosovo, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, all home to significant numbers of Albanians.

The Ghegs are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of the songs are about the ancient history of the country and the constant Albanian themes of honor, hospitality, treachery and revenge. In contrast, Tosk music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature. Notably, Albanian iso-polyphony from the south has been declared an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Along with the def, çifteli and sharki are used in the north in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade wind instruments are traditionally used by shepherds in northern Albania; these include the zumarë and lahuta. The southern people are known for ensembles consisting of violins, clarinets, lahuta and def as well.

Music in Albania extends to ancient Illyria and Greece, with influences from the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empire. It is evident in archeological findings such as arenas, odeons, theatre buildings and amphitheatres, all over Albania. The remains of temples, libraries, sculptures and paintings of ancient dancers, singers and musical instruments, have been found in territories inhabited by the ancient Illyrians and ancient Greeks.

The tradition of church singing was performed throughout the Middle Ages in the country&#x27;s territory by choirs or soloists in ecclesiastical centers such as Berat, Durrës and Shkodër. The Middle Ages in Albania included choral music and traditional music. Shën Jan Kukuzeli, a singer, composer and musical innovator of Albanian origin, is one of the earliest known musicians.

Albania has experienced another wave of Western cultural influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena. The most vivid example is the Albanian rock, hip hop and pop music, with some performers gaining international recognition of Albanian origin from Albania, Kosovo or Albanian diaspora, such as Action Bronson, Ava Max, Bebe Rexha, Dua Lipa, Era Istrefi, Elvana Gjata, Dafina Zeqiri, Albert Stanaj, G4SHI, Ermal Meta, Enca, Noizy and Rita Ora.

Classical music became immensely popular in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and was known across even the most rural sections of the country. It was defined by the tension between classical composer Martin Gjoka along with Fan Noli and Mikel Koliqi, who embraced national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions. Most notable Albanian sopranos and tenors have gained also international recognition, among the best known are Inva Mula, Marie Kraja, Saimir Pirgu and Ermonela Jaho.

=== Dance ===
The Albanians have a rich tradition of dances with a great diversity of choreography and styles varying on the region due mainly to the fact that Albania is a country with a diverse topography thus the different varieties of dance developed. A couple of dances are ancient and to a certain extent persist nowadays. The dances of the Albanians specifically of the Ghegs from the north have more a solo character than those from the southern Tosks that have more social character, expressed in line and semi circle dances.

== Language ==


Albanian is the most widely spoken language in Albania. It has two major distinct dialects: Tosk spoken in the south and Gheg spoken in the north. The geographical dividing line between those dialects appears to be the river of Shkumbin. Moreover, Albanian dialects are traditional local varieties and are traced back to the different Albanian tribes.

Albanian is an Indo-European language and occupies an independent branch within this family. Scholars and linguists argue that Albanian derives from the ancient Illyrian language, which were spoken in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula by Illyrian tribes.

Today, the language is spoken primarily in Kosovo, North Macedonia, Greece and Montenegro as well. Due to the large Albanian diaspora around the world, centuries-old communities speaking Albanian-based dialects can be particularly found scattered in Greece (Arvanitika, Cham), Italy (Arbëreshë), Southern Serbia and in Croatia (Arbanasi). However, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe. The four dialects include Tosk Albanian, Gheg Albanian, Arbëresh and Arvanitika.

Most Albanians are multi-lingual, speaking many regional and foreign languages such as Greek, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, English and others.

=== Mythology ===
The mythology of Albania consist of myths, legends, folklore, fairy tales and gods of the Albanian people. Many characters in its mythology are included in the Songs of the Frontier Warriors (Albanian: Këngë Kreshnikësh or Cikli i Kreshnikëve). It is divided into two major groups such as legends of metamorphosis and historical legends. The Albanian mythology has its origin to the ancient Illyrians, that inhabited the modern area of Albania during the classical time. Some of the legends, songs and characters include Bardha, Baloz, E Bukura e Dheut, E Bukura e Qiellit, En, Perëndi, Prende, Tomor and Zana e malit.

=== Literature ===
The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the catholic region in the North, but also of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku translated the Catholic liturgy into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what Luther did for German.
&quot;The Meshari&quot; (&quot;The Missal&quot;) by Gjon Buzuku, published in 1555 is considered one of the first literary works of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

The earliest evidence dates from 1332 AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books though their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a &quot;baptism formula&quot; (&quot;Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit&quot;) from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of Durrës, Pal Engjëlli; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.
Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist Marin Barleti, who, in his book &quot;&quot;Rrethimi i Shkodrës&quot; (The Siege of Shkodër)&quot; (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (&quot;in vernacula lingua&quot;) as well as his biography of Skanderbeg &quot;Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis&quot; (History of Skanderbeg) (1508). The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Scanderbeg studies, and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the catechism &quot;E mbësuame krishterë&quot; (&quot;Christian Teachings&quot;) by Lekë Matrënga in 1592, Doktrina e krishterë (The Christian Doctrine) in 1618, and &quot;Rituale romanum&quot; in 1621 by Pjetër Budi, the first writer of original Albanian prose and poetry, an apology for George Castriot in 1636 by Frang Bardhi, who also published a dictionary and folklore creations, the theological-philosophical treaty &quot;Cuneus Prophetarum&quot; (&quot;The Band of Prophets&quot;) in 1685 by Pjetër Bogdani, the most universal personality of Albanian Middle Ages, were published in Albanian.
Today, Albania&#x27;s best-known contemporary writer is Ismail Kadare (1936–2024) whose novels have been translated into 45 languages. With his novels &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot; (1963), &quot;The Siege&quot; (1970), &quot;Chronicle in Stone&quot; (1971), &quot;The Three-Arched Bridge&quot; (1978), &quot;Broken April&quot; (1980), &quot;The File on H.&quot; (1981), &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; (1981), &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (1992); and &quot;The Successor&quot; (2002), Kadare brought Albanian literature into the mainstream of modern European literature.

The central theme of Kadare&#x27;s works is totalitarianism and its mechanisms. His work represents an artistic encyclopedia of Albanian life. The philosophy, beliefs, dramas, and historical and cultural traditions of Albania, filtered through the artistry of the writer, in Kadare&#x27;s work express the vitality of the spiritual culture of the Albanian people. Kadare creates a modern prose making wide use of historical analogies, parables and associations, Albanian legends and mythology. Starting from the epic world of medieval legends and ballads, the prose of Kadare brings ancient folk traditions &#x27;up to date&#x27; by showing their relevance to the modern world.

In 1992 Kadare was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca; in 1998, the Herder Prize; in 2005, the inaugural Man Booker International Prize; in 2009, the Prince of Asturias Award of Arts; and in 2015, the Jerusalem Prize. He was awarded the Park Kyong-ni Prize in 2019, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2020. In 1996, France made him a foreign associate of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France, and in 2016, he was a &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; recipient. He has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 15 times. Since the 1990s, Kadare has been asked by both major political parties in Albania to become a consensual President of Albania, but has declined.

His nominating juror for the Neustadt Prize wrote: &quot;Kadare is the successor of Franz Kafka. No one since Kafka has delved into the infernal mechanism of totalitarian power and its impact on the human soul in as much hypnotic depth as Kadare.&quot; His writing has also been compared to that of Nikolai Gogol, George Orwell, Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera, and Balzac. Living in Albania during a time of strict censorship, Kadare devised cunning stratagems to outwit Communist censors who had banned three of his books, using devices such as parable, myth, fable, folk-tale, allegory, and legend, sprinkled with double-entendre, allusion, insinuation, satire, and coded messages. In 1990, to escape the Communist regime and its &quot;Sigurimi&quot; secret police he defected to Paris. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he was a national figure in Albania comparable in popularity perhaps to Mark Twain in the United States, and that &quot;there is hardly an Albanian household without a Kadare book.&quot; Kadare is regarded by some as one of the greatest writers and intellectuals of the 20th and 21st centuries.

== Wedding traditions ==

The dress of the Muslim bride is characterized by its elegance and transparency, in that of the Catholic one can see full colors. The Catholic bride&#x27;s dress is characterized by its picturesque effects and harmony. There are two types of Muslim wedding dresses. One is worked on a &quot;shajak&quot; (large piece of wool) and with floral motives worked with &quot;gajtan&quot; (kind of rope) black cotton, sometimes mixed with green. The other one is worked in the same material but with red color. Different from the first here the motifs are enriched with full colors. The difference between this two dresses that at the first dress the motifs occupy all the area, at the second it occupies a little part in the front and back. These dresses have a belt worked with gold and grain necklaces in red, rose, orange creating all together a warm surface. Here the motifs are very small.

;Dress of Catholic Shkodran Bride

The dress is tripped from the transparent white, shiny, soft, which spreads all over the body, and is intended to suggest tranquility and a warm purity. This concept of tradition is achieved through the white of the base material and the gold thread over. This dress is composed by the &quot;barnaveke&quot;: some kind of very long pants which seem a skirt.

;Paja

Ritual songs name various elements which contain &quot;paja&quot; (pronounced &quot;paya&quot;) of the girl, which are the goods parents give to the daughter to wear, to furnish the house, gifts for her husband and the intimate cousins. Elements are typically made by weaving clothes using looms. The preparation of the &quot;paja&quot; for the parents of the bride is a pleasure which means also accomplishing the obligations toward the daughter.

;Dhuntia

&quot;Dhunti&quot; in Shkodra means the gifts that the groom prepares for the bride during the engagement, mainly clothes, jewelry, gold ornaments and tricks, which are sent to her a few days before the wedding.
In addition to those received by the family of his father, the bride takes many gifts from the groom and his family. &quot;Dhuntia&quot;, which had a considerable monetary value, was prepared with great care by the family of the boy, because in some way embodied respect and love for his young bride, to whom these gifts were made, love for their son that he married at the same time was also a representation of the family in its economic and aesthetic. In &quot;dhunti&quot; there were enough clothes and items for use at all times, in joy and in sorrow, which expressed particular attention to the role of women.
== Sports ==

Sport is a popular culture activity in Albania and really popular amongst the population. Albanian&#x27;s participate in several sports activities and this since the 19th century.

=== Football ===
Association football is the most popular sport in Albania. It dates back to before the early 20th century.

The Football Association of Albania was founded in June 1930. It was accepted as a FIFA member in 1932 and was a UEFA founding member in 1954.

<doc id="167224" wikidata="Q11175" url="?curid=167224" title="Circumflex">
<text>The circumflex () is a diacritic in the Latin and Greek scripts that is also used in the written forms of many languages and in various romanization and transcription schemes. It received its English name from &quot;bent around&quot;a translation of the ().

The circumflex in the Latin script is chevron-shaped (), while the Greek circumflex may be displayed either like a tilde () or like an inverted breve (). For the most commonly encountered uses of the accent in the Latin alphabet, precomposed characters are available.

In English, the circumflex, like other diacritics, is sometimes retained on loanwords that used it in the original language (for example &quot;entrepôt, crème brûlée&quot;).
In mathematics and statistics, the circumflex diacritic is sometimes used to denote a function and is called a &quot;hat operator&quot;.

A free-standing version of the circumflex symbol, , is encoded in ASCII and Unicode and has become known as &quot;caret&quot; and has acquired special uses, particularly in computing and mathematics. The original caret, , is used in proofreading to indicate insertion.

==Uses==

===Diacritic on vowels===

====Pitch====

The circumflex has its origins in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, where it marked long vowels that were pronounced with high and then falling pitch. In a similar vein, the circumflex is today used to mark tone contour in the International Phonetic Alphabet. This is also how it is used in Bamanankan (as opposed to a háček, which signifies a rising tone on a syllable).

The shape of the circumflex was originally a combination of the acute and grave accents (^), as it marked a syllable contracted from two vowels: an acute-accented vowel and a non-accented vowel (all non-accented syllables in Ancient Greek were once marked with a grave accent). Later a variant similar to the tilde (~) was also used.

The term &quot;circumflex&quot; is also used to describe similar tonal accents that result from combining two vowels in related languages such as Sanskrit and Latin.

Since Modern Greek has a stress accent instead of a pitch accent, the circumflex has been replaced with an acute accent in the modern monotonic orthography.

==== Length ====
The circumflex accent marks a long vowel in the orthography or transliteration of several languages.

* In Afrikaans, the circumflex marks a vowel with a lengthened pronunciation, often arising from compensatory lengthening due to the loss of from the original Dutch form. Examples of circumflex use in Afrikaans are &quot;sê&quot; &quot;to say&quot;, &quot;wêreld&quot; &quot;world&quot;, &quot;môre&quot; &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;brûe&quot; &quot;bridges&quot;.
* In the transliteration of Akkadian, the circumflex indicates a long vowel resulting from an aleph contraction.
* In western Cree, Sauk, and Saulteaux, the Algonquianist Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) indicates long vowels either with a circumflex ⟨&quot;â ê î ô&quot;⟩ or with a macron ⟨&quot;ā ē ī ō&quot;⟩.
* The PDA orthography for Domari uses circumflex-bearing vowels for length.
* In Emilian, &quot;â î û&quot; are used to represent 
* French. In some varieties, such as in Belgian French, Swiss French and Acadian French, vowels with a circumflex are long: &quot;fête&quot; (party) is longer than &quot;faite&quot; . This length compensates for a deleted consonant, usually &quot;s&quot;. French words with deleted &quot;s&quot; include châtain and hôpital.
* Standard Friulian.
* Japanese. In the Nihon-shiki system of romanization, the circumflex is used to indicate long vowels. The Kunrei-shiki system, which is based on Nihon-shiki system, also uses the circumflex. The Traditional and Modified forms of the Hepburn system use the macron for this purpose, though some users may use the circumflex as a substitute if there are difficulties inputting the macron, as the two diacritics are visually similar.
* Jèrriais.
* In UNGEGN romanization system for Khmer, &quot;â&quot; is used to represent , &quot;ê&quot; in first series and in second series, and &quot;ô&quot; for . There are also additional vowels which are diphthongs such as &quot;aô&quot; , &quot;âu&quot; , &quot;âm&quot; , &quot;ŏâm&quot; and &quot;aôh&quot; .
* In Kurmanji Kurdish, ⟨ê î û⟩ are used to represent .
* In Mikasuki, circumflexed vowels indicate a rising and falling pitch or tone.
* In Adûnaic, the Black Speech, and Khuzdul, constructed languages of J. R. R. Tolkien, all long vowels are transcribed with the circumflex. In Sindarin, another of Tolkien&#x27;s languages, long vowels in polysyllabic words take the acute, but a circumflex in monosyllables, to mark a non-phonemic extra lengthening.

==== Stress ====
The circumflex accent marks the stressed vowel of a word in some languages:

* Portuguese &quot;â&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, and &quot;ô&quot; are stressed close vowels, opposed to their open counterparts &quot;á&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, and &quot;ó&quot; (see below).
* Welsh: the circumflex, due to its function as a disambiguating lengthening sign (see above), is used in polysyllabic words with word-final long vowels. The circumflex thus indicates the stressed syllable (which would normally be on the penultimate syllable), since in Welsh, non-stressed vowels may not normally be long. This happens notably where the singular ends in an &quot;a&quot;, to, e.g. singular &quot;camera&quot;, &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;opera&quot;, &quot;sinema&quot; → plural &quot;camerâu&quot;, &quot;dramâu&quot;, &quot;operâu&quot;, &quot;sinemâu&quot;; however, it also occurs in singular nominal forms, e.g. &quot;arwyddocâd&quot;; in verbal forms, e.g. &quot;deffrônt&quot;, &quot;cryffânt&quot;; etc.

==== Vowel quality ====
*In Breton, it is used on an &quot;e&quot; to show that the letter is pronounced open instead of closed.
* In Bulgarian, the sound represented in Bulgarian by the Cyrillic letter &quot;ъ&quot; (&quot;er goljam&quot;) is usually transliterated as &quot;â&quot; in systems used prior to 1989. Although called a schwa (misleadingly suggesting an unstressed lax sound), it is more accurately described as a mid back unrounded vowel . Unlike English or French, but similar to Romanian and Afrikaans, it can be stressed.
* In Pinyin romanized Mandarin Chinese, &quot;ê&quot; is used to represent the sound in isolation, which occurs sometimes as an exclamation.
* In French, the letter &quot;ê&quot; is normally pronounced open, like &quot;è&quot;. In the usual pronunciations of central and northern France, &quot;ô&quot; is pronounced close, like &quot;eau&quot;; in Southern France, no distinction is made between close and open &quot;o&quot;.
* In Phuthi, &quot;î&quot; and &quot;û&quot; are used to mark superclose vowels and , respectively.
* Portuguese &quot;â&quot; , &quot;ê&quot; , and &quot;ô&quot; are stressed high vowels, in opposition to &quot;á&quot; , &quot;é&quot; , and &quot;ó&quot; , which are stressed low vowels.
* In Romanian, the circumflex is used on the vowels &quot;â&quot; and &quot;î&quot; to mark the vowel , similar to Russian &quot;yery&quot;. The names of these accented letters are &quot;â din a&quot; and &quot;î din i&quot;, respectively. (The letter &quot;â&quot; only appears in the middle of words; thus, its majuscule version appears only in all-capitals inscriptions.)
* In Slovak, the circumflex (&quot;vokáň&quot;) on &quot;ô&quot; indicates a diphthong .
* In Swedish dialect and folklore literature the circumflex is used to indicate the phonemes or &quot;(â)&quot;, or (&quot;ô&quot;) and (&quot;û&quot;) in dialects and regional accents where these are distinct from (&quot;a&quot;), (&quot;ö&quot;) or (&quot;o&quot; or &quot;å&quot;) and (&quot;u&quot;) respectively, unlike Standard Swedish where and , and are short and long allophones of the phonemes and respectively, and where Old Swedish short (&quot;ŏ&quot;) has merged with from Old Swedish (&quot;ā&quot;, Modern Swedish &quot;å&quot;) instead of centralizing to or fronting to and remaining a distinct phoneme (&quot;ô&quot;) as in the dialects in question. Different methods can be found in different literature, so some author may use &quot;æ&quot; instead of &quot;â&quot;, or use &quot;â&quot; where others use &quot;å̂&quot; (&quot;å&quot; with a circumflex; for a sound between and ).
* Vietnamese &quot;â&quot; , &quot;ê&quot; , and &quot;ô&quot; are higher vowels than &quot;a&quot; , &quot;e&quot; , and &quot;o&quot; . The circumflex can appear together with a tone mark on the same vowel, as in the word &quot;Việt&quot;. Vowels with circumflex are considered separate letters from the base vowels.

====Nasality====
* In Luxembourgish &quot;m̂ n̂&quot; can be used to indicate nasalisation of a vowel. Also, the circumflex can be over the vowel to indicate nasalisation. In either case, the circumflex is rare.
* In several indigenous languages of New Caledonia, a circumflex indicates nasality on vowels: e.g. the orthography Xârâcùù contrasts its oral vowels &quot;a&quot; , &quot;e&quot; , &quot;i&quot; , &quot;u&quot; with its nasal vowels &quot;â&quot; , &quot;ê&quot; , &quot;î&quot; , &quot;ô&quot; , &quot;û&quot; – with duplicated variants indicating length (e.g. &quot;êê&quot; , etc.). Due to typographical shortage of characters, some nasal vowels in Xârâcùù are encoded with an umlaut: e.g. &quot;ä&quot; , &quot;ü&quot; ).

====Other articulatory features====
* In Emilian, &quot;ê ô&quot; denote both length and height.
* In Tagalog and most Philippine languages, the circumflex accent (&quot;pakupyâ&quot;) is used to represent the simultaneous occurrence of a stress and a glottal stop on the last vowel of a word. Though not part of the official alphabet, possible combinations can include: â, ê, î, ô, and û. But in the case of T&#x27;boli, the circumflex accent is only used as a pure unstressed glottal stop. It works as a combination of acute and grave accent; with the case of letters é and ó which represents the sound of and respectively and can be shown as ê and ô if it contains a glottal stop.
*In Romagnol, they are used to represent the diphthongs , whose specific articulation varies between dialects, e.g. &quot;sêl&quot; &quot;salt&quot;.
* In Old Tupi, the circumflex changed a vowel into a semivowel: &quot;î&quot; , &quot;û&quot; , and &quot;ŷ&quot; .
*In Rusyn, the letter &quot;ŷ&quot; is sometimes used to transliterate the Cyrillic &quot;ы&quot;.
* In Turkish, the circumflex over &quot;a&quot; and &quot;u&quot; is sometimes used in words of Arabic or Persian derivation to indicate when a preceding consonant (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;l&quot;) is to be pronounced as a palatal plosive; , (&quot;kâğıt&quot;, &quot;gâvur&quot;, &quot;mahkûm&quot;, &quot;Gülgûn&quot;). The circumflex over &quot;i&quot; is used to indicate a nisba suffix (&quot;millî&quot;, &quot;dinî&quot;).
* In Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization of Hokkien, the circumflex over a vowel (a, e, i, o, o͘, u) or a syllabic nasal (m, ng) indicate the tone number 5, traditionally called Yang Level or Light Level (陽平). The tone contour is usually low rising. For example, &quot;ê&quot; , &quot;n̂g&quot; .

====Visual discrimination between homographs====
* In Serbo-Croatian the circumflex can be used to distinguish homographs, and it is called the &quot;genitive sign&quot; or &quot;length sign&quot;. Examples include &quot;sam&quot; &quot;am&quot; versus &quot;sâm&quot; &quot;alone&quot;. For example, the phrase &quot;I am alone&quot; may be written &quot;Ja sam sâm&quot; to improve clarity. Another example: &quot;da&quot; &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;dâ&quot; &quot;gives&quot;.
* Turkish. According to Turkish Language Association orthography, &quot;düzeltme işareti&quot; &quot;correction mark&quot; over &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; marks a long vowel to disambiguate similar words. For example, compare &quot;ama&quot; &quot;but&quot; and &quot;âmâ&quot; &quot;blind&quot;, &quot;şura&quot; &#x27;that place, there&#x27; and &quot;şûra&quot; &quot;council&quot;. In general, circumflexes occur only in Arabic and Persian loanwords as vowel length in early Turkish was not phonemic. However, this standard was never applied entirely consistently and by the late 20th century many publications had stopped using circumflexes almost entirely. 
* Welsh. The circumflex is known as &quot;hirnod&quot; &quot;long sign&quot; or &quot;acen grom&quot; &quot;crooked accent&quot;, but more usually and colloquially as &quot;to bach&quot; &quot;little roof&quot;. It lengthens a stressed vowel (&quot;a, e, i, o, u, w, y&quot;), and is used particularly to differentiate between homographs; e.g. &quot;tan&quot; and &quot;tân&quot;, &quot;ffon&quot; and &quot;ffôn&quot;, &quot;gem&quot; and &quot;gêm&quot;, &quot;cyn&quot; and &quot;cŷn&quot;, or &quot;gwn&quot; and &quot;gŵn&quot;. However the circumflex is only required on elongated vowels if the same word exists without the circumflex - &quot;nos&quot; (night), for example, has an elongated &quot;o&quot; sound but a circumflex is not required as the same word with a shortened &quot;o&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist.
* The orthography of French has a few pairs of homophones that are only distinguished by the circumflex: e.g. &quot;du&quot; (partitive article) vs. &quot;dû&quot; &#x27;due&#x27;.

===Diacritic on consonants===
* In Pinyin, the romanized writing of Mandarin Chinese, &quot;ẑ&quot;, &quot;ĉ&quot;, and &quot;ŝ&quot; are, albeit rarely, used to represent &quot;zh&quot; , &quot;ch&quot; , and &quot;sh&quot; , respectively.
* In Esperanto, the circumflex is used on &quot;ĉ&quot; , &quot;ĝ&quot; , &quot;ĥ&quot; , &quot;ĵ&quot; , &quot;ŝ&quot; . Each indicates a different consonant from the unaccented form, and is considered a separate letter for purposes of collation. (See Esperanto orthography.)
* In Nsenga, &quot;ŵ&quot; denotes the labiodental approximant .
* In Chichewa, &quot;ŵ&quot; (present for example in the name of the country &quot;Malaŵi&quot;) used to denote the voiced bilabial fricative ; nowadays, however, most Chichewa-speakers pronounce it as a regular .
* In Nias, &quot;ŵ&quot; denotes the semivowel .
* In the African language Venda, a circumflex below d, l, n, and t is used to represent dental consonants: ḓ, ḽ, ṋ, ṱ.
* In the 18th century, the Real Academia Española introduced the circumflex accent in Spanish to mark that a &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;x&quot; were pronounced and respectively (instead of and , which were the default values): &quot;châracteres, exâcto&quot; (spelled today &quot;caracteres, exacto&quot;). This usage was quickly abandoned during the same century, once the RAE decided to use &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;x&quot; with one assigned pronunciation only: and respectively.
* In Domari (according to the Pan-Domari Alphabet orthography), the circumflex is used on the letters &lt;&quot;ĉ ĝ ĵ ŝ ẑ&quot;&gt; to represent the sounds of . It is also used above vowels to indicate length.

===Abbreviation, contraction, and disambiguation===

==== English ====
In 18th century British English, before the cheap Penny Post and while paper was taxed, the combination &quot;ough&quot; was occasionally shortened to &quot;ô&quot; when the &quot;gh&quot; was not pronounced, to save space: &quot;thô&quot; for &quot;though&quot;, &quot;thorô&quot; for &quot;thorough&quot;, and &quot;brôt&quot; for &quot;brought&quot;. 

==== French ====

In French, the circumflex generally marks the former presence of a consonant (usually &quot;s&quot;) that was deleted and is no longer pronounced. (The corresponding Norman French words, and consequently the words derived from them in English, frequently retain the lost consonant.) For example:
*&quot;ancêtre&quot; &quot;ancestor&quot;
*&quot;hôpital&quot; &quot;hospital&quot;
*&quot;hôtel&quot; &quot;hostel&quot;
*&quot;forêt&quot; &quot;forest&quot;
*&quot;rôtir&quot; &quot;to roast&quot;
*&quot;côte&quot; &quot;rib, coast, slope&quot;
*&quot;pâté&quot; &quot;paste&quot;
*&quot;août&quot; &quot;August&quot;
*&quot;dépôt&quot; (from the Latin &quot;depositum&quot; &#x27;deposit&#x27;, but now referring to both a deposit or a storehouse of any kind)

Some homophones (or near-homophones in some varieties of French) are distinguished by the circumflex. However, â, ê and ô distinguish different sounds in most varieties of French, for instance &quot;cote&quot; &quot;level, mark, code number&quot; and &quot;côte&quot; &quot;rib, coast, hillside&quot;.

In handwritten French, for example in taking notes, an &quot;m&quot; with a circumflex (m̂) is an informal abbreviation for &quot;même&quot; &quot;same&quot;.

In February 2016, the Académie française decided to remove the circumflex from about 2,000 words, a plan that had been outlined since 1990. However, usage of the circumflex would not be considered incorrect.

==== Italian ====
In Italian, &quot;î&quot; is occasionally used in the plural of nouns and adjectives ending with &quot;-io&quot; as a crasis mark. Other possible spellings are &quot;-ii&quot; and obsolete &quot;-j&quot; or &quot;-ij&quot;. For example, the plural of &quot;various&quot; can be spelt , , ; the pronunciation will usually stay with only one . The plural forms of &quot;prince&quot; and of &quot;principle, beginning&quot; can be confusing. In pronunciation, they are distinguished by whether the stress is on the first or on the second syllable, but would be a correct spelling of both. When necessary to avoid ambiguity, it is advised to write the plural of as or as .

==== Latin ====

In Neo-Latin, circumflex was used most often to disambiguate between forms of the same word that used a long vowel, for example ablative of first declension and genitive of fourth declension, or between second and third conjugation verbs. It was also used for the interjection &quot;ô&quot;.

==== Norwegian ====
In Norwegian, the circumflex differentiates &quot;fôr&quot; &quot;lining, fodder&quot; from the preposition &quot;for&quot;. From a historical point of view, the circumflex also indicates that the word used to be spelled with the letter &quot;ð&quot; in Old Norsefor example, &quot;fôr&quot; is derived from &quot;fóðr&quot;, &quot;lêr&quot; &#x27;leather&#x27; from &quot;leðr&quot;, and &quot;vêr&quot; &quot;weather, ram&quot; from &quot;veðr&quot; (both &quot;lêr&quot; and &quot;vêr&quot; only occur in the Nynorsk spelling; in Bokmål these words are spelled &quot;lær&quot; and &quot;vær&quot;). After the &quot;ð&quot; disappeared, it was replaced by a &quot;d&quot; (&quot;fodr, vedr&quot;).

==== Portuguese ====
Circumflexes are used in many common words of the language, such as the name of the language, &quot;português&quot;. Usually, &quot;â, ê&quot; and &quot;ô&quot; appear before nasals (&quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;) in proparoxytone words, like &quot;higiênico&quot; but in many cases in European Portuguese &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; will be marked with an acute accent (e.g. &quot;higiénico&quot;) since the vowel quality is open (ɛ or ɔ) in this standard variety. In early literacy classes in school, it is commonly nicknamed &quot;chapéu&quot; (hat).

====Welsh====

The circumflex (ˆ) is mostly used to mark long vowels, so &quot;â, ê, î, ô, û, ŵ, ŷ&quot; are always long. However, not all long vowels are marked with a circumflex, so the letters &quot;a, e, i, o, u, w, y&quot; with no circumflex do not necessarily represent short vowels.

===Mathematics===

In mathematics, the circumflex is used to modify variable names; it is usually read &quot;hat&quot;, e.g., formula_1 is &quot;x hat&quot;. The Fourier transform of a function &quot;ƒ&quot; is often denoted by formula_2.

In geometry, a hat is sometimes used for an angle. For instance, the angles formula_3 or formula_4.

In vector notation, a hat above a letter indicates a unit vector (a dimensionless vector with a magnitude of 1). For instance, formula_5, formula_6, or formula_7 stands for a unit vector in the direction of the x-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system.

In statistics, the hat is used to denote an estimator or an estimated value, as opposed to its theoretical counterpart. For example, in errors and residuals, the hat in formula_8 indicates an observable estimate (the residual) of an unobservable quantity called formula_9 (the statistical error). It is read &quot;x-hat&quot; or &quot;x-roof&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; represents the character under the hat.

===Music===

In music theory and musicology, a circumflex above a numeral is used to make reference to a particular scale degree.

In music notation, a chevron-shaped symbol placed above a note indicates marcato, a special form of emphasis or accent. In music for string instruments, a narrow inverted chevron indicates that a note should be performed up-bow.

==Circumflex below==
A circumflex below a vowel (for example, ) is a notation used by the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet to indicate a raised variant of the vowel.

== Unicode ==

Unicode encodes a number of cases of &quot;letter with circumflex&quot; as precomposed characters and these are displayed below. In addition, many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility ( and ) that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real-world application and thus are not shown in the table. 
The Greek diacritic , is encoded as . In distinction to the angled Latin circumflex, the Greek circumflex is printed in the form of either a tilde (◌̃) or an inverted breve (◌̑).

===Freestanding circumflex ===
There is a similar but larger character, , which was originally intended to emulate the typewriter&#x27;s dead key function using backspace and overtype. Nowadays, this glyph is more often called a caret instead (though the term has a long-standing meaning as a proofreader&#x27;s mark, with its own codepoints in Unicode). It is, however, unsuitable for use as a diacritic on modern computer systems, as it is a spacing character. Two other spacing circumflex characters in Unicode are the smaller modifier letters and , mainly used in phonetic notations or as a sample of the diacritic in isolation.

===Typing the circumflex accent===
In countries where the local language(s) routinely include letters with a circumflex, local keyboards are typically engraved with those symbols.

For users with other keyboards, see QWERTY#Multilingual variants and Unicode input.

<text>This is a list of heads of state of Albania who have served since the Declaration of Independence of 1912.

Since the collapse of the communist regime in 1991, the head of state of Albania is the president of the republic (). The president is indirectly elected to a five-year term and is limited to a maximum of two terms, as specified by the Constitution. As in most parliamentary systems, the president is now by-and-large a ceremonial office, with the prime minister &quot;de facto&quot; heading the executive branch.

<doc id="167238" wikidata="Q453480" url="?curid=167238" title="Lord Guildford Dudley">
<text>Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) ( – 12 February 1554) was an English nobleman who was married to Lady Jane Grey. She occupied the English throne from 10 July until 19 July 1553, having been declared the heir of King Edward VI. Guildford Dudley had a humanist education and married Jane in a magnificent celebration about six weeks before the King&#x27;s death. After Guildford&#x27;s father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane&#x27;s accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They were still in the Tower when their regime collapsed and remained there in different quarters as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion against Mary&#x27;s plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple&#x27;s execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh.

==Family and marriage==

Lord Guildford Dudley was the second youngest surviving son of John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland and his wife, Jane Guildford. The Dudley lineage goes back to a family called Sutton. In the early 14th century, they became the lords of Dudley Castle, from whom Guildford descended through his paternal grandfather. This was Edmund Dudley, a councillor of Henry VII, who, in 1510, after the accession of Henry VIII, was executed. Through his father&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Grey, 6th Baroness Lisle, Guildford descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.

The thirteen Dudley children grew up in a Protestant household and received a humanist education. Under the young King Edward VI, Guildford&#x27;s father became Lord President of the Council and &quot;de facto&quot; ruled England from 1550 to 1553. The chronicler Richard Grafton, who knew him, described Guildford as &quot;a comely, virtuous and goodly gentleman&quot;. In 1552 Northumberland unsuccessfully tried to arrange a marriage between Guildford and Margaret Clifford. Instead, in the spring of 1553, Guildford was engaged to the sixteen-year-old Jane Grey. Jane Grey and Margaret Clifford were both great-granddaughters of King Henry VII, but Jane figured higher in the line of succession. On 25 May 1553, three weddings were celebrated at Durham Place, the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s town mansion. Guildford married Jane; his sister Katherine married Henry Hastings, the Earl of Huntingdon&#x27;s heir; and Jane&#x27;s sister Katherine married Lord Herbert, the heir of the Earl of Pembroke. It was a magnificent festival, with jousts, games, and masques. For the latter, two different companies had been booked, one male, one female. The Venetian and French ambassadors were guests, and there were &quot;large numbers of the common people ... and of the most principal of the realm&quot;. Guildford and some others suffered an attack of food poisoning, because of &quot;a mistake made by a cook, who plucked one leaf for another&quot;.

==Claimed kingship==

King Edward, in his &quot;Devise of the Succession&quot;, settled the Crown on Jane Grey, his first cousin once removed, bypassing his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. After Edward&#x27;s death on 6 July 1553, the Duke of Northumberland undertook the enforcement of the King&#x27;s will. The envoys of the Holy Roman Empire and France were sure of the plan&#x27;s success. Jane was reluctant to accept the Crown: she gave in after remonstrances by an assembly of nobles, including her parents and in-laws, while Guildford chimed in with a lovelier approach, with &quot;prayers and caresses&quot;. On 10 July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London. Residing in there, Guildford wanted to be made king; according to her own later account, Jane had a long discussion about this with Guildford, who &quot;assented that if he were to be made king, he would be so by me, by Act of Parliament&quot;. However, Jane would agree only to make him Duke of Clarence; Guildford replied that he did not want to be a duke, but the king. When the Duchess of Northumberland heard of the argument, she became furious and forbade Guildford to sleep any longer with his wife. She also commanded him to leave the Tower and go home, but Jane insisted that he remain at court at her side.

According to later remarks by the Imperial ambassadors, the daily Council meetings were presided over by Guildford, who allegedly also dined in state alone and had himself addressed in regal style. Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, described Guildford as &quot;the new King&quot;. The Imperial court in Brussels also believed in the existence of King Guildford.

==Imprisonment==
On 10 July, the same day as Jane&#x27;s proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and demanding the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action until he heard on 20 July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the marketplace and was arrested the next morning. On 19 July, a few hours before Queen Mary I&#x27;s proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners&#x27; children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child&#x27;s name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.

A majority of the Privy Council moved out of the Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming aware of his colleagues&#x27; change of mind, Jane&#x27;s father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler&#x27;s lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane&#x27;s and Guildford&#x27;s lives, concluding that they were mere pawns in Northumberland&#x27;s scheme.

Jane and Guildford were indicted on 12 August, and Jane submitted a letter of explanation to the Queen, &quot;asking forgiveness ... for the sin she was accused of, informing her majesty about the truth of events.&quot; In this account, she spoke of herself as &quot;a wife who loves her husband&quot;. On 13 November 1553, Jane and Guildford were tried at Guildhall, together with Archbishop Cranmer and Guildford&#x27;s brothers Ambrose and Henry. They were all convicted of high treason after pleading guilty. Guildford was convicted of compassing to depose Queen Mary I by sending troops to the Duke of Northumberland and by proclaiming and honouring Jane as queen.

In December, Jane was allowed to walk freely in the Queen&#x27;s Garden. Lord Robert and Lord Guildford had to be content with taking the air on the leads of the Bell Tower. Jane and Guildford may have had some contact with each other, and at some point Guildford wrote a message to his father-in-law in Jane&#x27;s prayer book: 
Your loving and obedient son wishes unto your grace long life in this world with as much joy and comfort as ever I wish to myself, and in the world to come joy everlasting. Your humble son to his death, G. Dudley
==Execution== 

Queen Mary I&#x27;s plan to marry King Philip of Naples and Sicily (the future Philip II of Spain) was greeted with widespread opposition, not just among the populace but also among Members of Parliament and privy councillors. Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion in early 1554, in which the Duke of Suffolk took part, resulted from this dislike. It was not the intention of the conspirators to bring Jane Grey to the throne again. Nevertheless, at the height of the military crisis around 7 February, the government decided to execute Jane and her husband for high treason, of which they had both been found guilty. It was also an opportunity to remove possible inspirations for future unrest and unwelcome reminders of the past. It troubled Mary to let her cousin die, but she accepted the Privy Council&#x27;s advice. Bishop Gardiner pressed for the young couple&#x27;s execution in a court sermon, and the Imperial ambassador Simon Renard was happy to report that &quot;Jane of Suffolk and her husband are to lose their heads.&quot;

The day before their executions, Guildford asked Jane for a last meeting, which she refused, explaining it &quot;would only ... increase their misery and pain, it was better to put it off ... as they would meet shortly elsewhere, and live bound by indissoluble ties.&quot; Around ten o&#x27;clock in the morning of 12 February, Guildford was led towards Tower Hill, where &quot;many ... gentlemen&quot; waited to shake hands with him. Guildford made a short speech to the assembled crowd, as was customary. &quot;Having no ghostly father with him&quot;, he knelt, prayed, and asked the people to pray for him, &quot;holding up his eyes and hands to God many times&quot;. He was killed with one stroke of the axe, after which his body was conveyed on a cart to the Tower chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Watching the scene from her window, Jane exclaimed: &quot;Oh, Guildford, Guildford!&quot; He was buried in the chapel with Jane, who was dead within the hour.

The executions did not contribute to Mary&#x27;s or the government&#x27;s popularity. Five months after the couple&#x27;s death, John Knox, the famous Scottish reformer, wrote of them as &quot;innocents ... such as by just laws and faithful witnesses can never be proved to have offended by themselves.&quot; Of Guildford, the chronicler Grafton wrote ten years later: &quot;even those that never before the time of his execution saw him, did with lamentable tears bewail his death.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Lord Guildford Dudley was portrayed by John Mills in the 1936 film &quot;Tudor Rose&quot;, Cary Elwes in the 1986 film &quot;Lady Jane,&quot; Jacob Avery in the 2022 drama series &quot;Becoming Elizabeth&quot;, and Edward Bluemel in the 2024 television series &quot;My Lady Jane&quot;. He is also a character in Alison Weir&#x27;s &quot;Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey&quot; (2007).

<text>An omelette (sometimes omelet in American English; see spelling differences) is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is a common practice for an omelette to include fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.

==History==

The earliest omelettes are believed to have originated in ancient Persia. According to &quot;Breakfast: A History&quot;, they were &quot;nearly indistinguishable&quot; from the Iranian dish kookoo sabzi.

According to Alan Davidson, the French word &quot;omelette&quot; () came into use during the mid-16th century, but the versions &quot;alumelle&quot; and &quot;alumete&quot; are employed by the Ménagier de Paris (II, 4 and II, 5) in 1393. Rabelais (&quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, IV, 9) mentions an &quot;homelaicte d&#x27;oeufs&quot;, Olivier de Serres an &quot;amelette&quot;, François Pierre La Varenne&#x27;s &quot;Le cuisinier françois&quot; (1651) has &quot;aumelette&quot;, and the modern &quot;omelette&quot; appears in &quot;Cuisine bourgeoise&quot; (1784).

Alexandre Dumas discusses several variations of omelette in his &quot;Grand dictionnaire de cuisine&quot;. One is an omelette with fresh herbs (parsley, chives and tarragon), another is a variation with mushrooms that Dumas says may be adapted using green peas, asparagus, spinach, sorrel or varieties of truffles. The &quot;kirsch omelette &quot; (or rum omelette) is a sweet omelette made with sugar and liquor, either kirsch or rum. The omelette is rolled and sprinkled with powdered sugar. A hot poker is used to burn a design into the omelette and it is served with a sweet sauce made of liquor and apricot jam. Another sweet omelette, attributed to a royal cook of Prussia, is made with apples and brown sugar glaze. Of the Arabian omelette, Dumas writes &quot;I have been concerned in this book to give the recipes of peoples who have no true cuisine. Here, for example, is a recipe the Bey&#x27;s cook was good enough to give me.&quot; The omelette itself is made with an ostrich egg and served with a spicy tomato-pepper sauce.

==Variations by country==
===China===
* Egg foo young, a Cantonese omelette made with beaten eggs and usually ham.
* An oyster omelette, a dish of Hokkien and Teochew origin made with oysters, starch and egg batter

===France===
* Depending on sources, a standard omelette is cooked in butter on medium (or sometimes high) heat, is supposed to be golden brown or &quot;unbrowned or very lightly browned&quot; on the outside and soft in the inside (though variations are possible according to preferences); according to some American cookbooks reflecting high-end restaurant practices, a &quot;French Omelette&quot; should be unbrowned, cooked slowly over medium-low to medium heat, with initial stirring to prevent curds and sticking. Seasoned with just salt and pepper, this omelette is often flavored with finely chopped herbs (often fines herbes or tarragon, chervil, parsley and chives) or chopped onions.
* The omelette de la mère Poulard, a Norman specialty first developed in Mont-Saint-Michel, has been called the most famous omelette in the world. It is served without fillings but often served with heavy garnishes.
* The Provençal omelette is more similar to a frittata than to a traditional rolled or folded French omelette. The eggs are cooked like a traditional French omelette until the time any fillings are added; instead of adding fillings in a strip or on half the omelette, they are scattered over the entire surface of the omelette, and then the entire omelette is flipped and slipped back into the pan to cook what had been the top and is now the bottom. A tourne omelette or vire omelette, a concave platter similar to a cake plate, is often used as an aid and can be used to serve the finished omelette. According to Bernard Duplessy the tourne omelette dates to &quot;several centuries before Christ&quot;.
* Crespéou, another Provençal dish (also called &quot;gateau d&#x27;omelettes&quot; or &quot;omelettes en sandwich&quot;), is made by stacking open-faced omelettes.

===India===
* In Parsi cuisine, &quot;pora&quot; is an omelette made from eggs, onion, tomato, green chillies, and coriander leaves. It is usually served for breakfast with Indian/Irani tea and bread. 

* In India, eggs are beaten with onions and poured directly on a hot pan with salt and pepper. These omelettes are consumed frequently in many Indian households.
* Bread Omlette, a widespread indian snack made with Bread and egg is famous across India.

* In South Indian hotels, omlette is mixed with the mutton gravy (&quot;salna&quot;) in a semi-cooked manner and many omlette variants like &quot;Kalakki, Plain Omlette, Karandi Omlette, Podi Omlette&quot; are widespread found in Tamilnadu.

===Indonesia===
* In Betawi cuisine, &quot;kerak telor&quot; is a traditional spicy omelette that made from glutinous rice cooked with egg and served with &quot;serundeng&quot; (fried shredded coconut), fried shallots and dried shrimp as topping.
* &quot;Fuyunghai&quot; or &quot;puyonghai&quot; is a Chinese Indonesian omelette, usually made from the mixture of vegetables such as carrots, bean sprouts, and cabbages, mixed with meats such as crab, shrimp, or minced chicken.

===Iran===
*&quot;Kuku&quot; is an omelette frequently containing large proportions of other ingredients, including herbs, folded in.
*&quot;Nargesi&quot; or spinach omelette is an Iranian dish, made with fried onions and spinach, and is spiced with salt, garlic, and pepper.

===Italy===
* A &quot;frittata&quot; is an open-faced Italian omelette-like dish that can contain cheese, vegetables, or even leftover pasta. Frittatas are cooked slowly. Except for the cooking oil, all ingredients are fully mixed with the eggs before cooking starts.

===Japan===
* In Japan, &quot;tamagoyaki&quot; is a traditional omelette in which eggs are beaten with mirin, soy sauce, bonito flakes, sugar and water, and cooked in a special rectangular frying pan.
*&quot;Omurice&quot; (from the French word &quot;omelette&quot; and English word &quot;rice&quot;) is an omelette filled with fried rice and usually served with a large amount of tomato ketchup. &quot;Omu-soba&quot; is an omelette with &quot;yakisoba&quot; as its filling. There are several styles of this dish, including omelette cooked and filled with fried rice, a soft-cooked omelette served over the fried rice that is then sliced open, and a &quot;tornado&quot; style omelette over the rice.
* &quot;Tenshindon&quot; is a Japanese-Chinese specialty, consisting of a crab meat omelette on rice.

===Korea===
In Korean cuisine, traditional omelettes are known as &quot;gyeran-mari&quot; (계란말이, &quot;rolled-eggs&quot;) which is a type of savory &quot;banchan&quot;. &quot;Gyeran-mari&quot; is made with beaten eggs, mixed with finely diced vegetables, meats, and seafood. This side dish is often found in Korean banquet (&quot;janchi&quot;) meals, as well as Korean fast food (&quot;bunsik&quot;) restaurants.

===Mexico and Central America===
While the Spanish terms &quot;tortilla&quot; (in Spain) and &quot;torta&quot; (in the Philippines) are applied to an omelette dish, in Mexico &amp; Central America &quot;tortilla&quot; is a term for a flatbread made of wheat or corn, while &quot;torta&quot; is used for a type of sandwich. An omelette in Mexico (&amp; Central America) is sometimes termed as &quot;tortilla de huevos&quot;, but the term &quot;omelette&quot; is widely used.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, omelettes are known as &quot;torta&quot;, usually encountered with the enclitic &quot;-ng&quot; (&quot;tortang&quot;) indicating it modifies the next word (the main ingredient); e.g. &quot;tortang hipon&quot; = &quot;torta&quot; (&quot;omelette&quot;) + &quot;-ng&quot; and &quot;hipon&quot; (&quot;shrimp&quot;), meaning &quot;shrimp omelette&quot;. There are many types of &quot;torta&quot; which are named based on their main ingredients. They include:

* &quot;Tortang alamang&quot; or &quot;tortang hipon&quot; – an omelette with krill or small shrimp. Also known as shrimp fritters, although this term usually refers to &quot;okoy&quot;, a fritter made with shrimp and various vegetables (as well as other variations without shrimp).
*&quot;Tortang carne norte&quot; – an omelette made from corned beef mixed with eggs. A common cheap breakfast dish.
*&quot;Tortang dulong&quot; or &quot;maranay&quot; – an omelette, usually crispy, made with tiny fish from the family Salangidae known as &quot;dulong&quot; in Tagalog and &quot;ipon&quot;, &quot;libgao&quot;, or &quot;maranay&quot; in Visayan. It is sometimes called &quot;okoy&quot;, though traditional &quot;okoy&quot; is not an omelette, but rather a type of fritter made with glutinous rice.
* &quot;Tortang giniling&quot; or &quot;tortang picadillo&quot; – an omelette with ground meat (usually beef or pork) and sautéed vegetables.
* &quot;Tortang gulay&quot; – an omelette with peppers, mushrooms, onion, and garlic.
* &quot;Tortang kalabasa&quot; – an omelette made with finely julienned calabaza, eggs, flour, and salt.

The dish is usually served with Sriracha sauce and cilantro. A variation on this dish is &quot;khai chiao songkhrueang&quot;, where the plain egg omelette is served together with a stir-fry of meat and vegetables. Yet another type of Thai omelette is &quot;khai yat sai&quot;, literally &quot;eggs filled with stuffing&quot;.

<text>An academic degree is a qualification awarded to a student upon successful completion of a course of study in higher education, usually at a college or university. These institutions often offer degrees at various levels, usually divided into undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor&#x27;s degree, although some educational systems offer lower-level undergraduate degrees such as associate and foundation degrees. Common postgraduate degrees include engineer&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates.

In the UK and countries whose educational systems are based on the British system, honours degrees are divided into classes: first, second (broken into upper second, or 2.1, and lower second, or 2.2) and third class.

== History ==
=== Emergence of the doctor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees and the licentiate ===
The doctorate (Latin: &quot;doceo&quot;, &quot;I teach&quot;) first appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach (Latin: &quot;licentia docendi&quot;) at a medieval university. Its roots can be traced to the early church when the term &quot;doctor&quot; referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible. The right to grant a &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was originally reserved by the church which required the applicant to pass a test, take an oath of allegiance, and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access – now largely free of charge – of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic. This right remained a point of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the Pope to the University of Paris in 1231 where it became a universal license to teach (&quot;licentia ubique docendi&quot;). While the &quot;licentia&quot; continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Baccalaureus&quot;), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.

In universities, doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of &quot;Master of Arts&quot; was seven years. This was the same as the term of apprenticeship for other occupations. Originally the terms &quot;master&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot; were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master&#x27;s degree.

Today the terms &quot;master&quot; (from the Latin &quot;magister&quot;, ), &quot;Doctor&quot;, and &quot;Professor&quot; signify different levels of academic achievement, but in the Medieval university, they were equivalent terms. The use of them in the degree name was a matter of custom at a university. Most universities conferred the Master of Arts, although the highest degree was often termed Master of Theology/Divinity or Doctor of Theology/Divinity, depending on the place.

The earliest doctoral degrees (theology – &quot;Divinitatis&quot; Doctor (D.D.), law – &quot;Legum&quot; Doctor (LL.D., later D.C.L.) and medicine – &quot;Medicinæ&quot; Doctor (M.D., D.M.)) reflected the historical separation of all higher University study into these three fields. Over time, the D.D. has gradually become less common outside theology and is now mostly used for honorary degrees, with the title &quot;Doctor of Theology&quot; being used more often for earned degrees. Studies outside theology, law, and medicine were then called &quot;philosophy&quot;, due to the Renaissance conviction that real knowledge could be derived from empirical observation. The degree title of Doctor of Philosophy is a much later creation and was not introduced in England before 1900. Studies in what once was called philosophy are now classified as sciences and humanities.

George Makdisi theorizes that the &quot;ijazah&quot; issued in medieval Islamic madrasas in the 9th century was the origin of the doctorate that later appeared in medieval European universities. Alfred Guillaume, Syed Farid al-Attas and Devin J. Stewart agree that there is a resemblance between the &quot;ijazah&quot; and the university degree. However, Toby Huff and others reject Makdisi&#x27;s theory. Devin J. Stewart finds that the &quot;ijazat al-ifta&quot;, license to teach Islamic law and issue legal opinions, is most similar to the medieval European university degree in that it permits entry into certain professions. A key difference was that the granting authority of the &quot;ijaza&quot; was an individual professor whereas the university degree was granted by a corporate entity.

The University of Bologna in Italy, regarded as the oldest university in Europe, was the first institution to confer the degree of Doctor in Civil Law in the late 12th century; it also conferred similar degrees in other subjects, including medicine.

The University of Paris used the term &quot;master&quot; for its graduates, a practice adopted by the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the ancient Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

=== Emergence of the bachelor&#x27;s degree ===
In medieval European universities, candidates who had completed three or four years of study in the prescribed texts of the &quot;trivium&quot; (grammar, rhetoric and logic) and the &quot;quadrivium&quot; (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music), together known as the Liberal Arts, and who had successfully passed examinations held by their master, would be admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The term &quot;bachelor&quot; comes from the Latin , a term previously used to describe a squire (i.e., apprentice) to a knight. Further study and, in particular, successful participation in, and moderation of, disputations would earn one the Master of Arts degree, from the Latin magister, &quot;master&quot; (typically indicating a teacher), entitling one to teach these subjects. Masters of Arts were eligible to enter study under the &quot;higher faculties&quot; of Law, Medicine or Theology and earn first a bachelor&#x27;s and then master&#x27;s or doctor&#x27;s degree in these subjects. Thus, a degree was only a step on the way to becoming a fully qualified master – hence the English word &quot;graduate&quot;, which is based on the Latin (&quot;step&quot;).

=== Evolution of the terminology of degrees ===

The naming of degrees eventually became linked to the subjects studied. Scholars in the faculties of arts or grammar became known as &quot;masters&quot;, but those in theology, medicine and law were known as &quot;doctors&quot;. As a study in the arts or grammar was a necessary prerequisite to study in subjects such as theology, medicine and law, the degree of doctor assumed a higher status than the master&#x27;s degree. This led to the modern hierarchy in which the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), which in its present form as a degree based on research and dissertation is a development from 18th- and 19th-century German universities, is a more advanced degree than the Master of Arts (M.A.). The practice of using the term &quot;doctor&quot; for PhDs developed within German universities and spread across the academic world.

The French terminology is tied closely to the original meanings of the terms. The &quot;baccalauréat&quot; (cf. &quot;bachelor&quot;) is conferred upon French students who have completed their secondary education and allows the student to attend university. When students graduate from university, they are awarded a &quot;licence&quot;, much as the medieval teaching guilds would have done, and they are qualified to teach in secondary schools or proceed to higher-level studies. Spain had a similar structure: the term &quot;Bachiller&quot; was used for those who finished the secondary or high-school level education, known as &quot;Bachillerato&quot;. The standard Spanish university 5-year degree was &quot;Licenciado&quot;, (although there were a few 3-year associate degrees called &quot;diplomaturas&quot;, from where the &quot;diplomados&quot; could move to study a related &quot;licenciatura&quot;). The highest level was &quot;Doctor&quot;.

=== Degrees awarded by institutions other than universities ===
In the past, degrees have been directly issued by the authority of the monarch or by a bishop, rather than any educational institution. This practice has mostly died out. In Great Britain, Lambeth degrees are still awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s right to grant degrees is derived from the Peter&#x27;s Pence Act 1533, which empowered the Archbishop to grant dispensations previously granted by the Pope.

Among educational institutions, St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, was granted limited degree awarding powers by royal charter in the nineteenth century, despite not being a university. The University College of North Staffordshire was also granted degree awarding powers on its foundation in 1949, despite not becoming a university (as the University of Keele) until 1962. Following the Education Reform Act 1988, many educational institutions other than universities have been granted degree-awarding powers, including higher education colleges and colleges of the University of London, many of which are now effectively universities in their own right.

=== Academic dress ===
In many countries, gaining an academic degree entitles the holder to assume distinctive academic dress particular to the awarding institution, identifying the status of the individual wearing them.

== Laws on granting and use of degrees ==
In many countries, degrees may only be awarded by institutions authorised to do so by the national or regional government. Frequently, governments will also regulate the use of the word &quot;university&quot; in the names of businesses. This approach is followed, for example, by Australia, the United Kingdom and Israel. The use of fake degrees by individuals, either obtained from a bogus institution or simply invented, is often covered by fraud laws.

== Indicating earned degrees ==

Depending on the culture and the degree earned, degrees may be indicated by a pre-nominal title, post-nominal letters, a choice of either, or not indicated at all. In countries influenced by the UK, post-nominal letters are the norm, with only doctorates granting a title, while titles are the norm in many northern European countries.

Depending on the culture and the purpose of the listing, only the highest degree, a selection of degrees, or all degrees might be listed. The awarding institution may be shown and it might be specified if a degree was at honours level, particularly where the honours degree is a separate qualification from the ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree.

For member institutions of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, there is a standard list of abbreviations for university names given in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook. In practice, many variations are used and the Yearbook notes that the abbreviations used may not match those used by the universities concerned. For some British universities it is traditional to use Latin abbreviations, notably &#x27;Oxon&#x27; and &#x27;Cantab&#x27; for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge respectively, in spite of these having been superseded by English &#x27;Oxf&#x27; and &#x27;Camb&#x27; in official university usage, particularly in order to distinguish the Oxbridge MA from an earned MA. Other Latin abbreviations commonly used include &#x27;Cantuar&#x27; for Lambeth degrees (awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury), &#x27;Dunelm&#x27; for Durham University, &#x27;Ebor&#x27; for the University of York and &#x27;Exon&#x27; for the University of Exeter. The Ancient universities of Scotland and the University of London have abbreviations that are the same in English and Latin. (See for a more complete list and discussion of abbreviations for British universities.)

Confusion can result from universities sharing similar names, e.g. the University of York in the UK and York University in Canada or Newcastle University in the UK and the University of Newcastle in Australia. In this case, the convention is to include a country abbreviation with the university&#x27;s name. For example, &#x27;York (Can.)&#x27; and &#x27;York (UK)&#x27; or &#x27;Newc (UK)&#x27; and &#x27;Newc (Aus.) are commonly used to denote degrees conferred by these universities where the potential for confusion exists, and institution names are given in this form in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook.

Abbreviations used for degrees vary between countries and institutions, e.g. MS indicates Master of Science in the US and places following American usage, but Master of Surgery in the UK and most Commonwealth countries, where the standard abbreviation for Master of Science is MSc. Common abbreviations include BA and MA for Bachelor and Master of Arts, BS/BSc and MS/MSc for Bachelor and Master of Science, MD for Doctor of Medicine and PhD for Doctor of Philosophy.

== Online degree ==
An online degree is an academic degree (usually a college degree, but sometimes the term includes high school diplomas and non-degree certificate programs) that can be earned primarily or entirely on a distance learning basis through the use of an Internet-connected computer, rather than attending college in a traditional campus setting. Improvements in technology, the increasing use of the Internet worldwide, and the need for people to have flexible school schedules that enable them to work while attending school have led to a proliferation of online colleges that award associate&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

== Degree systems by regions ==
=== Asia ===

==== Bangladesh, India and Pakistan ====
Bangladesh and India mostly follow the colonial era British system for the classification of degrees, however, Pakistan has recently switched to the US model of a two-year associate degree and a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program. The arts, referring to the performing arts and literature, may confer a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Master of Arts (MA). Management degrees are also classified under &#x27;arts&#x27; but are nowadays considered a separate stream, with degrees of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and Master of Business Administration (MBA). Science refers to the basic sciences and natural science (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, etc.); the corresponding degrees are Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Master of Science (MSc).

Information Technology degrees are conferred specially in the field of computer science, and include Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc.IT.) and Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc.IT.). The engineering degree in India follows two nomenclatures, Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.). Both represent bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering. In Pakistan, engineering degrees are Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) and Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S./B.Sc. Engineering). Both are the same in curriculum, duration and pattern, and differ only in nomenclature. The engineering degree in Bangladesh is a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc. Engineering). Other degrees include the medical degree (Bachelor of Medicine &amp; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)), dental degree (Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS)) and computer application degrees (Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA)) and Master of Computer Application (MCA).

==== Indonesia ====
Indonesia follows the colonial Dutch system for the classification of degrees. However, Indonesia has been dropping the Dutch titles and developing its own distinctions.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sri Lanka, like many other commonwealth countries, follows the British system, but with its own distinctions. Degrees are approved by the University Grants Commission.

=== Africa ===

==== Tunisia ====
Tunisia&#x27;s educational grading system, ranging from elementary school to Ph.D. programs, operates on a scale of 0 to 20. The minimum score for passing is set at 10 out of 20. This numerical system exclusively evaluates a student&#x27;s academic accomplishments, serving as the determinant for admission into advanced programs. For instance, a student&#x27;s grades obtained for their bachelor&#x27;s degree are considered when they apply for a Master&#x27;s program. Level 4 courses, which include the first year of a Bachelor&#x27;s program or a Higher National Certificate (HNC), may allow students to enter directly into the second year of a Bachelor&#x27;s program, provided that the course they completed is the same as the one they are applying for.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, grades (also known as &quot;marks&quot;) are presented as a percentage, with anything below 50% considered a failure. Students who receive a failing grade may have the opportunity to rewrite the exam, depending on the criteria established by their institution.

Degrees in almost any field of study can be pursued at one of the institutions in the country, with certain institutions being known for excelling in specific fields. Major fields of study across the country include Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, and Theology.

The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) has developed a credit-based system for degrees, with different levels of National Qualifications Framework (NQF) ratings corresponding to each degree level. For example, an undergraduate degree in Science is rated at NQF level 6, while an additional year of study in that discipline would result in an NQF level 8 (honours degree) rating.

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, the first undergraduate degree is pursued after students have completed four years of secondary school education and attained at least a C+ (55–59%) on the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). Students pursuing a degree in engineering, such as B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering or B.Sc. Electrical and Electronics Engineering, are required to join programs that are accredited by the Engineers Board of Kenya and the Commission for University Education. The B.Sc. degree in engineering typically takes five years to complete. A degree in medicine or surgery may take six to seven years, while a degree in education or management takes around four years.

For students pursuing a master&#x27;s degree, they must have completed an undergraduate degree and attained at least a second-class honours upper division (60–69%) or lower division plus at least two years of relevant experience. Most master&#x27;s degree programs take two years to complete. In an engineering master&#x27;s degree program, students are typically required to publish at least one scientific paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

To pursue a doctor of philosophy degree, students must have completed a relevant master&#x27;s degree. They are required to carry out a supervised scientific study for a minimum of three years and publish at least two scientific first-author papers in peer-reviewed journals relevant to their area of study.

Currently, Kenya is implementing a Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) that follows a 2–6–3–3 education system to replace the existing 8–4–4 system which allows confirmation of undergraduate degrees upon successful completion. The CBC system was introduced in 2017.

=== Europe ===

Since the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region in 1997 and the Bologna Declaration in 1999, higher education systems in Europe have been undergoing harmonisation through the Bologna Process, which is based on a three-cycle hierarchy of degrees: &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s/Licence&quot; – &quot;Master&#x27;s&quot; – &quot;Doctorate&quot;. This system is gradually replacing the two-stage system previously used in some countries and is combined with other elements such as the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the use of Diploma Supplements to make comparisons between qualifications easier.

The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) was formally established in 2010 and, as of September 2016, has 50 members. The implementation of the various elements of the EHEA varies between countries. Twenty-four countries have fully implemented a national qualifications framework, and a further ten have a framework but have not yet certified it against the overarching framework. In 38 countries, ECTS credits are used for all higher education programmes, and 31 countries have fully implemented diploma supplements. Only 11 countries have included all the major points of the Lisbon Recognition Convention in national legislation.

Since 2008, the European Union has been developing the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). This is an eight-level framework designed to allow cross-referencing of the various national qualifications frameworks. While it is not specific to higher education, the top four levels (5–8) correspond to the short cycle, first cycle, second cycle, and third cycle of the EHEA.

==== Austria ====
In Austria, there are currently two parallel systems of academic degrees:
* the traditional two-cycle system of Magister/Diplom followed by the Doctorate, and
* the three cycle system of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate as defined by the Bologna process.

The two-cycle degree system was phased out by 2010, with a few exceptions. However, some of the established degree naming has been preserved, allowing universities to award the &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot; (and for a while also the &quot;Magister&quot;) to graduates of the new-style Master programmes.

==== Belgium ====
While higher education is regulated by the three communities of Belgium, all have common and comparable systems of degrees that were adapted to the Bologna structure during the 2000s. The primary 3-cycle structure is called BMD (Bachelor-Master-Doctorate; or ).

In the first cycle, the Bachelor&#x27;s degree is issued after 180 ECTS (3 years, EQF level 6). Other first cycle degrees include the one-year degree (; ) and the Brevet (in the French-speaking Community only) for short-cycle higher education programmes.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees are followed in the second cycle (EQF level 7) by that last two years, completing an extra 120 ECTS credits. The master&#x27;s degree can be followed by an (; ) that lasts one year (60 ECTS).

The third cycle of Belgium&#x27;s higher education is covered by the degree (; ) that covers a 3-to-7-year-long PhD, depending on whether the doctoral student has teaching responsibilities in addition to conducting research or not (typically 6 years for teaching assistants and 4 years for research-only mandates).

==== Czech Republic ====
The Czech Republic has implemented the Bologna process, and functionally has three degrees: Bachelor (3 years), Master (2 years after Bachelor) and Doctor (4 years after Master).

The Czech Republic also has voluntary academic titles called &quot;small doctorates&quot; (e.g. RNDr. for natural sciences, PhDr. for philosophy, JUDr. for law etc.) which are achieved after passing an additional exam. Medical students do not get bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees, but instead attend a six year program and obligatory exam they achieve the title MUDr. , or MDDr. for dentists and MVDr. for veterinary physicians. They can also get a &quot;big doctorate&quot; (Ph.D.) after another three or four years of study.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees and small doctorates in the form of letters (Bc., Mgr., Ing., ...) are listed before the person&#x27;s name, and Doctor&#x27;s degrees (Ph.D.) are listed after name (e.g. MUDr. Jan Novák, Ph.D.). The Czech Republic previously had more degrees that were awarded.

==== Denmark ====
Before the adoption of the Bologna Process, the lowest degree that would normally be studied at universities in Denmark was equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree (&quot;kandidatgrad&quot;). Officially, a bachelor&#x27;s degree was always obtained after 3 years&#x27; university studies.

Various medium-length (2–4 years) professional degrees have been adopted, so they now have status as professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees of varying length. As opposed to academic bachelor&#x27;s degrees, they are considered to be &quot;applied&quot; degrees. A professional bachelor&#x27;s degree is 180, 210, or 240 ECTS-points.

The academic degrees available at universities are:
* &quot;bachelor i &lt;field of study&gt;&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree = 180 ECTS-points)
* &quot;cand. &lt;Latin abbreviation of field of study&gt;&quot; (master&#x27;s degree = 120 ECTS-points, except Medicine, which is 180 ECTS-points and Veterinary Medicine, which is 150 ECTS-points)
* &quot;ph.d.&quot; (PhD degree = normally 180 ECTS-points)
* &quot;dr. &lt;Latin abbreviation of field of study&gt;&quot; (higher doctoral degree = normally after a minimum of 5 years of individual and original research)

==== Finland ====
Historically, the Finnish higher education system is derived from the German system. The current system of higher education comprises two types of higher education institutions, the universities and the polytechnics, many of whom refer to themselves as universities of applied sciences (UAS). With the exception of a few fields, such as medicine and dentistry, the Finnish system of higher education degrees is in compliance with the Bologna process. Universities award bachelor&#x27;s degrees (&quot;kandidaatti / kandidat&quot;), Master&#x27;s degrees (&quot;maisteri / magister&quot;) and doctoral degrees (&quot;lisensiaatin tutkinto / licentiat examen&quot; and &quot;tohtorin tutkinto / doktorexamen&quot;). In most fields, the system of doctoral degrees is two-tier, the degree of licentiate is an independent academic degree but completing the degree of doctor does not require completion of a licentiate degree. The polytechnics (universities of applied sciences) have the right to award bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees; the degree titles are distinct from the titles used for university degrees.

In general, students who are admitted to bachelor studies at a university have the right to continue to studies at master level. At polytechnics, the right to continue to master-level studies has to be applied for separately and there is also a work experience requirement. The majority of master&#x27;s degree holders have graduated from university.

The degrees awarded by the universities and polytechnics are at par by law, but the content and orientation of studies is different. A master&#x27;s degree obtained at a polytechnic gives the same academic right to continue studies at doctoral level as a master&#x27;s degree obtained at a university.

==== France ====
The French national education system makes a distinction between a &quot;diplôme national&quot; (&quot;national degree&quot;) and &quot;diplôme universitaire&quot; (&quot;university degree&quot;). The former, which are considered to have a higher status, are controlled by the state and issued by universities on behalf of the responsible ministry; the latter are controlled and granted by the universities themselves. Additionally, private universities and schools may be recognised by the state with a &quot;diplôme visé&quot; (&quot;recognised degree&quot;) and then, after five years of recognition, have their degrees validated by the state, the validation having to be renewed every six years.

Historically, academic degrees were orientated towards research, and the vocational education system awarded only diplomas. Since the implementation of the Bologna Process in France, the degree-granting system is being simplified: schools continue to grant their own diplomas, but the state&#x27;s recognition in degree awarding is more important than before.

Diploma courses such as the university Bachelor of Technical Studies (&quot;bachelor universitaire de technologie&quot;; BUT) are recognised as vocational bachelor&#x27;s degree qualifications worth 180 ECTS credits; the Advanced Technician Certificate (&quot;brevet de technician supérieur&quot;; BTS) is now recognised as a &quot;short cycle&quot; qualification worth 120 ECTS credits, allowing progression from these to academic qualifications. However, in France there are diplomas that are not recognised as degrees, such as specific diplomas designed by colleges (&quot;écoles supérieures&quot;), like the &quot;mastère spécialisé&quot; (accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; but not automatically by the French Government). Since 2002, &quot;grande école&quot; diplomas have been able to award a university degree, such as the Sciences Po &quot;Bachelor&quot;, which is a state-accredited diploma that awards a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licence&quot; in French).

The recognised degrees are in three levels, following the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. These are the &quot;licence&quot; (first level), &quot;master&quot; (second level) and &quot;doctorat&quot; (third level). All licence degrees take 3 years (180 ECTS credits) and all master&#x27;s degrees take 2 years (120 ECTS credits). There are also 5-year (300 ECTS credits) engineer&#x27;s degrees, which are master&#x27;s degrees. In addition to the doctorate, which is always a research degree, the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Etat de docteur en médicine&quot; and the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Etat de docteur vétérinaire&quot; are third level qualifications and recognized as level 7 in EQF.

==== Germany ====
Traditionally in Germany, students graduated after four-to-six years either with a &quot;Magister&quot; degree in social sciences, humanities, linguistics or the arts, or with a &quot;Diplom&quot; degree in the natural sciences, economics, business administration, political science, sociology, theology or engineering. Those degrees were the first, and at the same time highest, non-PhD/Doctorate-titles in many disciplines before their gradual replacement by other Anglo-Saxon-inspired master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees under the Bologna process. The &quot;Magister&quot; and &quot;Diplom&quot; awarded by universities, both of which require a final thesis, are considered equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree, although the &quot;Diplom&quot; awarded by a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; (university of applied sciences) is at bachelor&#x27;s degree level.

A special kind of examination is the &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; (State Examination). It is not an academic degree but a government licensing examination that future doctors, dentists, teachers, lawyers (solicitors), judges, public prosecutors, patent attorneys and pharmacists have to pass in order to be eligible to work in their profession. Students usually study at university for three to six years, depending on the field, before they take the first Staatsexamen. While this is normally at the master&#x27;s level, a few courses (e.g. primary and lower secondary level teaching), which have a standard study period of three years, are assigned to the bachelor&#x27;s level. After the first Staatsexamen, teachers and lawyers go through a form of pupillage, the &quot;Vorbereitungsdienst&quot;, for two years, before they are able to take the second Staatsexamen, which tests their practical abilities in their jobs. At some institutions pharmacists and jurists can choose whether to be awarded the first Staatsexamen or a master&#x27;s degree (or formerly the &quot;Diplom&quot;).

Since 1999, the traditional degrees have been replaced by bachelor&#x27;s (&quot;Bachelor&quot;) and master&#x27;s (&quot;Master&quot;) degrees as part of the Bologna process. The main reasons for this change are to make degrees internationally comparable and to introduce degrees to the German system that take less time to complete (German students typically took five years or more to earn a &quot;Magister&quot; or &quot;Diplom&quot;). Some universities were initially resistant to this change, considering it a displacement of a venerable tradition for the pure sake of globalization. However, universities had to fulfill the new standard by the end of 2007. Enrollment into &quot;Diplom&quot; and &quot;Magister&quot; programs is no longer possible at most universities, with a few exceptions. Programs leading to &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; did not usually make the transition to Bologna degrees.

Doctorates are issued with various designations, depending on the faculty: e.g., Doktor der Naturwissenschaften (Doctor of Natural Science); Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften (Doctor of Law); Doktor der Medizin (Doctor of Medicine); Doktor der Philosophie (Doctor of Philosophy), to name just a few. Multiple doctorates and honorary doctorates are often listed, and even used in forms of address, in German-speaking countries. A Diplom, Magister, Master&#x27;s or Staatsexamen student can proceed to a doctorate. Well-qualified bachelor&#x27;s graduates can also enrol directly into PhD programs after a procedure to determine their aptitude is administered by the admitting university. The doctoral degree—such as Dr. rer. nat., Dr. phil. and others—is the highest academic degree in Germany and is generally a research degree. The degree &quot;Dr. med.&quot; for medical doctors has to be viewed differently; medical students usually write their doctoral theses right after they have completed studies, without any previously conducted scientific research, just as students in other disciplines write a &quot;Diplom&quot;, &quot;Magister&quot; or &quot;Master&#x27;s&quot; thesis. Higher doctorates, such as the D.Sc. degree in the UK, are not present in the German system.

However, sometimes incorrectly regarded as a degree, the Habilitation is a higher academic qualification—in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic—that grants a further teaching and research endorsement after a doctorate. It is earned by writing a second thesis (the &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;) or presenting a portfolio of first-author publications on an advanced topic. The exact requirements for satisfying a Habilitation depend on individual universities. The &quot;habil.&quot;, as it is abbreviated, to indicate that a habilitation has been awarded after the doctorate, was traditionally the conventional qualification for serving at least as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (e.g. &quot;PD Dr. habil.&quot;) (senior lecturer) in an academic professorship. Some German universities no longer require the Habilitation, although preference may still be given to applicants who have this credential in securing academic posts in the more traditional fields.

==== Greece====
In Greece access to university is possible after national exams (Panhellenic Exams). 
The Greek academic degrees are:
* Ptychio (EQL Level 6 or bachelor&#x27;s degree)
* Diploma (EQL Level 7 or Integrated master&#x27;s degree)
* Metaptychiako Diploma Eidikefsis (EQL Level 7 or master&#x27;s degree)
* Didaktoriko Diploma (EQL Level 8 or Doctorate)

==== Ireland ====
Ireland operates under a National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The school-leaving qualification attained by students is called the Leaving Certificate. It is considered as Level 4–5 in the framework. This qualification is the traditional route of entry into third-level education. There are also Level 5 qualifications in certain vocational subjects (e.g. Level 5 Certificate in Restaurant Operations) awarded by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC). Advanced Certificates at Level 6 are also awarded by FETAC.

The Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) awards the following: A higher certificate at Level 6; An ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree at Level 7; An honours bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher diploma at Level 8; A master&#x27;s degree or postgraduate diploma at Level 9; A doctoral degree or higher doctorate at Level 10. These are completed in institutes of technology or universities.

==== Italy ====
In Italy access to university is possible after gaining the &quot;Diploma di Maturità&quot; at 19 years of age, following 5 years of study in a specific high school focused on certain subjects (e.g. &quot;liceo classico&quot; focused on classical subjects, including philosophy, ancient Greek and Latin; &quot;liceo scientifico&quot; focused on scientific subjects such as maths, chemistry, biology and physics but also including philosophy, ancient Latin and Italian literature; &quot;liceo linguistico&quot; focused on foreign languages and literature; &quot;istituto tecnico&quot; focused on practical and theoretical subjects such as mechanics, aerospace, shipbuilding, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, chemistry, biology, fashion industry, food industry, building technology, law and economics). After gaining the diploma one can enter university and enrol in any curriculum (e.g. physics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, architecture): all high school diplomas allow access to any university curriculum, although most universities have pre-admission tests.

In 2011, Italy introduced a qualifications framework, known as the &quot;Quadro dei Titoli Italiani&quot; (QTI), which tied together, in a three-level system, both the new qualifications introduced as part of the Bologna Process and the older, pre-Bologna qualifications and which covers qualifications from university institutions and higher-education institutions for fine arts, music and dance (AFAM institutions). In addition to academic degrees, many professional qualifications are tied to the QTI at the different levels.

The first level, tied to the first cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the &quot;laurea&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree) in universities and the &quot;Diploma accademico di primo livello&quot; in AFAM institutions. The older qualifications that map to this level are the &quot;Diploma universitario&quot; and the &quot;Diploma di scuole dirette a fini speciali (SDAFS)&quot; from universities, and the &quot;Diploma di Conservatorio&quot;, &quot;Diploma di Istituto Musicale Pareggiato&quot;, &quot;Diploma dell&#x27;Accademia di Belle Arti&quot;, &quot;Diploma dell&#x27;Istituto Superiore delle Industrie Artistiche (ISIA)&quot;, &quot;Diploma dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Danza&quot; and &quot;Diploma dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica&quot; from AFAM institutions. The &quot;laurea&quot; is obtained after three years of study (180 ECTS credits) and confers the academic title of &quot;dottore&quot;; the older university qualifications at this level took two to three years, with the three-year courses conferring the title of &quot;dottore&quot;.

The second level, tied to the second cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; and the &quot;laurea specialistica&quot; of university institutions, and the &quot;Diploma accademico di secondo livello&quot; of AFAM institutions. The old &quot;Diploma di laurea&quot; is mapped to this level. The &quot;Laurea magistrale&quot; and the &quot;laurea specialistica&quot; are obtained after two further years of study (120 ECTS credits) and give the academic title of &quot;dottore magistrale&quot;. The old &quot;Diploma di laurea&quot; took four to six years but was accessed directly from school, with a possible reduction by one year for those with a related &quot;diploma&quot; and also granted the title of &quot;dottore magistrale&quot;.

The third level, tied to the third cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the &quot;Dottorato di ricerca&quot; from university institutions and the &quot;Diploma accademico di formazione alla ricerca&quot; from AFAM institutions. The old &quot;Dottorato di ricerca&quot; and &quot;Diploma di specializzazione&quot; are tied to this level. The &quot;Dottorato di ricerca&quot;, under both new and old systems, takes a minimum of three years after the &quot;laurea magistralie/specialistica&quot;, and gives the academic titles of &quot;Dottore di Ricerca (Dott. Ric.)&quot; and PhD. The old &quot;Diploma di specializzazione&quot; took two to six years and gave the academic title of &quot;Specialista&quot;.

Universities in Italy offer a number of other qualifications, including the &quot;Master universitario di primo livello&quot; (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 2nd cycle qualification) and the &quot;Master universitario di secondo livello&quot; (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 3rd cycle qualification), continuing from the &quot;laurea&quot; and the &quot;laurea magistrale/specialistica&quot;, respectively. These do not give access to the PhD. The &quot;Diploma di specializzazione&quot;, which is offered in a few specific professions, takes two to six years and gives the title of &quot;specialista&quot;. The &quot;Diploma di perfezionamento&quot; is a university certificate, aimed at professional training or in specific fields of study, which usually takes one year; it is not allocated a level in the framework.

AFAM institutions may offer the &quot;Diploma di perfezionamento o Master&quot; and &quot;Diploma accademico di specializzazione&quot;. These are one-year and two-year qualifications, respectively, and may be offered at the second cycle or third cycle level, distinguished by adding &quot;(I)&quot; or &quot;(II)&quot; after the qualification name. Higher schools for language mediators offer the &quot;Diploma di mediatore linguistico&quot;, a first-cycle degree that takes three years (180 ECTS credits), and which gives access to the &quot;laurea specialistica&quot;. Specialisation institutes/schools in psychoterapy offer the &quot;Diploma di specializzazione in psicoterapia&quot;, a third-cycle qualification that takes at least four years and requires a &quot;laurea magistrale/specialistica&quot; in either psychology or medicine and surgery, along with professional registration.

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, the structure of academic studies was altered significantly in 1982 when the &quot;&quot; (Two Phase Structure) was introduced by the Dutch Minister of Education, Wim Deetman. With this structure an attempt was made to standardise all the different studies and to have them conform to similar timetables. An additional effect was that students would be forced to produce results within a preset time-frame or otherwise discontinue their studies. The two-phase structure has been adapted to a bachelor-master structure as a result of the Bologna process.

===== Admission =====
In order for a Dutch student to get access to a university education, the student must complete a six-year pre-university secondary education called &quot;voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot; (VWO). There are other routes possible, but only if the educational level of the applicant is comparable to that at the end of the standard two levels is access to university education granted. For some studies, specific end levels or disciplines are required, e.g., graduating without having studied physics, biology and chemistry will make it impossible to study medicine. People 21 years old, or older, who do not have the required entrance diplomas, may opt for an entrance exam to be admitted to a higher-educational curriculum. In this exam, they have to prove their command of disciplines considered necessary for pursuing such study. After 1 September 2002, they would be thus admitted to a Bachelor&#x27;s curriculum, not to a Master&#x27;s curriculum.

For some disciplines in the Netherlands, a governmentally determined limited access is in place (although under political review for abolishment, as of February 2011). This limits the number of applicants to a specific course of study, thus trying to control the number of future graduates. The disciplines most renowned for their numerus clausus are medicine and dentistry. Every year a combination of the highest pre-university graduation grades and some additional conditions determine who can start such a numerus clausus course of study and who can not.

Almost all Dutch universities are government supported, with only a few privately owned universities in existence (i.e. one in business and all others in theology). Leiden University is the oldest, founded in 1575.

===== Pre-Bologna phases =====

Before the introduction of the bachelor-master structure, almost all academic studies in the Netherlands had the same length of four years and had two phases:
* &quot;The &quot;propedeutische fase&quot; (1–2 years):&quot; After finishing this phase, a student can follow another two years&#x27; study, which grants equivalents to the Anglo-Saxon BSc (Bachelor of Science), BA (Bachelor of Arts) or LLB (Bachelor of Laws).
* &quot;The &quot;doctorale fase&quot; (3–4 years):&quot; Completing the first phase successfully gives the student access to the second phase. Again, failure to finish within the time given will lead to discontinuation. This phase is concluded with the &quot;&quot; (doctoral exam). This is not similar to any type of doctoral exam that would grant the student with any type of PhD title. Successful completion, however, does grant the student the Dutch degree of &quot;drs.&quot; &quot;doctorandus&quot;, ir. (&quot;ingenieur&quot; – engineer) or &quot;mr.&quot; (&quot;Meester in de rechten&quot; – master of law). Nowadays these Dutch titles have been largely replaced by the Anglo Saxon titles MSc (Master of Science), MA (Master of Arts) and LLM (Master of Laws), depending on the area of study.

For medical students the &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree is not equivalent to the European Anglo Saxon postgraduate research degree in medicine, of MD (Medical Doctor). Besides the title doctorandus, the graduates of the Curius curriculum may also bear the title &quot;arts&quot; (physician). The doctorandus in medicine title is granted after four years (nominal time) of the Curius curriculum, while the title physician is granted after six years (nominal time) of that curriculum. The Dutch physician title is equal to a MSc degree according to the Bologna process and can be compared with the MBBS in the UK degree system and the North American MD, but not the UK MD degree, which is a research degree. One-on-one equivalence or interchangeability of the Dutch medical title and MD is often suggested. However, officially the MD title is not known, nor legal to use, in the Netherlands. The correct notation for a Dutch physician who completed his or her medical studies, but did not pursue a doctoral (PhD-like) study is &quot;drs.&quot; (e.g. &quot;drs. Jansen, arts&quot;) and not &quot;dr.&quot; in medicine, which is often used incorrectly. However, like in the United Kingdom, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as &#x27;Doctor&#x27; by courtesy.

In the Netherlands, there is the informal title &quot;dokter&quot; for physicians, but not &quot;doctor&quot; (dr.), unless they also earn such adegree by completing a PhD curriculum. Furthermore, the &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree does not give a medical student the right to treat patients; for this a minimum of two years of additional study (internship) is required. After obtaining a Medical Board registration, Dutch physicians must work an additional two to six years in a field of expertise to become a registered medical specialist. Dutch surgeons commonly are only granted access to surgical training and positions after obtaining a doctorate (PhD) successfully. In recent years, the six-year (nominal time) old Curius curriculum (which offered the titles doctorandus and physician) has been replaced with a three-year (nominal time) Bachelor Curius+ followed by a three-year (nominal time) Master Curius+. Those who had already begun their old-style Curius curriculum before that will still have to complete it as a six-year study (nominal time).

A doctorandus in law uses the title &quot;meester&quot; (master, abbreviated as &quot;mr. Jansen&quot;) instead of drs., and some courses of study, such as in technology and agriculture&lt; grant the title &quot;ingenieur&quot; (engineer, noted as &quot;ir. Jansen&quot;) instead of drs. These titles as equivalent to an LL.M (the title mr.) and to a MSc (the title ir.) and if gotten before 1 September 2002, from a recognized Dutch university, may be rendered as M (from Master) behind one&#x27;s name, instead of using the typical Dutch honorifics before one&#x27;s name. Since 1 September 2002, Dutch universities offer specific BSc, BA or LLB studies followed by MSc, MA or LLM studies, thus integrating into the international scientific community, offering lectures, other classes, seminars or complete curricula in English instead of Dutch. According to their field of study, MSc graduates may use either ir. or drs. before their names; MA graduates may use drs. before their name; LLM graduates may use mr. before their names, but only if they received such degrees from recognized Dutch universities. Not uncommonly, the Dutch &quot;drs.&quot; abbreviation can cause much confusion in other countries, since it is perceived as a person who has a PhD in multiple disciplines. In the Netherlands, the degree MPhil was not awarded after 2009 as the Universiteiten van Nederland refused to recognize the MPhils awarded by Leiden University.

After successfully obtaining a &quot;drs.&quot;, &quot;ir.&quot; or &quot;mr.&quot; degree, a student has the opportunity to follow a further, promotional course of study (informally called PhD) to eventually obtain a doctorate and subsequently the title &quot;doctor&quot;. Promotion studies are ideally structured according to a preset time schedule of 4 to 6 years, during which the student has to be mentored by at least one professor. The promotion study has to be concluded with at least a scientific thesis, which has to be defended to &quot;a gathering of his/her peers&quot;, in practice the board of the faculty with guest professors from other faculties or universities added. More and more common—and, in some disciplines, even mandatory—is that the student write, and have accepted for publication by peer-reviewed journals, original scientific work. The number of publications required is often debated and varies considerably between the various disciplines. However, in all disciplines the student is obligated to produce and publish a dissertation or thesis in book form.

===== Bachelor/master structure =====
All current Dutch academic programs are offered under the Anglo-Saxon bachelor/master structure. It takes three years to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree and another one or two years to earn a master&#x27;s degree. There are three official academic bachelor titles (BA, BSc and LLB) and three official master titles (MA, MSc and LLM). These academic titles are protected by the Dutch government.

===== Using academic titles =====
After obtaining a doctorate, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D following, their name, but not both simultaneously. There is no notation signifying the specific discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. As of 1 January 2021, the title &#x27;PhD&#x27; and post-nominal degree &#x27;PhD&#x27; can also be used, and these are also legally protected. Stacking of titles, as seen in countries such as Germany (Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. Gruber), is highly uncommon in the Netherlands and not well received culturally. Those who have multiple doctoral titles may use dr.mult. before their name, but this is seldom seen in practice. The &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctors may use dr.h.c. before their name. Combining different Dutch titles, especially in different disciplines, is allowed, however, (e.g. mr. dr. Jansen, dr. mr. Jansen, dr. ir. Jansen, mr. ir. drs. Jansen, mr. ir. Jansen). The use of the combination ir. ing. is frequent, indicating one holds a HBO, vocational, or professional engineering degree, together with an academic engineering degree. What is not allowed is, after obtaining a doctorate, using dr. drs. Jansen; dr. Jansen should be used instead. A combination of a Dutch title with an international title is not allowed, except for some limited number of international professional titles. Thus, one should choose either one&#x27;s classical Dutch title or use the shortcut provided by the law following one&#x27;s name (since 1 September 2002 it is the other way around: those who hold Dutch degrees as MSc, LLM or MA may optionally use the old-style shortcuts before their names).

&quot;Doctors&quot; (dr.) can proceed to teach at universities as &quot; (UD – assistant professor). With time, experience and achievement, this can evolve to a position as &quot; (UHD – associate professor). Officially an UHD still works under the supervision of a &quot;&quot; (professor), the head of the department. However, this is not a given; it is also possible that a department is headed by a &quot;plain&quot; doctor, based on knowledge, achievement and expertise. The position of &quot;hoogleraar&quot; is the highest possible scientific position at a university and equivalent to the US &quot;full&quot; professor. The Dutch professor&#x27;s title, noted as &quot;prof. Jansen&quot; or &quot;professor Jansen&quot;, is connected to one&#x27;s employment. This means that, should the professor leave the university, he or she also loses the privilege to use the title of professor. Retired professors are an exception and may continue to note the title in front of their name, or use the title emeritus professor (em. prof.). People who switch to a non-university job lose their professorial title and are only allowed to use the &quot;dr.&quot; abbreviation.

Unlike some other European countries, such as Germany, Dutch academic titles are used rarely outside academia, hold no value in everyday life, and typically are not listed on official documentation (e.g. passport, drivers license, (governmental) communication). Dutch academic titles, however, are legally protected and can only be used by graduates from Dutch institutions of higher education. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and is subject to legal prosecution. Holders of foreign degrees, therefore, need special permission before being able to use a recognised Dutch title, but they are free to use their own foreign title (untranslated). In practice, the Public Department does not prosecute the illegal use of a protected title (the Netherlands applies prosecutorial discretion, so some known criminal uses are not prosecuted).

==== Norway ====
Prior to 1980, there were around 50 different degrees and corresponding educational programs within the Norwegian higher education system. 
Degrees had titles that included the gender based Latin term &quot;candidatus/candidata&quot;. The second part of the title usually consisted of a Latin word corresponding to the profession or training. For example, Cand. Mag. (Candidatus Magisterii) required 4 to 5 years, Cand. Real. (Candidatus Realium) required 6 years of study and a scientific thesis in a select set of scientific disciplines (realia). Over the years these were replaced gradually with degrees that were more and more internationally comparable programs and corresponding titles. For example, the degree Cand. Scient. replaced Cand. Real. in the period 1985 to 2003. These degrees were all retired in 2003 in favour of an international system.

The reform of higher education in Norway, &quot;Kvalitetsreformen&quot; (&quot;The Quality Reform&quot;), was passed in the Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, in 2001 and carried out during the 2003/2004 academic year. It introduced standard periods of study and the titles &quot;master&quot; and &quot;bachelor (baccalaureus)&quot;. The system differentiates between a free master&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree in technology. The latter corresponds to the former &quot;sivilingeniør&quot; degree (not to be confused with a degree in civil engineering, which is but one of many degrees linked to the title &quot;sivilingeniør&quot;, which is still in use for new graduates who can choose to also use the old title). All pre-2001 doctoral degree titles were replaced with the title &quot;Philosophical Doctor degree&quot;, written &quot;philosophiæ doctor&quot; (instead of the traditional &quot;doctor philosophiæ&quot;). The title dr. philos. is a substantially higher degree than the PhD and is reserved for those who qualify for such a degree without participating in an organized doctoral degree program.

==== Poland ====
In Poland, the system is similar to the German one.
* &quot; title – given by a university; the equivalent of Bachelor of Arts degree or Bachelor of Science degree (depending on academic major); granted after at least 3 years of study.
* &quot; () title – Engineer&#x27;s degree given by a technical university; granted after at least about 3.5 years of study.
* &quot; () title – the equivalent of a Master of Arts or Master of Science degree, granted after 5–6 years of study or 2 years of additional study by holders of a bachelor&#x27;s degree with classification of Honours Degree.
* &quot; () title – the equivalent of a Master of Engineering, granted after about 2 years of additional study by holders of a degree of Bachelor of Engineering.
* &quot; () degree – the equivalent of Doctor of Philosophy.
* &quot; () degree – Polish Habilitation degree, requires approval by an external ministerial body.
* &quot;&quot; () degree – the highest title, officially conferred by the president of Poland.

==== Russia, Ukraine and some other former USSR republics ====
Since 1992, Russian higher education has introduced a multilevel system, enabling higher education institutions to award and issue Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees.

In Russia, Ukraine and some other former USSR republics educational degrees are awarded after finishing a college education. There are several levels of education that one must choose in the 2nd and 3rd year of college, usually in the 3rd year of study.

# A bachelor&#x27;s degree usually takes 4 years of college (minimum level to be recognized as having a higher education).
# A specialist degree is awarded after 5 years of college (4 + 1).
# A Master&#x27;s (Magister) degree is awarded after 6 years of college (4 + 2).

But a Specialist degree can appear equivalent to Magister degree by reason of taking an equivalent amount of time. Usually Specialist or Magister degrees incorporate the bachelor&#x27;s degrees in them, but only the high-level degree is given on the final diploma. Specialist and Magister degrees require taking final state exams and producing written work on practical application of studied skills or research thesis (usually 70–100 pages) and is roughly equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree.

The first-level academic degree is called &quot;Kandidat nauk&quot; (&quot;Candidate of Sciences&quot;). This degree requires extensive research, taking some classes, publications in peer-reviewed academic journals (not less than 5 publications in Ukraine or 3 publications in Russia), taking 3 or more exams (one or more in their speciality, one in a foreign language and one in the history and philosophy of science) and writing and defending an in-depth thesis (80–200 pages) called a &quot;dissertation&quot;.

Finally, there is a &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; (&quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot;) degree in Russia and some former USSR academic environments. This degree is granted for contributions in a certain field (formally – who established new direction or new field in science). It requires discovery of new phenomenon or development of new theory or essential development of new direction, etc. There is no equivalent of this &quot;doctor of sciences&quot; degree in the US academic system. It is roughly equivalent to Habilitation in Germany, France, Austria and some other European countries.

In countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees, the degree of &quot;Kandidat Nauk&quot; should be considered for recognition at the level of the first doctoral degree. According to &quot;Guidelines for the recognition of Russian qualifications in the other countries&quot;, in countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees, the degree of &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; should be considered for recognition at the level of the second doctoral degree. In countries in which only one doctoral degree exists, the degree of &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; should be considered for recognition at the level of this degree.

According to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) UNESCO 2011, par.262, for purposes of international educational statistics:

# DPhil to &quot;Kandidat Nauk/Philosophy&quot;;
# D.Lit. to &quot;Kandidat Nauk in Literature&quot;;
# D.Sc. to &quot;Kandidat Nauk of Natural Science&quot;;
# LL.D. to &quot;Kandidat Nauk of Legal Science&quot;.

==== Spain ====
Spain&#x27;s higher-education legal framework includes official and accredited education, as well as non-official education.

1.1 Official and accredited education

In Spain, accreditation of official university study programmes is regulated by law and monitored by governmental agencies responsible for verifying their quality and suitability for official approval and accreditation.

Official professional study programmes lead to degree qualifications (&quot;Títulos&quot;) with full academic and professional rights. The degrees awarded in accordance with the latest higher-education system are:

1. Bachelor&#x27;s Degree (&quot;Grado&quot;) – 240 ECTS Credits in 4 years.

2. Master&#x27;s Degree (&quot;Master Universitario&quot;) – 60 to 120 ECTS Credits in 1–2 years.

3. Doctoral degree PhD (&quot;Doctorado&quot;) – in 3–4 years.

Accredited bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees qualifications will always be described as &quot;Grado&quot; and &quot;Master Universitario&quot;. These qualifications comply with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) framework. Officially approved and accredited university study programmes by law must implement this framework in order to attain and retain accreditation in Spain.

1.2 Non-official education

Not all EHEA-compliant study programmes in Spain are officially approved or accredited by government agencies. Some universities offer proprietary study programmes as alternatives for a variety of reasons: serving the continuing education market for individual self-advancement and also providing higher education to individuals who have failed to acquire bachelor&#x27;s degree qualifications. The main reason for offering these alternative studies, though, is the complex bureaucratic process required to receive the approval of specific titles, in particular when it refers to new studies or studies about matters that do not fit with the official studies. For historical reasons, the academic system has been very much under the control of the state, and private universities are still regarded with as a threat to the state system.

These programmes fall within the category of &quot;non officially approved and accredited&quot; or &quot;estudios no oficiales&quot;, and they confer no academic or professional rights. This means that they do not entitle the bearer to claim to have any specific academic or professional qualifications, as far as the Spanish authorities are concerned. However, there may be private agreements to recognize the titles.

Universities offering non-official study programmes are legally bound to clearly differentiate between officially-approved and non-officially-approved qualifications. Non-accredited master&#x27;s degrees will be described as just &quot;Master&quot;, without the accompanying &quot;Universitario&quot;.

Certain non-officially approved and accredited study programmes may acquire a positive reputation. However, neither professional associations, government agencies, judiciary authorities, nor universities – other than the study programme provider – are obliged to recognize non-official qualifications in any way.

2. Accreditation system

University-taught study programme accreditation is granted through the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA), a government-dependent quality assurance and accreditation provider for the Spanish higher education system that ensures that the data held in the Register of Universities, Centres and Qualifications (RUCT), a national registry for universities and qualifications, is correct and up to date. All study programmes must be accredited by ANECA prior to their inclusion in the RUCT. The RUCT records all officially approved universities and their bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees and PhDs and each and every one of the officially approved and accredited study programmes. Universities are assigned a specific number Code (&quot;Código&quot;) by the RUCT. The same study programme may acquire different codes as it progresses through various stages of official approval by local and central governments.

Prospective students should check the RUCT Code awarded to the study programme of their interest at every stage of their enquiries concerning degrees in Spain.

ANECA makes recommendations regarding procedures, staffing levels, quality of teaching, resources available to students and continuity or loss of accreditation. The ANECA Registry records all events in the life of an officially approved and accredited study programme or a university. The ANECA Registry Search Facility may be the simplest and safest way to verify the status of all officially approved and accredited study programmes in Spain.

It is also possible to track qualifications by using the search facility that several Autonomous Communities&#x27; own accreditation agencies offer. These agencies work within the ANECA framework and generally show more detailed information about the study programmes available in each territory (e.g., Catalonia, Madrid, etc.)

3. Qualifications framework for higher education

The qualifications framework for higher education MECES is the reference framework adopted in Spain in order to structure degree levels.

Not all universities offer degrees named exactly the same, even if they have similar academic and professional effects. Each university may present proposals for the study programme considered to meet professional and academic demand. The proposal will consist of a report linking the study programme being considered and the proposed qualification to be awarded. This report will be assessed by ANECA and sent for the Consejo de Universidades Españolas. If the &quot;Consejo&quot; agrees with ANECA&#x27;s approval, it will be included in the RUCT and ANECA registries.

4. Spanish qualifications and their professional effects.

All bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees accredited by ANECA bestow full academic and professional rights in accordance with new and previous laws. Professional-practice law in Spain is currently under revision.

==== Sweden ====

==== Switzerland ====
Before the Bologna Process, the academic degree of a Licentiate was reached after 4 or 5 years of study. Depending on the official language of the university, it was called &quot;Lizentiat&quot; (German), &quot;Licence&quot; (French) or &quot;licenza&quot; (Italian) and, according to the Bologna reform, is today considered equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. A Licentiate with a predefined qualification gave access to the last stage of a further two or more years of studies (depending on the field) for a doctoral degree.

Apart from this, most universities offered a postgraduate diploma requiring up to two years of study. French-speaking universities called them &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études approfondies&quot; DEA or DESS, the Italian-speaking university &quot;post laurea&quot; and German-speaking universities mostly &quot;Nachdiplomstudium&quot; (NDS). Today the federal legislation defines these postgraduate diplomas (60 ECTS credits) as Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) or Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degrees. Universities may also offer the possibility to gain a diploma in advanced studies (DAS, less than 60 ECTS credits). These degrees do not normally give access to a doctoral programme.

==== United Kingdom ====

===== England, Wales and Northern Ireland =====
An academic degree is protected under UK law. All valid UK degrees are awarded by universities or other degree-awarding bodies whose powers to do so are recognised by the UK government; hence they are known as &quot;recognised bodies&quot;.

The standard first degree in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is the bachelor&#x27;s degree conferred with honours. Usually this is a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. Other variants exist: for example, Bachelor of Education or Bachelor of Laws. It usually takes three years to read for a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The honours are usually categorised into four classes:
* First class honours (1st).
* Second class honours, divided into:
** Upper division or upper second (2:1).
** Lower division or lower second (2:2).
* Third class honours (3rd).

Candidates who have not achieved the standard for the award of honours may be admitted without honours to the &quot;ordinary&quot; bachelor&#x27;s degree if they have met the required standard for this lesser qualification (also referred to as a &quot;pass degree&quot;). Standard levels for each of these classes are 70%+ for a first, 60–69% for a 2:1, 50–59% for a 2:2, 40–49% for a 3rd and 30%+ for a pass degree, although this can vary by institution (e.g. the Open University).

The foundation degree is a qualification, lower than bachelor&#x27;s level, awarded following a two-year programme of study that is usually vocational in nature. The foundation degree can be awarded by a university or college of higher education that has been granted foundation-degree-awarding powers by the UK government. This degree is comparable to an associate degree in the United States.

The universities of Oxford and Cambridge award honorary Master of Arts (MA) degrees to graduates of their bachelor&#x27;s programmes, following a specified period of time. This is comparable to the practice of the ancient universities in Scotland awarding an MA for a first degree and arguably reflects the rigorous standards expected of their graduates.

Master&#x27;s degrees such as Master of Arts or Master of Science are typically awarded to students who have undertaken at least a year of full-time postgraduate study, which may require study and involve an element of research. Degrees such as Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Master of Letters/Literature (MLitt) are likely to be awarded for postgraduate study involving original research. A student undertaking a master&#x27;s would normally be expected to already hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a relevant subject, hence the possibility of reaching the master&#x27;s level in one year.

Some universities award a master&#x27;s as a first degree following an integrated programme of study (an &#x27;integrated master&#x27;s degree&#x27;). These degrees are usually designated by the subject, such as Master of Engineering for engineering, Master of Physics for physics, Master of Mathematics for mathematics and so on; it usually takes four years to read for them. Graduation to these degrees is always with honours. Master of Engineering in particular has now become the standard first degree in engineering at the top UK universities, replacing the older Bachelor of Engineering.

Master&#x27;s degrees are often graded as:

* Distinction
* Merit 
* Pass

The Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree is highly valued by those seeking to advance in business as managers and decision makers.

Doctoral degrees or doctorates, such as the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD or DPhil) or Doctor of Education (EdD or DEd), are awarded following a programme of original research that contributes new knowledge within the context of the student&#x27;s discipline. Doctoral degrees usually take three years full-time. Therefore, in the UK it may only take seven years to progress from undergraduate to earning a doctorate – in some cases six, since having a master&#x27;s is not always a precondition for embarking on a doctoral degree. This contrasts with nine years in the United States, reflecting differences in the educational systems.

Some doctorates, such as the Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) qualification, confirm competence to practice in particular professions. There are also higher doctorates – Doctor of Science (DSc) and Doctor of Letters/Literature (DLitt) — that are typically awarded to experienced academics who have demonstrated a high level of achievement in their academic career; for example, they may have published widely on their subject or become professors in their fields.

UK post-secondary qualifications are defined at different levels, with levels 1–3 denoting further education and levels 4–8 denoting higher education. Within this structure, a foundation degree is at level 5; a bachelor&#x27;s degree at level 6; a master&#x27;s degree at level 7; and a doctoral degree at level 8. Full information about the expectations for different types of UK degrees is published by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.

See also graduate certificate, graduate diploma, postgraduate certificate, postgraduate diploma and British degree abbreviations.

===== Scotland =====
The standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in Scotland is either a Bachelor of Arts or a Master of Arts (the latter traditionally awarded by the Ancient Universities of Scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject). The standard undergraduate degree for natural and social science subjects is the Bachelor of Science.

Students can work towards a first degree at either ordinary or honours level. A general or ordinary degree (BA/MA or BSc) takes three years to complete; an honours degree (BA/MA Hons or BSc Hons) takes four years. The ordinary degree need not be in a specific subject, but can involve study across a range of subjects within (and sometimes beyond) the relevant faculty, in which case it may also be called a general degree. If a third year or junior honours subject is included, the ordinary degree in that named discipline is awarded. The honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field (for example classics, history, chemistry, biology, etc.). Not all universities in Scotland adhere to this; in some, one studies in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year.

This also reflects the broader scope of the final years of Scottish secondary education, where traditionally five Highers are studied, compared to (typically) three English or Welsh A-Levels. The Higher is a one-year qualification, as opposed to the two years of A-Levels, which accounts for Scottish honours degrees being a year longer than those in England. Advanced Highers add an optional final year of secondary education, bringing students up to the level of their A-Level counterparts – students with strong A-Levels or Advanced Highers may be offered entry directly into the second year at Scottish universities.

Honours for MA or bachelor&#x27;s degrees are classified into three classes:
* First class honours
* Second class honours, divided into:
** Division one (2:1) [Upper Second Class Honours]
** Division two (2:2) [Lower Second Class Honours]
* Third class honours
Students who complete all the requirements for an honours degree, but who do not receive sufficient merit to be awarded third-class honours, may be awarded a &quot;Special Degree&quot; (ordinary degree – bachelor&#x27;s level SCQF Level 9).

In most respects, the criteria for awarding qualifications at honours level and above are the same as in the rest of the UK (see above under England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Postgraduate qualifications are not designated Master of Arts, as in the rest of the UK, as this is an undergraduate degree. Postgraduate degrees in arts and humanities subjects are usually designated Master of Letters (M.Litt.) or, in natural and social sciences, Master of Science (M.Sc.). Non-doctoral postgraduate research degrees are usually designated Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) or Master of Research (M.Res.). The postgraduate teaching qualification is the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE).

Postgraduate qualifications are classified into four classes:
* Distinction
* Credit
* Merit
* Pass

==== Canada ====

In Canada, education is the responsibility of the provinces and territories, rather than the federal government. However, all of Canada follows the three-level bachelor&#x27;s-master&#x27;s-doctorate system common to the Anglophone world, with a few variations. A common framework for degrees was agreed between the provinces and territories in 2007.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees take normally three to four years, more commonly three years in Quebec (where they follow on from college courses rather than directly from secondary education). Outside Quebec, three-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees are normally ordinary degrees, while four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees are honours degrees; an honours degree is normally needed for further study at the master&#x27;s level. Master&#x27;s degrees take one to three years (in Quebec they normally take one and a half to two years). Doctorates take a minimum of three years. Alone among Canadian provinces and territories, British Columbia offers two-year associate degrees, allowing credit to be transferred into a four-year bachelor&#x27;s program.

In Canada, first professional degrees such as DDS, MD, PharmD and LLB or JD are considered bachelor&#x27;s level qualifications, despite their often being named as if they were doctorates.

===== Quebec =====
In the province of Quebec, the majority of students must attend college prior to entering university. Upon completion of a two-year pre-university program, such as in sciences or humanities, or a three-year technical program, such as nursing or computer science, college graduates obtain a &quot;college diploma&quot;, which is a prerequisite for access to university-level studies. Although these college programs are typical, they are not offered in every institution in the province. Moreover, while a few other pre-university programs with various concentrations exist, many other technical/career programs are available, depending on the college of choice. For example, Dawson College in Montreal has nearly sixty different programs leading to a college diploma.

Special programs, such as physical rehabilitation therapy, are offered in some colleges as well. These programs allow students to enter professional university programs, such as physiotherapy (which consists of an integrated Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy and Master of Physical Therapy), without having to meet the usual grade and course prerequisites required from students holding a pre-university science diploma. A similar option is offered for college nursing graduates as they can pursue their studies in university to obtain a Bachelor of Nursing in two years (rather than the usual three or four years, depending on whether the student has completed a college diploma in Quebec). Additionally, whereas aspiring medical students are usually required to complete an undergraduate degree before applying to medical schools, Quebec college graduates have the option to enter:
* a &quot;medical preparatory&quot; year at McGill University or and then pursue medical studies for the following four years; 
* directly into the undergraduate medical education program at Université Laval (4 to 5 years in duration) or (4 years in duration).

==== Mexico ====
Education in Mexico follows a three-degree system similar to that of Canada and the US. The pre-university academic level is the &quot;bachillerato&quot; (also called &quot;preparatoria&quot;), similar to high school. Students typically leave preparatoria at the age of 18 for university, at which point they choose to specialize in a specific academic area (a &quot;carrera&quot;), such as economics, business administration, sciences, law, engineering or medicine, for 8–10 semesters of full-time study, which typically takes 4–5 years. They study for a &quot;técnico superior universitario&quot; (associate degree, only half of the &quot;licenciatura&quot;, with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor&#x27;s degree later, mainly in fields such as engineering and computer sciences), or a &quot;licenciatura&quot; (bachelor), then a &quot;maestría&quot; (master), then a &quot;doctorado&quot; (doctorate). They can also get the degree of &quot;ingenieria&quot; or &quot;medico&quot; as an engineer or MD, respectively.

After receiving the &quot;licenciatura&quot;, students may take extra courses called &quot;diplomados&quot; (similar to a certification but issued by a university). These courses last 4–12 months and are a means to further study without continuing to the next degree level, and are usually to demonstrate that students are staying up-to-date in their fields. Most students stay at this level, but some choose to continue to the &quot;maestría&quot;, equivalent to the master&#x27;s degree. Study at the &quot;maestría&quot; level takes 1–3 years and mandates completion of a thesis. Post-graduate students in Mexico typically enter a master&#x27;s program after a few years in the workforce and often continue working while studying.

Traditionally, students who have completed the &quot;maestria&quot; may continue on to the &quot;doctorado&quot; or the doctorate. Doctoral study typically lasts 3–4 years. In recent years this schemes has become flexible such that in some PhD programmes, students are accepted before, or not completing, the course of study for a master&#x27;s.

==== United States ====
In the United States, since the late 19th century, the threefold degree system of bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate has been in place but has evolved into a slightly different pattern from the European equivalent. The U.S. Department of Education now classifies degrees in six categories: associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, first professional degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, intermediate graduate qualifications and research doctorates.

The standard academic progression remains bachelor&#x27;s—master&#x27;s—(research) doctorate. Most standard &quot;academic&quot; programs are based on the four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, most often Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor of Science (B.S.), a one- or two-year master&#x27;s degree (most often Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.); either of these programs might be as long as three years in length) and a further two to five years of coursework and research, culminating in &quot;comprehensive&quot; examinations in one or more fields, plus perhaps some teaching experience and then the writing of a dissertation for the doctorate, for a total of ten or more years from starting the bachelor&#x27;s degree (which is usually begun around age 18) to the awarding of the doctorate. This timetable is only approximate, however, as students in accelerated programs can sometimes earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in three years or, on the other hand, a particular dissertation project might take four or more years to complete. In addition, a graduate may wait an indeterminate time between degrees before candidacy in the next level or even an additional degree at a level already completed. Therefore, there is no time limit on the accumulation of academic degrees.

By far the most common research doctorate is the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), comprising 98.1% of research doctorates in 2014. The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) made up 1.1% (not including Ed.D.s classified as professional degrees rather than research doctorates) and all other research doctorates were less than 1% in total.

Some schools, mostly junior colleges and community colleges and some four-year schools, offer an associate degree that takes two full years of study. These may be in professional or academic fields, and the most common awards are the Associate of Arts (A.A.) and Associate of Science (A.S.) degrees. Articulation agreements may allow credit earned on an associate degree to be counted toward the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The &quot;first professional degree&quot; is a graduate-level degree program designed to prepare graduates for professional practice in various fields other than academic scholarship and research. First professional degrees require a minimum of two years of college-level education prior to entering the program and a minimum of six years of total college-level education (including that undertaken prior to entry) to complete the program. Most professional degree programs require a prior bachelor&#x27;s degree for admission and many require seven or eight years of total study. Many first professional degrees, e.g. M.D., J.D. or D.O. are named as doctorates but should not be confused with research doctorates such as the Ph.D. (or, in law, the S.J.D.). First professional degrees should also not be confused with professional master&#x27;s degrees such as the M.Arch. and M.B.A., which are classified as master&#x27;s degrees, or with intermediate graduate qualifications that also bear the title of doctor, such as D.Min. or D.Psy.

Intermediate graduate qualifications lie between the master&#x27;s level and doctorate. They include awards such as the Certificate of Advanced Study, Graduate Diplomas, Professional Engineer status, and Professional Diplomas, as well as specialist degrees such as Education Specialist, Doctor of Ministry, Doctor of Psychology and the Licentiate in Sacred Theology.

In 21 US jurisdictions, religious institutions can be authorized to grant religious-exempt (rel. exmpt., rel. expt., etc.) degrees without accreditation or government oversight. Such degrees are used primarily to attain church-related employment.

===== Current levels of attainment of degrees =====
Traditionally, more men than women attended and earned degrees at the world&#x27;s universities. A milestone was reached in the United States, according to the 2010 census, as women surpassed men in attaining master&#x27;s degrees, for the first time. The U.S. census reports that 10.5 million men have master&#x27;s degrees or higher, compared with 10.6 million women. The first year that women surpassed men in earning bachelor&#x27;s degrees was 1996.

===== Perceptions of the value of a degree in the US =====
Students, the media, and the general public have shown much concern over the value of getting a higher degree in the US ever since the Great Recession of 2007. A 2015 survey of 2,000 adults (900 of which were graduates), implemented by the education technology company Greenwood Hall, reported that more than half of the graduates surveyed believe those getting their degree now will be receiving a lower return on their investment than their counterparts 10–15 years ago.

Media coverage of the rising costs of higher education and increased student debt have also affected the public&#x27;s perceptions of whether higher degrees are still worthwhile. Statistics citing that college graduates make around $1 million more in their lifetimes than those who did not attend college and live longer, healthier lives work in favor of those who argue the continued value of higher degrees. Studies like the 2011 Learning Gains study by Arum and Roksa, on the other hand, reported that only 55% of students had any learning gains during their first two years of college, which favors the argument that investing in higher education may not still be worth it.

==== Australia ====
The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) covers 10 levels, of which levels 6–10 correspond to academic degrees. These are: the &quot;associate degree&quot; (level 6), which normally takes 2 years; the &quot;bachelor degree&quot; (level 7), which normally takes 3 years; the &quot;bachelor honours degree&quot; (level 8), which normally takes 1 year after the bachelor&#x27;s degree and is mostly taken as an optional extension year, depending on the discipline; the &quot;master degree&quot; (level 9), which normally takes 1–2 years for &quot;research&quot; or &quot;coursework&quot; degrees and 3–4 years for an &quot;extended&quot; degree and follows on from either a bachelor or honours degree; and the &quot;doctoral degree&quot; (level 10), which normally takes 3–4 years following on from a master&#x27;s degree or a Class I or IIa honours qualification. Also included within the higher education system are: diplomas at level 5 (first year of a degree course); advanced diplomas, at level 6 (associate degree level); and graduate certificates and graduate diplomas, both of which are at level 8 (honours degree level). In Australia, most degrees are issued ungraded, with bachelor&#x27;s degrees with honours being the exception.

Categories of honours degrees are:
* First Class Honours (H1 or I; overall mark of 80% and above);
* Second Class Honours – A Division (H2A or IIA; overall mark of 74% to 79%);
* Second Class Honours – B Division (H2B or IIB; overall mark of 70% to 74%);
* Third Class Honours (H3 or III; overall mark of 65% to 69%).
Lower marks do not qualify for honours, but yield a bachelor&#x27;s degree at:
* Pass (P: overall mark of 50% to 64%);
* Fail (N or Failed: overall mark of 49% and below).

Doctorates in Australia may be research doctorates (normally titled PhDs), professional doctorates (normally titled to refer to the field of practice, e.g. Doctor of Engineering) or higher doctorates (also normally titled to refer to the field of practice). Extended master&#x27;s degrees are also allowed to have the word &#x27;doctor&#x27; in their title if they are in certain fields, but they are not doctoral degrees.

==== New Zealand ====
Like Australia, New Zealand has a 10-level qualifications framework (the New Zealand Qualifications Framework – NZQF) and a referencing exercise has found a one-to-one correspondence between the levels of the two frameworks. However, the names given to qualifications at different levels are not the same and New Zealand does not have associate degrees, thus only levels 7–10 correspond to academic degrees. These are the bachelor&#x27;s degree (level 7), bachelor honours degree (level 8), master&#x27;s degree (level 9) and the doctoral degree (level 10). In addition to these, the NZQF has certificates across levels 1–6, diplomas at levels 5 and 6, graduate certificates and graduate diplomas at level 7 (bachelor&#x27;s), and postgraduate certificates and postgraduate diplomas at level 8 (honours). Another referencing exercise, comparing the NZQF to the 10-level Irish National Framework for Qualifications, found that degrees were comparable but that further work was needed to improve compatibility at the sub-degree levels (1–6). Non-degree qualifications at levels 7–9 were not included in the study. In New Zealand, master&#x27;s degrees may be awarded with classified honours (1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd) or with distinction or merit.

==== Argentina ====
==== Brazil ====
Undergraduate students in Brazilian universities graduate either with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, a licentiate degree or a technologist degree. Bachelor degrees in Brazil normally take four or five years of full-time study to complete, with the exception of the human medicine course, which requires six years. Licentiate degrees normally take four-years, and are for students who want to qualify as school teachers. &quot;Licenciatura&quot; courses exist mostly in mathematics, humanities and natural sciences. The technologist degree is available in technology-related fields and can be normally obtained in three years. These degrees are for entry into industry.

Admission as an undergraduate student to most top public or private universities in Brazil requires that the applicant pass a competitive entrance examination known as the Vestibular. Contrary to what happens in the United States, candidates must declare their intended university major when they register for the Vestibular. Although it is theoretically possible to switch majors afterwards (in a process known within the universities as &quot;transferência interna&quot;), that is actually quite rare in Brazil. Undergraduate curricula tend to be more rigid than in the United States and there is little room to take classes outside one&#x27;s major.

Individuals who hold either a bachelor&#x27;s degree, licentiate or technologist are eligible for admission into graduate courses leading to advanced master&#x27;s or doctor&#x27;s degrees. Criteria for admission into master&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s programs vary in Brazil. Some universities require that candidates take entrance exams; others make admission decisions based solely on undergraduate transcripts, letters of recommendation and possibly oral interviews. In most cases, however, especially for the doctorate, the candidate is required to submit a research plan, and one faculty member must agree to serve as supervisor before the candidate can be admitted into the program. The exceptions are the natural sciences post-graduate programs, which accept students with very broad or vague research prospects that sometimes the prospect is given &quot;in promptu&quot; during the interview, preferring to let the students define their study program and advisor in the course of the first year of studies.

There are two types of post-graduate programs: &quot;lato sensu&quot; (specialization and MBAs) and &quot;stricto sensu&quot; (professional master&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate).

Specializations or MBAs are courses that include taking a minimum number of graduate classes (minimum of 360 hours) but with no need to do research nor defend a thesis, only to present final work showing knowledge acquired. It is a professional level where theory and practice are focused broadly.

Professional master&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees usually take one to two years of full-time study. Requirements for an academic master&#x27;s degree include taking a minimum number of advanced graduate classes (typically between five and eight) and submitting a research thesis, which is examined orally by a panel of at least two examiners (three is the preferred number), sometimes including one member from another university or research institute. The emphasis of the thesis must be in adding some value to knowledge, but not necessarily in being original.

Doctoral degrees normally take four additional years of full-time study to complete. Requirements for obtaining a doctor&#x27;s degree include taking additional advanced courses, passing an oral qualifying exam, and submitting a longer doctoral dissertation which must represent a significant original contribution to knowledge in the field to which the dissertation topic is related. That contrasts with master&#x27;s thesis, which, in addition to being usually shorter than doctoral dissertations, are not required to include creation of new knowledge or revision/reinterpretation of older views/theories. The doctoral dissertation is examined in a final oral exam before a panel of at least two members (in the state of São Paulo the preferred number is five, while the other regions prefer three members), usually including one or two external examiners from another university or research institute.

Finally, a small number of Brazilian universities, most notably the public universities in the state of São Paulo, still award the title of (&quot;free docent&quot;), which is of higher standing than a doctorate and is obtained, similar to the German Habilitation, by the submission of a second (original or cumulative) thesis and approval in a &quot;Livre-Docência&quot; examination that includes giving a public lecture before a panel of full professors.

==== Colombia ====
In Colombia, the system of academic degrees is based in the British model, similar to the U.S. model. After completing their &quot;bachillerato&quot; (high school), students can take one of three options. The first one is called a (professional career), which is similar to a bachelor&#x27;s degree requiring from four to 6 years of study according to the chosen program. The other option is called a (technician); this degree consists of two and a half years of study and prepares the student for technical or mechanical labors. Finally, the third option is called a (equivalent to associate degree) and consists of three years of study.

After this, students, now called (professionals), (technicians) or (associates), can opt for higher degrees. Formal education after the bachelor&#x27;s degree leads to the master&#x27;s degree with the title of and doctorate degrees, known as (doctorate). The master&#x27;s degree normally takes two years.

Students also can take a specialization course, , equivalent to a graduate certificate degree, after their bachelor&#x27;s degree. These programs, like in the U.S., are very popular, because it requires only one to two years of study.

In Colombia, similar to the U.S. system, the students may not go directly to the without having the &quot;master&quot; degree first.

==== Chile ====
After completing (high school), students receive a (high school diploma), which is a requirement for higher education.

In Chile, there is a distinction between academic degrees and professional titles:

* is the denomination given to an academic degree granted by a higher education institution recognized by the Chilean Mineduc (Ministry of Education).
* is the denomination given to a professional title. Some professional titles are required for occupations such as physicians, attorneys and as civil/commercial engineers. A professional title may or may not require a , additional examination or work experience. For example, the (attorney) professional title is granted by the Chilean Supreme Court and requires an examination, academic degree and 6 months of pro-bono work experience.

Among degrees, there are the following levels:

* , undergraduate degree obtained by completing a 2-year .
* , undergraduate degree obtained as a 4+ year . Equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree.
* , graduate degree, requiring a degree or equivalent. Equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree.
* , a doctoral degree, often requiring a degree or equivalent.

Higher-education programs that provide a professional title but not an academic degree are referred to as , which are similar in duration and scope to associate degree programs. These are often granted by educational institutions of the type (IP) or (CFT).

==== Venezuela ====
Academic degrees in Venezuela start with the &quot;Certificado de Educación Básica&quot; (Certificate of Basic Education), awarded upon completing the 9th grade. The next degree is earned upon completing the 11th grade and confers the title of &quot;Bachiller en Ciencias&quot; (High School Graduate of Science), &quot;Bachiller en Humanidades&quot; (High School Graduate of Humanities) or &quot;Técnico en Ciencias&quot; (Science Technician). The reason for this diversity is because some schools provide vocational education as part of their high school curriculum (thereby allowing them to hand out &quot;technician&quot; titles), while elsewhere the student is required to decide whether to study science or the humanities for the last two years of secondary school.

Titles at the higher-education level usually depend on the institution handing them out. Technical schools award the student with the title of &quot;Técnico Superior Universitario&quot; (university higher technician, to distinguish from science technician). Universities award the student with the title of &quot;ingeniero&quot; (engineer) or with the title &quot;licenciado&quot; (licentiate) after completing a five-year program. The ingeniero degree requires more physics than the licenciado degree, but both take five years. Some higher-education institutions may award &quot;diplomados&quot; (diploma), but the time necessary to obtain one varies. Medical doctors are awarded the title &quot;Médico Cirujano&quot; after completing a 6-year course of study.

Postgraduate education in Venezuela follows the conventions of the United States (being named &quot;master&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;doctorate&quot; after the programs there).

== Pontifical universities ==
Pontifical universities around the world—such as the Pontifical University, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, in Ireland; the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila; Catholic University of America, the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, in Rome; the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru depend for their status as pontifical universities, and for the nature of their academic degrees, on the Pope, through the Congregation for Catholic Education. The nature of academic degrees from ecclesiastical institutions of education is outlined in the apostolic constitution &quot;Sapientia Christiana&quot;.

In distinction to secular or Catholic universities, which are academic institutions for the study and teaching of a broad range of disciplines, ecclesiastical or pontifical universities &quot;are usually composed of three principal ecclesiastical faculties: theology, philosophy, and canon law, as well as at least one other faculty. A pontifical university specifically addresses Christian revelation and disciplines correlative to the evangelical mission of the Church as set out in &quot;Sapientia christiana&quot;.&quot;

The core of degrees granted by pontifical universities consists of three levels: the first is the baccalaureate; the second is the licentiate; the third is the doctorate. From this core pontifical universities confer specific degrees, including:

Theology
* Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology, &quot;Sacrae Theologiae Baccalaureatus&quot; (S.T.B.)
* Licentiate in Sacred Theology, &quot;Sacrae Theologiae Licentiatus&quot; (S.T.L.)
* Doctorate in Sacred Theology, &quot;Sacrae Theologiae Doctoratus&quot; (S.T.D.)

Philosophy
* Baccalaureate in Philosophy, &quot;Philosophiae Baccalaureatus&quot; (Ph.B.)
* Licentiate in Philosophy, &quot;Philosophiae Licentiatus&quot; (Ph.L.)
* Doctorate in Philosophy, &quot;Philosophiae Doctoratus&quot; (Ph.D.)

Canon Law
* Baccalaureate in Canon Law, &quot;Juris Canonici Baccalaureatus&quot; (J.C.B.)
* Licentiate in Canon Law, &quot;Juris Canonici Licentiatus&quot; (J.C.L.)
* Doctorate in Canon Law, &quot;Juris Canonici Doctoratus&quot; (J.C.D.)

<text>I, Claudius is a historical novel by English writer Robert Graves, published in 1934. Written in the form of an autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, it tells the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the early years of the Roman Empire, from Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC to Caligula&#x27;s assassination in AD 41. Though the narrative is largely fictionalized, most of the events depicted are drawn from historical accounts of the same time period by the Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus.

The &quot;autobiography&quot; continues in a sequel, Claudius the God (1935), which covers the period from Claudius&#x27; accession to his death in AD 54. The sequel also includes a section written as a biography of Herod Agrippa, a contemporary of Claudius and the king of Judaea (Roman province). Both books were adapted by the BBC into the award-winning television serial &quot;I, Claudius&quot; in 1976.

Graves stated in an interview with Malcolm Muggeridge in 1965, that he wrote &quot;I, Claudius&quot; mainly because he needed the money to pay off a debt, having been let down in a land deal. He needed to raise £4,000 (), but with the success of the books he brought in £8,000 (£) in six months, thus extricating himself from his precarious financial position.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;I, Claudius&quot; fourteenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2005, the novel was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to present.

==Novels==
===Historical context===
Claudius was the fourth Emperor of the Roman Empire, from AD 41 to 54. A grandson of Mark Antony and great-nephew of Augustus, he was a member of the Julio-Claudian family, Rome&#x27;s first imperial ruling family. Claudius&#x27; family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer, limp, and other nervous tics, which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives. Even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years, he ran into trouble as a budding historian; his work on a history of the Roman civil wars was either too truthful or too critical of the reigning emperor Augustus, and his mother Antonia Minor and grandmother Livia quickly put a stop to it. This episode reinforced their initial suspicions that Claudius was not fit for public office. 

Claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history, and Graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family&#x27;s incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot. Graves&#x27; interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, Plutarch, and (especially) Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot;. Graves translated Suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading Suetonius, Claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told. The life of Claudius provided Graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of Rome from an intimate point of view. &quot;I, Claudius&quot; is written as a first-person narrative of Roman history from Claudius&#x27; perspective, covering the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula; &quot;Claudius the God&quot; is written as a later addition documenting Claudius&#x27; own reign. The real Claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography (now lost) in eight books that covered the same period.

Graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional Claudius describe a visit to Cumae, where he receives a prophecy in verse from the Sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of &quot;Sibylline Curiosities&quot;. The latter concerns the fates of the &quot;hairy ones&quot; (i.e. the Caesars – from the Latin word &quot;caesar&quot;, meaning &quot;a fine head of hair&quot;) who are to rule Rome. The penultimate verse concerns his reign and Claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy. Graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of &quot;Claudius the God&quot; when Claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by Nero.

At Cumae, the Sibyl tells Claudius that he will &quot;speak clear&quot;. Claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he, having written the truth, will speak clearly, while his contemporaries, who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family, will seem like stammerers. Since he wishes to record his life for posterity, Claudius explains that he chooses to write in Greek, which he believes will remain &quot;the chief literary language of the world&quot;. This enables Graves&#x27; Claudius to offer explanations of Latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native Latin speakers. Claudius also portrays his grandmother Livia as a scheming Machiavellian, based on the works of Tacitus and Cassius Dio, who wrote that rumours persisted that Augustus was poisoned by Livia, but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty.

===&quot;I, Claudius&quot;===
Writing in the first-person (from an unspecified time period, presumably late in his own reign as emperor), Claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth, which includes harsh criticisms of the deified Augustus and especially of Livia. The narrative begins prior to his own birth, as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the Roman Principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of Augustus as emperor despite Augustus&#x27; own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former Republic. During his prosperous reign, Augustus is plagued by personal losses as his favored heirs, Marcellus, Marcus Agrippa, Gaius Caesar, and Lucius Caesar, die. Claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of Augustus&#x27; third wife Livia (who is also Claudius&#x27; paternal grandmother), a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son Tiberius (Claudius&#x27; uncle) succeed Augustus as the next emperor.

As these intrigues occur, the sickly Claudius is born and is immediately shunned and mocked by his family. Only his brother Germanicus and his cousin Postumus treat him with any kindness. He is eventually given a great tutor, the reputable historian Athenodorus, who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young Claudius. During these early years, Claudius is advised by his idol Asinius Pollio to play the fool to survive.

Postumus is eventually framed for raping Claudius&#x27; sister Livilla and beating his own niece Aemilia; Augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of Italy, but not before Postumus reveals the truth to Claudius. Claudius then passes this on to Germanicus, who convinces Augustus of Postumus&#x27; innocence. Augustus exchanges the exiled Postumus with a double named Clemens and secretly writes a will restoring Postumus as his heir, but Livia manages to discover this and poisons Augustus.

Upon Augustus&#x27; death, Tiberius is declared emperor, though his mother Livia retains her power and influence as empress. The Roman legions campaigning in Germany refuse to accept the unpopular Tiberius and begin to mutiny, instead declaring Germanicus emperor. Shocked and confused, Germanicus refuses, declaring his loyalty to Tiberius. He sends his wife Agrippina and youngest son Caligula away from the military frontier and asks Claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers. Claudius agrees and pretends that they are gambling debts. With the money and the return of Caligula, Germanicus ends the mutiny and leads several successful campaigns in Germany.

In the midst of this, Claudius is informed that Postumus is alive and secretly forming a resistance group to take back his rightful place in Rome. Claudius&#x27; letters to Germanicus about Postumus are intercepted by Livia; Postumus is later captured and executed by Tiberius. Livia, recognizing that Claudius is a threat, sends him to Carthage to prevent him from having contact with Germanicus. Growing to fear Germanicus&#x27; popularity more and more, Tiberius sends a hostile governor, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, to spy on Germanicus. Germanicus soon becomes plagued by witchcraft before dying of poison. It is later revealed that Germanicus&#x27; son Caligula was the instigator of the witchcraft.

As Tiberius becomes more hated by the public, he increasingly relies on his Praetorian Captain Sejanus to administer his edicts and punishments, who is able to manipulate Tiberius into suspecting that Germanicus&#x27; wife Agrippina and his own son Castor are plotting to usurp the monarchy. Sejanus meanwhile secretly plots with Livilla to usurp the monarchy for himself by poisoning Castor and systematically eliminating any ally of Agrippina and her sons. Agrippina only survives due to the protection of Livia, who holds vital information regarding Augustus&#x27; true opinion of Tiberius.

Livia then hosts a surprising dinner, to which Claudius and Caligula are invited. She predicts that Caligula (and not his older brothers) will become emperor and that Claudius will succeed him. She privately admits to Claudius to having ordered the poisonings and assassinations of many people, and then begs Claudius to swear to deify her as a goddess, believing it will grant her a blissful afterlife, to which he agrees. Claudius is later invited to Livia&#x27;s deathbed and reveals that Caligula betrayed his promise. Claudius swears that Livia will become the Queen of Heaven, which moves Livia to declare he is no fool before she dies.

Tiberius, now free of Livia, loses all compunction and executes hundreds of influential citizens on false charges of treason. He banishes Agrippina and her son Nero, while Agrippina&#x27;s son Drusus is imprisoned and starved to death in Rome. Tiberius retreats from public life to the island of Capri and Sejanus is given full command of the city in his absence, becoming &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Rome. Tiberius is soon alerted to Sejanus&#x27; treachery by a letter from Antonia Minor and allies himself with Caligula, despite his awareness of Caligula&#x27;s growing wickedness and narcissism, and transfers control of Rome to the even more despotic Naevius Sutorius Macro. Sejanus is executed along with his children; Claudius survives despite being married to Sejanus&#x27; sister, whom he quickly divorces. Livilla is locked in a room by her mother Antonia and starved to death, and Antonia punishes herself for having raised Livilla by listening to her daughter die.

On his deathbed, the old and feeble Tiberius is smothered to death by Macro. Caligula is declared emperor and at first appears to be enlightened and kind. To his surprise, Claudius is recalled to Rome from his peaceful life in Capua writing history and living with his prostitute companion Calpurnia. Claudius quickly becomes the butt of many taunts and practical jokes by the Imperial Court. After recovering from a severe illness, Caligula descends into madness, his behavior becoming ever more egomaniacal and irrational. He declares himself a god in human disguise, stages arguments and battles with other gods, bankrupts the country, and kills thousands.

The madness having reached a tempest is finally quelled by Cassius Chaerea, a captain of the Praetorian Guard who plots with the other captains to assassinate Caligula, along with his wife and daughter. Horrified, Claudius hides behind a curtain and is discovered by a disgruntled Praetorian Guard. Realizing they need a new emperor, the Guards suddenly and bemusedly declare Claudius emperor. Claudius pleads that he does not want to be emperor and only wants to see the Republic restored, but the Guards ignore him. He sadly accepts for the sake of his wife and unborn child, and for the access the emperorship will give him to valuable historical documents, on a whim deciding that as emperor he will finally be able to demand that people read his books.

===&quot;Claudius the God&quot;===
The story begins with an apology by Claudius for having ended his first history on a dramatic point and continues with a brief history of his friend Herod Agrippa. Herod was a schoolmate of Claudius and was liked by Claudius&#x27; mother Antonia. Herod always finds himself in debts and danger in the East and in Rome. He eventually gains the favour of Caligula and is made King of Bashan. Herod is in Rome when Caligula is assassinated and quickly is able to convince Claudius to accept the emperorship in order to avoid civil war.

Claudius reluctantly executes Cassius Chaerea and several of the other assassins and begins tirelessly working for the sake of Rome. He applies himself to the law courts, demonstrates his intelligence in being able to locate one of Augustus&#x27; lost Eagles, and orders the building of a harbour in Ostia to help preserve the Roman food supply. Claudius is also able to quell two mutinies and conquers Britain.

Herod Agrippa conspires to take over the East, as he regards himself as the Messiah. When he announces this he breaks the first commandment by declaring himself a god. Herod quickly dies a painful death, just as his grandfather had died, imploring Claudius to forgive him and not to trust anyone.

Throughout Claudius&#x27; reign he is unwittingly manipulated by his adulterous wife Messalina, who kills many of her enemies as well as being involved in bribery. She eventually conspires to usurp the monarchy with her lover Gaius Silius. Claudius is distraught and crushed by this news and is given an &quot;Olympian Mixture&quot; in order to manage through the ordeal. Claudius arrests Silius and the leaders of the coup. Messalina is executed without Claudius&#x27; consent and Claudius has no reaction during his &quot;Olympian&quot; state, even bemusedly joking about being worshipped as a god in Britain.

On being relieved of the &quot;Olympian Mixture&quot;, Claudius is crushed and decides that the only way the Republic can be restored is by having a true mad monarch rather than the reign of a benevolent one. Comparing himself to the fable of the frogs who desired a King, Claudius privately refers to himself as &quot;Old King Log&quot; and plays a weak and easily manipulated fool. He then incestuously marries his niece Agrippinilla, whom he openly despises. In his feeble old age Claudius excessively enjoys gladiatorial games, is often intoxicated, and makes himself oblivious to Agrippinilla&#x27;s schemes to gain power and make her son Nero emperor. Foreseeing that Nero will be a terrible ruler, Claudius plans on having his son Britannicus removed to live with the Northern Britons and later to return as Rome&#x27;s saviour. Britannicus refuses and admits that while he loves the Republic, the Republic is dead and he wants to challenge Nero for the right to rule Rome as an emperor. Dismayed, Claudius agrees, knowing that he is sending his son to his death. Claudius resignedly accepts that his death will be soon with numerous signs suggesting such.

==Literary significance==
The &quot;I, Claudius&quot; novels became massively popular when published, both in 1934. In addition to instant popularity and enormous sales the books soon gained literary recognition; they were collectively awarded the 1934 James Tait Black Prize for fiction. Along with his autobiography, &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;, they remain Graves&#x27; best known work. Graves later claimed that the novels were written only from financial need on a strict deadline. Nonetheless, they are today regarded as pioneering masterpieces of historical fiction.

At the time of its original publication, Peter Monro Jack of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Graves has made a fascinating novel out of [Claudius], and of the Rome of his times a piece of first-rate historical writing.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===German translation===
When the time came to translate the novels into German, Graves, who spoke the language, decided instead to rework them into a one volume edition. He collaborated with translator Hans Rothe and they jointly produced a shortened edition which left out the many digressions which were incorporated into the English original, with the aim of presenting Claudius&#x27; story in a clearer and more effective way. The contents of the books were thus roughly cut down to a half. The book is published as &quot;Ich, Claudius, Kaiser und Gott&quot; (&quot;I, Claudius, Emperor and God&quot;) with Graves being styled &quot;Robert von Ranke Graves&quot;, which is how he is credited in all German editions of his works.

===Film and television===

In 1937, abortive attempts were made to adapt the first book into a film by the film director Josef von Sternberg. The producer was Alexander Korda, who was then married to Merle Oberon, who was cast as Claudius&#x27; wife Messalina. Emlyn Williams was cast as Caligula, Charles Laughton was cast as Claudius, and Flora Robson was cast as Livia. Filming was abandoned after Oberon was injured in a serious motor car accident.

In 1976, BBC Television adapted the book and its sequel into the popular TV serial &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, starring Derek Jacobi, Siân Phillips, Brian Blessed, and John Hurt. The production was awarded three BAFTAs in 1977 and an Emmy in 1978.

In 2008, it was reported that Relativity Media had obtained the rights to produce a new film adaptation of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. Jim Sheridan was named as director.

In 2011, rights then passed to HBO and BBC2 to film a miniseries adaptation. Jane Tranter and Anne Thomopoulos, who previously worked on HBO/BBC2&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Rome&quot; have been named as producers.

===Radio===

In November and December 2010, as part of the &quot;Classic Serial&quot; strand, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a series of six hour-long episodes of a dramatisation of both novels, adapted by Robin Brooks and directed by Jonquil Panting. Performers were Derek Jacobi, Tom Goodman Hill and full cast. It won the 2012 Audie Award in the &quot;Audio Dramatization&quot; category.

===Comics===

An episode from &quot;Claudius the God&quot; was adapted for comics in the EC Comics Two-Fisted Tales #36, in a story titled &quot;Battle!&quot;, written by Colin Dwakins and drawn by Reed Crandall.

===Theatre===
The novel has also been adapted for theatre. The 1972 production &quot;I, Claudius&quot; was written by John Mortimer and starred David Warner.

===Audio===
Several audio recordings of the novel have been produced. Derek Jacobi performed two separate readings of the novel, both as abridged versions, one for Dove Audio (1986) and one for CSA Word (2007). Nelson Runger performed unabridged readings of both &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot; for Recorded Books (1987). Jonathan Oliver performed an unabridged reading for ISIS Audio Books (1988). Frederick Davidson performed an unabridged reading for Blackstone Audio (1994).

===Opera===
The novel has also been adapted for opera by Igor Escudero under the title &quot;I, Claudius and Claudius the God&quot; (2019).

The three parts, or chapters, that form the trilogy are titled &quot;Livia&quot;, &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;, and have been conceived to be performed not only sequentially, but also separately.

== Legacy ==
A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s 1950s science fiction novels &quot;Empire of the Atom&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Linn&quot; drew heavily from the plot of Graves&#x27; &quot;Claudius&quot; novels, to the point of reusing slightly altered character names. For these reasons the critic Damon Knight has said their plots were &quot;lifted almost bodily&quot; from that of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

George R. R. Martin, the author of &quot;The Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series (1996—present), has spoken of the inspiration he took from &quot;I, Claudius.&quot; He especially noted the resemblance Stannis Baratheon bore to Tiberius Caesar, particularly as portrayed by George Baker in the 1976 BBC television adaptation.

David Chase, creator and showrunner of the acclaimed 1999 HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; has spoken highly of the book, calling it one of his favorite works of fiction. While Chase has stopped short of drawing a direct connection, many have compared the Machiavellian Livia Soprano to Claudius&#x27; grandmother, Livia Drusilla. These suspicious tend to find confirmation in the maiden name Chase selected for Livia—Pollio, one shared by Gaius Asinius Pollio, who makes a decisive appearance in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. 

&quot;I, Claudia&quot; is a 2001 one-woman play written by Kristen Thomson. The play and its 2004 CBC adaptation recount the difficult transition into adolescence of Claudia, a 12-year-old girl struggling with her parents&#x27; divorce. Thomson played all of the roles, using masks to change character.

A 2018 novel by Mary McCoy is also titled &quot;I, Claudia.&quot; This work resets the characters from Graves&#x27; book into a modern-day private high school that labors under a problematic power structure.

<text>Timothy Sydney Robert Hardy (29 October 1925 – 3 August 2017) was an English actor who had a long career in theatre, film and television. He began his career as a classical actor and later earned widespread recognition for roles such as Siegfried Farnon in the BBC television series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, Cornelius Fudge in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, and Winston Churchill in several productions, beginning with the Southern Television series &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot;. He was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Actor for &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot; in 1982. Aside from acting, Hardy was an acknowledged expert on the medieval English longbow and wrote two books on the subject.

==Early life==
Hardy was born in Cheltenham on 29 August 1925 to Henry Harrison Hardy, MBE, of Old Farm, Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve, Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and Edith Jocelyn, daughter of Rev. Sydney Dugdale, rector of Whitchurch, Shropshire, a member of a landed gentry family of Wroxall Abbey, Wroxall, Warwickshire. Henry Hardy was the headmaster of Cheltenham College and later of Shrewsbury School, and a Major in the Rifle Brigade.

Hardy was educated at Rugby School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where his studies were interrupted by service in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He trained as a pilot, receiving part of his instruction in the British Flying Training School Program in Terrell, Texas. Although he visited Los Angeles when on leave from flight training at Terrell, his later acting career never gained a foothold in Hollywood. After service in the RAF, he returned to gain a BA (Hons) in English. On BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, he described the degree he obtained as &quot;shabby&quot;, although he treasured the time spent studying under C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.

==Career==
Hardy began his career as a classical actor, and made an early Hollywood film appearance in a minor role opposite Glenn Ford in the 1958 war film &quot;Torpedo Run&quot;. In 1959, he appeared as The King of France in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; in April 1959, directed by Tyrone Guthrie at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Vanessa Redgrave and Diana Rigg indicated as supporting extras. He subsequently appeared as Sicinius opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;Coriolanus&quot; at Stratford-upon-Avon, directed by Peter Hall. In this production, Ian Holm featured as a &quot;Third Aufidious Servant&quot;, Vanessa Redgrave as Valeria, and Diana Rigg as a &quot;Roman Citizen&quot;. Albert Finney featured as a &quot;First Roman Citizen&quot;. Hardy then appeared in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; on stage and in television&#x27;s &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; (1960), and subsequently played Coriolanus in &quot;The Spread of the Eagle&quot; (BBC, 1963) and Sir Toby Belch for the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 1980. Over the years, Hardy played a range of parts on television and film. His first continuing role in a TV series was as businessman Alec Stewart in the award-winning oil company drama &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot; for the BBC, which he played from 1966 to 1970. He won further acclaim for his portrayal of the mentally-unhinged Abwehr Sgt. Gratz in LWT&#x27;s 1969 war drama &quot;Manhunt&quot;. In 1975, Hardy portrayed Albert, Prince Consort in the award-winning 13-hour serial &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (known as &quot;Edward the King&quot; to the American audience), which he regarded as one of his best performances. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d done a good job there, although I believe the Royal Family didn&#x27;t like it all. There are always people who don&#x27;t like what one does.&quot;

Hardy was seen as the irascible senior veterinary surgeon Siegfried Farnon in the long-running &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (1978–90), an adaptation of James Herriot&#x27;s semi-autobiographical books. Hardy also made an appearance in the 1986–88 ITV comedy series &quot;Hot Metal&quot;, in which he played the dual roles of newspaper proprietor Twiggy Rathbone (who bore more than a passing resemblance to Rupert Murdoch) and his editor, Russell Spam. In 1993 Hardy appeared in an episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, playing Andrew Baydon in &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;. In 1994, he played Arthur Brooke in the BBC production of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. In 2002, he played the role of pompous and eccentric Professor Neddy Welch in a WTTV/WGBH Boston co-production of &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, adapted from the novel by Kingsley Amis. It aired originally as part of the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; series on PBS in the U.S. and starred Stephen Tompkinson in the title role of Jim Dixon, a luckless lecturer at a provincial British university.

Hardy played both Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, each on more than one occasion. He played Churchill most notably in &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot; (1981), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award, but also in &quot;The Sittaford Mystery&quot;, &quot;Bomber Harris&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. On 20 August 2010, he read Churchill&#x27;s famous wartime address &quot;Never was so much owed by so many to so few&quot; at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the speech. He played Roosevelt in the BBC serial, &quot;Bertie and Elizabeth&quot;, and in the French TV mini-series, &quot;Le Grand Charles&quot;, about the life of Charles de Gaulle. He also played Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; and took the role of Sir John Middleton in the 1995 film version of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.

Hardy&#x27;s big screen roles included Professor Krempe in &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

Hardy&#x27;s voice performance as Robin Hood in &quot;Tale Spinners For Children&quot;, an LP from the 1960s, is considered one of the best Robin Hood renditions. His voice was also the voice of D&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and of Frédéric Chopin, in &quot;The Story of Chopin&quot;.

==Awards==
Hardy was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1981 Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
Hardy&#x27;s first marriage, in 1952, was to Elizabeth Fox, the daughter of Sir Lionel Fox; they had a son, Paul. This marriage ended in 1956. In 1961 he married Sally Pearson, the daughter of the baronet Sir Neville Pearson and Dame Gladys Cooper as well as a half-sister of John Buckmaster and a sister-in-law of Robert Morley. From this marriage, which ended in 1986, Hardy had two other children, one of whom is Justine Hardy, a journalist, activist and psychotherapist who founded Healing Kashmir.

Hardy was a close friend of actor Richard Burton, whom he met at Oxford University. He shared some memories of their wartime friendship and read extracts from Burton&#x27;s newly published diaries at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2012.

While playing Henry V, Hardy developed an interest in medieval warfare, and in 1963 he wrote and presented an acclaimed television documentary on the subject of the Battle of Agincourt. He also wrote two books on the subject of the longbow, &quot;Longbow: A Social and Military History&quot; and &quot;The Great Warbow: From Hastings to the Mary Rose&quot; with Matthew Strickland. He was one of the experts consulted by the archaeologist responsible for raising the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Bowyers of the City of London from 1988 to 1990. In 1996 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.

In February 2013, Hardy withdrew from his scheduled performance as Winston Churchill in Peter Morgan&#x27;s play, &quot;The Audience&quot;, after suffering cracked ribs as the result of a fall.

Hardy died on 3 August 2017, aged 91, at Denville Hall, a home for retired actors.

<text>A recumbent bicycle is a bicycle that places the rider in a laid-back reclining position. Recumbents are available in a wide range of configurations, including: long to short wheelbase; large, small, or a mix of wheel sizes; overseat, underseat, or no-hands steering; and rear wheel or front wheel drive. A variant with three wheels is a recumbent tricycle.

Recumbents are much faster than upright bicycles, but they were banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1934. Recumbent races and records are now overseen by the World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA) and International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA).

Some recumbent riders may choose this type of design for ergonomic reasons: the rider&#x27;s weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional upright bicycle, the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the sitting bones, the feet, and the hands. Others may choose a recumbent because some models also have an aerodynamic advantage; the reclined, legs-forward position of the rider&#x27;s body presents a smaller frontal profile. 

==Description==

Recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase, wheel sizes, steering system, faired or unfaired, and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive.

===Wheelbase===

Long-wheelbase (LWB) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels; short-wheelbase (SWB) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel; compact long-wheelbase (CLWB) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it. Within these categories are variations, intermediate types, and even convertible designs (LWB to CLWB) there is no &quot;standard&quot; recumbent.

===Wheel sizes===
The rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size, from around to the 700c (or 27″ on some older models, as on upright road bikes of that time) of an upright racing cycle. The front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear, although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch (ISO 559), 650c (ISO 571), 700c (ISO 622), or even 29 × 4″ oversize all-terrain tires. Given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel, loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt, sand or pebbles. Larger diameter wheels generally have lower rolling resistance but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance. High-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable, and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass, the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable. Another advantage of both wheels being the same size is that the bike requires only one size of inner tube.

One common arrangement is an ISO 559 (26-inch) rear wheel and an ISO 406 or ISO 451 (20-inch) front wheel. The small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other, avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called &quot;heel strike&quot; (where the rider&#x27;s heels catch the wheel in tight turns). A pivoting-boom front-wheel drive (PBFWD aka moving bottom bracket recumbent) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together. PBFWD bikes may have dual wheels or larger.

===Steering===

Steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as
* over-seat (OSS) or above seat steering (ASS);
* under-seat (USS); or
* center steering or pivot steering.
OSS/ASS is generally direct—the steerer acts on the front fork like a standard bicycle handlebar—but the bars themselves may extend well behind the front wheel (more like a tiller); alternatively the bars might have long rearward extensions (sometimes known as Superman or Kingcycle bars). Chopper-style bars are sometimes seen on LWB bikes.

USS is usually indirect—the bars link to the headset through a system of rods or cables and possibly a bell crank. Most tadpole trikes are USS.

Center steered or pivot steered recumbents, such as Flevobikes and Pythons, may have no handlebars at all.

In addition, some trikes such as the Sidewinder have used rear-wheel steer, instead of the more common front-wheel steer. They can provide good maneuverability at low speeds, but have been reported to be potentially unstable at speeds above .

===Drive===
Most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame, with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive. However, due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel, front wheel drive (FWD) can be an option, and it allows for a much shorter chain. One style requires the chain to twist slightly to allow for steering.
Another style, pivoting-boom FWD (PBFWD), has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork. In addition to the much shorter chain, the advantages to PBFWD are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike (you can pedal while turning) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing. The main disadvantage to all FWD designs is &quot;wheelspin&quot; when climbing steep hills covered with loose gravel, wet grass, etc. This mainly affects off-road riders, and can be ameliorated by shifting the weight forward, applying steady pressure to the pedals, and using tires with more aggressive tread. Another disadvantage of PBFWD for some riders is a slightly longer &quot;learning curve&quot; due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect (forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike). Beginner riders tend to swerve along a serpentine path until they adapt a balanced pedal motion. After adaptation, a PBFWD recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike, and can even be steered accurately with the feet only. Cruzbike is the only PBFWD recumbent currently in production, and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes. Flevobike formerly produced a center-steered FWD bike similar to the Python Lowracer.

Yet another drive-train variation is on rowing cycles where the rider rows using arms and legs.

===Fully suspended bikes===
Modern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers. The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.

===Fairings===
Some riders fit their bikes with aerodynamic devices called fairings. These can reduce aerodynamic drag and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather. Fairings are also available for upright bikes, but are much less common. Fully enclosed bikes and trikes are considered velomobiles.

===Seats===
The seats themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame or foam cushions over hard shells like the Stinger pictured, which might be moulded or assembled from sheet materials. Hard-shell seats predominate in Europe, mesh seats in the USA.

==Variations==
===Mountain bike recumbents===
With the right equipment and design, recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad, just as with conventional mountain bikes. Because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat, recumbents are not as easy to use on tight, curving unpaved singletrack. Large-diameter wheels, mountain gearing and off-road specific design have been used since 1999. Crank-forward designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle, such as the RANS Dynamik, also can be used off-road.

===Lowracers===
Lowracers are a type of recumbent more common in Europe among racing enthusiasts. These typically have two 20″ wheels or a 26″ wheel at the rear and 20″ wheel at the front. The seat is positioned between the wheels rather than above them. The extreme reclined position, and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them, makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents.

===Highracers===
Highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels (usually ISO 559, 650c or 700c). This necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider&#x27;s legs are above the front wheel, and this in turn requires a higher seat. The seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing similar aerodynamics. &quot;Racer&quot; in the name implies that this will often be the case, since these bikes strive for speed.

Highracers are generally more maneuverable than lowracers since their higher center of mass make them easier to balance at lower speeds. Given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers, since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter. However, lowracer proponents reply that their design is faster due to aerodynamics. The reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels, reducing drag.

Hip and elbow injuries are more common on highracers than on lowracers due to the greater height from which the rider can fall. However, the injuries are very rare and seldom serious.

===Semi-recumbent and crank forward bicycles===
Bicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or crank forward designs. These generally are intended for casual use and have comfort and ease of use as primary objectives, with aerodynamics sacrificed for this purpose.

===Tandem recumbents===

Just as with upright bicycles, recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat, thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of tandem bicycles. In order to keep the wheelbase from being any longer than absolutely necessary, tandem recumbents often place the stoker&#x27;s crankset under the captain&#x27;s seat. A common configuration for two riders in the recumbent position is the sociable tandem, wherein the two riders ride side by side. There are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the Hase Pino Allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front, and an upright pilot in the rear.

=== Recumbent tricycles ===


Recumbent tricycles (trikes) are closely related to recumbent bicycles, but have three wheels instead of two. The three wheels can be arranged in two ways: delta trikes have one front wheel and two rear wheels, while tadpole trikes have two front wheels and one rear wheel.


====Handcycles====

In order to accommodate paraplegics and other individuals with little or no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at human powered vehicle (HPV) meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard dérailleur gearing powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180° of pedal cranks. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.

Although arms are weaker than legs, many hand cyclists are able to make use of the power of the whole upper body. A good hand cyclist can still achieve a respectable pace in competitions. Handcycles have also been used for touring, though few designers incorporate mudguards or luggage racks. Also, the gear ratios of standard handcycles tend to be less useful for long steep climbs.

==== Hand-and-foot recumbent tricycles ====
Recumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs, and thus the potential for a full-body workout, and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg(s) to power a cycle. In one recumbent tricycle design the user makes the two front wheels change direction by shifting his center of weight, and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel. There are also hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle; these bikes enable cycling by use of legs, despite a spinal cord injury

=== Recumbent quadracycles ===

Recumbent four-wheel cycles have the same general advantages of tricycles. For quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle. More wheels introduce more weight and more complexity. The fourth wheel is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road. When two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option.

===Homebuilts===

As with upright bikes, there is a subculture of recumbent builders who design and build home-built recumbents. Often these are assembled of parts from other bikes, particularly mountain bikes. The frame designs may be as simple as a long steel tube bent into the appropriate shape, or as elaborate as hand-built carbon fiber frames. For many builders, the engineering and construction of the bikes is as much of a challenge as riding them.

===Folding===
Several manufacturers offer folding recumbents to facilitate packing and travelling.

===Couplers===
It is possible to add couplers either during manufacturing or as a retrofit so that the frame can be disassembled into smaller pieces to facilitate packing and travel.

===Stationary recumbents===
As well as road-going recumbent bicycles with wheels, stationary versions also exist. These are often found in gyms but are also available for home use. Like a regular stationary exercise bike, these stay in one place and the user pedals against some kind of resistance mechanism such as a fan or alternator but in a recumbent position. These have the same comfort advantages as road-going recumbents. Stationary recumbents almost always have a fairly upright seat and the pedal crank is lower than the level of the seat. The seat is normally adjustable and is adjusted by sliding it along a rail.

==Compared to uprights==
There are striking differences between recumbents and upright bikes. Since recumbents vary widely, the advantages and disadvantages listed below may apply to different types to different degrees or not at all. (For example, balance is not a concern with tricycles.)

==History==
Recumbent bicycle designs date back to the middle of the 19th century. Several designs were patented around 1900, but these early designs were unsuccessful.

===Early recumbents===

Recumbent designs of both prone and supine varieties can be traced back to the earliest days of the bicycle. Before the shape of the bicycle settled down following Starley&#x27;s safety bicycle, there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements, and this included designs which might be considered recumbent. Although these dated back to the 1860s the first recorded illustration of a recumbent considered as a separate class of bicycle is considered to be in the magazine &quot;Fliegende Blätter&quot; of 10 September 1893. This year also saw what is considered the first genuine recumbent, the Fautenil Vélociped. Patent applications for a number of recumbent designs exist in the late years of the 19th century, and there were discussions in the cycling press of the relative merits of different layouts. The Challand designs of 1897 and the American Brown of 1901 are both recognisable as forerunners of today&#x27;s recumbents.

===The Mochet &#x27;Vélo-Velocar&#x27; and &#x27;Vélorizontal&#x27;===
A four-wheeled, two-seater, pedal-propelled car called the &#x27;Velocar&#x27; was built in the 1930s by French inventor and light car builder Charles Mochet. Velocars sold well to French buyers who could not afford a motor car, possibly because of a poor economy during the Great Depression. The four-wheeled Velocars were fast but didn&#x27;t corner well at high speed. Mochet then experimented with a three-wheel design and finally a mould-breaking two-wheel design based on the Vélocar technology.

The early models of Mochet&#x27;s &#x27;La bicyclette de l&#x27;Avenir&#x27; (The bicycle of the Future), the &#x27;Vélo-Vélocar&#x27;, or &#x27;V-V&#x27; as the factory referred to them, used a 40mm steel-tube, single-beam frame and 450 x 55 wheels with handlebars over the rider and steering torque transmitted by bevel gears. Various types of Mochet-designed derailleur gears were fitted, with a single gear for the track models. Gears were mid-mounted using primary and secondary chains. The back-rest was adjustable on more sporting models.

To demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle, Mochet had the design ratified by the UCI and UVF and enlisted cyclist Francis Faure, a Category 2 racer, to ride it in races. Faure was highly successful, defeating many of Europe&#x27;s top cyclists both on the track and in road races, and setting new world records at short distances. Another cyclist, Paul Morand, won the Paris-Limoges race in 1933 on one of Mochet&#x27;s recumbents.

On 7 July 1933, at a Paris velodrome, Faure rode a modified Vélo-Velocar in one hour, beating an almost 20-year-old hour record held by Oscar Egg, and attracting a great deal of attention.

When the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) met in February 1934, manufacturers of &#x27;upright&#x27; bicycles lobbied to have Faure&#x27;s one-hour record declared invalid. On 1 April 1934, the UCI published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground, how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel. The new definition effectively banned recumbents from UCI events for a combination of tradition, safety, and economic reasons.

Charles Mochet died a short time after the ban was enacted, still protesting against the UCI decision, and the firm continued to make recumbents under his widow and, later, Georges Mochet until at least 1941 for a limited number of customers. Their final versions were a single-chain design named the &#x27;Vélorizontal&#x27;, the final model using a &#x27;Cyclo&#x27; four-speed gear.
After the UCI decision, Faure continued to race, and consistently beat upright bicycles with the Velocar. In 1938, Faure and Mochet&#x27;s son, Georges, began adding fairings to the Velocar in hopes of bettering the world record of one hour for a bicycle with aerodynamic components. On 5 March 1938, Faure rode a faired Velocar 50.537 kilometers in an hour and became the first cyclist to travel more than 50 kilometers in an hour without the aid of a pace vehicle.

The UCI ban on recumbent bicycles and other aerodynamic improvements virtually stopped development of recumbents for four decades and remains in force. Although recumbent designs continued to crop up over the years they were mainly the work of lone enthusiasts and numbers remained insignificant until the 1970s. Georges Mochet died in 2008.

===1970s resurgence and the IHPVA===
While developments had been made in this fallow period by Paul Rinkowski and others, the modern recumbent movement was given a boost in 1969 when the &quot;Ground Hugger&quot; by Robert Riley was featured in Popular Mechanics. There was also the work of Chester Kyle and particularly David Gordon Wilson of MIT, two Americans who opposed the UCI restrictions and continued to work on fairings and recumbents. In 1974, they also nucleated the International Human Power speed Championship in Long Beach, California, from which the IHPVA grew. Kyle and his students had been experimenting with fairings for upright bicycles, also banned by the UCI. In 1975 the brothers John and Randy Schlitter started producing recumbents at their company, Rans, and became the first U.S. company to do so.

In 1978, the &quot;Vélérique&quot; is the very first commercialized recumbent bicycle (fully faired), by the Belgian Erik Abergen.

The Avatar 2000, a LWB bike very much like the current Easy Racers products, arrived in 1979. It was featured in the 1983 film Brainstorm, ridden by Christopher Walken, and in the popular cycling reference &quot;Richard&#x27;s Bicycle Book&quot; by Richard Ballantine. From 1983 to 1991 Steven Roberts toured the U.S. in a modified Avatar, pulling a trailer with solar panels and a laptop, gaining press coverage and writing the book &quot;Computing Across America&quot;. A faired Avatar 2000 was the first two-wheeler to beat the European Vector three-wheeler in the streamliner races. For about ten years afterward, speed records were exchanged between Easy Racers with Freddy Markham in the cockpit and the Lightning Team. So America&#x27;s strength became the flying 200 meter sprint in the streamliner division. The oil crises of the 1970s sparked a resurgence in cycling coincident with the arrival of these &quot;new&quot; designs.

A parallel but somewhat separate scene grew up in Europe, with the first European human power championships being held in 1983. The European scene was more dominated by competition than was the US, with the result that European bikes are more likely to be low SWB machines, while LWB are much more popular in the US (although there have been some notable European LWB bikes, such as the Peer Gynt).

=== In the 1980s ===

In 1984, Linear Recumbents of Iowa began producing bicycles. In 2002, Linear Manufacturing&#x27;s assets were bought by Bicycle Man LLC and moved to New York. Since then owner Peter Stull has been working with senior engineering students at Alfred University, local engineers and machinists utilizing available technology including computer FEA testing to improve their recumbent bikes.

In the UK in the 1980s, the most publicised recumbent cycle in the UK was the delta configuration, sometime electrically powered Sinclair C5. Although sold as an &quot;electric car&quot;, the C5 could be characterised as a recumbent tricycle with electrical assistance.

A study by Bussolari and Nadel (1989) led them to pick a recumbent riding position for the Daedalus flight even though the English Channel crossing was accomplished in the Gossamer Albatross with an upright position. Drela in 1998 confirmed &quot;that there was no significant difference in power output between recumbent and conventional bicycling.&quot;

=== In the 2000s ===
Three of the largest recumbent manufacturers in the US went out of business after the 1990s, including BikeE (August 2002), ATP-Vision (early 2004) and Burley Design Cooperative (September 2006).

==Performance==

Over distances recumbent bicycles outperform upright bicycles as evidenced by their dominance in ultra-distance events like 24 hours at Sebring. Official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association. A number of records are recognised, the fastest of which is the &quot;flying 200 m&quot;, a distance of 200 m on level ground from a flying start with a maximum allowable tailwind of 1.66 m/s. The current record is , set by Todd Reichert of Canada in a fully faired front-wheel-drive recumbent lowracer bicycle. The official record for an upright bicycle under IHPVA-legal conditions (but at sea level, not high altitude) is set by Jim Glover in 1986 with an English-made Moulton bicycle with a USA-made hardshell fairing around him and the bike.

The IHPVA hour record is , set by Sam Whittingham on 19 July 2009. The latest known hour record is 92.432 km kilometers (57.434 miles), set by Francesco Russo of Switzerland, using Metastretto on the DEKRA Test Oval track in Klettwitz, Germany, 26.06.2016

The equivalent record for an upright bicycle is , set by Victor Campenaerts in 2019. The UCI no longer considers the bike Chris Boardman rode for his 1996 record to be in compliance with its definition of an upright bicycle. Boardman&#x27;s Monocoque bike was designed by Mike Burrows, whose Windcheetah recumbent trike (see above) also holds the record from Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats, in 41 h 4 min 22 s with Andy Wilkinson riding.

In 2003, Rob English took on and beat the UK 4-man pursuit champions VC St Raphael in a 4000 m challenge race at Reading, beating them by a margin of 4 min 55.5 s to 5 min 6.87 s – and dropping one of the St Raphael riders along the way.

In 2009 Team RANS won the Race Across America (RAAM) on recumbents.

<text>An igloo (Inuit languages: , Inuktitut syllabics (plural: )), also known as a snow house or snow hut, is a type of shelter built of suitable snow.

Although igloos are often associated with all Inuit, they were traditionally used only by the people of Canada&#x27;s Central Arctic and the Qaanaaq area of Greenland. Other Inuit tended to use snow to insulate their houses, which were constructed from whalebone and hides. 

Snow is used because the air pockets trapped in it make it an insulator. On the outside, temperatures may be as low as , but on the inside, the temperature may range from when warmed by body heat alone.

==Nomenclature==
In the Inuit languages, the word (plural ) can be used for a house or home built of any material. The word is not restricted exclusively to snowhouses (called specifically , plural ), but includes traditional tents, sod houses, homes constructed of driftwood and modern buildings. Outside Inuit culture, however, &quot;igloo&quot; refers exclusively to shelters constructed from blocks of compacted snow, generally in the form of a dome.

Several Inuit language dialects throughout the Canadian Arctic (Sallirmiutun (Siglitun), Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmiutut, Kivalliq, North Baffin) use for all buildings, including snowhouses, and it is the term used by the government of Nunavut. An exception to this is the dialect used in the Igloolik region of Nunavut. is used for other buildings, while , (plural , Inuktitut syllabics: ) is specifically used for a snowhouse.

==Types==
There are three traditional types of igloos. Each has a different size from small to large and is used for a different purpose.

The smallest-sized igloos are constructed as temporary shelters. They are usually used for one or two nights, and therefore, are easier to build. On rare occasions, these small types of igloos are used during hunting trips which are often on open sea ice.

Intermediate-sized igloos were for semi-permanent, family dwelling. This was usually a single room dwelling that housed one or two families. Often there were several of these in a small area, which formed an Inuit village.

The largest-sized igloos were normally built in groups of two. One of the buildings was a temporary structure built for special occasions, while the other one was built nearby for living. These large igloos could have up to five rooms and house 20 people. A large igloo could be constructed from several smaller igloos attached by their tunnels, giving common access to the outside. These large igloos were used to hold community feasts and traditional dances.

==Construction==
Snow igloos are not spherical, but are built in a catenary, a curved shape more closely resembling a paraboloid. Using this shape, the stresses of snow as it ages and compresses are less likely to cause it to buckle because in an inverted paraboloid or catenoid the pressures are nearer to being exclusively compressive.

The individual snow bricks are cut out of the ground with saws and machete-like blades. They are originally cut out in a four-sided shape. However, later the snow bricks are often cut into five- or six-sided shapes to increase structural interlocking, similar to the stones used in the architecture of the Inca Empire.

Igloos gradually become shorter with time due to the compressive creep of the snow.

==Building methods==
The snow used to build an igloo must have enough structural strength to be cut and stacked appropriately. The best snow to use for this purpose is snow which has been blown by wind, which can serve to compact and interlock the ice crystals. Snow that has settled gently to the ground in still weather is not useful. The hole left in the snow, where the blocks are cut, is usually used as the lower half of the shelter.

Snow&#x27;s insulating properties enable the inside of the igloo to remain relatively warm. In some cases, a single block of clear freshwater ice is inserted to allow light into the igloo. Igloos used as winter shelters had beds made of loose snow, skins, and caribou furs. Sometimes, a short tunnel is constructed at the entrance, to reduce wind and heat loss when the door is opened. Animal skins or a snow block can be used as a door.

The igloo is architecturally unique in that it is a dome that can be raised out of independent blocks leaning on each other and polished to fit without an additional supporting structure during construction. An igloo that is built correctly will support the weight of a person standing on the roof.

Traditionally, an igloo might be deliberately consolidated immediately after construction by making a large flame with a (, stone lamp), briefly making the interior very hot, which causes the walls to melt slightly and settle. Body heat is also adequate, although slower. This melting and refreezing builds up a layer of ice that contributes to the strength of the igloo.

The sleeping platform is a raised area. With warmer air rising and cooler air settling, the entrance area acts as a cold trap whereas the sleeping area will hold whatever heat is generated by a stove, lamp, body heat, or other device. The Central Inuit, especially those around the Davis Strait, lined the living area with skin, which could increase the temperature within from around to .

<text>A dome () is an architectural element similar to the hollow upper half of a sphere. There is significant overlap with the term cupola, which may also refer to a dome or a structure on top of a dome. The precise definition of a dome has been a matter of controversy and there are a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them.

A dome can rest directly upon a rotunda wall, a drum, or a system of squinches or pendentives used to accommodate the transition in shape from a rectangular or square space to the round or polygonal base of the dome. The dome&#x27;s apex may be closed or may be open in the form of an oculus, which may itself be covered with a roof lantern and cupola.

Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory. Domes were built in ancient Mesopotamia, and they have been found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese architecture in the ancient world, as well as among a number of indigenous building traditions throughout the world. Dome structures were common in both Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, which influenced that of the rest of Europe and Islam in the Middle Ages. The domes of European Renaissance architecture spread from Italy in the early modern period, while domes were frequently employed in Ottoman architecture at the same time. Baroque and Neoclassical architecture took inspiration from Roman domes.

Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques resulted in new dome types. Domes have been constructed over the centuries from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic. The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary, celestial, and governmental traditions that have likewise altered over time. The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;dome&quot; ultimately derives from the ancient Greek and Latin &quot;domus&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), which, up through the Renaissance, labeled a revered house, such as a &quot;Domus Dei&quot;, or &quot;House of God&quot;, regardless of the shape of its roof. This is reflected in the uses of the Italian word &quot;duomo&quot;, the German/Icelandic/Danish word &quot;dom&quot; (&quot;cathedral&quot;), and the English word &quot;dome&quot; as late as 1656, when it meant a &quot;Town-House, Guild-Hall, State-House, and Meeting-House in a city.&quot; The French word &quot;dosme&quot; came to acquire the meaning of a cupola vault, specifically, by 1660. This French definition gradually became the standard usage of the English &quot;dome&quot; in the eighteenth century as many of the most impressive Houses of God were built with monumental domes, and in response to the scientific need for more technical terms.

== Definitions ==
Across the ancient world, curved-roof structures that would today be called domes had a number of different names reflecting a variety of shapes, traditions, and symbolic associations. The shapes were derived from traditions of pre-historic shelters made from various impermanent pliable materials and were only later reproduced as vaulting in more durable materials. The hemispherical shape often associated with domes today derives from Greek geometry and Roman standardization, but other shapes persisted, including a pointed and bulbous tradition inherited by some early Islamic mosques.

Modern academic study of the topic has been controversial and confused by inconsistent definitions, such as those for cloister vaults and domical vaults. Dictionary definitions of the term &quot;dome&quot; are often general and imprecise. Generally-speaking, it &quot;is non-specific, a blanket-word to describe an hemispherical or similar spanning element.&quot; Published definitions include: hemispherical roofs alone; revolved arches; and vaults on a circular base alone, circular or polygonal base, circular, elliptical, or polygonal base, or an undefined area. Definitions specifying vertical sections include: semicircular, pointed, or bulbous; semicircular, segmental or pointed; semicircular, segmental, pointed, or bulbous; semicircular, segmental, elliptical, or bulbous; and high profile, hemispherical, or flattened.
Sometimes called &quot;false&quot; domes, corbel domes achieve their shape by extending each horizontal layer of stones inward slightly farther than the lower one until they meet at the top. A &quot;false&quot; dome may also refer to a wooden dome. The Italian use of the term &quot;finto&quot;, meaning &quot;false&quot;, can be traced back to the 17th century in the use of vaulting made of reed mats and gypsum mortar. &quot;True&quot; domes are said to be those whose structure is in a state of compression, with constituent elements of wedge-shaped voussoirs, the joints of which align with a central point. The validity of this is unclear, as domes built underground with corbelled stone layers are in compression from the surrounding earth.

The precise definition of &quot;pendentive&quot; has also been a source of academic contention, such as whether or not corbelling is permitted under the definition and whether or not the lower portions of a sail vault should be considered pendentives. Domes with pendentives can be divided into two kinds: &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;compound&quot;. In the case of the &quot;simple dome&quot;, the pendentives are part of the same sphere as the dome itself; however, such domes are rare. In the case of the more common &quot;compound dome&quot;, the pendentives are part of the surface of a larger sphere below that of the dome itself and form a circular base for either the dome or a drum section.

The fields of engineering and architecture have lacked common language for domes, with engineering focused on structural behavior and architecture focused on form and symbolism. Additionally, new materials and structural systems in the 20th century have allowed for large dome-shaped structures that deviate from the traditional compressive structural behavior of masonry domes. Popular usage of the term has expanded to mean &quot;almost any long-span roofing system&quot;.

== Elements ==

The word &quot;cupola&quot; is another word for &quot;dome&quot;, and is usually used for a small dome upon a roof or turret. &quot;Cupola&quot; has also been used to describe the inner side of a dome. The top of a dome is the &quot;crown&quot;. The inner side of a dome is called the &quot;intrados&quot; and the outer side is called the &quot;extrados&quot;. As with arches, the &quot;springing&quot; of a dome is the base level from which the dome rises and the &quot;haunch&quot; is the part that lies roughly halfway between the base and the top. Domes can be supported by an elliptical or circular wall called a &quot;drum&quot;. If this structure extends to ground level, the round building may be called a &quot;rotunda&quot;. Drums are also called &quot;tholobates&quot; and may or may not contain windows. A &quot;tambour&quot; or &quot;lantern&quot; is the equivalent structure over a dome&#x27;s oculus, supporting a cupola.

When the base of the dome does not match the plan of the supporting walls beneath it (for example, a dome&#x27;s circular base over a square bay), techniques are employed to bridge the two. One technique is to use corbelling, progressively projecting horizontal layers from the top of the supporting wall to the base of the dome, such as the corbelled triangles often used in Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The simplest technique is to use diagonal lintels across the corners of the walls to create an octagonal base. Another is to use arches to span the corners, which can support more weight. A variety of these techniques use what are called &quot;squinches&quot;. A squinch can be a single arch or a set of multiple projecting nested arches placed diagonally over an internal corner. Squinch forms also include trumpet arches, niche heads (or half-domes), trumpet arches with &quot;anteposed&quot; arches, and muqarnas arches. Squinches transfer the weight of a dome across the gaps created by the corners and into the walls. Pendentives are triangular sections of a sphere, like concave spandrels between arches, and transition from the corners of a square bay to the circular base of a dome. The curvature of the pendentives is that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the diagonal of the square bay. Pendentives concentrate the weight of a dome into the corners of the bay.

== Materials ==
The earliest domes in the Middle East were built with mud-brick and, eventually, with baked brick and stone. Domes of wood allowed for wide spans due to the relatively light and flexible nature of the material and were the normal method for domed churches by the 7th century, although most domes were built with the other less flexible materials. Wooden domes were protected from the weather by roofing, such as copper or lead sheeting. Domes of cut stone were more expensive and never as large, and timber was used for large spans where brick was unavailable.

Roman concrete used an aggregate of stone with a powerful mortar. The aggregate transitioned over the centuries to pieces of fired clay, then to Roman bricks. By the sixth century, bricks with large amounts of mortar were the principle vaulting materials. Pozzolana appears to have only been used in central Italy. Brick domes were the favored choice for large-space monumental coverings until the Industrial Age, due to their convenience and dependability. Ties and chains of iron or wood could be used to resist stresses.

In the Middle East and Central Asia, domes and drums constructed from mud brick and baked brick were sometimes covered with brittle ceramic tiles on the exterior to protect against rain and snow.

The new building materials of the 19th century and a better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre-stressed concrete eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled much thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.

Experimental rammed earth domes were made as part of work on sustainable architecture at the University of Kassel in 1983.

== Shapes and internal forces ==
A masonry dome produces thrusts downward and outward. They are thought of in terms of two kinds of forces at right angles from one another: meridional forces (like the meridians, or lines of longitude, on a globe) are compressive only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of latitude on a globe) are in compression at the top and tension at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top. The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials. Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their haunches.

The outward thrusts in the lower portion of a hemispherical masonry dome can be counteracted with the use of chains incorporated around the circumference or with external buttressing, although cracking along the meridians is natural. For small or tall domes with less horizontal thrust, the thickness of the supporting arches or walls can be enough to resist deformation, which is why drums tend to be much thicker than the domes they support.

Unlike voussoir arches, which require support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made a complete and self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit and a range of deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still.

The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces against which masonry is weak. For a particular material, the optimal dome geometry is called the funicular surface, the comparable shape in three dimensions to a catenary curve for a two-dimensional arch. Adding a weight to the top of a pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to more closely match the actual pointed shape of the dome. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate the optimal dome shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms.

== Symbolism ==

According to E. Baldwin Smith, from the late Stone Age the dome-shaped tomb was used as a reproduction of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the stupas of India to the tholos tombs of Iberia. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol.

Domes and tent-canopies were also associated with the heavens in Ancient Persia and the Hellenistic-Roman world. A dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth. An octagon was intermediate between the two. The distinct symbolism of the heavenly or cosmic tent stemming from the royal audience tents of Achaemenid and Indian rulers was adopted by Roman rulers in imitation of Alexander the Great, becoming the imperial baldachin. This probably began with Nero, whose &quot;Golden House&quot; also made the dome a feature of palace architecture.

The dual sepulchral and heavenly symbolism was adopted by early Christians in both the use of domes in architecture and in the ciborium, a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the church altar. The celestial symbolism of the dome, however, was the preeminent one by the Christian era. In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built in front of the mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning. The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations.

== Acoustics ==
Because domes are concave from below, they can reflect sound and create echoes. A dome may have a &quot;whispering gallery&quot; at its base that at certain places transmits distinct sound to other distant places in the gallery. The half-domes over the apses of Byzantine churches helped to project the chants of the clergy. Although this can complement music, it may make speech less intelligible, leading Francesco Giorgi in 1535 to recommend vaulted ceilings for the choir areas of a church, but a flat ceiling filled with as many coffers as possible for where preaching would occur.

Cavities in the form of jars built into the inner surface of a dome may serve to compensate for this interference by diffusing sound in all directions, eliminating echoes while creating a &quot;divine effect in the atmosphere of worship.&quot; This technique was written about by Vitruvius in his &quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;, which describes bronze and earthenware resonators. The material, shape, contents, and placement of these cavity resonators determine the effect they have: reinforcing certain frequencies or absorbing them.

== Types ==
=== Beehive dome ===

Also called a &quot;corbelled dome&quot;, &quot;cribbed dome&quot;, or &quot;false dome&quot;, these are different from a &#x27;true dome&#x27; in that they consist of purely horizontal layers. As the layers get higher, each is slightly cantilevered, or corbeled, toward the center until meeting at the top. A monumental example is the Mycenaean Treasury of Atreus from the late Bronze Age.

=== Braced dome ===
A single or double layer space frame in the form of a dome, a &quot;braced dome&quot; is a generic term that includes &quot;ribbed&quot;, &quot;Schwedler&quot;, &quot;three-way grid&quot;, &quot;lamella&quot; or &quot;Kiewitt&quot;, &quot;lattice&quot;, and &quot;geodesic domes&quot;. The different terms reflect different arrangements in the surface members. Braced domes often have a very low weight and are usually used to cover spans of up to 150 meters. Often prefabricated, their component members can either lie on the dome&#x27;s surface of revolution, or be straight lengths with the connecting points or nodes lying upon the surface of revolution. Single-layer structures are called &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;skeleton&quot; types and double-layer structures are &quot;truss&quot; types, which are used for large spans. When the covering also forms part of the structural system, it is called a &quot;stressed skin&quot; type. The &quot;formed surface&quot; type consists of sheets joined at bent edges to form the structure.

=== Cloister vault ===

Also called &quot;domical vaults&quot; (a term sometimes also applied to sail vaults), &quot;polygonal domes&quot;, &quot;coved domes&quot;, &quot;gored domes&quot;, &quot;segmental domes&quot; (a term sometimes also used for saucer domes), &quot;paneled vaults&quot;, or &quot;pavilion vaults&quot;, these are domes that maintain a polygonal shape in their horizontal cross section. The component curved surfaces of these vaults are called &quot;severies&quot;, &quot;webs&quot;, or &quot;cells&quot;. The earliest known examples date to the first century BC, such as the Tabularium of Rome from 78 BC. Others include the Baths of Antoninus in Carthage (145–160) and the Palatine Chapel at Aachen (13th – 14th century). The most famous example is the Renaissance octagonal dome of Filippo Brunelleschi over the Florence Cathedral. Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, installed an octagonal dome above the West front of his plantation house, Monticello.

=== Compound dome ===
Also called &quot;domes on pendentives&quot; or &quot;pendentive domes&quot; (a term also applied to sail vaults), compound domes have pendentives that support a smaller diameter dome immediately above them, as in the Hagia Sophia, or a drum and dome, as in many Renaissance and post-Renaissance domes, with both forms resulting in greater height.

=== Crossed-arch dome ===
One of the earliest types of ribbed vault, the first known examples are found in the Great Mosque of Córdoba in the 10th century. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs characteristically intersect one another off-center, forming an empty polygonal space in the center. Geometry is a key element of the designs, with the octagon being perhaps the most popular shape used. Whether the arches are structural or purely decorative remains a matter of debate. The type may have an eastern origin, although the issue is also unsettled. Examples are found in Spain, North Africa, Armenia, Iran, France, and Italy.

=== Ellipsoidal dome ===
The ellipsoidal dome is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a semi-ellipse. Like other &quot;rotational domes&quot; formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, ellipsoidal domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of &quot;circular dome&quot; for that reason.

=== Geodesic dome ===

&quot;Geodesic domes&quot; are the upper portion of geodesic spheres. They are composed of a framework of triangles in a polyhedron pattern. The structures are named for geodesics and are based upon geometric shapes such as icosahedrons, octahedrons or tetrahedrons. Such domes can be created using a limited number of simple elements and joints and efficiently resolve a dome&#x27;s internal forces. Their efficiency is said to increase with size. Although not first invented by Buckminster Fuller, they are associated with him because he designed many geodesic domes and patented them in the United States.

=== Hemispherical dome ===
The &quot;hemispherical dome&quot; is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a semicircle. Like other &quot;rotational domes&quot; formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, hemispherical domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of &quot;circular dome&quot; for that reason. They experience vertical compression along their meridians, but horizontally experience compression only in the portion above 51.8 degrees from the top. Below this point, hemispherical domes experience tension horizontally, and usually require buttressing to counteract it. According to E. Baldwin Smith, it was a shape likely known to the Assyrians, defined by Greek theoretical mathematicians, and standardized by Roman builders.

=== Onion dome ===
&quot;Bulbous domes&quot; bulge out beyond their base diameters, offering a profile greater than a hemisphere. An &quot;onion dome&quot; is a greater than hemispherical dome with a pointed top in an ogee profile. They are found in the Near East, Middle East, Persia, and India and may not have had a single point of origin. Their appearance in northern Russian architecture predates the Tatar occupation of Russia and so is not easily explained as the result of that influence. They became popular in the second half of the 15th century in the Low Countries of Northern Europe, possibly inspired by the finials of minarets in Egypt and Syria, and developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Netherlands before spreading to Germany, becoming a popular element of the baroque architecture of Central Europe. German bulbous domes were also influenced by Russian and Eastern European domes. The examples found in various European architectural styles are typically wooden. Examples include Kazan Church in Kolomenskoye and the Brighton Pavilion by John Nash. In Islamic architecture, they are typically made of masonry, rather than timber, with the thick and heavy bulging portion serving to buttress against the tendency of masonry domes to spread at their bases. The Taj Mahal is a famous example.

=== Oval dome ===

An &quot;oval dome&quot; is a dome of oval shape in plan, profile, or both. The term comes from the Latin &quot;ovum&quot;, meaning &quot;egg&quot;. The earliest oval domes were used by convenience in corbelled stone huts as rounded but geometrically undefined coverings, and the first examples in Asia Minor date to around 4000 B.C. The geometry was eventually defined using combinations of circular arcs, transitioning at points of tangency. If the Romans created oval domes, it was only in exceptional circumstances. The Roman foundations of the oval plan Church of St. Gereon in Cologne point to a possible example. Domes in the Middle Ages also tended to be circular, though the church of Santo Tomás de las Ollas in Spain has an oval dome over its oval plan. Other examples of medieval oval domes can be found covering rectangular bays in churches. Oval plan churches became a type in the Renaissance and popular in the Baroque style. The dome built for the basilica of Vicoforte by Francesco Gallo was one of the largest and most complex ever made. Although the ellipse was known, in practice, domes of this shape were created by combining segments of circles. Popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, oval and elliptical plan domes can vary their dimensions in three axes or two axes. A sub-type with the long axis having a semicircular section is called a Murcia dome, as in the Chapel of the Junterones at Murcia Cathedral. When the short axis has a semicircular section, it is called a Melon dome.

=== Paraboloid dome ===
A paraboloid dome is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a sector of a parabola. Like other &quot;rotational domes&quot; formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, paraboloid domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of &quot;circular dome&quot; for that reason. Because of their shape, paraboloid domes experience only compression, both radially and horizontally.

=== Sail dome ===
Also called &quot;sail vaults&quot;, &quot;handkerchief vaults&quot;, &quot;domical vaults&quot; (a term sometimes also applied to cloister vaults), &quot;pendentive domes&quot; (a term that has also been applied to compound domes), &quot;Bohemian vaults&quot;, or &quot;Byzantine domes&quot;, this type can be thought of as pendentives that, rather than merely touching each other to form a circular base for a drum or compound dome, smoothly continue their curvature to form the dome itself. The dome gives the impression of a square sail pinned down at each corner and billowing upward. These can also be thought of as saucer domes upon pendentives. Sail domes are based upon the shape of a hemisphere and are not to be confused with elliptic parabolic vaults, which appear similar but have different characteristics. In addition to semicircular sail vaults there are variations in geometry such as a low rise to span ratio or covering a rectangular plan. Sail vaults of all types have a variety of thrust conditions along their borders, which can cause problems, but have been widely used from at least the sixteenth century. The second floor of the Llotja de la Seda is covered by a series of nine meter wide sail vaults.

=== Saucer dome ===
Also called &quot;segmental domes&quot; (a term sometimes also used for cloister vaults), or &quot;calottes&quot;, these have profiles of less than half a circle. Because they reduce the portion of the dome in tension, these domes are strong but have increased radial thrust. Many of the largest existing domes are of this shape.

Masonry saucer domes, because they exist entirely in compression, can be built much thinner than other dome shapes without becoming unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased horizontal thrust at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they are more vulnerable to damage from movement in their supports.

=== Umbrella dome ===
Also called &quot;gadrooned&quot;, &quot;fluted&quot;, &quot;organ-piped&quot;, &quot;pumpkin&quot;, &quot;melon&quot;, &quot;ribbed&quot;, &quot;parachute&quot;, &quot;scalloped&quot;, or &quot;lobed&quot; domes, these are a type of dome divided at the base into curved segments, which follow the curve of the elevation. &quot;Fluted&quot; may refer specifically to this pattern as an external feature, such as was common in Mamluk Egypt. The &quot;ribs&quot; of a dome are the radial lines of masonry that extend from the crown down to the springing. The central dome of the Hagia Sophia uses the ribbed method, which accommodates a ring of windows between the ribs at the base of the dome. The central dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica also uses this method.

== History ==

=== Early history and simple domes ===

Cultures from pre-history to modern times constructed domed dwellings using local materials. Although it is not known when the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. The earliest discovered may be four small dwellings made of Mammoth tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in Mezhirich, Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more. They date from 19,280 – 11,700 BC.

In modern times, the creation of relatively simple dome-like structures has been documented among various indigenous peoples around the world. The wigwam was made by Native Americans using arched branches or poles covered with grass or hides. The Efé people of central Africa construct similar structures, using leaves as shingles. Another example is the igloo, a shelter built from blocks of compact snow and used by the Inuit, among others. The Himba people of Namibia construct &quot;desert igloos&quot; of wattle and daub for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor. Extraordinarily thin domes of sun-baked clay 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from Cameroon.

The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early Mesopotamia may explain the existence of domes in both China and the West in the first millennium BC. Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.

Corbelled stone domes have been found from the Neolithic period in the ancient Near East, and in the Middle East to Western Europe from antiquity. The kings of Achaemenid Persia held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. Simple domical mausoleums existed in the Hellenistic period. Indian bas-relief sculptures from Sāñcī (1st century BC), Bhārhut (2nd century BC), and Amarāvatī (2nd century BC), show domed huts, shrines, and pavilions. The remains of a large domed circular hall in the Parthian capital city of Nyssa has been dated to perhaps the first century AD, showing &quot;...the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them.&quot; It likely had a wooden dome.

=== Persian domes ===


Persian architecture likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes. Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the Iranian plateau and Greater Iran, domes were an important part of vernacular architecture throughout Persian history. The Persian invention of the squinch, a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome in a way reliable enough for large constructions and domes moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result. Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.

The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century. The Samanid Mausoleum in Transoxiana dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century.

The Seljuk Empire&#x27;s notables built tomb-towers, called &quot;Turkish Triangles&quot;, as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous. The domed enclosure of the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, built in 1086-7 by Nizam al-Mulk, was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks.

Beginning in the Ilkhanate, Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. The construction of tomb towers decreased. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors.

The domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852–1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside.

=== East Asian domes ===

Very little has survived of ancient Chinese architecture, due to the extensive use of timber as a building material. Brick and stone vaults used in tomb construction have survived, and the corbeled dome was used, rarely, in tombs and temples. The earliest true domes found in Chinese tombs were shallow cloister vaults, called &quot;simian jieding&quot;, derived from the Han use of barrel vaulting. Unlike the cloister vaults of western Europe, the corners are rounded off as they rise. The first known example is a brick tomb dating from the end of the Western Han period, near the modern city of Xiangcheng in Henan Province. These four-sided domes used small interlocking bricks and enabled a square space near the entrance of a tomb large enough for several people that may have been used for funeral ceremonies. The interlocking brick technique was rapidly adopted and four-sided domes became widespread outside Henan by the end of the first century AD.

A model of a tomb found with a shallow true dome from the late Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) can be seen at the Guangzhou Museum (Canton). Another, the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb, found in Hong Kong in 1955, has a design common among Eastern Han dynasty (25 AD – 220 AD) tombs in South China: a barrel vaulted entrance leading to a domed front hall with barrel vaulted chambers branching from it in a cross shape. It is the only such tomb that has been found in Hong Kong and is exhibited as part of the Hong Kong Museum of History.

During the Three Kingdoms period (220–280), the &quot;cross-joint dome&quot; (&quot;siyuxuanjinshi&quot;) was developed under the Wu and Western Jin dynasties south of the Yangtze River, with arcs building out from the corners of a square room until they met and joined at the center. These domes were stronger, had a steeped angle, and could cover larger areas than the relatively shallow cloister vaults. Over time, they were made taller and wider. There were also corbel vaults, called &quot;diese&quot;, although these are the weakest type. Some tombs of the Song dynasty (960–1279) have beehive domes.

The Seokguram Grotto (751), built in the Korean city of Gyeongju during the Unified Silla period, includes a domed chamber 7.2 meters wide covering a statue of the Buddha. The dome is made from blocks of granite, with the flat cap of the dome decorated with a lotus flower motif. The dome is unique in north-east Asia.

The Buddhism monastery Baoguo near Ningbo has three domes dated to 1013. The Daoist monastery Yongle Gong in Shanxi has domes in its Hall of the Three Purities, from the 13th century.

The Fenghuang Mosque in Hangzhou has three domes along its back wall dating to the Yuan dynasty. The central dome is 8 meters in diameter and covered by an octagonal roof. The north and south flanking domes are 6.8 meters and 7.2 meters wide, respectively, and covered by hexagonal roofs. The zones of transition under the domes use a tiered system similar to muqarnas or the corner bracketing found in Chinese temples.

=== Roman and Byzantine domes ===


Roman domes are found in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. oculi are common features. They are customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. To buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof.

Domes reached monumental size in the Roman Imperial period. Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD. The growth of domed construction increases under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally-planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. The Pantheon, a temple in Rome completed by Emperor Hadrian as part of the Baths of Agrippa, is the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome. Segmented domes, made of radially concave wedges or of alternating concave and flat wedges, appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of this style date from this period.

In the 3rd century, Imperial mausoleums began to be built as domed rotundas, rather than as tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late third and early fourth centuries. In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed, including advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. Baptisteries began to be built in the manner of domed mausoleums during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world.

With the end of the Western Roman Empire, domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman — or &quot;Byzantine&quot; — Empire. 6th-century church building by the Emperor Justinian used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale, and his architects made the domed brick-vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east. This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a &quot;Byzantine&quot; architecture. Justinian&#x27;s Hagia Sophia was an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs.
&quot;Cross-domed units&quot;, a more secure structural system created by bracing a dome on all four sides with broad arches, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture. The Cross-in-square plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843–1204). It is the most common church plan from the tenth century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.

In the Byzantine period, domes were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. All of the surviving examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.

=== Arabic and Western European domes ===
The Syria and Palestine area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as &quot;conoid&quot;, or similar to pine cones. When the Arab Muslim forces conquered the region, they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of Islam. In addition to religious shrines, such as the Dome of the Rock, domes were used over the audience and throne halls of Umayyad palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the calderia of baths. Blending the architectural features of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, the domes used both pendentives and squinches and were made in a variety of shapes and materials. Although architecture in the region would decline following the movement of the capital to Iraq under the Abbasids in 750, mosques built after a revival in the late 11th century usually followed the Umayyad model. Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the Umayyad period. They were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century.

Italian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans. With the crowning of Charlemagne as a new Roman Emperor, Byzantine influences were largely replaced in a revival of earlier Western building traditions. Occasional exceptions include examples of early quincunx churches at Milan and near Cassino. Another is the Palatine Chapel. Its domed octagon design was influenced by Byzantine models. It was the largest dome north of the Alps at that time. Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily served as outposts of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy.

The Great Mosque of Córdoba contains the first known examples of the crossed-arch dome type. The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries. After the ninth century, mosques in North Africa often have a small decorative dome over the mihrab. Additional domes are sometimes used at the corners of the mihrab wall, at the entrance bay, or on the square tower minarets. Egypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century. Fatimid mausoleums were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid &quot;keel&quot; shape profile.

Domes in Romanesque architecture are generally found within crossing towers at the intersection of a church&#x27;s nave and transept, which conceal the domes externally. They are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base. They appear &quot;in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe&quot; between 1050 and 1100. The Crusades, beginning in 1095, also appear to have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The Knights Templar, headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence. In southwest France, there are over 250 domed Romanesque churches in the Périgord region alone. The use of pendentives to support domes in the Aquitaine region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence. Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall steeple, but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque.

Star-shaped domes found at the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, the Hall of the Abencerrajes (c. 1333–91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333–54), are extraordinarily developed examples of muqarnas domes. In the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of Mamluk Egypt and, over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk sultans and emirs. Dome profiles were varied, with &quot;keel-shaped&quot;, bulbous, ogee, stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were chamfered, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows were used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces. Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century. In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the Near East exposed the Low Countries of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the Orient and such domes apparently became associated with the city of Jerusalem. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.

=== Russian domes ===

The multidomed church is a typical form of Russian church architecture that distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;, were multi-domed, which has led some historians to speculate about how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked. Examples of these early churches are the 13-domed wooden Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (989) and the 25-domed stone Desyatinnaya Church in Kiev (989–996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in Russian architecture, for example 13 domes symbolize Christ with 12 Apostles, while 25 domes means the same with an additional 12 Prophets of the Old Testament. The multiple domes of Russian churches were often comparatively smaller than Byzantine domes.
Plentiful timber in Russia made wooden domes common and at least partially contributed to the popularity of onion domes, which were easier to shape in wood than in masonry. The earliest stone churches in Russia featured Byzantine style domes, however by the Early Modern era the onion dome had become the predominant form in traditional Russian architecture. The onion dome is a dome whose shape resembles an onion, after which they are named. Such domes are often larger in diameter than the drums they sit on, and their height usually exceeds their width. The whole bulbous structure tapers smoothly to a point. Though the earliest preserved Russian domes of such type date from the 16th century, illustrations from older chronicles indicate they have existed since the late 13th century. Like tented roofs—which were combined with, and sometimes replaced domes in Russian architecture since the 16th century—onion domes initially were used only in wooden churches. Builders introduced them into stone architecture much later, and continued to make their carcasses of either of wood or metal on top of masonry drums.

Russian domes are often gilded or brightly painted. A dangerous technique of chemical gilding using mercury had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, most notably in the giant dome of Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral. The more modern and safe method of gold electroplating was applied for the first time in gilding the domes of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, the tallest Eastern Orthodox church in the world.

===Ukrainian domes===
The domes of the Saint Sophia Cathedral and Dormition Cathedral were remodeled to the helmet-shaped baroque style by Ivan Mazepa in the early 18th century, who also paid for gilding of the domes. Mazepa&#x27;s reign also included the construction of an octagonal western bay with a baroque dome (1672) and five helmet-shaped domes over Boris and Gleb Cathedral in Chernihiv, which were removed in the 20th century by the Soviet government.

=== Ottoman domes ===
The rise of the Ottoman Empire and its spread in Asia Minor and the Balkans coincided with the decline of the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantine Empire. Early Ottoman buildings, for almost two centuries after 1300, were characterized by a blending of Ottoman culture and indigenous architecture, and the pendentive dome was used throughout the empire. The Byzantine dome form was adopted and further developed. Ottoman architecture made exclusive use of the semi-spherical dome for vaulting over even very small spaces, influenced by the earlier traditions of both Byzantine Anatolia and Central Asia. The smaller the structure, the simpler the plan, but mosques of medium size were also covered by single domes.

Early experiments with large domes include the domed square mosques of Çine and Mudurnu under Bayezid I, and the later domed &quot;zawiya-mosques&quot; at Bursa. The Üç Şerefeli Mosque at Edirne developed the idea of the central dome being a larger version of the domed modules used throughout the rest of the structure to generate open space. This idea became important to the Ottoman style as it developed.
The Bayezid II Mosque (1501–1506) in Istanbul begins the classical period in Ottoman architecture, in which the great imperial mosques, with variations, resemble the former Byzantine basilica of Hagia Sophia in having a large central dome with semi-domes of the same span to the east and west. Hagia Sophia&#x27;s central dome arrangement is largely reproduced in three Ottoman mosques in Istanbul: the Bayezid II Mosque, the Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque, and the Süleymaniye Mosque. Other Imperial mosques in Istanbul added semi-domes to the north and south, doing away with the basilica plan, starting with the Şehzade Mosque and seen again in later examples such as the Sultan Ahmed I Mosque and the Yeni Cami. The classical period lasted into the 17th century but its peak is associated with the architect Mimar Sinan in the 16th century. In addition to large imperial mosques, he designed hundreds of other monuments, including medium-sized mosques such as the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque, and Rüstem Pasha Mosque and the tomb of Suleiman the Magnificent, with its double-shell dome. The Süleymaniye Mosque, built from 1550 to 1557, has a main dome 53 meters high with a diameter of 26.5 meters. At the time it was built, the dome was the highest in the Ottoman Empire when measured from sea level, but lower from the floor of the building and smaller in diameter than that of the nearby Hagia Sophia.

Another classical domed mosque type is, like the Byzantine church of Sergius and Bacchus, the domed polygon within a square. Octagons and hexagons were common, such as those of the Üç Şerefeli Mosque (1437–1447) and the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. The Selimiye Mosque was the first structure built by the Ottomans that had a larger dome than that of the Hagia Sophia. The dome rises above a square bay. Corner semi-domes convert this into an octagon, which muqarnas transition to a circular base. The dome has an average internal diameter of about 31.5 meters, while that of Hagia Sophia averages 31.3 meters. Designed and built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1574, when he finished it he was 86 years old, and he considered the mosque his masterpiece.

=== Italian Renaissance domes ===
Filippo Brunelleschi&#x27;s octagonal brick domical vault over Florence Cathedral was built between 1420 and 1436 and the lantern surmounting the dome was completed in 1467. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer. A combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century. Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome and then Venice. Brunelleschi&#x27;s domes at San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture. His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence&#x27;s Basilica of Santa Croce (1430–52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry&#x27;s supreme form. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential.

&quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;, written by Leon Battista Alberti around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. This would culminate in Bramante&#x27;s 1505–06 projects for a wholly new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, marking the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century. Bramante&#x27;s initial design was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a quincunx pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years. The dome was completed by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. The publication of Sebastiano Serlio&#x27;s treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture throughout Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe.

The Villa Capra, also known as &quot;La Rotunda&quot;, was built by Andrea Palladio from 1565 to 1569 near Vicenza. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it proved highly influential on the Georgian architects of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, Thomas Jefferson among them. Palladio&#x27;s two domed churches in Venice are San Giorgio Maggiore (1565–1610) and Il Redentore (1577–92), the latter built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of plague in the city. The spread of the Renaissance-style dome outside of Italy began with central Europe, although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two.

=== South Asian domes ===
Hemispherical rock-cut tombs appear to imitate in stone the early bamboo or timber roofed domed huts with central poles known from the pre-Buddhist period. Examples include Sudama cave (3rd century BC) in Bihar, a similar domed chamber at Cannanora in Malabar, and a cave at Guntpalle (1st century BC). A rock-cut hemispherical chamber at Manappuram in Kerala retained a thin central pillar with no structural function. The hemispherical shape of Buddist stupas, likely refined forms of burial mounds, may also reflect earlier wooden dome roof construction, such as at Ghantasala.

Islamic rule over northern and central India brought with it the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used at the base of domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.

The earliest examples include the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. Under the Lodi dynasty there was a large proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture can be seen in the dome shape of the Taj Mahal: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples. The Gol Gumbaz, or &quot;Round Dome&quot;, is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was the most technically advanced built in the Deccan. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753–54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.

=== Early modern period domes ===
In the early sixteenth century, the lantern of the Italian dome spread to Germany, gradually adopting the bulbous cupola from the Netherlands. Russian architecture strongly influenced the many bulbous domes of the wooden churches of Bohemia and Silesia and, in Bavaria, bulbous domes less resemble Dutch models than Russian ones. Domes like these gained in popularity in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in the Baroque style, and influenced many bulbous cupolas in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period. However, many bulbous domes in eastern Europe were replaced over time in the larger cities during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles.

The construction of domes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions rather than the architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details. This was adequate for domes up to medium size, with diameters in the range of 12 to 20 meters. Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials and the size of the dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure.

Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, developments in mathematics and the study of statics led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the catenary curve. Robert Hooke, who first articulated that a catenary arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Wren&#x27;s structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century. The ribs in Guarino Guarini&#x27;s San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as catenary arches. The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him. He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists. Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the Rococo period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives.

In the eighteenth century, the study of dome structures changed radically, with domes being considered as a composition of smaller elements, each subject to mathematical and mechanical laws and easier to analyse individually, rather than being considered as whole units unto themselves. Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the Neo-Classical style. In the United States, most public buildings in the late 18th century were only distinguishable from private residences because they featured cupolas.

=== Modern period domes ===

The historicism of the 19th century led to many domes being re-translations of the great domes of the past, rather than further stylistic developments, especially in sacred architecture. New production techniques allowed for cast iron and wrought iron to be produced both in larger quantities and at relatively low prices during the Industrial Revolution. Russia, which had large supplies of iron, has some of the earliest examples of iron&#x27;s architectural use. Excluding those that simply imitated multi-shell masonry, metal framed domes such as the elliptical dome of Royal Albert Hall in London (57 to 67 meters in diameter) and the circular dome of the Halle au Blé in Paris may represent the century&#x27;s chief development of the simple domed form. Cast-iron domes were particularly popular in France.

The practice of building rotating domes for housing large telescopes was begun in the 19th century, with early examples using papier-mâché to minimize weight. Unique glass domes springing straight from ground level were used for hothouses and winter gardens. Elaborate covered shopping arcades included large glazed domes at their cross intersections. The large domes of the 19th century included exhibition buildings and functional structures such as gasometers and locomotive sheds. The &quot;first fully triangulated framed dome&quot; was built in Berlin in 1863 by Johann Wilhelm Schwedler and, by the start of the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common. Vladimir Shukhov was also an early pioneer of what would later be called gridshell structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All-Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition.

Domes built with steel and concrete were able to achieve very large spans. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, a father and son team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using tiles set flat against the surface of the curve and fast-setting Portland cement, which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces. The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by Walther Bauersfeld of two planetarium domes in Jena, Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete. These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural thin shells. These are also considered the first geodesic domes. Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations. Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis.

The first permanent air supported membrane domes were the radar domes designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost eventually led to the development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system. Tensegrity domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century. The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with retractable roofing.

<text>La Ruche (; &quot;the beehive&quot;) was an artist&#x27;s residence in the Montparnasse district of Paris. It now hosts around fifty artists and stages art exhibitions open to the public.

==History==
Located in the Passage Dantzig, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, La Ruche is a three-storey circular structure that got its name because it looked more like a large beehive than a dwelling for humans. Originally a temporary building designed by Gustave Eiffel for use as a wine rotunda at the Great Exposition of 1900, the structure was dismantled and re-erected as low-cost studios for artists by Alfred Boucher (1850–1934), a sculptor, who wanted to help young artists by providing them with shared models and an exhibition space open to all residents. As well as to artists, La Ruche became a home to transients.

At La Ruche the rent was cheap; and no one was evicted for non-payment. When hungry, many would wander over to artist Marie Vassilieff&#x27;s soup kitchen (more genteelly called her &quot;cantine&quot;) for a meal and conversation with fellow starving artists.

==Artists==
Like Montmartre, few places have ever housed such artistic talent as found at La Ruche. At one time or another in those early years of the 20th century, Guillaume Apollinaire, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky, Gustave Miklos, , Ossip Zadkine, Moise Kisling, Marc Chagall, Max Pechstein, Nina Hamnett, Isaac Frenkel Frenel, Fernand Léger, Jacques Lipchitz, Pinchus Kremegne, Max Jacob, Blaise Cendrars, Chaïm Soutine, Robert Delaunay, Amedeo Modigliani, Constantin Brâncuși, Micheal Farrell, Amshey Nurenberg, Diego Rivera, Marevna, Luigi Guardigli, Miklos Bokor, Michel Sima, Marek Szwarc, José Balmes, Gracia Barrios, Wacław Zawadowski, Kazimierz Brandel, and others, called the place home or frequented it. Today, works by some of these poorer residents and their close friends sell well, even in the millions of dollars.

La Ruche went into decline during World War II; and by the time of the 1968 real estate boom, it was threatened with demolition by developers. However, with the support of well known artists such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Alexander Calder, Jean Renoir, and René Char, new management with a preservation mission took over in 1971, and turned it into a collection of working studios.

Its interior is not open to the general public, although many feel that the exterior of La Ruche alone is worth a visit.

<text>Ronald Alfred Goodwin (17 February 19258 January 2003) was an English composer and conductor known for his film music. He scored over 70 films in a career lasting over fifty years. His most famous works included &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, &quot;633 Squadron&quot;, Margaret Rutherford&#x27;s Miss Marple films, and &quot;Frenzy&quot;.

Born in Plymouth, Devon, England, Goodwin learned to play the piano and trumpet from the age of five which allowed him to join the school band. When he was nine, the family moved to Harrow, London, where he attended Willesden County School and Pinner County Grammar School, in Middlesex. From there he went on to study the trumpet in London at the Guildhall School of Music.

Whilst working as a copyist, he formed his own orchestra in his spare time and began arranging and conducting recordings for over fifty performers, which resulted in more than 100 chart successes. He wrote his first feature film score for &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM-British Studios in 1959, Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios.

In the 1980s Goodwin began concentrating on live orchestral performances and appeared as guest conductor with many symphony orchestras at home and abroad including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Goodwin was born in Plymouth to James Goodwin (died 1952), a policeman with the Metropolitan Police Force and Bessie Violet Goodwin née Godsland (died 1966), a clothing machinist and daughter of a labourer. James was originally from London, but had moved to Devon after being assigned to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s No. 3 (Devonport Dockyard) Division, marrying Bessie in her birthplace of Devonport in 1920. 
Goodwin learned to play the piano by the age of five and returned to London four years later, where he attended Willesden County Grammar School. Whilst there, he learnt to play the trumpet and performed regularly in the school band. Upon the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to Harrow, Middlesex, and Goodwin attended Pinner County Grammar School. It was here that he formed his own band – &quot;Ron Goodwin and the Woodchoppers&quot;. He later studied the trumpet in London at the Guildhall School of Music.

=== Early career ===
In 1943, after a brief spell as an insurance clerk, Goodwin joined Campbell, Connelly and Company, a music publisher. His job was a copyist and arranger and went on to work in that role for the BBC. He entered the world of movie music through documentary films, which he said was &quot;a very good training&quot;. He worked as a ghostwriter for Phil Green, Stanley Black, Geraldo and Peter Yorke among others. From 1949, Goodwin conducted for the Polygon company, arranging and conducting recordings of Petula Clark and Jimmy Young, including the latter&#x27;s 1951 UK no 1 hit &quot;Too Young&quot;. In the 1950s he joined Parlophone, and worked alongside George Martin. He accompanied Peter Sellers on his &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; album, and began to broadcast and make records with his Ron Goodwin Concert Orchestra.

In 1953, Goodwin began arranging and conducting more than 300 recordings for over fifty performers, which resulted in more than 100 chart successes. He simultaneously made his own series of recordings and broadcasts as Ron Goodwin and his Concert Orchestra, and, in addition, began to compose scores for documentary films at Merton Park Studios. In 1958, Goodwin wrote his first feature film score for &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM British Studios in 1959, Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios. His singles work included recordings with jazz and calypso singer Frank Holder.

===Works===
Goodwin is primarily known for his film music and worked on more than 70 scores during his career. He composed his first feature film, &quot;Man with a Gun&quot; in 1958 and was quickly followed by &quot;The Witness&quot; and &quot;Whirlpool&quot; a year later. Early minor film success followed with several films until 1961 when he composed scores for the first of four Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford, entitled &quot;Murder, She Said&quot; (1961). He later went on to compose for the remaining three Miss Marple films &quot;Murder at the Gallop&quot; (1963), &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot; (1963) and &quot;Murder Ahoy&quot; (1964). He scored two horror films, &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1960) and its sequel &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; (1964). His music for war films is particularly well remembered. This includes work on &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964), &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), for which he (mostly) replaced William Walton, plus &quot;Force Ten from Navarone&quot; (1978). After requests from the Band of the Royal Air Force, the opening from &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, originally titled &quot;Luftwaffe March&quot;, was retitled &quot;Aces High&quot; and is now regularly played by military bands in the UK.

He wrote the scores for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1964), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972, replacing Henry Mancini), two movies featuring Morecambe and Wise, and the Norman Wisdom film, &quot;The Early Bird&quot; (1965).

Goodwin&#x27;s score for the 1966 film &quot;The Trap&quot; is now used by the BBC as the theme to the London Marathon coverage. A 30-second variation of his 1969 composition for the film &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust&quot; is used as the intro for the BBC Radio Four panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

Goodwin wrote several Disney film scores during the 1970s, including the one used for &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; (1975). He also composed the music and lyrics for a series of animated films. These included &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; (1971), &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (also 1974). Goodwin&#x27;s last film score was for the Danish-made animation film &quot;Valhalla&quot; in 1986. He composed the Yorkshire Television start up music used from their launch in July 1968 to the early 1980s, before ITV had breakfast television.

Goodwin wrote the television advertising jingles such as Noddy&#x27;s chant, &quot;I like Ricicles: they&#x27;re twicicle as nicicles&quot;, and the &quot;Mr Sheen shines umpteen things clean&quot; song, inspired by &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;.

===Later career===
By 1987, Goodwin had begun concentrating on live orchestrations which included his &quot;Drake 400 Suite&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Armada Suite&quot; in 1988. His &quot;New Zealand Suite&quot; in 1983 marked a long association with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Goodwin appeared as guest conductor with many symphony orchestras at home and abroad including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Hallé Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Australian Pops Orchestra, Danish Radio Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Goodwin was guest conductor at the Royal Academy of Music&#x27;s Festival of British and American Film Music in June 1996.

===Awards===
In 1972, Goodwin recorded &quot;Somebody Named Ron Goodwin Plays Somebody Named Burt Bacharach&quot; and recorded internationally, winning gold and platinum discs awarded by EMI. He won a platinum disc from EMI New Zealand to mark two million sales of the album &quot;Going Places&quot;. During his career he won three Ivor Novello Awards, including a lifetime achievement award, and was a Fellow of the City of Leeds College of Music and a Freeman of the City of London.

Goodwin was nominated for the Golden Globe award for best original score for the movie &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972).

==Personal life==
Goodwin was married twice and had a son, Chris, from his first marriage. Ron Shillingford, Goodwin&#x27;s personal assistant for over twenty years, said of him: &quot;Ron was a musical perfectionist who had a fine rapport with his fellow artists. He was a kind, caring man, with a wonderful sense of humour.&quot; Goodwin was enthusiastic about working with young people and was heavily involved with the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra, Worthing Youth Orchestra, City of Leeds College of Music and the City of Birmingham Schools&#x27; Concert Orchestra.

The road in which Goodwin lived with his family in Plymouth has since been renamed Goodwin Crescent in his memory.

===Death===
In December 2002, Goodwin completed his 32nd consecutive year of Christmas concerts in packed venues across the South of England. However, he had suffered from asthma for many years and the condition had worsened with age. On 7 January 2003, having completed conducting a series of Christmas concerts with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, he returned home and died in his sleep at Blacknest Cottage, Brimpton Common, Hampshire, on 8 January 2003, aged 77.
