<text>Golden Earring were a Dutch rock band, founded in 1961 in The Hague as The Tornados. They achieved worldwide fame with their international hit songs &quot;Radar Love&quot; in 1973, which went to number one on the Dutch chart, reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, and went to number thirteen on the United States chart, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; in 1982, and &quot;When the Lady Smiles&quot; in 1984. During their career they had nearly 30 top-ten singles on the Dutch charts and released 25 studio albums.

The band went through a number of early personnel changes until settling on a stable lineup in 1970, consisting of Rinus Gerritsen (bass and keyboards), George Kooymans (vocals and guitar), Barry Hay (vocals, guitar, flute and saxophone), and Cesar Zuiderwijk (drums and percussion), which remained unchanged until the band broke up in 2021 when Kooymans was diagnosed with ALS. A number of other musicians also appeared in short stints with the band over its history.

The band will play a series of five sold-out farewell concerts at the Rotterdam Ahoy in 2026.

==History==
===Early years (1961–1969)===
What became Golden Earring was formed in 1961 in The Hague by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbor, Rinus Gerritsen. Originally called &quot;the Tornados&quot;, the name was changed to the Golden Earrings when they discovered that the name the Tornados was already in use by another group. The name &quot;the Golden Earrings&quot; was taken from an instrumental called &quot;Golden Earrings&quot; performed by the British group the Hunters, for whom they served as opening and closing act. Initially a pop-rock band with Frans Krassenburg on lead vocals and Jaap Eggermont on drums, the Golden Earrings had a hit with their debut single &quot;Please Go&quot;, recorded in 1965. Dissatisfied with Dutch recording studios, the band&#x27;s manager and co-discoverer Fred Haayen arranged for the next single to be recorded at the Pye Records studios in London. The record cut at Pye, &quot;That Day&quot;, reached number two on the Dutch charts. The definite article was dropped from the name in 1967, and the plural &quot;s&quot; was dropped in 1969.

In 1968, Barry Hay joined the band, replacing Krassenburg as frontman. Two years later, the band earned their first number one hit in the Netherlands with the song &quot;Dong Dong Diki Digi Dong&quot;. In the United States, ground work for entering the US market was being laid by East Coast FM radio disc jockey and music critic Neil Kempfer-Stocker, who is credited as the first radio DJ to play the band in the US. This single was followed by a successful psychedelic album &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, which featured a 19-minute version of the title track, a cover of the 1966 hit song by the Byrds. The song, played throughout their US tour, became the core performance of their live shows, and their experience in the US led them to make their studio albums resemble their live shows, rather than the other way around. The band&#x27;s American records during this period were issued by the Perception Records label in New York, and the band&#x27;s &quot;Golden Earring&quot; LP, known as &quot;Wall of Dolls&quot;, and single &quot;Back Home&quot; performed poorly in the US but became a number 1 hit in the Netherlands.

===International fame (1970s and 1980s)===

In 1969, drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk joined the band, completing what has become Golden Earring&#x27;s classic line-up. The band enjoyed brief international fame in the 1970s when the single version of &quot;Radar Love&quot; (1973), from the gold-certified album &quot;Moontan&quot;, became a hit in both Europe and the US. Golden Earring embarked on their first major US tour in 1969–1970. Owing to American influences, their music evolved towards hard rock, and they performed along with Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Procol Harum, and Eric Clapton. Between 1969 and 1984, Golden Earring completed 13 US tours. During this period, they performed as the opening act for Santana, King Crimson, the Doobie Brothers, Rush and .38 Special. During 1973–74, when &quot;Radar Love&quot; was a hit, they had Kiss and Aerosmith as their opening acts.

Golden Earring released the &quot;Live&quot; album in 1977. The album was recorded at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theater.

Golden Earring enjoyed a brief period of US stardom, but were unable to secure further chart success until 1982&#x27;s &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. The music video of the song, directed by Dick Maas, was played on the recently launched MTV, and helped the song to become a US hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard chart.

&quot;When the Lady Smiles&quot; became an international hit in 1984, reaching No. 3 in Canada and becoming the band&#x27;s fifth number one hit in their native country, but was not successful in the United States, reaching no higher than #76 on the US Singles Chart. The video was banned from MTV because of its &quot;unholy desires about a nun and a lobotomy&quot;; this was Dick Maas&#x27;s second video for the band, and helped launch his career as a film director. While touring the US in 1984, the band played at the Great Arena Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey on May 11 and were in the midst of their performance when a fire broke out at the Haunted Castle on the opposite side of the theme park, killing eight teenagers. Following this tour, Golden Earring turned their focus toward Europe where they continued to attract standing-room-only crowds. The group paused briefly after the release of &quot;The Hole&quot; in 1986 to focus on other projects, with Hay and Kooymans both releasing solo albums (&quot;Victory of Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot;, respectively) the following year. The group then reconvened to record their final album of the 1980s, releasing &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; in 1989.

===Later years (1990s–2021)===
In 1991, Golden Earring had another hit in the Netherlands with &quot;Going to the Run&quot;, a rock-ballad about a Hells Angels motorcycle gang member who was a friend of the band and died in a crash. The Russian rock band Aria made a successful cover of &quot;Going to the Run&quot; as &quot;Беспечный ангел&quot; (&quot;Careless Angel&quot;). Between 1992 and 2004, the band released three acoustic live unplugged albums, which became quick successes. The first, &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, sold 450,000 copies within the first few years and became the third-best selling album of 1993 in the Netherlands.

Golden Earring celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2011, which the Dutch postal service honored with a stamp that contained a music link: when a smartphone with a special app is held up to the music stamp, Golden Earring&#x27;s &quot;Radar Love&quot; plays.

On 11 May 2012, the band released what was to prove to be their final studio album, &quot;Tits &#x27;n Ass&quot;.

On 5 February 2021, the band&#x27;s manager announced to the Dutch press that the band&#x27;s active career was over due to George Kooymans&#x27; serious ALS illness.

=== One Last Night (2025–present) ===
In January 2025, the band announced that they would play one final concert, named &quot;Golden Earring: One Last Night&quot; at the Rotterdam Ahoy on 30 January 2026. Kooymans will not play, but several famous Dutch artists will perform with the band, and five euros from each ticket sold will go to ALS research. Because of extra demand, four more shows from 26 to 29 January were added, which also all sold out immediately.

<doc id="169780" wikidata="Q1602619" url="?curid=169780" title="Hell, Norway">
<text>Hell (, ) is a village in Stjørdal Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is located in the western part of the municipality, about south of the town of Stjørdalshalsen. The village has a population (2023) of 1,921 and a population density of .

Hell is a post town with two post codes: 7517 for delivery route addresses and 7570 for post-office boxes. Hell currently has a grocery store, gas station, a fast food shop, and a retirement home. Until late 1995, the European route E6 highway was aligned through Hell and across the Hell bridge to Sandfærhus (nearby is the Trondheim Airport, Værnes). The new highway (completed in 1995) now goes around the village.

==Etymology==

The village of Hell has become a minor tourist attraction because of its name, as visitors often have their photograph taken in front of the station sign. A smaller building on the railway station has been given the sign &#x27;, which is the archaic spelling of the word for &quot;goods handling&quot; (&#x27; would be the spelling in the contemporary Norwegian language).

The name &quot;Hell&quot; stems from the Old Norse word &quot;hellir&quot;, which means &quot;overhang&quot; or &quot;cliff cave&quot;. It has a more common homonym in modern Norwegian that means &quot;luck&quot;. The Old Norse word &quot;Hel&quot; is the same as today&#x27;s English &quot;Hell&quot;, and as a proper noun, &quot;Hel&quot; was the ruler of Hel. In modern Norwegian, the word for hell is &quot;&quot;.

Temperatures in Hell can reach during winter. Among English-speaking tourists, popular postcards depict the station with a heavy frost on the ground, making a visual joke about &quot;Hell frozen over&quot;. 

British punk band The Boys recorded their third album in the village, and as a result named it &quot;To Hell with the Boys&quot;.

==Climate==
Trondheim Airport Værnes is used as the official meteorological office for this region. Temperatures in both the winter and summer are moderate due to the geography of the location: the average January highs are still above freezing despite a high latitude. Hell has a humid continental climate that is close to being subarctic and also close to being oceanic.

==Amenities==

Hell railway station is situated at a railway junction where the Nordland Line north to Bodø branches off from the Meråkerbanen between Trondheim and Storlien, Sweden. Hell Station is currently a staffed railway station.

The &quot;Hell Kjøpesenter&quot; mall is located at Sandfærhus north of the Stjørdalselva river, rather than in Hell, and thus the name is a misnomer.

A blues festival takes place every year at Hell Station in September, The original festival (Hell Blues Festival) started in 1992, then changed its name to Hell Music Festival in 2006 to open their doors for music other than blues. The Hell Music Festival in 2007 failed to attract many concert-goers, however, and the festival declared bankruptcy the same year. In 2008 a new festival was started, entitled &quot;Blues in Hell&quot;, going back to the original concept.

Since 2011, the circuit in the village has hosted a round of the FIA European Rallycross Championship (and from 2014 the FIA World Rallycross Championship).

==Notable person==
Mona Grudt, Miss Norway 1990 and Miss Universe 1990, is from a small village near Hell. During the 1990 Miss Universe competition, she listed herself as &quot;The beauty queen from Hell&quot; as a publicity stunt.

<text>Sarah Aaronsohn; 5 January 1890 – 9 October 1917) was a member of Nili, a ring of Jewish spies working for the British in World War I, and a sister of agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn. She is often referred to as the &quot;heroine of Nili.&quot;

==Biography==

Sarah Aaronsohn was born in Zichron Yaakov, which at the time was part of Ottoman Syria. Her parents were Zionists from Romania who had come to Ottoman Palestine as some of the first settlers of the First Aliyah and were founders of the moshava where Aaronsohn was born. Encouraged by her brother Aaron, she studied languages and was fluent in Hebrew, Yiddish, Turkish and French, had reasonable command of Arabic and taught herself English. On 31 March 1914, she was married in Atlit to Haim Abraham, an affluent merchant from Bulgaria, and Zionist activist and lived briefly with him in Istanbul; but the marriage was an unhappy one and she returned home to Zichron Yaakov in December 1915.

On her way from Istanbul to Haifa, Aaronsohn witnessed part of the Armenian genocide. She testified to seeing hundreds of bodies of Armenian men, women, children, and babies; sick Armenians being loaded onto trains; with the dead being tossed out and replaced by the living. After her trip to Haifa, any allusions to Armenians upset her greatly. According to Chaim Herzog, Aaronsohn decided to assist British forces as a result of what she had witnessed.

==Pro-British espionage==

Aaronsohn, her sister Rivka Aaronsohn, and her brothers Aaron Aaronsohn and Alexander Aaronsohn, with their friend (and fiancé of Rivka) Avshalom Feinberg formed and led the Nili spy organization. Aaronsohn oversaw operations in Palestine of the spy ring and passed information to British agents offshore. Sometimes she travelled widely through Ottoman territory collecting information useful to the British, and brought it directly to them in Egypt. In 1917, her brother Alexander urged her to remain in British-controlled Egypt, expecting hostilities from Ottoman authorities; but Aaronsohn returned to Zichron Yaakov to continue Nili activities. Nili developed into the largest pro-British espionage network in the Middle East, with a network of about 40 spies.

==Torture and suicide==

In September 1917, the Ottomans intercepted her carrier pigeon carrying a message to the British and decrypted the Nili code. In October, the Ottomans surrounded Zichron Yaakov and arrested numerous people, including Aaronsohn. Her captors tortured her father in front of her. She endured four days of torture herself, but she gave no information beyond what she thought of her torturers. Before she was to be transferred to Damascus for further torture, she asked permission to return to her home in Zichron Yaakov to change her blood-stained clothes. While there, she managed to shoot herself with a pistol concealed under a tile in the bathroom. According to Scott Anderson, in his book &quot;Lawrence in Arabia&quot;, Aaronsohn shot herself in the mouth on Friday 5 October 1917. &quot;Even this did not end the torment of Sarah Aaronsohn. While the bullet destroyed her mouth and severed her spinal cord, it missed her brain. For four days she lingered in agony.&quot; In &quot;Spies in Palestine&quot;, James Srodes quotes the diary of Dr. Hillel Yaffe as saying that Sarah pleaded with him, &quot;For heaven&#x27;s sake, put an end to my life. I beg you, kill me…I can&#x27;t suffer any longer….&quot; Instead, Dr. Yaffee administered morphine. She died on 9 October 1917. In her last letter, she expressed her hope that her activities in Nili would bring nearer the realization of a national home for the Jews in Eretz Israel.

Because of the Jewish views on suicide, Aaronsohn was denied a traditional burial in a Jewish cemetery. However, refusing a Jewish burial for her was unpopular. As a compromise, a small fence was placed around her grave in the cemetery (symbolically removing her grave from the surrounding hallowed ground).

==Legacy==
Aaronsohn was the first example of a &quot;secular, active death of a Jewish-Zionist woman for the nation, unprecedented in both religious martyrdom and in the Zionist tradition established in Palestine.&quot; Annual pilgrimages to her tomb in Zikhron&#x27;s cemetery started in 1935. After the Six-Day War of 1967, the memory of Aaronsohn and of Nili became a part of Israel&#x27;s cult of heroism, officially recognized by the Labor Party and celebrated in children&#x27;s literature.

<doc id="169784" wikidata="Q2354204" url="?curid=169784" title="Nili">
<text>NILI () was a Jewish espionage network which assisted the United Kingdom in its fight against the Ottoman Empire in the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem between 1915 and 1917, during World War I. NILI was centered in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov, with branches in Hadera and other Moshava. Nili is an acronym which stands for the Hebrew phrase: &quot;Netzah Yisrael Lo Yeshaker&quot; (), which translates as &quot;the Eternal One of Israel will not lie&quot;. The British government code-named NILI the &quot;A Organization&quot;, according to a 1920 misfiled memorandum in the British National Archives, as described in the book &quot;Spies in Palestine&quot; by James Srodes.

In choosing to side with the British Empire, the members of Nili went against the majority view of their fellow Jews from the Yishuv. Thus, during the Armenian genocide, the group opposed the Yishuv leadership at the time, and tried to intervene on behalf of the Armenians.

== Establishment ==

Sarah Aaronsohn, her brothers Aaron and Alexander, and their sister Rivka, together with their friend (and Rivka&#x27;s fiancé) Avshalom Feinberg formed and led Nili.

In 1915, even before the group commenced operations, the Ottomans imprisoned Feinberg on suspicion of spying, which was not true at the time. When Feinberg was arrested for espionage and held in Beersheba, Yosef Lishansky joined Nili in December 1915. Because he was active in the south, he was recruited by Feinberg to pass information to and from Sarah Aaronsohn, who was operating from Atlit.

From March to October 1915, a plague of locusts stripped areas in and around Palestine of almost all vegetation. The Turkish authorities, worried about feeding their troops, turned to world-famous botanist and the region&#x27;s leading agronomist, Aaron Aaronsohn, who requested the release of his friend and assistant, Avshalom Feinberg. The team fighting the locust invasion was given permission to move around the country, enabling them to collect strategic information about Ottoman camps and troop deployment.

For months, the group was not taken seriously by British intelligence, and attempts by Aaron Aaronsohn and Avshalom Feinberg to establish communication channels in Cairo and Port Said failed. Only after Aaronsohn arrived in London (by way of Berlin and Copenhagen) and owing to his reputation, was he able to obtain cooperation from the diplomat Sir Mark Sykes.

Sarah oversaw operations in Palestine from Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov.

== Demise ==
Attempting to reach Egypt on foot, Avshalom Feinberg was killed and Yosef Lishansky was wounded but managed to reach British lines.

From February to September 1917, the steam yacht &quot;Managem&quot; regularly sailed to the Palestinian coast near Atlit. Lishansky swam ashore to collect Nili information and to pass money sent by American Jews to the starving Yishuv. However, the presence of German submarines made the trips too risky and the group switched to homing pigeons.

In the fall of 1917, the Bosnian mudir of Qisarya, Ahmad Bek Kat-huda Ćehajić, exposed Nili when he intercepted one of its carrier pigeons. The Ottomans were able to decipher the Nili code (based on Hebrew, Aramaic, French, and English) within one week. As a result, the Ottomans were able to unravel the spy network, whereupon the leadership of the Yishuv and the Hashomer disassociated itself from Nili. One Nili member, Na&#x27;aman Belkind, was captured by the Ottomans and reportedly revealed information about the group.

In October 1917, the Ottomans surrounded Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov and arrested numerous people, including Sarah Aaronsohn, who committed suicide after four days of torture. Other prisoners were incarcerated in Damascus. Lishansky and Belkind were hanged.

==Controversies==

Nili&#x27;s &quot;irresponsibility&quot; for not coordinating their operations with the Zionist leadership, thereby endangering the Yishuv, was the cause of a longstanding controversy among the Jewish community of the British Mandate of Palestine and subsequently of the State of Israel. The issue was officially resolved in November 1967, when Feinberg&#x27;s remains were reinterred on Mount Herzl with full military honors, with eulogies delivered by both Speaker of the Knesset and chief chaplain of the IDF.

==Remembrance==
The Aaronsohn home in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov, Beit Aaronsohn, has been preserved as a museum and memorial to Nili. West of Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov is a moshav called Givat Nili. The settlement Nili in the western Binyamin region is also named for Nili. Many streets throughout Israel bear the Nili name. In December 2015. the Israel Post marked the centenary of Nili with a special stamp issue.

<text>The dewberries are a group of species in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot;, section &quot;Rubus&quot;, closely related to the blackberries. They are small, trailing (rather than upright or high-arching) brambles with aggregate fruits, reminiscent of the raspberry, but are usually purple to black instead of red. 

==Description==
The plants do not have upright canes like some other &quot;Rubus&quot; species, but have stems that trail along the ground, putting forth new roots along the length of the stem. The stems are covered with fine spines or stickers. Around March and April, the plants start to grow white flowers that develop into small, green berries. The tiny, green berries grow red and then a deep purple-blue as they ripen. When the berries are ripe, they are tender and difficult to pick in any quantity without squashing them. The berries are sweet and often less seedy than blackberries. In the winter, the leaves often remain on the stems, but may turn dark red.

The European dewberry, &quot;Rubus caesius&quot;, grows more upright like other brambles. Its fruits are a deep, almost black, purple and are coated with a thin layer or &#x27;dew&#x27; of waxy droplets. Thus, they appear sky blue (&quot;caesius&quot; being Latin for pale blue). Its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Dewberries are common throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere, and are thought of as a beneficial weed. &quot;R. caesius&quot; is frequently restricted to coastal communities, especially sand-dune systems.

== Ecology ==
The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including peach blossom moths.

== Uses ==
The leaves can be used to make an herbal tea (tisane), and the berries are edible and taste sweet. They can be eaten raw, or used to make cobbler, jam, or pie.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town of Cameron, North Carolina, was known as the &quot;dewberry capital of the world&quot; for large-scale cultivation of this berry, which was shipped out for widespread consumption. Local growers made extensive use of the railroads in the area to ship them nationally and internationally.

<doc id="169788" wikidata="Q673486" url="?curid=169788" title="Friday (1995 film)">
<text>Friday is a 1995 American buddy comedy film directed by F. Gary Gray and written by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh. The first installment in the &quot;Friday&quot; trilogy, it stars Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, Nia Long, Tiny &quot;Zeus&quot; Lister Jr., Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford, Bernie Mac, and John Witherspoon. In the film, unemployed friends Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Tucker) face troubles after becoming indebted to a drug dealer while also contending with the neighborhood bully in South Central Los Angeles.

While developing &quot;Friday&quot;, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh sought to counteract the violent portrayal of hood films and drew on personal experiences when writing the screenplay. Preparations for &quot;Friday&quot; began after the pair were able to secure funding from New Line Cinema, who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles; Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker during casting. The film was Gray&#x27;s film directorial debut, who was previously known as a music video director.

&quot;Friday&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 1995, by New Line. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the comedic sequences, writing, and acting performances, particularly Tucker&#x27;s: the film is considered his breakout role. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $27 million worldwide. It subsequently obtained a large cult following, inspiring several internet memes and pop-culture references and launched a media franchise, with the sequels &quot;Next Friday&quot; (2000) and &quot;Friday After Next&quot; (2002).

==Plot==
Craig Jones, a recently fired and unemployed slacker living in South Central Los Angeles, spends Friday with his best friend Smokey, a small-time drug peddler. The pair smoke a brokered consignment of marijuana, which Smokey was tasked to sell for his drug supplier, Big Worm.

Big Worm attempts to collect his money from Smokey, who accidentally involves Craig, subjecting both to his ultimatum: if they are unable to repay him $200 by 10:00 PM that evening, Craig and Smokey will be killed.

Craig attempts to borrow money from a number of people, including his mother Betty, his sister Dana, and jealous girlfriend Joi, and Joi refuses under the assumption that Craig is being unfaithful with local drug addict and mooch Felisha and her sister Debbie. Craig retrieves a gun to walk Smokey home, but his father, Willie, tells him that he needs to use his fists instead of weapons to help himself. He also informs Craig that his former supervisor has called and wants to see him tomorrow.

Smokey sells some drugs to Hector, a former smoking buddy. At the same time, Deebo, the neighborhood bully, forces Smokey to break into their neighbor Stanley&#x27;s house to burglarize, and they manage to steal $200 that Deebo decides to keep for himself.

Smokey attempts to retrieve the money from Deebo, who is asleep with Felisha at her house, but fails due to interference from the petty thief Ezal. Seeing Deebo awake, Craig and Smokey notice a car driving slowly, and, suspecting a drive-by shooting, they hide in Craig&#x27;s room for the evening. After failing to contact Big Worm, and with 10:00 PM approaching, they return outside but are forced to evade Big Worm&#x27;s men as they are sitting in a black van with the headlights off, starting a shootout.

After the shootout, the neighbors come out of their houses upon hearing the gunshots. Debbie confronts Deebo for beating Felisha, assuming Felisha was behind Smokey&#x27;s attempted theft. As Craig and Smokey arrive, Deebo starts bullying Debbie by punching Debbie, knocking her to the ground, leading to a physical altercation between him and Craig. Craig is victorious by defeating him on Debbie&#x27;s behalf.

Smokey steals $200 from the incapacitated Deebo as Red retrieves his stolen gold chain and bicycle. Debbie tends to Craig&#x27;s wounds. When midnight happens, Craig breaks up with Joi on the phone, in favor of Debbie.

Smokey settles his debt with Big Worm, telling him he will no longer sell drugs and is set to enter rehabilitation. Smokey then smokes a joint and ends the movie by looking at the camera and saying, &quot;I was just bullshittin&#x27;! And you know this, man!&quot;

==Production==
Before &quot;Friday&quot;″s release, movies such as &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (also starring Ice Cube) and &quot;Colors&quot; portrayed life in the hood as violent and menacing. Ice Cube and DJ Pooh felt that these films did not portray the full picture of living in the hood, missing a more lighthearted element, with Ice Cube later saying, &quot;we had fun in the hood. We used to trip off the neighborhood.&quot; Therefore, Cube and DJ Pooh decided to create a film that would portray that environment.

The script was only the third Ice Cube had ever written; the previous two were undeveloped. With the film, Ice Cube intended to make a &quot;hood classic&quot;, one that could be &quot;[watched] over and over and over again&quot;. According to Ice Cube, a majority of the film is autobiographical, with much of it being based on events that occurred in his neighborhood growing up. Smokey was based on DJ Pooh&#x27;s stint as a drug dealer, while Craig being fired on his day off was based on Ice Cube&#x27;s cousin, who was working as a delivery driver for United Parcel Service (UPS) at the time.

Prior to writing, the duo realized their inexperience as filmmakers was unlikely to attract major film studios, and floated the idea of self-financing the film. For a time, the idea of making the film in black and white to save money was considered, before the pair decided on approaching New Line Cinema about producing the film, who had achieved success with the &quot;House Party&quot; series; a film-type the duo aimed to replicate.

New Line Cinema agreed to finance the production, but requested that the role of Smokey, initially to be played by DJ Pooh, be played by someone with more experience. Chris Rock and Tommy Davidson were also considered for the role of Smokey. Ice Cube and Pooh immediately decided on Tucker, after discovering the comic through &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot;. However, Tucker&#x27;s first audition was poorly received, but was granted more time to try again at a later date. Tucker soon contacted Angela Means, aiming to work with her acting coach, but she invited him to a workshop session over dinner to help him secure the role. According to Means, &quot;by the time that spaghetti was gone, Chris was Smokey.&quot;

Ice Cube was granted license to select the film&#x27;s director, and decided on F. Gary Gray, who was a music video director. Gray had previously worked with Ice Cube on a number of occasions and was also aiming to establish a foothold in Hollywood through a short film. Ice Cube instead offered him the role for &quot;Friday&quot;, attracted to the fact that he and Gray had similar backgrounds, feeling the director would accurately capture the film&#x27;s aesthetic.

Gray said that Ice Cube starring in a comedy &quot;scared the shit out of me,&quot; as he doubted whether audiences would buy into Cube portraying a role so different from his public persona. Gray explained, &quot;Ice Cube was the toughest man in America, and when you take someone [who] delivers hard-hitting social issues in hardcore gangsta rap, and who has a hardcore view on politics, you would never think comedy.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Friday&quot; was released on April 26, 1995, in the United States, June 30, 1995, in the United Kingdom, and October 5, 1995, in Australia. The film saw a limited, theatrical re-release in honor of its 20th anniversary on April 20, 2015, for one night only.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS on October 10, 1995, on DVD on March 2, 1999, and on Blu-ray on September 8, 2009.

==Reception==

&quot;Friday&quot; grossed $6,589,341 on its opening weekend debuting at #2 in the box office in 865 theaters, averaging $7,617 per theater. The film grossed $27,467,564 in North America, against a budget of $3.5 million.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 76% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;What &quot;Friday&quot; might lack in taut construction or directorial flair, it more than makes up with its vibrant (albeit consistently crass) humor and the charming, energetic performances of its leads.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Legacy==
The film has obtained a large cult following since its release. A scene in the film is the source of the internet meme &quot;Bye, Felicia&quot;—which is a phrase meant to dismiss an inconsequential person. Former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison and San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel are both nicknamed Deebo in reference to the character from the film.

Director Quentin Tarantino counted &quot;Friday&quot; as one of his 20 favorite movies from 1992 to 2009.

American rapper Kendrick Lamar referenced the character Deebo in his 2024 song Not Like Us, a diss track aimed at Canadian rapper Drake, drawing parallels between himself and the character.

===Sequels===
The film&#x27;s success spawned two sequels: &quot;Next Friday&quot; (2000) and &quot;Friday After Next&quot; (2002). A fourth installment, tentatively titled &quot;Last Friday&quot;, has been in the works for several years. The film also inspired an animated series, titled &quot;&quot;, which aired in summer 2007.

The sequel &quot;Next Friday&quot; was the most successful in the franchise grossing a total of $59.8 million worldwide.

<doc id="169790" wikidata="Q313648" url="?curid=169790" title="Box camera">
<text>A box camera is a simple type of camera, the most common form being a cardboard or plastic box with a lens in one end and film at the other. They were sold in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The lenses are often single element designs meniscus fixed focus lens, or in better quality box cameras a doublet lens with minimal (if any) possible adjustments to the aperture or shutter speeds. Because of the inability to adjust focus, the small lens aperture and the low sensitivity of the sensitive materials available, these cameras work best in brightly lit day-lit scenes when the subject is within the hyperfocal distance for the lens and of subjects that move little during the exposure. Eventually, box cameras with photographic flash, shutter and aperture adjustment were introduced, allowing indoor photos.

== Purpose ==
The Kodak camera introduced in 1888 was the first box camera to become widely adopted by the public and its design became the archetype for box camera designs introduced by many different manufacturers. The use of flexible roll film meant that the cameras were light and portable and could be used without the encumbrance of tripods and the attendant difficulty of using glass photographic plates which were typical of professional cameras. Before the introduction of the Kodak, photographers were responsible for making their own arrangements for the development and printing of their pictures. The first Kodak came pre-loaded with film and the customer returned the camera to Kodak for processing and to be reloaded with film for the customer. In 1900, a Yale plate box camera cost US$2 (about $ in dollars). and a Kodak rollfilm box sold for US$1 (about $ in dollars)

== Typical box cameras ==
*The Kodak introduced in May 1888 first commercially successful box camera for roll film—the advertising slogan being &quot;You press the button – we do the rest&quot;.
*The Kodak Brownie, a long lasting series of classical box cameras using roll film.
*The Ansco Panda was designed to compete directly with the Brownies. It used 620 film.
*The Kodak Instamatic using 126 film, later 110 film.
*The modern disposable camera using 135 film.
*The Zeiss Ikon Box-Tengor for roll film.

== Other box cameras ==
Although many cameras of the mid nineteenth century were wooden and &quot;boxy&quot; in appearance with a brass fitted lens on the front they should not be confused with the mass-produced box cameras that exploded in popularity after the introduction of the first Kodak.

===Le Phoebus 1870===
The &quot;Le Phoebus&quot; camera was typical, it was built of mahogany wood with a brass mounted lens in a rack-and-pinion focuser to adjust the projected image sharply onto a ground glass at the back. Most cameras like this used glass plates. The lens did not come equipped with a shutter; instead, the lenscap was removed and replaced to control the exposure time.

===Pocket Kodak 1895–1896===
Pocket Kodaks were small () and lightweight (), and took roughly exposures on 102 size rollfilm. This camera had a new feature, a small view box that told how many exposures of film were left. They were first available in 1895 with either black or red leather covering.

===Crown Camera 1896===
Patent GB189602965 was granted on February 10, 1896 to Thomas Peter Bethell of Crown Works, Boundary Place, Liverpool for a &quot;simple construction of camera to be made of cardboard of metal, or a combination of both&quot;. The Crown Camera had a quarter-plate cardboard-body with two waist level finders, cardboard rubber-band powered shutter, four-position rotary stops marked 1 2 3 4, a single meniscus lens, removable ground glass screen, rear sliding sheath and leather carrying strap.

===le Papillon 1905–1908===
Meaning &quot;the butterfly,&quot; le Papillon was a small French stereo camera which made stereoscopic images on glass plates in single plateholders.

===No. 00 Cartridge Premo Camera, 1916–1922===
The No. 00 Cartridge Premo was Kodak&#x27;s smallest box camera ever. It was only tall. It uses a simple rotary shutter with meniscus lens, and does not have a viewfinder. The photographer must use the leatherette covering to attempt to see the subject of the photograph.

<doc id="169798" wikidata="Q163225" url="?curid=169798" title="Sonia Gandhi">
<text>Sonia Gandhi (, ; ; born 9 December 1946) is an Italian-born Indian politician. She is the longest-serving president of the Indian National Congress, a liberal political party, which has governed India for most of its post-independence history. She took over as the party leader in 1998, seven years after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, her husband and a former Prime Minister of India, and remained in office until 2017 after serving for twenty-two years. She returned to the post in 2019 and remained the President for another three years.

Born in a small village near Vicenza, Italy, Gandhi was raised in a Roman Catholic family. After completing her primary education at local schools, she moved for language classes to Cambridge, England, where she met Rajiv Gandhi, and later married him in 1968. She then moved to India and started living with her mother-in-law, the then-Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, at the latter&#x27;s New Delhi residence. Sonia Gandhi, however, kept away from the public sphere, even during the years of her husband&#x27;s premiership.

Following her husband&#x27;s assassination, Gandhi was invited by Congress leaders to lead the party, but she declined. She agreed to join politics in 1997 after much pleading from the party; the following year, she was nominated for party president. Under her leadership, the Congress went on to form the government post the 2004 elections in coalition with other centre-left political parties. Gandhi has since been credited for being instrumental in formulating the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which was re-elected to power in 2009. Gandhi declined the premiership following the 2004 victory; she instead led the ruling alliance and the National Advisory Council.

Over the course of her career, Gandhi presided over the advisory councils credited for the formation and subsequent implementation of such rights-based development and welfare schemes as the Right to Information, Food Security Bill, and MGNREGA, as she drew criticism related to the &quot;National Herald&quot; case during the Manmohan Singh premiership. Her foreign birth has also been a subject of much debate and controversy. Gandhi&#x27;s active participation in politics began to reduce during the latter half of the UPA government&#x27;s second term owing to health concerns. She stepped down as the Congress president in December 2017 but returned to lead the party in August 2019. 

Although she has not held any public office in the government of India, Gandhi has been widely described as one of the most powerful politicians in the country, and is often listed among the most powerful women in the world.

==Early life==
Sonia Maino was born on 9 December 1946 to Stefano and Paola Maino in Lusiana (in Maini street), a historically Cimbrian-speaking village about 35 km from Vicenza in Veneto, Italy. She was one of three siblings: Sonia, Nadia and Anoushka, raised in a traditional Roman Catholic Christian family. Sonia spent her adolescence in Orbassano, a town near Turin. She attained primary education attending the local Catholic schools; one of her early teachers described her as &quot;a diligent little girl, [who] studied as much as was necessary&quot;.

Stefano, who was a building mason, established a small construction business in Orbassano. He had fought against the Soviet military alongside Hitler&#x27;s Wehrmacht on the eastern front in World War II, was a loyal supporter of Benito Mussolini and Italy&#x27;s National Fascist Party. The family house had leather bound books on writings and speeches of Mussolini. Stefano had named Sonia and her elder sister Nadia in the memory of the Italian participation in the Eastern Front. He died in 1983. Gandhi has two sisters who still reside in Orbassano.

Gandhi completed her schooling at the age of 13; her final report card read: &quot;intelligent, diligent, committed [...] would succeed well at the high school for teachers&quot;. She aspired to become a flight attendant. In 1964, she went to study English at the Bell Educational Trust&#x27;s language school in the city of Cambridge. The following year, she met Rajiv Gandhi at the Varsity Restaurant, where she was working as a part-time waitress, while he was enrolled for an engineering degree in the Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. In this context, the &quot;Times&quot;, London reported, &quot;Mrs Gandhi was an 18-year-old student at a small language college in Cambridge in 1965, [...] when she met a handsome young engineering student&quot;. The couple married in 1968, in a Hindu ceremony, following which she moved into the house of her mother-in-law and then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.

The couple had two children, Rahul Gandhi (born 1970) and Priyanka Vadra (born 1972). Despite belonging to the influential Nehru family, Sonia and Rajiv avoided all involvement in politics. Rajiv worked as an airline pilot while Sonia took care of her family.
She spent considerable amount of time with her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi; she recalled her experience in a 1985 interview with the Hindi-language magazine &quot;Dharmyug&quot;, &quot;She [Indira] showered me with all her affection and love&quot;. Soon after the latter&#x27;s ousting from office in 1977 in the aftermath of the Indian Emergency, the Rajiv family contemplated moving abroad for a short time. When Rajiv entered politics in 1982 after the death of his younger brother Sanjay Gandhi in a plane crash on 23 June 1980, Sonia continued to focus on her family and avoided all contact with the public.

== Political career ==

===Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s premiership (1984–1990)===
Sonia Gandhi&#x27;s involvement with Indian public life began after the assassination of her mother-in-law and her husband&#x27;s election as prime minister. As the prime minister&#x27;s wife she acted as his official hostess and also accompanied him on a number of state visits.

In 1984, she actively campaigned against her husband&#x27;s sister-in-law Maneka Gandhi who was running against Rajiv in Amethi. At the end of Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s five years in office, the Bofors scandal broke out. Ottavio Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman believed to be involved, was said to be a friend of Sonia Gandhi, having access to the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence. The BJP has alleged that she appeared on the voters&#x27; list in New Delhi prior to obtaining Indian citizenship in April 1983, in contravention of Indian law.

Former senior Congress leader and former President of India Pranab Mukherjee said that she surrendered her Italian passport to the Italian Embassy on 27 April 1983. Italian nationality law did not permit dual nationality until 1992. So, by acquiring Indian citizenship on 30 April 1983, she would automatically have lost Italian citizenship.

===Political debut and Congress presidency (1991–1998)===
After Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 and Sonia Gandhi refused to succeed him as the Congress president and prime minister, the party settled on the choice of P. V. Narasimha Rao who subsequently became Prime Minister after winning elections that year. Over the next few years, however, the Congress fortunes continued to dwindle and it lost the 1996 elections. Several senior leaders such as Madhavrao Sindhia, Rajesh Pilot, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Arjun Singh, Mamata Banerjee, G. K. Moopanar, P. Chidambaram and Jayanthi Natarajan were in open revolt against incumbent President Sitaram Kesri and many of whom quit the party, splitting the Congress into many factions.

In an effort to revive the party&#x27;s sagging fortunes, she joined the Congress Party as a primary member in the Calcutta Plenary Session in 1997 and became party leader in 1998.

In May 1999, three senior leaders of the party (Sharad Pawar, P. A. Sangma, and Tariq Anwar) challenged her right to try to become India&#x27;s Prime Minister because of her foreign origins. In response, she offered to resign as party leader, resulting in an outpouring of support and the expulsion from the party of the three rebels who went on to form the Nationalist Congress Party.

Within 62 days of joining as a primary member, she was offered the party President post which she accepted.

She contested Lok Sabha elections from Bellary, Karnataka and Amethi, Uttar Pradesh in 1999. She won both seats but chose to represent Amethi. In Bellary, she had defeated veteran BJP leader, Sushma Swaraj.

===Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha (1999–2003)===

She was elected the Leader of the Opposition of the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999.

When the BJP-led NDA formed a government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, she took the office of the Leader of the Opposition. In 2000, she defeated Jitendra Prasada by a huge margin of 97% in the Congress President Election. She had been repeatedly selected for the position without any election being held. As Leader of the Opposition, she called a no-confidence motion against the NDA government led by Vajpayee in 2003.

===Electoral success and NAC chairmanship (2004–2014)===

In the 2004 general elections, Gandhi launched a nationwide campaign, crisscrossing the country on the &quot;Aam Aadmi&quot; (ordinary man) slogan in contrast to the &#x27;India Shining&#x27; slogan of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) alliance. She countered the BJP asking &quot;Who is India Shining for?&quot;. In the election, she was re-elected by a 200,000-vote margin over her nearest rival, in the Rae Bareli. Following the unexpected defeat of the NDA, she was widely expected to be the next Prime Minister of India. On 16 May, she was unanimously chosen to lead a coalition government of 15 parties supported by the left, and it was subsequently named as United Progressive Alliance (UPA).

The defeated NDA protested once again about her &#x27;foreign origin&#x27; and senior NDA leader Sushma Swaraj threatened to shave her head and &quot;sleep on the ground&quot;, among other things, should Sonia become prime minister.

The NDA claimed that there were legal reasons that barred her from the Prime Minister&#x27;s post.

They pointed, in particular, to Section 5 of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955, which they claimed implied &#x27;reciprocity&#x27;. This was contested by others and eventually the suits were dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.

A few days after the election, Gandhi recommended Manmohan Singh as her choice as prime minister, which the party leaders accepted. Her supporters compared it to the old Indian tradition of renunciation, while her opponents attacked it as a political stunt.
On 23 March 2006, Gandhi announced her resignation from the Lok Sabha and also as chairperson of the National Advisory Council under the office-of-profit controversy and the speculation that the government was planning to bring an ordinance to exempt the post of chairperson of National Advisory Council from the purview of office of profit. She was re-elected from her constituency Rae Bareli in May 2006 by a margin of over 400,000 votes.

As chairperson of the National Advisory Committee and the UPA, she played an important role in making the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the Right to Information Act into law.

She addressed the United Nations on 2 October 2007, Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s birth anniversary which is observed as the international day of non-violence after a UN resolution passed on 15 July 2007.

Under her leadership, the Congress-led UPA won a decisive majority in the 2009 general elections with Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister. The Congress itself won 206 Lok Sabha seats, which was then the highest total by any party since 1991. She was re-elected to a third term as a member of parliament representing Rae Bareli.

In 2013, Gandhi became the first person to serve as Congress President for 15 years consecutively. In the same year, Gandhi condemned the Supreme Court judgement supporting Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and backed LGBT rights.

===Leaving active politics and Rajya Sabha (2014–present)===
In the 2014 general election, she held her seat in Rae Bareli. However, the Indian National Congress and the Congress-led UPA electoral alliance suffered their worst result in a general election ever, winning only 44 and 59 seats respectively.
When Rahul Gandhi was expected to take over as Congress president, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury picked Sonia over Rahul, calling her the &quot;glue that binds the opposition&quot; during an interview November 2017. Rahul took over as the 49th Congress president on 16 December 2017.

Gandhi returned to active politics for the Indian National Congress&#x27; campaign for the 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election. Having stayed away from campaigning for elections since 2016, Gandhi addressed a rally at Bijapur, which comprised five legislative assembly constituencies; while Congress emerged as the second largest party in the election with 78 seats behind the BJP, the former won four or the five assembly seats from Bijapur. Gandhi also played an active role in orchestrating a post-poll alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular).

Rahul Gandhi, taking responsibility for Congress party&#x27;s second consecutive loss in general elections held in 2019, resigned from the post of President on 25 May. Following the resignation, party leaders began deliberations for a suitable candidate to replace him. The Congress Working Committee met on 10 August to take a final call on the matter and passed a resolution asking Sonia Gandhi to take over as interim president until a consensus candidate could be picked.

Following her appointment, Gandhi undertook a restructuring of the Congress&#x27; state units and appointed Kumari Selja and Eknath Gaikwad as the presidents of the party&#x27;s Haryana and Mumbai units. Several other changes were also made in the party&#x27;s organisational units in states slated for elections including Haryana, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand.

In February 2020, Gandhi held a press conference where she demanded that Home Minister Amit Shah should resign for failing to stop the North East Delhi riots. She asked for the deployment of an adequate number of security forces. In 2022, it was reported that Sonia Gandhi supported Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot for Congress president to lead in the next Indian general election. But, Gehlot did not contest the election and Gandhi loyalist Mallikarjun Kharge elected as the new Congress president, defeating non-loyalist Shashi Tharoor.

In February 2024, Sonia Gandhi opted out of the 2024 Indian general election citing health and age-related issues. Gandhi filed her nomination to contest for the 2024 Rajya Sabha elections from Rajasthan to succeed retiring MP Manmohan Singh. During the nomination filing, she was accompanied by Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot and other senior members of the party. Sonia Gandhi was elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan on 20 February 2024 and took the oath in April.

On 31 January 2025, Gandhi faced a major criticism for her controversial comments against President Droupadi Murmu following the latter&#x27;s speech during a joint session. Calling the President as &quot;Poor Thing&quot;, several BJP leaders stated the comment was derogatory and anti-poor, besides disrespect to the highest Constitutional authority. The Rashtrapati Bhavan responded by saying that Gandhi&#x27;s comments hurt the dignity of the President of India and it cannot be tolerated.

==Personal life==
Sonia is the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, elder son of Indira Gandhi. She has two children, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, who both serve as Members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha.

In August 2011, she underwent successful surgery for cervical cancer in the United States at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She returned to India on 9 September after her treatment.

According to an affidavit filed during the 2014 Indian general election, Gandhi had declared assets worth , with in movable and in immovable properties. This was an almost six-fold increase since her declaration in the last election in 2009; party officials attributed this to a switch from book value to market value for asset valuation.

Gandhi&#x27;s mother, Paola Maino, died due to an illness at her home in Italy on 27 August 2022, at the age of about 90.

==Electoral history==
==Honours and recognition==

Gandhi was seen as the most powerful politician of India from 2004 to 2014, and variously listed among the most powerful people and women listings by magazines.

In 2013, Sonia Gandhi was ranked 21st among world&#x27;s most powerful and 9th most powerful woman by &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot;.

In 2007, she was named the third most powerful woman in the world by the same magazine and was ranked 6th in exclusive list in 2007.

In 2010, Gandhi was ranked as the ninth most powerful person on the planet by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. She was ranked 12 in 2012 in Forbes&#x27; powerful people list.

Sonia was also named among the &quot;Time 100 most influential&quot; people in the world for 2007 and 2008. &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed Sonia Gandhi at number 29 in their annual survey of &quot;The World&#x27;s 50 Most Influential Figures&quot; in 2010.

<text>The neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes. The type species of its genus, it is native to blackwater and clearwater streams in the Amazon basin of South America. Its bright colouring makes the fish visible to conspecifics in the dark blackwater streams, and is also the main reason for its popularity among freshwater fish hobbyists, with neon tetras being one of the most widely kept tropical fish in the world.

==Range and habitat==
The neon tetra is found in the western and northern Amazon basin in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil. It lives in waters with a temperature between and pH 4–7.5. It has a preference for acidic blackwater streams, but also occurs in transparent clearwater streams. It is not found in the whitewater rivers. UN FAO considers &quot;P. innesi&quot; an introduced species in Singapore and the United States. FAO considers its introduction to Singapore to be ecologically and socioeconomically beneficial, but it is not established there.

==Description==
The neon tetra has a light-blue back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. The fish is partially transparent (including fins) except for these markings. Sexual dimorphism is slight, with the female having a slightly larger belly, and a bent iridescent stripe rather than the male&#x27;s straight stripe. During the night, the blue and red become gray or black as the fish rests. It reactivates once it becomes active in the morning. This peculiar change is due to the neon tetras capacity to change the color of its iridescent stripe in response to lighting conditions. In a light-adapted state it is blue-green, likewise in a dark-adapted state its color changes to indigo. This change is produced by guanine crystals in their cells that reflect light. The neon tetra grows to approximately in overall length.

==Economics==
The neon tetra was first imported from South America and was described by renowned ichthyologist George S. Myers in 1936, and named after William T. Innes. &quot;P. innesi&quot; is one of the most popular aquarium fish, with about 2 million sold in the US each month. Most neon tetras available in the United States are imported from Southeast Asia, where they are farm-raised, or to a lesser extent from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, where they are collected from the wild. During a single month, an average of 1.8 million neon tetras with an estimated value of $175,000 are imported into the United States for the aquarium trade. With the exception of home aquarists and a few commercial farms that breed neon tetras experimentally, captive breeding on a commercial scale is nonexistent in the USA.

==In the aquarium==
In the wild they inhabit very soft, acidic waters (pH 4.0 to 4.8) Ideal pH for aquarium is 7.0, but a range of 6.0 to 8.0 is tolerable. They can have a lifespan of as long as ten years, but normally just two to three years in an aquarium.

Neon tetras are considered easy to keep in an aquarium of at least with a temperature range of between , a water pH of between 6.0 and 7.0, GH of below 10 dGH and KH of 1–2 dKH, and under 20 ppm of nitrate.

They are shoaling fish and must be kept in groups of at least six, but will be more active in groups of eight to 12 or more. Neon tetras are best kept in a densely planted tank to resemble their native Amazon environments.

===Nutrition===
Neon tetras are omnivores and will accept most flake foods, if sufficiently small, but should also have some small foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, which can be stuck to the side of the aquarium, and micropellet food to supplement their diets. A tropical sinking pellet is ideal, as most brands of these include natural color enhancers that bring out the color in neon tetras. Some frozen foods, including frozen blood worms, add variety to their diets.

===Breeding===
The male is slender, and the blue line is straighter. The female is rounder, producing a bent blue line. Some aquarists say the females look plumper when viewed from above. However, the straightness of the line and the plumpness of the female might occasionally be due to the eggs she is carrying. A neon tetra can appear slightly plump in the belly due to having overeaten.

Neon tetras need dim lighting, a DH less than one, about 5.5 pH, and a temperature of to breed. There also needs to be a lot of tannins in the water. Neon tetras are old enough to breed at 12 weeks.

Breeding neon tetras is considered to be difficult in home aquariums. However, it is becoming more common, with less than 5% of specimens currently sold in America caught in the wild, and more than 1.5 million specimens imported to America each month from fish farms.

===Disease===
Neon tetras are occasionally afflicted by the so-called &quot;neon tetra disease&quot; (NTD) or pleistophora disease, a sporozoan disease caused by &quot;Pleistophora hyphessobryconis&quot;. Despite being a well-known condition, it is generally incurable and often fatal to the fish. However this disease is also generally preventable. The disease cycle begins when microsporidian parasite spores enter the fish after it consumes infected material, such as the bodies of a dead fish, or live food such as tubifex, which may serve as intermediate hosts. The disease is most likely passed by newly acquired fish that have not been quarantined.

Symptoms include restlessness, loss of coloration, lumps on the body as cysts develop, difficulty swimming, curved spines as the disease progresses, and secondary infections, such as fin rot and bloating.

A so-called &quot;false neon disease&quot;, which is bacterial, shows very similar symptoms. It is impossible for the home aquarist to determine for certain the difference between NTD and false NTD on the basis of visible symptoms alone, without laboratory backup. This disease has also been confused with columnaris (mouth rot, mouth fungus, &#x27;flex&#x27;).

Generally the best &#x27;treatment&#x27; is the immediate removal of diseased fish to preserve the remaining fish, although some occasional successful treatments have been performed that include fish baths and a &quot;medication cocktail&quot;. The use of a diatom filter, which can reduce the number of free parasites in the water, may help. As with Pleistophora neon tetra disease, prevention is most important and this disease is rare when good preventive measures are performed.

==Related species==
The green neon tetra (&quot;P. simulans&quot;) and black neon tetra (&quot;Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi&quot;) are distinct species—the latter belongs to a different genus—and not color varieties. The cardinal tetra (&quot;P. axelrodi&quot;) is also a similar species, but its greater extent of red coloring distinguishes it from the neon tetra. The name &quot;Hyphessobrycon innesi&quot; is an obsolete synonym for &quot;P. innesi&quot;.

<text>The Anabantidae are a family of ray-finned fish within the order Anabantiformes commonly called the climbing gouramies or climbing perches. The family includes about 34 species. As labyrinth fishes, they possess a labyrinth organ, a structure in the fish&#x27;s head which allows it to breathe atmospheric oxygen. Fish of this family are commonly seen gulping at air at the surface of the water. The air is held in a structure called the suprabranchial chamber, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream via the respiratory epithelium covering the labyrinth organ. This therefore allows the fish to move small distances across land.
==Genera==
There are four extant genera within the family Anabantidae:

* &quot;Anabas&quot; 
* &quot;Ctenopoma&quot; 
* &quot;Microctenopoma&quot; 
* &quot;Sandelia&quot; 

There is also at least one extinct genus known:

* †&quot;Eoanabas&quot; 

Of the four genera, &quot;Anabas&quot; are the only climbing gouramies found in South Asia. They are widely distributed and are found in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and China. Climbing gouramies have distinct names in numerous South Asian languages. In Tamil, they are பனையேறி கெண்டை (&quot;panaieri kendai&quot;); in Malayalam, &quot;chemballi&quot;; in Odia, they are କଉ ମାଛ (&quot;kau&quot;); in Assamese they are কাৱৈ মাছ (&quot;kawoi maas&quot;); in Bengali, they are কই মাছ (&quot;koi mach&quot;).

The remaining three genera are endemic to Africa: &quot;Ctenopoma&quot; and &quot;Microctenopoma&quot; are primarily found in the Congo Basin, whereas &quot;Sandelia&quot; are endemic to the Eastern and Western Capes of South Africa. Anabantidae are primarily freshwater fish and only very rarely are found in brackish water. Parental care is varied; &quot;Anabas&quot; and &quot;Ctenopoma&quot; do not tend their eggs, &quot;Microctenopoma&quot; species produce bubble nests like many other labyrinth fish, and &quot;Sandelia&quot; lays their eggs on the substrate.

Climbing gouramis are so named due to their ability to &quot;climb&quot; out of water and &quot;walk&quot; short distances. Even though it has not been reliably observed, some authors have mentioned about them having a tree climbing ability. Their method of terrestrial locomotion uses the gill plates as supports, and the fish pushes itself using its fins and tail.

<doc id="169804" wikidata="Q3735285" url="?curid=169804" title="Elections in Sweden">
<text>Elections in Sweden are held once every four years. At the highest level, all 349 members of Riksdag, the national parliament of Sweden, are elected in general elections. Elections to the 20 county councils () and 290 municipal assemblies () – all using almost the same electoral system – are held concurrently with the legislative elections on the second Sunday in September (with effect from 2014; until 2010 they had been held on the &quot;third&quot; Sunday in September).

Sweden also holds elections to the European Parliament, which unlike Swedish domestic elections are held in June every five years, although they are also held on a Sunday and use an almost identical electoral system. The last Swedish general election was held on 11 September 2022. The last Swedish election to the European Parliament was held on 9 June 2024.

==Electoral system==

===Dates===
Elections to Sweden&#x27;s county councils occur simultaneously with the general elections on the second Sunday of September. Elections to the municipal councils also occur on the second Sunday of September. Elections to the European Parliament occur every five years in May or June throughout the entire European Union; the exact day of the election varies by country according to the local tradition, thus in Sweden they happen on a Sunday.

===Voter eligibility===
To vote in a Swedish &quot;general election&quot;, one must be:
* a Swedish citizen,
* at least 18 years of age on election day,
* and have at some point been a registered resident of Sweden (thus excluding foreign-born Swedes who have never lived in Sweden)

To vote in Swedish &quot;local elections&quot; (for the county councils and municipal assemblies), one must:
* be a registered resident of the county or municipality in question and be at least 18 years of age on election day
* fall into one of the following groups:
# Swedish citizens
# Citizens of Iceland, Norway, or any country in the European Union
# Citizens of any other country who have permanent residency in Sweden and have lived in Sweden for three consecutive years

In order to vote in elections to the European Parliament, one must be at least 18 years old, and fall into one of the following groups:

# Swedish citizens who are or have been residents of Sweden
# Citizens of any other country in the European Union who are currently residents of Sweden; such citizens, by choosing to vote in European Parliamentary elections in Sweden, become ineligible to vote in European Parliamentary elections in any other EU member state

In general, any person who is eligible to vote is also eligible to stand for election.

Sweden does not disenfranchise prisoners or those with criminal convictions. Expat Swedish citizens may however be removed from the polling register if they do not renew their registration every 10 years.

===Voting===
Unlike in many countries where voters chose from a list of candidates or parties, each party in Sweden has separate ballot papers. The ballot papers must be identical in size and material, and have different colors depending on the type of election: yellow for Riksdag elections, blue for county council elections and white for municipal elections and elections to the European Parliament.

Sweden uses open lists and utilizes apparentment between lists of the same party and constituency to form a &quot;cartel&quot;, a group of lists that are legally allied for purposes of seat allocation. A single preference vote may be indicated as well.

Swedish voters can choose between three different types of ballot papers. The &quot;party ballot paper&quot; has simply the name of a political party printed on the front and is blank on the back. This ballot is used when a voter wishes to vote for a particular party, but does not wish to give preference to a particular candidate. The &quot;name ballot paper&quot; has a party name followed by a list of candidates (which can continue on the other side). A voter using this ballot can choose (but is not required) to cast a personal vote by entering a mark next to a particular candidate, in addition to voting for their political party. Alternatively, a voter can take a &quot;blank ballot paper&quot; and write a party name on it. Finally, if a party has not registered its candidates with the election authority, it is possible for a voter to manually write the name of an arbitrary candidate. In reality, this option is almost exclusively available when voting for unestablished parties. However, it has occasionally caused individuals to be elected into the city council to represent parties they do not even support as a result of a single voter&#x27;s vote.

The municipalities and the national election authority have the responsibility to organise the elections. On the election day, voting takes place in a municipal building such as a school. It is possible to do early voting, also in a municipal building which is available in day time, such as a library. Early voting can be performed anywhere in Sweden, not just in the home municipality.

Long-standing Swedish election policy of always displaying the ballot papers for voters to select in public has been criticised as undemocratic and is arguably in contravention of Protocol 1, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which stipulates that elections must be &quot;free&quot; and &quot;by secret ballot&quot;. There has been a common practice of masking by selecting multiple ballot papers. In 2014, a German citizen, Christian Dworeck, reported the lack of secrecy to the European Commission and from 2019 ballot papers are selected behind a screen. This measure has now been implemented in Swedish parliamentary and local elections as was seen in the Swedish General Election of 2022 (a picture can be seen in the linked reference).

===Cost of ballot papers===
For the general elections, the State pays for the printing and distribution of ballot papers for any party which has received at least one percent of the vote nationally in either of the previous two elections. For local elections, any party that is currently represented in the legislative body in question is entitled to free printing of ballot papers.

===Constituencies===

In Riksdag elections, constituencies are usually coterminous with one of the Swedish counties, though the Counties of Stockholm, Skåne (containing Malmö), and Västra Götaland (containing Gothenburg) are divided into smaller electoral constituencies due to their larger populations. The number of available seats in each constituency is based on its number of voters (vis-à-vis the number of voters nationwide), and parties are apportioned seats in each constituency based on their votes in that constituency.

In County Council elections, individual municipalities—or alternatively groups of municipalities—are used as electoral constituencies. The number of seats on the county council allocated to each constituency, and the borders of these constituencies, is entirely at the discretion of each county council itself. As mandated by Swedish law, nine out of ten seats on each county council are permanent seats from a particular constituency; the remaining seats are at-large adjustment seats, used to ensure county-wide proportionality with the vote, just as with general elections.

For European parliamentary elections, all of Sweden consists of one electoral district.

===Party list candidate selection===
In Sweden, the seats of the Riksdag are allocated to the parties, and the prospective members are selected by their party. Sweden uses open lists and utilizes apparentement between lists of the same constituency and party to form a &quot;cartel&quot;, a group of lists that are legally allied for purposes of seat allocation. Which candidates from which lists are to secure the seats allocated to the party is determined by two factors: preference votes are first used to choose candidates which pass a certain threshold, then the number of votes cast for the various lists within that party are used. In national general elections, any candidates who receive a number of personal votes equal to five percent or greater of the party&#x27;s total number of votes will automatically be bumped to the top of the list, regardless of their ranking on the list by the party. This threshold is similarly five percent for local elections and elections to the European Parliament.

Although sometimes dissatisfied party supporters put forward their own lists, the lists are usually put forward by the parties, and target different constituencies and categories of voters. Competition between lists is usually more of a feature of campaign strategies than for effective candidate preferences, and does not bear prominently in elections.

Because seats are allocated primarily to the parties and not candidates, the seat of an MP who resigns during their term in office can be taken by a replacement runner-up candidate from their own party (unlike systems such as the United Kingdom, a by-election is not triggered). In contrast to assigning the seat, resigning is a voluntary action of the MP, meaning that there exists the possibility of MPs resigning from their parties but not their seats and sitting as independents. The system of replacement runner-up candidates also means that the Prime Minister and their potential members of cabinet appear on ballot papers, but surrender their seats to replacement candidates as they are appointed as ministers (holding both posts is not permitted). This allows senior party politicians to assume roles as opposition members of parliament if they lose an election.

===Seat allocation===
Seats in the various legislative bodies are allocated amongst the Swedish political parties proportionally using a modified form of the Sainte-Laguë method. This modification creates a systematic preference in the mathematics behind seat distribution, favoring larger and medium-sized parties over smaller parties. It reduces the slight bias towards larger parties in the d&#x27;Hondt formula. At the core of it, the system remains intensely proportional, and thus a party which wins approximately 25% of the vote should win approximately 25% of the seats. An example of the close correlation between seats and votes can be seen below in the results of the 2002 Stockholm municipal election.

In Riksdag elections, 310 of the members are elected using a party-list proportional representation system within each of Sweden&#x27;s 29 electoral constituencies. The remaining 39 seats in the Riksdag are &quot;adjustment seats&quot;, distributed amongst the parties in numbers that will ensure that the party distribution in the Riksdag matches the distribution of the votes nationally as closely as possible. County elections use the same system. All seats on municipal assemblies are permanent; there are no adjustment seats. This can cause the distribution of seats in the municipal assemblies to differ somewhat from the actual distribution of votes in the election. The European Parliament has 751 permanent seats, 20 of which were allocated to Sweden for the 2019 election. After Brexit, an additional seat was allocated for Sweden.

In order to restrict the number of parties which win seats in the Riksdag, a threshold has been put in place. In order to win seats in the Riksdag, a party must win at least four percent of the vote nationally, or twelve percent of the vote in any electoral constituency. County elections use a lower threshold of three percent. For municipal elections, since the elections of 2018 there has been a minimum threshold of two percent in municipalities with only one constituency, and three percent in those with more than one.

Comparison of vote share vs. share of allocated seats after 2018 municipal elections:
===Terms of office===
The assembly members are elected for a fixed term of four years. From 1970 to 1994, terms were three years; before that, normally four. The Riksdag may be dissolved earlier by a decree of the prime minister, in which case new elections are held; however, new members will hold office only until the next ordinary election, the date of which remains the same. Thus, the terms of office of the new members will be the remaining parts of the terms of the MPs in the dissolved parliament.

The unicameral Riksdag has never been dissolved by decree. The last time the second chamber of the old Riksdag was dissolved in this manner was in 1958.

The regional and local assemblies cannot be dissolved before the end of their term.

===Party organization===
While parties have been very careful to maintain their original mass party image, party organizations have become increasing professionalized and dependent on the state, and less connected with their grass-roots members and civil society. Party membership has declined to 210,067 members in 2010 across all parties (3.67% of the electorate), from 1,124,917 members in 1960 (22.62% of the electorate). Political parties can be registered with the support of 1500 electors for Riksdag elections, 1500 electors for EU elections, 100 electors for county council elections, and/or 50 electors for municipal elections.

== Riksdag elections ==

The unicameral Parliament of Sweden has 349 members: 310 are elected using party-list proportional representation, and 39 using &quot;adjustment seats&quot;.

===2018 election===

At the 2018 general elections, the red-green coalition consisting of Social Democrats, Greens, and the Left got 40.7% of the votes compared to 40.3% for the Alliance parties, resulting in a single-seat difference between the blocks. After a prolonged government formation process, Stefan Löfven was able to form a minority government with the Greens, conditional on external support from Centre Party and the Liberals.

=== Riksdag election results in percent of the vote 1911–2022===
The first elections to a unicameral were held in 1970. The older figures refer to elections of the under the older bicameral system.

Note that, the 2022 results are still preliminary; official results will be announced about two weeks after the election.

<doc id="169805" wikidata="Q162141" url="?curid=169805" title="Smilacaceae">
<text>Smilacaceae, the greenbriers, is a family of flowering plants. While they were often assigned to a more broadly defined family Liliaceae, most recent botanists have accepted the two as distinct families, diverging around 55 million years ago during the Early Paleogene. One characteristic that distinguishes Smilacaceae from most of the other members of the Liliaceae-like Liliales is that it has true vessels in its conducting tissue. Another is that the veins of the leaves, between major veins, are reticulate (net-shaped), rather than parallel as in most monocots.

== Taxonomy ==
The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), recognizes this family and places it in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. Earlier it was a family of two genera, &quot;Heterosmilax&quot; and &quot;Smilax&quot;, but DNA studies have shown that &quot;Heterosmilax&quot; has arisen from &quot;Smilax&quot; and the two genera are now merged. This results in Smilax being the only genus in Smilacaceae with about 210 known species.
The family occurs throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Members of this family typically have woody roots and a climbing or vining form. Some have woody vining stems, often with thorns, while others are herbaceous above ground and thornless.

Other placements of the family include:
* The Cronquist system, of 1981, recognized this family and placed it in the order Liliales, in subclass Liliidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons] of division Magnoliophyta [=angiosperms]. 
* The Reveal system (1997) recognized this family and placed it in the order Smilacales, in subclass Liliidae which is placed as in the Cronquist system. 
* The Thorne system (1992) also recognized this family, and placed it in the order Dioscoreales in superorder Lilianae in subclass Liliidae (monocotyledons) of class Magnoliopsida (angiosperms).
* The Dahlgren system treated it as did the Thorne system (1992): see above.

== Characteristics ==
Members of this family can be herbaceous to &quot;woody&quot; vines. They grow from their rhizomes and are often armed with prickles on the stems and/or leaves. Leaves are alternate and simple; and entire to spinose-serrate. Some members of this family have coriaceous (leathery) leaves. Venation of the leaves may be palmate to reticulate. A pair of tendrils often appear near the base of the petiole. The inflorescence type for members of this family is an umbel. The flowers are inconspicuous, radial and unisexual. The flowers are made of 6 tepals, 6 stamens and 3 carpels. The fruit type of all members of Smilacaceae is a berry. The number of seeds per berry is 1–3. Nectaries are located at the base of the tepals.

== Genera ==
While both genera are dioecious and nearly indistinguishable vegetatively, their flowers differ markedly. The flower of &quot;Heterosmilax&quot; is fused into a deep bottle-shaped tube containing prominent nectaries and its stamens are connected at the bottom, whereas flowers of &quot;Smilax&quot; are typically small with unfused floral parts. &quot;Smilax&quot; is a much larger and more widely distributed genus than &quot;Heterosmilax&quot;. &quot;Heterosmilax&quot; has only twelve species which are confined to China, Japan, tropical Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the surrounding islands.

Some taxonomists separate the herbaceous plants native to North America in &quot;Smilax&quot; as the genus &quot;Nemexia&quot;, which is known for its malodorous flowers. &quot;Smilax&quot; would then be left with only plants of a woody, vining form with thorns. However, the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; does not recognise &quot;Nemexia&quot;, nor does the Missouri Botanical Garden&#x27;s Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.

<text>Smilax is a genus of about 300–350 species, found in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. They are climbing flowering plants, many of which are woody and/or thorny, in the monocotyledon family Smilacaceae, native throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 
Common names include catbriers, greenbriers, prickly-ivys and smilaxes. &quot;Sarsaparilla&quot; (also zarzaparrilla, sarsparilla) is a name used specifically for the Neotropical &quot;S. ornata&quot; as well as a catch-all term in particular for American species. Occasionally, the non-woody species such as the smooth herbaceous greenbrier (&quot;S. herbacea&quot;) are separated as genus &quot;Nemexia&quot;; they are commonly known by the rather ambiguous name &quot;carrion flowers&quot;.

Greenbriers get their scientific name from the Greek myth of Crocus and the nymph Smilax. Though this myth has numerous forms, it always centers around the unfulfilled and tragic love of a mortal man who is turned into a flower, and a woodland nymph who is transformed into a brambly vine.

== Description ==

On their own, &quot;Smilax&quot; plants will grow as shrubs, forming dense impenetrable thickets. They will also grow over trees and other plants up to 10 m high, their hooked thorns allowing them to hang onto and scramble over branches. The genus includes both deciduous and evergreen species. The leaves are heart shaped and vary from 4–30 cm long in different species.

Greenbrier is dioecious. However, only about one in three colonies have plants of both sexes. Plants flower in May and June with white–green clustered flowers. If pollination occurs, the plant will produce a bright red to blue-black spherical berry fruit about 5–10 mm in diameter that matures in the fall (autumn).

== Taxonomy ==

The genus has traditionally been considered as divided into a number of sections, but molecular phylogenetic studies reveals that these morphologically defined subdivisions are not monophyletic. Subdivision is best considered in terms of clades (A–D), corresponding to biogeography, with the main divisions being Old World (clades C, D) and New World (clade B) with the exception of &quot;S. aspera&quot;, that appears to be sister to all other species (clade A) and has a tri-continental disjunction.

Section &quot;Smilax&quot; includes &quot;woody&quot;, prickly vines of temperate North America, for example cat greenbrier (&quot;S. glauca&quot;) and common greenbrier (&quot;S. rotundifolia&quot;). Section &quot;Nemexia&quot; includes unarmed herbaceous plants of temperate North America, for example &quot;carrion flowers&quot; like the smooth herbaceous greenbrier (&quot;S. herbacea&quot;). Section &quot;Heterosmilax&quot; represents a previous separate genus that was found to be embedded within Smilax, and was reduced to a section within it.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The genus has a pantropical distribution, extending into adjacent temperate zones to north and south. 29 species are recognized in Central America and the Caribbean, while there are 20 species in North America north of Mexico. In China, there are 80 species (39 of which are endemic). 

== Ecology ==

The berry is rubbery in texture and has a large, spherical seed in the center. The fruit stays intact through winter, when birds and other animals eat them to survive. The seeds are passed unharmed in the animal&#x27;s droppings. Since many &quot;Smilax&quot; colonies are single clones that have spread by rhizomes, both sexes may not be present at a site, in which case no fruit is formed.

&quot;Smilax&quot; is a very damage-tolerant plant capable of growing back from its rhizomes after being cut down or burned down by fire. This, coupled with the fact that birds and other small animals spread the seeds over large areas, makes the plants very hard to get rid of. It grows best in moist woodlands with a soil pH between 5 and 6. The seeds have the greatest chance of germinating after being exposed to a freeze.
Besides their berries providing an important food for birds and other animals during the winter, greenbrier plants also provide shelter for many other animals. The thorny thickets can effectively protect small animals from larger predators who cannot enter the prickly tangle. Deer and other herbivorous mammals will eat the foliage, as will some invertebrates such as Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), which also often drink nectar from the flowers. Beetles too are known to consume leaves.

Among the Lepidoptera utilizing &quot;Smilax&quot; are Hesperiidae like the water snow flat (&quot;Tagiades litigiosa&quot;), Pieridae like the small grass yellow (&quot;Eurema smilax&quot;), or moths like the peculiar and sometimes flightless genus &quot;Thyrocopa&quot;. But particularly fond of greenbriers are certain Nymphalidae caterpillars, for example those of:
* &quot;Faunis&quot; – faun butterflies
* &quot;Kaniska canace&quot; – blue admiral (on China smilax, &quot;S. china&quot;)
* &quot;Phalanta phalantha&quot; – common leopard (on &quot;S. tetragona&quot;)

== Uses ==
An extract from the roots of some species – most significantly Jamaican sarsaparilla (&quot;S. ornata&quot;) – is used to make the sarsaparilla drink and other root beers, as well as herbal drinks like the popular Baba Roots from Jamaica. Two species, &quot;S. domingensis&quot; and &quot;S. havanensis&quot;, are used in a traditional soda-like Cuban beverage called pru. The roots may also be used in soups or stews. The young shoots can be eaten raw or cooked and are said to taste like asparagus, and the berries can be eaten both raw and cooked. Stuffed smilax pancake, or &quot;fúlíng jiābǐng&quot; (), is a traditional snack from the Beijing region. &quot;S. glabra&quot; is used in Chinese herbology. It is also a key ingredient in the Chinese medical dessert &quot;guīlínggāo&quot;, which makes use of its property to set certain kinds of jelly.

The powdered roots of Jamaican sarsaparilla are known as &quot;Rad. Sarzae. Jam.&quot; in pharmacy and are used as a traditional medicine for gout in Latin American countries. &quot;Köhler&#x27;s Medicinal Plants&quot; of 1887 discusses the American sarsaparilla (&quot;S. aristolochiifolia&quot;), but as early as about 1569, in his treatise devoted to syphilis, the Persian scholar Imad al-Din Mahmud ibn Mas‘ud Shirazi gave a detailed evaluation of the medical properties of chinaroot.

Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin, is reported from &quot;S. menispermoidea&quot;. Other active compounds reported from various greenbrier species are parillin (also sarsaparillin or smilacin), sarsapic acid, sarsapogenin and sarsaponin.

Due to the nectar-rich flowers, species like &quot;S. aristolochiifolia&quot;, &quot;S. bona-nox&quot;, &quot;S. tamnoides&quot; (&quot;S. medica&quot; is a synonym for all three of these species) and &quot;S. officinalis&quot; are also useful honey plants.

A common floral decoration sometimes called &quot;smilax&quot; is &quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;, which may look similar to real &quot;Smilax&quot; but isn’t closely related.

In 18th-century England, a type of beer called china-ale was made by infusing china-root (&quot;S. glabra&quot;) and coriander seeds in ale.

<doc id="169816" wikidata="Q3275545" url="?curid=169816" title="Class variable">
<text>In class-based, object-oriented programming, a class variable is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

A class variable is not an instance variable. It is a special type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between &quot;instance&quot; and &quot;class&quot; members applies to methods (&quot;member functions&quot;) as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods.

==Static member variables and static member functions==

In some languages, class variables and class methods are either statically resolved, not via dynamic dispatch, or their memory statically allocated at compile time (once for the entire class, as static variables), not dynamically allocated at run time (at every instantiation of an object). In other cases, however, either or both of these are dynamic. For example, if classes can be dynamically defined (at run time), class variables of these classes are allocated dynamically when the class is defined, and in some languages class methods are also dispatched dynamically.

Thus in some languages, static member variable or static member function are used synonymously with or in place of &quot;class variable&quot; or &quot;class function&quot;, but these are not synonymous across languages. These terms are commonly used in Java, C#, and C++, where class variables and class methods are declared with the codice_1 keyword, and referred to as static member variables or static member functions.

==Examples==

=== C++ ===

struct Request {

 static int count;
 int number;

 Requestobject() {
 number = count; // modifies the instance variable &quot;this-&gt;number&quot;
 ++count; // modifies the class variable &quot;Request::count&quot;


int Request::count = 0;
In this C++ example, the class variable codice_2 is incremented on each call to the constructor, so that codice_2 always holds the number of Requests that have been constructed, and each new Request object is given a codice_4 in sequential order. Since codice_5 is a class variable, there is only one object codice_2; in contrast, each Request object contains its own distinct codice_4 field.

Also note that the variable codice_2 is initialized only once.

=== Python ===

class Dog:
 vertebrate_group = &#x27;mammals&#x27; # class variable

dog_1 = Dog
print(dog_1.vertebrate_group) # accessing the class variable
In the above Python code, it does not provide much information as there is only class variable in the Dog class that provide the vertebrate group of dog as mammals. In instance variable, you could customize your own object (in this case, dog_1) by having one or more instance variables in the Dog class.

<doc id="169821" wikidata="Q3338007" url="?curid=169821" title="Smilax sect. Nemexia">
<text>Smilax&quot; sect. &quot;Nemexia is a section of plants in the family Smilacaceae. It consists of the herbaceous plants within the genus &quot;Smilax&quot;. &quot;Smilax&quot; species fall into two groups with distinctive morphologies: one group has woody perennial stems with thorns and a vining habit, while the other group has herbaceous stems that die back to the ground each winter. &quot;S.&quot; sect. &quot;Nemexia&quot; is the taxon that comprises the herbaceous species. In the past it was often a genus of its own under the name Nemexia and taxonomists still need further study of the species of &quot;Smilax&quot; to determine its proper rank. However the widely accepted taxonomic system of the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; does not recognize &quot;Nemexia&quot;, nor does the AP-site. Thus &quot;Nemexia&quot; is not currently considered an accepted genus taxon by most plant taxonomists.

The plants in &quot;Smilax&quot;, are called carrion flowers for their malodorous flowers and those plants included in section &quot;Nemexia&quot; also have flowers that smell like rotten meat. The herbaceous species have greenish-yellow flowers and bloom in spring, they are fly pollinated.

==Phylogenetic relationships==
Cladistic analysis among several members of the section was carried out in 2005 on several gene sequences, including the plastid &quot;trnL-F&quot; and &quot;rpl16&quot; sequences and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. The eastern North American species in the morphologically variable &quot;S. herbacea&quot; complex form a sister group to the western North American &quot;S. jamesii&quot;. The analysis did not conclusively clarify whether the &quot;S. herbacea&quot; complex should be recognized as different species. The two East Asian species, &quot;S. riparia&quot; and &quot;S. nipponica&quot;, formed two well-defined clades. It is hypothesized that the ancestor of this section evolved in Asia and spread to North America via the Bering Strait land bridge.

The current entry states &quot;The two East Asian species, S. riparia and S. nipponica, formed two well-defined clades.&quot; But according to the abstract of reference 2 (Fu et al. 2005) &quot;Results strongly support a clade of two well-defined East Asian species, Smilax riparia and S. nipponica.&quot; Thus, the entry should read:

<text>Miner Willy is the protagonist in a series of platform games for the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 home computers. The first two games - &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; were written by Matthew Smith during the early 1980s.

The Willy saga was to be a trilogy and a third game in the series was planned, &quot;Miner Willy Meets The Taxman&quot;.

The series started in 1983 with the release of &quot;Manic Miner&quot;, and was followed up a year later with &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Willy II&quot;. Another game in the series, &quot;The Perils of Willy&quot;, was released solely for the VIC-20. &quot;Andre&#x27;s Night Off&quot; was published as a type-in listing in the June 1984 issue of Computer &amp; Video Games. In addition, quite a few unofficial sequels, remakes, homages and updates have been released.

<text>Survivor is an action game released in 1987 by the Spanish software house Topo Soft and later re-released in the UK by U.S. Gold. It was published for several 8-bit formats including Amstrad CPC, MSX and ZX Spectrum.

==Overview==
The player takes control of an alien (who bears a striking resemblance to the race of aliens from the &quot;Alien&quot; series of films) aboard a huge spacecraft filled with many extraterrestrial creatures. The player must perpetuate the alien&#x27;s race by finding ten pods on the ship and introducing them to the incubators.

The ship itself is split into 142 areas divided into four zones. These zones are joined by doors or air-vents (which the player can crawl through). The zones also consist of different levels connected by lifts.

The pods are found in large rooms which are different from the corridors and vents which make up much of the spacecraft and more closely resemble the sort of room found in 1980s platform games.

Some creatures on the ship are dangerous and the player can spit paralysing acid at them.

The player has a limited amount of energy which can be sapped by hostile creatures on the ship or defence systems. This energy can be replenished by managing to place a pod in an incubator or by eating one of the technicians which can be found wandering around the ship.

<doc id="169832" wikidata="Q33477" url="?curid=169832" title="Eugène Delacroix">
<text>Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix ( ; ; 26 April 1798 – 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist who was regarded as the leader of the French Romantic school.

In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the &quot;forces of the sublime&quot;, of nature in often violent action.

However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, &quot;Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.&quot; Together with Ingres, Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting and is one of the few who was ever photographed.

As a painter and muralist, Delacroix&#x27;s use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott, and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

==Early life==

Eugène Delacroix was born on 26 April 1798 at Charenton-Saint-Maurice in Île-de-France, near Paris. His mother was Victoire Oeben, the daughter of the cabinetmaker Jean-François Oeben.
He had three much older siblings.
Charles-Henri Delacroix (1779–1845) rose to the rank of General in Napoleon&#x27;s army.
Henriette (1780–1827) married the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur (1762–1822).
Henri was born six years later. He was killed at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807.

There are medical reasons to believe that Eugène&#x27;s legal father, Charles-François Delacroix, was not able to procreate at the time of Eugène&#x27;s conception.
Talleyrand, who was a friend of the family and successor of Charles Delacroix as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and whom the adult Eugène resembled in appearance and character, considered himself as his real father. After assuming his office as foreign minister, Talleyrand dispatched Delacroix to The Hague in the capacity of French ambassador to the then Batavian Republic. Delacroix who at the time suffered from erectile dysfunction returned to Paris in early September 1797, only to find his wife pregnant. Talleyrand went on to assist Eugène in the form of numerous anonymous commissions. Throughout his career as a painter, he was protected by Talleyrand, who served successively the Restoration and king Louis-Philippe, and ultimately as ambassador of France in Great Britain, and later by Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny, half-brother of Napoleon III, Grandson of Talleyrand, and speaker of the French House of Commons. His legitimate father, Charles Delacroix, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving 16-year-old Eugène an orphan.
His early education was at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, and at the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen where he steeped himself in the classics and won awards for drawing. In 1815 he began his training with Pierre-Narcisse Guérin in the neoclassical style of Jacques-Louis David. An early church commission, &quot;The Virgin of the Harvest&quot; (1819), displays a Raphael-esque influence, but another such commission, &quot;The Virgin of the Sacred Heart&quot; (1821), evidences a freer interpretation. It precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, and fellow French artist Théodore Géricault, whose works marked an introduction to Romanticism in art.

The impact of Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was profound, and stimulated Delacroix to produce his first major painting, &quot;The Barque of Dante&quot;, which was accepted by the Paris Salon of 1822. The work caused a sensation, and was largely derided by the public and officialdom, yet was purchased by the State for the Luxembourg Galleries; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work, countered by a vigorous, enlightened support, would continue throughout his life. Two years later he again achieved popular success for his &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Chios&quot; and &quot;Missolonghi&quot;===

Delacroix&#x27;s painting of Chios Massacre during the Greek civil wars of 1823–1825 shows dying Greek civilians rounded up for enslavement by the Ottoman Empire. This is one of several paintings he made of contemporary events, expressing the official policy for the Greek cause in Greek War of Independence against the Turks, the English, the Russians, and the French governments. Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style, and the picture was bought by the state. His depiction of suffering was controversial, however, as there was no glorious event taking place, no patriots raising their swords in valour as in David&#x27;s &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot;, only a disaster. Many critics deplored the painting&#x27;s despairing tone; the artist Antoine-Jean Gros called it &quot;a massacre of art&quot;.

The pathos in the depiction of an infant clutching its dead mother had an especially powerful effect, although this detail was condemned as unfit for art by Delacroix&#x27;s critics. A viewing of the paintings of John Constable and the watercolour sketches and art of Richard Parkes Bonnington prompted Delacroix to make extensive, freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape.
Delacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of Missolonghi by Turkish forces in 1825. With a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory, &quot;Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi&quot; displays a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene: the suicide of the Greeks, who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is seen at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet Byron, whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there.

===Romanticism===
A trip to England in 1825 included visits to Thomas Lawrence and Richard Parkes Bonington, and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only full-length portrait, the elegant &quot;Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter&quot; (1826–30). At roughly the same time, Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes, many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years. By 1825, he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare, and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from Goethe&#x27;s Faust. Paintings such as &quot;The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan&quot; (1826), and &quot;Woman with Parrot&quot; (1827), introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent.

These various romantic strands came together in &quot;The Death of Sardanapalus&quot; (1827–28). Delacroix&#x27;s painting of the death of the Assyrian king Sardanapalus shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with colours, exotic costumes and tragic events. The &quot;Death of Sardanapalus&quot; depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is a play by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines.

Sardanapalus&#x27; attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in Romantic imagery in this period in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat is about to be cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time.

A variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in &quot;The Murder of the Bishop of Liège&quot; (1829). It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts a scene from the Middle Ages, that of the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, William de la Marck. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in Rouen and Westminster Hall, the drama plays out in chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the painting&#x27;s vibrant handling as &quot;Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, &quot;The Murder of the Bishop of Liège&quot; was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything&quot;.

===&quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;===
Delacroix&#x27;s most influential work came in 1830 with the painting &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style. Less obviously, it also differs from the Romanticism of Géricault, as exemplified by &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;.

Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions...

Probably Delacroix&#x27;s best-known painting, &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; is an unforgettable image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward under the banner of the tricolour representing liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis Philippe I, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly against a background of smoke.

Although the French government bought the painting, by 1832 officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view. Nonetheless, Delacroix still received many government commissions for murals and ceiling paintings.

Following the Revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of King Louis Philippe, Delacroix&#x27; painting, &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, was finally put on display by the newly elected president, Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III). It is exhibited in the Louvre museum in Paris; although from December 2012 until 2014 it was on exhibit at Louvre-Lens in Lens, Pas-de-Calais.

The boy holding a pistol aloft on the right is sometimes thought to be an inspiration for the Gavroche character in Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

===&quot;Religious Works&quot;===

Delacroix painted hundreds of religious works in his lifetime and had a strong interest in Christianity. He had many commissions for religious paintings, including pieces for the Saints-Anges chapel of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. His religious paintings and style would shift drastically depending on the needs of the commission.

Some of his religious works, such as &quot;Christ On the Sea of Galilee&quot;, had multiple painted versions. Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Pietà,&quot; a painting of the Virgin Mary mourning Christ after his death, was eventually redone by Vincent Van Gogh.

Delacroix reflected on religion through his paintings, and his religious works often show subtle details to Biblical texts. While considered an unbeliever or agnostic, his journal and paintings reveal an openness and receptiveness to spirituality through his art.

==Travel to North Africa==
In 1832, Delacroix traveled to Spain and North Africa in company with the diplomat Charles-Edgar de Mornay, as part of a diplomatic mission to Morocco shortly after the French conquered Algeria. He went not primarily to study art, but to escape from the civilization of Paris, in hopes of seeing a more &quot;primitive&quot; culture. He eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of North Africa, and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in Orientalism. Delacroix was entranced by the people and their clothes, and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings. He believed that the North Africans, in their attire and their attitudes, provided a visual equivalent to the people of Classical Rome and Greece:

The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus...

He managed to sketch some women secretly in Algiers, as in the painting &quot;Women of Algiers in their Apartment&quot; (1834), but generally he encountered difficulty in finding Muslim women to pose for him because of Muslim rules requiring that women be covered. Less problematic was the painting of Jewish women in North Africa, as subjects for the &quot;Jewish Wedding in Morocco&quot; (1837–1841).

While in Tangier, Delacroix made many sketches of the people and the city, subjects to which he would return until the end of his life. Animals—the embodiment of romantic passion—were incorporated into paintings such as &quot;Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable&quot; (1860), &quot;The Lion Hunt&quot; (of which there exist many versions, painted between 1856 and 1861), and &quot;Arab Saddling his Horse&quot; (1855).

==Musical inspirations==

Delacroix drew inspiration from many sources over his career, such as the literary works of William Shakespeare and Lord Byron, and the artistry of Michelangelo. But, throughout his life, he felt a constant need for music, saying in 1855 that &quot;nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling.&quot; He also said, while working at Saint-Sulpice, that music put him in a state of &quot;exaltation&quot; that inspired his painting. It was often from music, whether the most melancholy renditions of Chopin or the &quot;pastoral&quot; works of Beethoven, that Delacroix was able to draw the most emotion and inspiration. At one point during his life, Delacroix befriended and made portraits of the composer Chopin; in his journal, Delacroix praised him frequently.

==Murals and later life==
In 1838 Delacroix exhibited &quot;Medea about to Kill Her Children&quot;, which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale treatment of a scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts Medea clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by Jason. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light that penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the Lille Musée des Beaux-Arts; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined &quot;The Barque of Dante&quot; and &quot;Scenes from the Massacres of Chios&quot;.

From 1833 on Delacroix received numerous commissions to decorate public buildings in Paris. In that year he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des Députés, Palais Bourbon, which was not completed until 1837, and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist Marie-Élisabeth Blavot-Boulanger. For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large &quot;Pietà&quot;, and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon of the Louvre. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. They included &quot;Jacob Wrestling with the Angel&quot;, &quot;Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple&quot;. These commissions offered him the opportunity to compose on a large scale in an architectural setting, much as had those masters he admired, Paolo Veronese, Tintoretto, and Rubens.

The work was fatiguing, and during these years he suffered from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition to his home in Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in Champrosay, where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, Jeanne-Marie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years.

In 1862 Delacroix participated in the creation of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. His friend, the writer Théophile Gautier, became chairman, with the painter Aimé Millet acting as deputy chairman. In addition to Delacroix, the committee was composed of the painters Carrier-Belleuse and Puvis de Chavannes. Among the exhibitors were Léon Bonnat, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Charles-François Daubigny, Gustave Doré, and Édouard Manet. Just after his death in 1863, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs by Delacroix—and ceased to mount any further exhibitions.

The winter of 1862–63 was extremely rough for Delacroix; he was suffering from a bad throat infection that seemed to get worse over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after having a conversation. On 1 June he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to again see his doctor, who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could eat was fruit. Delacroix realized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while ordering everything in his studio to be sold. He also inserted a clause forbidding any representation of his features, &quot;whether by a death-mask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly.&quot; On 13 August, Delacroix died, with Jenny by his side. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

His house, formerly situated along the canal of the Marne, is now near the exit of the motorway leading from Paris to central Germany.

==Legacy==

At the sale of his work in 1864, 9140 works were attributed to Delacroix, including 853 paintings, 1525 pastels and water colours, 6629 drawings, 109 lithographs, and over 60 sketch books. The number and quality of the drawings, whether done for constructive purposes or to capture a spontaneous movement, underscored his explanation, &quot;Colour always occupies me, but drawing preoccupies me.&quot;
Delacroix produced several fine self-portraits, and a number of memorable portraits which seem to have been done purely for pleasure, among which were the portrait of fellow artist Baron Schwiter, an inspired small oil of the violinist Niccolò Paganini, and Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand, a double portrait of his friends, the composer Frédéric Chopin and writer George Sand; the painting was cut after his death, but the individual portraits survive.

On occasion Delacroix painted pure landscapes (&quot;The Sea at Dieppe&quot;, 1852) and still lifes (&quot;Still Life with Lobsters&quot;, 1826–27), both of which feature the virtuoso execution of his figure-based works. He is also well known for his &quot;Journal&quot;, in which he gave eloquent expression to his thoughts on art and contemporary life.

A generation of impressionists was inspired by Delacroix&#x27;s work. Renoir and Manet made copies of his paintings, and Degas purchased the portrait of Baron Schwiter for his private collection. His painting at the church of Saint-Sulpice has been called the &quot;finest mural painting of his time&quot;.

Contemporary Chinese artist Yue Minjun has created his own interpretation of Delacroix&#x27;s painting &quot;Massacre of Chios&quot;, which retains the same name. Yue Minjun&#x27;s painting was itself sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for nearly $4.1 million in 2007.

His pencil drawing &quot;Moorish Conversation on a Terrace&quot; was discovered as part of the Munich Art Hoard.

<text>Tracy Chapman (born March 30, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter, widely known for her hit singles &quot;Fast Car&quot; (1988) and &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot; (1995).

She was signed to Elektra Records by Bob Krasnow in 1987. The following year she released her debut album, &quot;Tracy Chapman&quot;, which became a commercial success, boosted by her appearance at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert, and was certified 6× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album received six Grammy Award nominations, including one for Album of the Year, three of which she won: Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single &quot;Fast Car&quot;, and Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 1989, she released her second album, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, which earned her an additional Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Her third album, &quot;Matters of the Heart&quot;, followed in 1992.

Her fourth album, &quot;New Beginning&quot;, was released in 1995 and became another worldwide success. It was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA and yielded the hit single &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot;, which earned her the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. Five years would pass before the release of her fifth album, &quot;Telling Stories&quot; (2000). &quot;Let It Rain&quot; and &quot;Where You Live&quot; followed in 2002 and 2005, respectively. Her most recent studio album, &quot;Our Bright Future&quot;, was released in 2008. The remastered compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which she curated, was released in 2015.

In 2023, Chapman became the first black person to score a country number one with a solo composition, and to win the Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year, when Luke Combs covered her song &quot;Fast Car&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Chapman was born in Cleveland and was raised by her mother, who bought her a ukulele at age three. Her parents divorced when she was four years old. She began playing guitar and writing songs at age eight. She says that she may have been first inspired to play the guitar by the television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. In her native Cleveland, she experienced frequent bullying and racially motivated assaults as a child.

Raised a Baptist, she attended an Episcopal high school and was accepted into the program A Better Chance, which sponsors students at college preparatory high schools away from their home communities. She graduated from Wooster School in Connecticut then attended Tufts University, majoring in anthropology. While a student at Tufts, she busked in nearby spots, including Harvard Square and on MBTA Red Line platforms. Chapman recorded demos of songs at the Tufts University radio station, WMFO, for copyright purposes while she was a student at Tufts, in exchange for the station&#x27;s right to play her songs.

==Career==
Chapman made her major-stage debut as an opening act for women&#x27;s music pioneer Linda Tillery at Boston&#x27;s Strand Theatre on May 3, 1985. Another Tufts student, Brian Koppelman, heard her playing and brought her to the attention of his father, Charles Koppelman, showing him a demo tape he had smuggled from her college radio station containing the song &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot;. Charles Koppelman, who ran SBK Publishing, signed her in 1986. After she graduated from Tufts in 1987, he helped her to sign a contract with Elektra Records.
At Elektra, she released &quot;Tracy Chapman&quot; (1988). The album was critically acclaimed, and she began touring and building a fanbase. &quot;Fast Car&quot; began its rise on the U.S. charts soon after she performed it at the televised Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in London in June 1988. At the concert, she initially performed a short set in the afternoon, but reached a larger audience when she was a last-minute stand in for Stevie Wonder, who had technical difficulties. This appearance is credited with greatly accelerating sales of the single and album. &quot;Fast Car&quot; became a No. 6 pop hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week ending August 27, 1988. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number 167 on their 2010 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Fast Car&quot;, charted at No. 75 and was followed by &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot;, which peaked at No. 48. The album sold well, going multi-platinum and winning three Grammy Awards, including an honor for her as Best New Artist. Later in 1988 she was a featured performer on the worldwide Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour.

Her follow-up album, &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1989), was less commercially successful than her debut had been, but it still achieved platinum status in the U.S. In 1992, she released &quot;Matters of the Heart&quot;. Her fourth album, &quot;New Beginning&quot; (1995), proved successful, selling over five million copies in the U.S. alone. The album included the hit single &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot;, which won the 1997 Grammy for Best Rock Song and became her most successful single in the U.S. to date, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and going Platinum. Her fifth album, &quot;Telling Stories&quot;, was released in 2000, and later went gold. She released her sixth album, &quot;Let It Rain&quot;, in 2002.

She was commissioned by the American Conservatory Theater to compose music for its production of Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Blood Knot&quot;, a play about apartheid in South Africa, staged in early 2008. Atlantic Records released her eighth studio album, &quot;Our Bright Future&quot; (2008). The album earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album the following year.
She was appointed a member of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival U.S. Documentary jury. She performed Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand By Me&quot; on one of the final episodes of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in April 2015. The performance became a viral hit and was the focus of various news articles including some by &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.
On November 20, 2015, she released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, consisting of 18 tracks including the live version of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. The album is her first global compilation release.

In October 2018, she sued the rapper Nicki Minaj over copyright infringement, alleging that Minaj had sampled her song &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot; without permission. Chapman stated that she had &quot;repeatedly denied&quot; permission for &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot; to be sampled. The lawsuit alleged that Minaj had engaged in copyright infringement (a) by creating the song &quot;Sorry&quot; and (b) by distributing it; she requested an injunction to prevent Minaj from releasing the song. According to the lawsuit, Chapman has a policy of declining all requests for permission to sample her songs. In September 2020, District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips granted summary judgment in favor of Minaj on the first count of her complaint, stating that Minaj&#x27;s experimentation with Chapman&#x27;s song constituted fair use rather than copyright infringement. However, the judge ruled that the second count of the complaint should go to trial. In January 2021, the dispute was settled when Minaj paid Chapman $450,000.

On the eve of the 2020 United States presidential election she performed &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, encouraging people to vote.

When Luke Combs&#x27; version of her song &quot;Fast Car&quot; hit number one on the Country Airplay chart in July 2023, Chapman became the first Black woman to score a country number one with a solo composition. At the 57th Annual Country Music Association Awards in November 2023, she became the first Black woman to ever take home a CMA Award, winning Song of the Year for &quot;Fast Car&quot;, which also made her the first Black songwriter to win that award. During the 66th Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, she joined Combs onstage to sing &quot;Fast Car&quot;.

==Social activism==
Chapman is politically and socially active. In a 2009 interview with National Public Radio, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m approached by lots of organizations and lots of people who want me to support their various charitable efforts in some way. And I look at those requests and I basically try to do what I can. And I have certain interests of my own, generally an interest in human rights.&quot; In 1988 she performed in London as part of a worldwide concert tour to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with Amnesty International. That same year she performed at a tribute concert in honor of South African activist and leader Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 70th birthday, an event which raised money for South Africa&#x27;s Anti-Apartheid Movement and several children&#x27;s charities. She also performed at the event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Amnesty International held in Paris on December 10, 1998, known as &quot;The Struggle Continues...&quot;. She was one of the guest artists at Pavarotti &amp; Friends for Cambodia and Tibet on June 6, 2000, at which she performed a critically acclaimed duet with Luciano Pavarotti of &quot;Baby Can I Hold You Tonight&quot;. In 2004, she performed and rode in the AIDS/LifeCycle event.

She has been involved with Cleveland&#x27;s elementary schools, producing an educational music video highlighting achievements in African-American history. She sponsored &quot;Crossroads in Black History&quot;, an essay contest for high school students in Cleveland and other cities.

She received an honorary doctorate from Saint Xavier University in Chicago in 1997. In 2004 she was given an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts by her alma mater, Tufts University, recognizing her commitment to social activism.

On April 16, 2023, The South African Presidency announced that Chapman along with others would be bestowed with a National Order – &quot;The Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo&quot; which &quot;recognizes eminent foreign nationals for friendship shown to South Africa. It is therefore an Order of peace, cooperation and active expression of solidarity and support.&quot; The Order was bestowed in Silver on her &quot;for her contribution to the fight for freedom by participating in efforts to free Nelson Mandela and raising awareness of human rights violations globally.&quot; An investiture ceremony for the bestowment was held on April 28, 2023.

Chapman often performs at charity events such as Make Poverty History, amfAR, and AIDS/LifeCycle. She is a feminist.

==Personal life==
Although Chapman has never publicly discussed her sexual orientation, writer Alice Walker has said she and Chapman were in a romantic relationship during the mid-1990s. Chapman maintains a strong separation between her personal and professional life. &quot;I have a public life that&#x27;s my work life and I have my personal life&quot;, she said. &quot;In some ways, the decision to keep the two things separate relates to the work I do.&quot; Chapman lives in San Francisco.

<doc id="169836" wikidata="Q191458" url="?curid=169836" title="Entertainment Software Rating Board">
<text>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA, formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA)), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content, particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot; for home consoles and &quot;Doom&quot; for home computers. The industry, pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings, established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary rating system based on the Motion Picture Association film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity.

The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game&#x27;s content and suitability, along with a system of &quot;content descriptors&quot; which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. More recently, the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization. The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game&#x27;s publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game, and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating. The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children. Once a game is rated, the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences.

The ESRB rating system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the video game and retail industries in the subscribing countries for physical releases; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB&#x27;s highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. More recently, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product&#x27;s publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff, allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB. Through the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for online privacy on websites and mobile apps. There have been attempts to pass federal and state laws to force retailers into compliance with the ESRB, but the 2011 Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot; ruled that video games are protected speech, and such laws are therefore unconstitutional.

Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the rating system, along with the organization&#x27;s efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the rating system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the Federal Trade Commission for being the &quot;strongest&quot; self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other watchdog groups for the structure of its operations, particularly after a sexually-explicit minigame was found within 2004 game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas—&quot;which was inaccessible from the game but could be accessed using a user-created modification.

The ESRB has been accused of having a conflict of interest because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that it does not rate certain games, such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board&#x27;s restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.

==History==

===Background===
Video games with objectionable content date back as far as 1976; the arcade game &quot;Death Race&quot; required users to run over &quot;gremlins&quot; with a vehicle and avoid the gravestones they leave behind. Although its graphics were relatively primitive, the game&#x27;s overall theme and the sound effects made when gremlins were killed were considered disturbing by players, prompting media attention. A developer known as Mystique became known for making sexually explicit adult video games for the Atari 2600 console, but garnered the most attention with its controversial 1982 game &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which infamously featured a crude simulation of the rape of a Native American woman. Atari received numerous complaints about the game, and responded by trying to sue the game&#x27;s makers.

A 1983 industry crash, caused by the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted a higher degree of regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.

When asked in 1987 about the suitability of a film-like rating system for video games, a representative of the Software Publishers Association said that &quot;Adult computer software is nothing to worry about. It&#x27;s not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with a big witchhunt in the music recording industry, and they got absolutely nowhere&quot;. The association did recommend voluntary warnings for games like &quot;Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards&quot; (1987).

=== Formation and early years ===
Video games&#x27; progression into the 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, and the ability to use full-motion video (FMV) content in games. In the United States Senate, Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin led hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society which began in 1993. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, and the ability to use violent &quot;fatality&quot; moves to defeat opponents, while &quot;Night Trap&quot; featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and exploitive. Both Nintendo and Sega had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; for the Super NES was censored to remove the game&#x27;s overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales. In May 1993, British censors banned &quot;Night Trap&quot; from being sold to children under 15 years old in the United Kingdom, which was an influence on Sega&#x27;s decision to create an age rating system.

At the time of the 1993 hearings, there was no industry-wide standard in place for rating video games, which was a point of contention at the hearings. Sega had implemented its own voluntary ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), largely to rate games released for its own consoles, which Nintendo largely disputed. The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform had its own age ratings voluntarily determined by game publishers, and the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman did not believe that these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games. Stores like Toys &quot;R&quot; Us refused to sell titles they deemed were too violent for children following the hearings.

With the threat of federal regulations, a group of major video game developers and publishers, including Acclaim Entertainment and Electronic Arts along with Nintendo and Sega, formed a political trade group known as the Interactive Digital Software Association in April 1994, with a goal to create a self-regulatory framework for assessing and rating video games. While Sega had proposed that the industry use its VRC rating system, Nintendo representatives objected to the idea because they did not want to associate themselves with the work of their main competitor; instead, a vendor-neutral rating system known as the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was developed. The formation of the ESRB was officially announced to Congress on July 29, 1994. The ESRB was officially launched on September 16, 1994; its system consisted of five age-based ratings; &quot;Early Childhood&quot;, &quot;Kids to Adults&quot; (later renamed &quot;Everyone&quot; in 1998), &quot;Teen&quot;, &quot;Mature&quot;, and &quot;Adults Only&quot;. The ESRB was the first rating system to also use &quot;descriptors&quot; with brief explanations of the content contained in a game, as the ESRB found that parents wanted to have knowledge of this type of content before they purchased games for their children.

The U.S. arcade gaming industry did not adopt the ESRB system, with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) having cited &quot;fundamental differences between the coin-operated and consumer segments of the video game industry&quot; as reasoning. The AAMA, the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, adopted their own three-tier &quot;Parental Advisory System&quot; in 1994, which uses three color-coded levels of content intensity (designated by green, yellow, and red stickers affixed to arcade cabinet artwork).

=== Expansion and recent developments ===
Alongside its efforts to classify video games, the ESRB also formed a division known as Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi), which rated internet content using a similar system to its video game ratings. ESRBi also notably partnered with the internet service provider America Online to integrate these ratings into its existing parental controls. ESRBi was discontinued in 2003.

In 2002, Dr. Arthur Pober, the original president of the ESRB, stepped down so he could focus on academics. In November 2002, he was formally replaced by Patricia Vance, who formerly worked for The Princeton Review and The Walt Disney Company. In March 2005, the ESRB introduced a new rating, &quot;Everyone 10+&quot;, designating games with content of a relatively higher impact than those of games rated &quot;Everyone&quot;, but still not high enough to garner a &quot;Teen&quot; rating. The first game to receive this rating was &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot;.

In response to the growth of smartphone use, in November 2011, CTIA, a group of major U.S. companies representing the wireless industry, and ESRB announced the co-development of a free, voluntary ratings process for mobile app stores. The system uses ESRB&#x27;s icons and content descriptors, along with four additional &quot;Interactive Elements&quot; (&quot;Digital Purchases&quot;, &quot;Shares Info,&quot; &quot;Shares Location,&quot; and &quot;Users Interact&quot;) to inform users of an app&#x27;s behavior in regards to data collection and interactions with others. Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile US were among the first to implement the system for their own application storefronts, and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Phone Marketplace already supported ESRB ratings upon its introduction. ESRB president Patricia Vance explained that the partnership was intended to help broaden the ESRB&#x27;s reach into the mobile market, and that &quot;consumers, especially parents, benefit from having a consistently applied set of ratings for games rather than a fragmented array of different systems.&quot;

In November 2012, the ESRB and other video game ratings boards, including PEGI, the Australian Classification Board, and USK among others, established a consortium known as the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC). The group sought to design an online, questionnaire-based rating process for digitally-distributed video games that could generate ratings for multiple video game ratings organizations at once. The resulting ratings information is tied to a unique code, which can then be used by online storefronts to display the corresponding rating for the user&#x27;s region. The three major console makers, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have all committed to supporting IARC for their digital storefronts, including ESRB ratings for North American markets. Google Play Store was updated in March 2015 to adopt and display ESRB ratings for apps in North America through IARC. Windows Store also implemented IARC in January 2016. Apple&#x27;s App Store still uses its own generic age rating system and does not use the ESRB or IARC systems.

==Rating process==
While the ESRB formally operates within the ESA, they operate independently of the trade group to assess and apply industry-wide standards for video games. The ESRB operates out of offices in New York City.

To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher submits a detailed questionnaire (a &quot;Long Form&quot;) that describes the graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, along with a video (VHS, DVD, video file, or other means) that demonstrates this content which can include gameplay footage and in-game cutscenes. This information includes the game&#x27;s context, storyline, gameplay mechanics, reward system, unlockable and otherwise &quot;hidden&quot; content, and other elements that may affect its rating; the ESRB seeks to have enough information on context of the extreme content to be able to judge its appropriateness. The video game publisher may also provide printed copies of the game&#x27;s script and lyrics from songs in the game. The publisher also pays an upfront fee for obtaining the ESRB rating.

After the information is reviewed for completeness and appropriateness by ESRB staff, the material is sent to at least three different raters, who are treated anonymously and prevented from talking directly with the publishers through the ESRB offices. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with casual and &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who all live in the New York City area. The raters discuss what the most appropriate and &quot;helpful&quot; rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Most ESRB reviews at this stage take on the order of 45 minutes, though some cases based on material provided by publisher or by the type of game have taken up to four hours over multiple days to complete. One rater is designated as the lead for each game reviewed. The lead rater writes up the report and conclusions of the process, and works with other ESRB staff members to do a parity analysis to make sure the assigned ratings align with ratings from similar games in the past. Overall, between the raters&#x27; discussion and final reporting, the process takes about a week to complete.

At times during the internal review, the raters may find inconsistencies between the details on the Long Form and in the video footage. Should these occur, the ESRB contacts the publisher to ask for clarification of these matters, typically which are then resolved quickly. In some cases, the omission of certain material on the Long Form or in the footage may be significant. For any publisher, the ESRB gives them a number of warnings of such omissions which help the publisher to better prepare future submissions, but should a publisher make such omissions multiple times, the ESRB will fine them for subsequent infractions.

The publisher receives this final report of what rating the game will carry. According to the ESRB, most publishers have a good expectation of what they will be assigned and do not challenge what they are given. However, if a publisher does not agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may ask questions about why a rating was given and work back and forth with the ESRB to adjust it. Alternatively, the publisher may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating, which restarts the process. In such cases, the ESRB does not inform the publisher of what content must be changed or removed to change the rating, but only which content triggered certain rating elements, leaving the choice to the publisher to resolve. For example, an initial cut of &quot;The Punisher&quot; was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.

When the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game&#x27;s packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for a more thorough review, typically for up to four hours. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall to reprint proper labels, if deemed necessary. With newer games often having large content patches at release as well as downloadable content, season passes, and other games as a service updates, the ESRB will flag these games in their system and periodically check on the new content to make sure it remains within the established rating.

The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.

===Associated media review===
Besides evaluating games, the ESRB also oversees the marketing and advertising materials released for games that have undergone the ESRB rating process or in progress. This includes making sure that such material includes the given ESRB rating, and that the marketing has been tailored appropriately to its target audience, particularly for television spots. The ESRB provides guidance for what type of content is reasonable for certain types of games, what type of content may be inappropriately gratuitous, and the presentation of the ESRB rating within the work. The ESRB will go back and forth with publishers when there is objectionable elements within the marketing to correct these issues.

===Shortened processes===
In April 2011, the ESRB introduced its Short Form, a free, streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product (the Long Form), publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game&#x27;s rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps. The ESRB phased out the Short Form for digital-only games, instead directing those developers and publishers to use the similar free questionnaire-driven IARC program, which was being adopted beyond mobile app stores, including the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store, as a requirement for posting, and which automatically are accepted by several national-level rating boards, including the ESRB.

In response to concerns from Sony on the growing number of indie game titles that were receiving physical releases alongside retail ones, the ESRB began instituting new rules around August 2017 that any retail product was mandated to undergo the standard Long Form review for the game, disallowing the use of the Short Form for such titles. Alongside this, ESRB introduced a &quot;value tier&quot; for the Long Form review process for games developed at lower budgets (under $1 million), with a cost of $3000 for obtaining the retail rating. This decision has impacted the choice of several boutique indie game publishers, who have either cancelled plans for retail versions or had to stop selling retail versions to comply with the new ESRB rules.

==Ratings==

ESRB ratings are primarily identified through icons, which are displayed on the packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating. A full label, containing both &quot;content descriptors&quot; and rating, are typically displayed on the back of a game&#x27;s packaging.

Games that provide post-release downloadable content must ensure that the new content remains consistent with the original ESRB rating; otherwise the ESRB requires that the original game be re-evaluated and remarked with the more appropriate rating in considering this new content. 

The appearance of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated look, they were first updated in late 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In August 2013, the rating icons were streamlined again; the textual name of the rating became black text on white, the &quot;content rated by&quot; tagline was removed, and registered trademark symbols were moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase the icons&#x27; clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting the growth in the digital distribution of video games.


===Retired ratings===

=== Content descriptors ===
In addition to the main age-based ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate one or more of 31 &quot;content descriptors&quot;, which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of violence, language, sexual content, nudity, use of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and drugs, crude and mature humor, or gambling. When a descriptor is preceded by the term &quot;Mild&quot;, it is intended to convey low frequency (unless the definition of the content descriptor says otherwise), intensity, or severity.

===Interactive elements===
An ESRB ratings label may also include a third section related to &quot;Interactive Elements&quot;, which disclaims if a game offers online communications, collects personal data, or offers digital goods or other premiums (including downloadable content and microtransactions) that require payment of real money to obtain.
==Enforcement==
The ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a self-regulatory basis by the video game and retail industries; in markets where it is used, retailers typically enforce the &quot;Mature&quot; rating using photo identification, and refuse to stock video games that have not been rated by the organization, or are rated &quot;Adults Only&quot;. Modern video game consoles include parental controls that can be configured to restrict games played by specific users, using factors such as their ESRB rating. The ESRB has also taken action against video game distributors who use the ratings icons in advertising without authorization or having actually been issued the rating by the board.

Steam, the largest digital distribution storefront for personal computers, does display ratings when available, and allows games to be categorized and filtered based on categories and the extent of potentially objectionable content, but an ESRB rating is not mandatory. As of June 2018, following complaints regarding inconsistent enforcement of its previous guidelines, Steam stated that it would only ban the sale of games that contain blatantly illegal content, or games that it classifies as being &quot;straight up trolling&quot;. However, in March 2019, it was revealed that there are still undisclosed limitations to this policy based on &quot;costs and risks&quot; associated with Steam&#x27;s ability to distribute specific games. Epic Games Store also prohibits &quot;Adults Only&quot;-rated games, unless the rating was solely for their use of blockchain technology.

In the United States, there have been attempts at the state and federal level to introduce laws requiring retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system. In 2004, California Assemblyman Leland Yee sponsored a state bill requiring retailers to stock M-rated games on separate shelves that are at least from the ground. The bill was passed, after it was modified to only require that retailers promote awareness of the ESRB ratings system to their customers.

The following year, California passed AB 1179, a second bill sponsored by Yee, which banned the sale of &quot;violent video games&quot; to minors. The term was defined using a variation of the Miller test (originally created to judge whether a work is obscene), separate from any rating the game may have received. In a landmark ruling, the law was struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot;, which ruled that AB 1179 was unconstitutional because video games are a protected form of expression.

In Canada, ESRB ratings are enforced under provincial laws by film ratings boards in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. As in the U.S., retailers voluntarily enforce the ratings regardless. Prior to the implementation of the Film Classification Act, 2005, which gave it the power to enforce ESRB ratings, the Ontario Film Review Board had used its own powers to classify the M-rated &quot;Manhunt&quot; as a film and give it a &quot;Restricted&quot; rating to ban its sale to those under 18. By contrast, the British Columbia Film Classification Office considered the ESRB rating to be appropriate.

== Marketing ==

The ESRB enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging and promotional materials (including advertisements and trailers) properly display rating information, restricting where promotional materials for games rated &quot;Teen&quot; or higher can appear, prohibiting publishers from glamorizing or exploiting a game&#x27;s rating in marketing materials, and requiring online marketing of games rated &quot;Mature&quot; or higher to be restricted to users who are appropriately aged. This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising &quot;to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate.&quot; The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers&#x27; websites or social media outlets. 

A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.

In March 2013, the ESRB eased certain restrictions on the promotion of M-rated games. Firstly, trailers for games that are or are anticipated to be rated &quot;Mature&quot; can be cleared by the ESRB as being appropriate for &quot;general&quot; audiences—similarly to the &quot;green band&quot; ratings issued by the MPAA for film trailers. Secondly, the board began to allow, on a case-by-case basis depending on the target demographic of the game, M-rated games to be cross-promoted in the marketing materials of games with lower ratings.

== Online privacy ==
In addition to its video game ratings operation, the ESRB also offers an online privacy program which helps websites adopt privacy policies and data usage practices which comply with relevant laws and best practices for the collection and use of personal information, and provides &quot;Privacy Certified&quot; seals indicating certification under the ESRB&#x27;s privacy guidelines. In June 2013, the service was extended to mobile apps, with a particular emphasis on helping application developers comply with the then-upcoming changes to the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act.

== Reception ==
The ESRB has considered its system to be effective, due in part to initiatives by the Board to promote enforcement and consumer awareness of the system, and efforts by retailers to prevent the sale of M-rated games to minors.

In the year following its 1994 launch, the ESRB rating system had achieved widespread usage across the console game industry, although adoption was not yet as high within the PC gaming industry. Lieberman and Kohl also reported that some retailers were reluctant to the idea of removing older, non-rated games from their shelves, and that some retail employees lacked knowledge of the new system. By 2008, the Federal Trade Commission reported 20% of underaged mystery shoppers were able to successfully purchase an M-rated video game from a selection of retailers—a 22 percent reduction from 2007. By 2011, these numbers had dropped further to 13%. In its 2009 Report to Congress, the FTC recognized the ESRB for having &quot;the strongest self-regulatory code&quot; of all entertainment sectors because of its enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines.

===Ratings accuracy===
The ESRB has often been accused of not rating certain games, such as &quot;Manhunt&quot; and the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, harshly enough for violence and other related themes, and for lacking transparency in certain aspects of the ratings process. Critics have argued that some games only received the M rating rather than the stricter AO rating because of the commercial effects of such a rating; console manufacturers and most retailers refuse to distribute AO-rated games, dramatically affecting their commercial availability. An ESRB representative stated that the Board uses the AO rating when warranted, even due to violence, and that in most occasions, publishers would edit the game to meet the M rating to ensure wide commercial availability instead of keeping the AO rating. The film classification boards of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario respectively classified the M-rated games &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Manhunt&quot; as films due to concerns over the nature of their content, and gave them &quot;Restricted&quot; ratings, legally restricting their sale to adults.

There has been a correlation between the M rating and sales; a 2007 study by Electronic Entertainment Design and Research found that M-rated games &quot;have both the highest average Metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States&quot;, and NPD Group found that 7 of the top 20 video games of 2010 (including the #1 game, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;) were M-rated, even though only 5% of games released that year carried the rating.

In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family (NIMF) criticized the ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating, arguing that because it has a vested interest in the video game industry, it did not want to perform actions that would affect their commercial availability. The organization stated that &quot;study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request.&quot; The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization &quot;relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence&quot;, was &quot;imposing its own narrow values and morality on the rest of the country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view&quot;, and did not reply to the ESRB&#x27;s request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF&#x27;s study and &quot;report card&quot; used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.

On the other hand, some have felt that the &quot;Mature&quot; rating is too broad; video game journalist Ben Kuchera noted that &quot;Halo 3&quot;—a sci-fi first-person shooter whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, had received an M rating for &quot;Blood and Gore,&quot; &quot;Mild Language&quot; and &quot;Violence&quot;. He argued that &quot;having a game like &quot;Halo 3&quot; share the same rating as &quot;Saints Row IV&quot;, which carries the &#x27;Blood,&#x27; Intense Violence,&#x27; &#x27;Partial Nudity,&#x27; &#x27;Sexual Content,&#x27; &#x27;Strong Language&#x27; and &#x27;Use of Drugs&#x27; descriptors was always silly, and it weakened the thrust of the ratings system.&quot; Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was relatively harsher to children than that of the &quot;Saints Row&quot; series due to the latter&#x27;s comedic tone, but still noted that &quot;as parents we know what&#x27;s right and what isn&#x27;t for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents.&quot; &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot; received a &quot;Teen&quot; rating instead of &quot;Mature&quot;. Microsoft Xbox division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been &quot;surprised&quot; by the M rating on previous installments &quot;given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that&quot;, but that the &quot;Teen&quot; rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.

=== Adults Only rating ===

The &quot;Adults Only&quot; (AO) rating has attracted a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which has been criticized for stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers&#x27; objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is &quot;true in every entertainment medium&quot;, but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a good thing for the ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children&#x27;s products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game&#x27;s motion controls to act out the game&#x27;s &quot;many graphic torture scenes and murders&quot;.

Attitudes towards AO-rated games have also been influenced by the types of games that have received the rating; Peter Payne, head of Peach Princess, a publisher of English translations of Japanese eroge visual novels, believed that the &quot;Adults Only&quot; rating had acquired a &quot;smutty&quot; and &quot;tasteless&quot; reputation since the majority of AO-rated titles were either niche pornographic titles such as eroge games, or immature titles such as &quot;Riana Rouge&quot; (which &quot;Polygon&quot; described as a game which had the quality of an adult movie, and &quot;[aimed] to do nothing more than tell low-brow jokes and show nude women prancing around&quot;) and &quot;Lula 3D&quot; (whose packaging advertised the inclusion of &quot;Bouncin&#x27; Boobs Technology&quot;).

By contrast, the ESRB has only officially issued the AO rating for extreme violence three times: &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for &quot;Animated Violence&quot; and &quot;Animated Blood and Gore&quot;. Due to objections over the game&#x27;s content, &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was canceled by Electronic Arts after it acquired the North American operations of the game&#x27;s publisher, Virgin Interactive. &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version would be released exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria. In January 2015, &quot;Hatred&quot;, a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game&#x27;s developers disputed the rating, arguing that &quot;its violence isn&#x27;t really that bad and this harsh language isn&#x27;t overused&quot;, but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.

===Hidden content===

The 2005 game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was originally intended to include a broader amount of sexually explicit content, but Rockstar North elected to leave the content out of the final game due to concerns over its eventual ESRB rating. Due to time constraints, Rockstar could not remove this content from the game&#x27;s source code entirely, and instead made it inaccessible via normal gameplay; soon after the release of &quot;San Andreas&quot;, a modification for the PC version known as &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; allowed access to an incomplete sex minigame that was present in the code of the released game.

The discovery of the minigame caused California State Assemblyman Leland Yee to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the scenes in console versions of the game. Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game&#x27;s disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device. Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M. 

In May 2006, &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; had its rating changed from T to M due to &quot;more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating&quot;, along with a third-party mod for the PC version allowing the use of topless female characters. The game&#x27;s co-publisher, Bethesda Softworks, decided not to re-edit the game or contest the new rating, but noted that &quot;Oblivion&quot;″s content was &quot;not typical&quot; of games with the M rating, and that the game &quot;does not present the central themes of violence that are common to those products.&quot;

In the wake of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its policies in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise &quot;hidden&quot; content in the game as part of the ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented the content of their game after further reviews. In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, &quot;there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales.&quot; However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator Sam Brownback, California State Senator Leland Yee, and Michigan Congressman Fred Upton (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had &quot;lost&quot; its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board&#x27;s conflict of interest with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB&#x27;s full knowledge.

In late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled bills to place governmental oversight on aspects of the ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the Video Game Decency Act, explaining that developers had &quot;done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids&quot;, and that the bill would &quot;[go] hand in hand with the mission of the industry&#x27;s own ratings system.&quot; Brownback proposed a bill known as the Truth in Video Game Rating Act, which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of the organization and the possibility of forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.

=== Microtransactions ===
In October 2017, in response to growing criticism of the loot box model for video game microtransactions (which grant chances at earning randomized items of various rarities, typically cosmetic in nature, in exchange for payment), the ESRB stated their opinion that they were not a form of gambling. They described them as a voluntary and optional aspect of a video game, and comparable to booster packs for collectible card games because their purchase guarantees that a user will receive items, but not necessarily high-value items all the time. The ESRB added that games that contain actual wagering of real money would hold the Adults Only rating.

On February 14, 2018, U.S. senator Maggie Hassan asked the ESRB to examine if games with loot box microtransactions were being marketed in an &quot;ethical and transparent way&quot; that &quot;adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices.&quot; The ESRB subsequently announced on February 27, 2018, that it would introduce a new label for any games that contain &quot;the ability to purchase digital goods or premiums with real world currency&quot;. The announcement was criticized for being overreaching and ambiguous, as it applies to not only microtransactions, but any purchases of digital goods in relation to a game (which includes downloadable content), and would thus apply to almost all modern video games. Patrica Vance stated that the ESRB avoided references to specific types of microtransactions, so that the advisory label could be understood by parents unaware of specific details. Vance added that the ESRB was &quot;unable to find any evidence that children specifically have been [psychologically] impacted by loot boxes&quot; or that they caused children to develop &quot;some sort of tendency towards gambling.&quot; The new label &quot;in-game purchases&quot; was added to ESRB&#x27;s standards by April 2018.

On April 13, 2020, the ESRB announced on their official blog that they are introducing a new interactive elements: &quot;in-game purchases (includes random items)&quot;. This notice will specifically apply to &quot;all games that include purchases with any randomized elements&quot;, which includes, but is not limited to, loot boxes, gacha games, item or card packs, prize wheels, and treasure chests. The original label will still apply for &quot;other type purchases&quot;, such as additional levels, cosmetics, DLC, expansions, and other downloadable contents.

<text>Stabbing Westward is an American industrial rock/alternative rock band. Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus formed the band in 1985 in Macomb, Illinois. The band released an extended play in 1992, followed by four studio albums: &quot;Ungod&quot; (1994), &quot;Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel&quot; (1996), &quot;Darkest Days&quot; (1998), and &quot;Stabbing Westward&quot; (2001). The band announced a dissolution in February 2002. Two compilation albums were later released in 2003. Stabbing Westward reunited in 2016 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its formation and continued to perform live shows. The band&#x27;s first new album in 21 years, &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;, was released in 2022.

== History ==
===Early years (1985–1992)===
Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus formed the band Stabbing Westward when they were in college. They came up with the name while working at the college radio station WIUS-FM. It was allegedly from a 1950s speech regarding political fears of Communism &quot;stabbing westward&quot;. During an interview in 1996, Hall stated, &quot;Since we went to Western Illinois University, [the name] Stabbing Westward had a certain &#x27;kill everybody in the school&#x27; vibe to it! The school&#x27;s way out in farm country and the country is really close minded. I was walking around like Robert Smith with real big hair, big baggy black clothes, black fingernail polish and eye makeup. They just didn&#x27;t get it. We hated the town.&quot;

Moving to Chicago, Illinois in 1985, the original lineup for Stabbing Westward consisted of Hall on bass and lead vocals, Flakus on keyboards, and Jim Clanin on guitars. Clanin would briefly be replaced on guitars by Andrew Hunter, and bassist Jim Sellers was added on as well. Angelo Negrette was also added as a live drummer. This lineup of the band recorded the 1991 extended play tape &quot;Iwo Jesus&quot;, and featured four songs: an early version of &quot;Violent Mood Swings&quot; (titled &quot;Violent Mood Swing&quot;), &quot;P.O.M.F.&quot; (which contains elements of the later song &quot;The Thing I Hate&quot;), an early version of &quot;Shame&quot;, and &quot;Plastic Jesus&quot;. &quot;Violent Mood Swing&quot; was also included on the 1992 compilation CD &quot;The Cyberflesh Conspiracy&quot;.

The band&#x27;s official website stated that &quot;the original EP was recorded on an eight-track tape machine synched to an Emax II Sampler and an EMU SP1200 sampling drum machine. 100 copies were originally printed and sold both at local shows and in the legendary Wax Trax Record store in Chicago.&quot;

Hall took a brief break to tour with the band Die Warzau as that group&#x27;s percussionist before continuing to work on Stabbing Westward. Hall, Flakus, and Sellers later recruited Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails) on drums to replace Negrette, as Hall had met Vrenna when playing in Die Warzau. Vrenna played drums on all of the demo recordings that ultimately landed Stabbing Westward their record deal with Columbia Records. The demo recordings included &quot;Violent Mood Swings&quot;, &quot;Lies&quot;, and &quot;Nothing&quot;. They were recorded at a studio in Evanston, Illinois. At the insistence of the band&#x27;s record label, Stuart Zechman was brought in on guitar, as previous guitarist Hunter was no longer in the band. After Vrenna returned to Nine Inch Nails, the band hired David Suycott, who was a high school friend of Flakus.

===&quot;Ungod&quot; (1993–1995)===
With a solidified lineup including Zechman on guitar and Suycott on drums, the band in 1993 recorded at Eden Studios in London with producer John Fryer. This resulted in their major label (Columbia Records) debut album, &quot;Ungod&quot;, which was released on February 15, 1994. The band landed an opening slot on Depeche Mode&#x27;s Exotic Tour in summer 1994, and opened North American tour dates in fall 1994 for Killing Joke, but Stabbing Westward&#x27;s album sales still didn&#x27;t increase.

David Suycott abruptly dropped out of the band toward the end of the &quot;Ungod&quot; tour. Andy Kubiszewski was called in to replace Suycott&#x27;s position for the remainder of the shows. This fast replacement required Kubiszewski to learn all of Suycott&#x27;s parts while on his flight to meet with the band. Kubiszewski became a permanent fixture of Stabbing Westward.

The &quot;Thread Mix&quot; of the song &quot;Violent Mood Swings&quot; was included in the to the 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot;, and briefly appeared in the movie itself for one scene. The song &quot;Nothing&quot; was featured in the 1995 motion picture &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, but was not included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack release. &quot;Nothing&quot; was later included in the credits of the movie &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and both it and &quot;Lost&quot; were featured on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. The songs &quot;Lies&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; were also all featured in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; movie in 1995; however, these songs were not featured on the CD soundtrack.

===&quot;Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel&quot; (1995–1997)===
When Stuart Zechman departed the band after the &quot;Ungod&quot; tour due to personal differences, the remaining band members found themselves without one of their major songwriters. New drummer Andy Kubiszewski took over some songwriting duties afterward. Prior to playing in Stabbing Westward, Kubiszewski had not only played drums in The The, recorded one song for Nine Inch Nails, and played in Prick, but had been the singer and songwriter in the Cleveland-based Exotic Birds. Shortly after Zechman&#x27;s departure, Kubiszewski played the band dozens of demos and Exotic Birds recordings. Included were &quot;What Do I Have to Do?&quot;, &quot;Haunting Me&quot;, &quot;Sometimes It Hurts&quot;, &quot;Crushing Me&quot;, &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, &quot;Desperate Now&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye&quot;. These tracks would later find space on both the &quot;Wither&quot; and &quot;Darkest Days&quot; albums. When the band headed to Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, without a permanent guitar player, they decided to play all the guitar parts themselves, with Sellers and Kubiszewski taking on most of the guitar duties.

In 1996, the &quot;Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel&quot; LP became a success, landing them their first certified gold album, aided by the singles &quot;Shame&quot; and &quot;What Do I Have to Do?&quot; which granted the band heavy rotation on MTV, MuchMusic, and radio. Tour mates for this album included Sponge. &quot;What Do I Have to Do?&quot; was featured in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Masterminds&quot;, as well as in the episode &quot;Tempest&quot; of &quot;Smallville&quot; years later. The band later recruited Mark Eliopulos after the &quot;Wither&quot; recording sessions were completed to handle the live element of the main guitar parts.

===&quot;Darkest Days&quot; (1998–2000)===
Stabbing Westward relocated to Los Angeles, where they began work on the 1998 album, titled &quot;Darkest Days&quot;. &quot;Darkest Days&quot; was envisioned as a four-act story by the band (but never marketed as such). This is the only release featuring studio work by Mark Eliopulos. The first single &quot;Save Yourself&quot; had success yet the album failed to sell as well as its predecessor. Stabbing Westward continued to tour with bands like Placebo, The Cult, Monster Magnet, and Depeche Mode, while playing numerous summer festivals. Due to a broken collarbone, Kubiszewski was forced to sit out the remainder of the touring cycle. He was replaced for three dates by former drummer Chris Vrenna, then Johnny Haro for the remaining dates. Haro joined Econoline Crush after Kubiszewski&#x27;s return.

The song &quot;The Thing I Hate&quot; was featured as the opening theme song in the Sony PlayStation game &quot;Duke Nukem: Time to Kill&quot;, which was released in September 1998. A remixed version of the song &quot;Torn Apart&quot; was featured on the &quot;Spawn&quot; movie soundtrack in July 1997. The song &quot;Save Yourself&quot; was featured in the 1998 films &quot;Urban Legend&quot; and &quot;&quot;, in addition to the 2012 &quot;True Blood&quot; Season 5 finale. The song &quot;Haunting Me&quot; was featured in the opening scenes of the 1998 teen horror flick &quot;The Faculty&quot;.

In 2000, the day before the band was to fly to Hawaii to record the follow-up to &quot;Darkest Days&quot; with producer Bob Rock, the band was dropped by Columbia Records.

===&quot;Stabbing Westward&quot; and breakup (2001–2002)===
After signing with Koch Records, the new manager wanted the band to create an album with a heavy pop influence. Christopher Hall, Walter Flakus, and Mark Eliopulos fought against the decision. Mark Eliopulos was fired by the manager who then brought in Derrek Hawkins as both a studio and live musician, as well as a new producer, Ed Buller.

The demo for the self-titled album was considered too dark. Old guitar parts from the demos were muted and new pop-driven riffs were created by the new guitarist.

The self-titled album, &quot;Stabbing Westward&quot;, was released on May 22, 2001, and featured the hit &quot;So Far Away&quot;. The album did well in Australia, but ultimately failed to sell worldwide. Before a fifth LP could be recorded, the band did not sign for a new record deal and formally announced that they had disbanded on February 9, 2002.

===Post-breakup (2003–2015)===
* Lead singer Christopher Hall formed the Los Angeles-based band The Dreaming in 2001. They released their debut album &quot;Etched In Blood&quot; in June 2008. Songs from the album received airplay on XM Satellite Radio and rock stations nationwide. The album was distributed in Hot Topic and Best Buy. The band spent three years touring as a headliner and co-headliners with bands such as Trust Company and Flaw. In November 2011, the band released its second album, &quot;Puppet&quot;. It reached No. 32 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart. Their third album, &quot;Rise Again&quot;, was released in February 2015. &quot;From the Ashes&quot;, a remix album, was released in June 2017.
* Walter Flakus has been working with The Clay People and Chokt. He was the APD/Music Director/Afternoon host for Chicago alternative station 101 WKQX. He is now an afternoon DJ for Seattle alternative station 107.7 The End. He joined Hall&#x27;s band The Dreaming in 2015.
* Jim Sellers and his wife opened a natural foods market called Sellers Market in 2005. It appears to have closed in 2012.
* Jim Clanin left the music industry. He owned and operated a Dairy Queen in Illinois.
* Andy Kubiszewski has filled in as the drummer for a handful of Prick shows, joined a new project called Affected with Chris Schleyer, written and produced several songs for the popular Russian pop duo t.A.T.u., and has composed music for dozens of TV shows, including &quot;Monster Garage&quot;, &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;Ax Men&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Jobs&quot;, &quot;The Colony&quot;, and most recently &quot;Storage Wars&quot;. Other film credits include &quot;Jam&quot;. Andy also composes the music to the popular &quot;Habla Blah Blah&quot; line of kids CDs.
* Mark Eliopulos played guitar in the bands Violent New Breed, HTH, Super Model, and Brave Ulysses.
* Johnny Haro joined Econoline Crush after briefly playing drums for Stabbing Westward. He eventually formed The Dreaming along with Christopher Hall.
* Stuart Zechman retired from the music industry. He moved to New York and started a family.
* David Suycott joined Machines of Loving Grace in 1995 as their new drummer. He continues to do production and remix work with various bands.
* Derrek Hawkins continued to work in the music industry, notably contributing to the song &quot;Outer Space&quot; on Ace Frehley&#x27;s 2009 solo album &quot;Anomaly&quot;.

In June 2010, a rumor was afloat that Stabbing Westward would reunite to tour and possibly work on new material; however, this proved false. In July 2012, a fan created a petition which asked frontman Christopher Hall to reconcile with his former Stabbing Westward bandmates for a reunion tour; again, the reunion never happened.

Christopher Hall, Walter Flakus, and Johnny Haro reunited at one of The Dreaming&#x27;s shows in Las Vegas on November 15, 2013. Flakus would later join The Dreaming on a permanent basis.

===Reunion and &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot; (2015–present)===
Stabbing Westward reunited in 2015 after Eliopulos joined them onstage to play a set of Stabbing Westward songs when the Dreaming came through Chicago on their &quot;Rise Again&quot; tour on June 11, 2015. The band officially reunited for two shows, which coincided with the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The first show took place in Chicago on September 22, 2016, as a part of the Cold Waves Festival, a charity festival benefiting suicide prevention causes. The lineup featured Christopher Hall, Walter Flakus, Mark Eliopulos, and Johnny Haro along with Carlton Bost (mainly known from The Dreaming, and also the reunited bands Orgy and Berlin). Jim Sellers did not take part in the reunion because of work commitments. The second show took place at Dracula&#x27;s Ball in Philadelphia on October 31, 2016, at the Trocadero Theatre.

In a January 2017 interview with audioBoom, Walter Flakus was asked if there would be more Stabbing Westward reunion shows in the future. His response was, &quot;We&#x27;ll see. I don&#x27;t have anything planned yet, but I&#x27;m always open to opportunities. It was great to get back on stage and play those songs again.&quot; Dates for a full tour began to be announced in February 2017. The band also performed at the 2017 edition of Cold Waves Festival in Chicago, Illinois.

The band released new material after their formation, such as a re-recorded version of the song &quot;Plastic Jesus&quot; (released on the &quot;Cold Waves V&quot; compilation on September 22, 2016) and an outtake from 2001 entitled &quot;Home in You&quot; (released on the &quot;Cold Waves VI&quot; compilation on September 28, 2017).

On August 17, 2018, Johnny Haro had been &quot;let go&quot; from the band, and will not be participating in any further band activities. In his Facebook post of that date, he stated that &quot;The Dreaming is done.&quot; Stabbing Westward announced Bobby Amaro, from Orgy, as a replacement for Haro. The band embarked on a U.S. tour from October to December 2018 by celebrating the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Darkest Days&quot; and performing most of the album, along with other songs. 

In June 2019, the ensemble stated via their Facebook page that they were working on a new album, with Eliopulos via his Facebook site stating that he has left the band. In early 2020, 19 years after the band&#x27;s self-titled album, the first proper release of all new material was put out by the band, titled &quot;Dead and Gone&quot;.

In May 2020, the band announced their signing to label COP International for their forthcoming studio album &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;, the band&#x27;s first full studio album since 2001. The lead single was &quot;I Am Nothing&quot; and the album was released on March 18, 2022.

==Musical style and influences==
Stabbing Westward is most commonly described as industrial rock and alternative rock, but also as industrial metal and alternative metal. The group has often been compared to Nine Inch Nails; according to Alan Escher of AllMusic, however, the band &quot;owe more to the British synth poppers Depeche Mode than anyone.&quot; Christopher Hall&#x27;s vocals have been compared to Nine Inch Nails singer Trent Reznor. Stabbing Westward&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ungod&quot; has been described by Escher as &quot;lo-fi aggro-synth assault&quot;. Stabbing Westward moved to a very guitar-driven sound on &quot;Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel&quot;. The self-titled album in 2001 shows a less heavy and more melodic sound than previous albums. Stabbing Westward&#x27;s influences include Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, Soundgarden, The Cure, Bauhaus, The Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, and Pearl Jam.

<doc id="169842" wikidata="Q3109017" url="?curid=169842" title="My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult">
<text>My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult (often shortened to Thrill Kill Kult or TKK) is an American electronic industrial rock band originally based in Chicago and founded by Groovie Mann (born Frankie Nardiello) and Buzz McCoy (born Marston Daley). They became known in the 1980s as pioneers of the industrial music genre – although by the early 1990s they had changed to a more disco-oriented sound – and as a frequent target of censorship groups, including the PMRC, which objected to the band&#x27;s humorous and satirical references to Satan, Jesus and sex in their song lyrics and stage shows.

During the early 1990s, Thrill Kill Kult had several hits on the U.S. dance club and alternative charts. They also contributed songs to several movie soundtracks and appeared in the 1994 film &quot;The Crow&quot;. The band has continued to record and tour with a rotating lineup in addition to core members Mann and McCoy. In 2017, the band celebrated its 30th anniversary.

==History==
Nardiello and Daley met in spring 1987 while touring together with the band Ministry. Soon after, Nardiello and Daley began to conceive an art film to be called &quot;My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult&quot; – a headline taken from a British tabloid Nardiello had noted a few years prior when he lived in London. The film was never completed, but the music they had recorded for its soundtrack appealed to Wax Trax! Records, who released the completed songs as a three-track EP.

Dubbing themselves Groovie Mann (Nardiello) and Buzz McCoy (Daley), they launched &quot;My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult&quot;. When the first EP sold well, a full-length album, &quot;I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits&quot;, followed in 1988. Both attracted attention from college radio stations and dancefloors, as well as religious groups who balked at the overtly occult imagery in both the music and the artwork of the releases. The group continued to stoke controversy with each subsequent release, which included a remix EP entitled &quot;Nervous Xians&quot;, and they became even more popular with release of the 12-inch single &quot;Kooler Than Jesus&quot;.

Thrill Kill Kult&#x27;s second album, &quot;Confessions of a Knife...&quot;, became one of the best-selling releases on Wax Trax!, and continued to goad parental groups with song titles like &quot;A Daisy Chain 4 Satan&quot; and &quot;Rivers of Blood, Years of Darkness&quot;.

Along with labelmates Ministry, KMFDM, and Front 242, Thrill Kill Kult helped develop the industrial music genre, but they themselves continued to evolve, creating a sound that was not easily identified or categorized. It was electronic club music with heavy beats, reminiscent of both disco and funk, yet amplified to a sometimes abrasive level. Thrill Kill Kult reflected a shift where dance records could be ominous and aggressive, and they laced their music with riffs and references that would seem more at home in a heavy metal group. One of their most distinctive characteristics is their use of spoken-word samples lifted from B-movies and old television shows.

At the onset of their career, the band&#x27;s music was known as having a &quot;satanic&quot; theme, although used in a satirical sense. The occult element of the band has moved to the background in recent years, as they have focused more on their sleazy disco sound although still laden with satire. The 1991 album &quot;Sexplosion!&quot; marked TKK&#x27;s leap toward more psychedelic house beats and their later grind house lounge sound. Later albums expanded upon these sounds and explored new directions as well, such as the 1995 Interscope release &quot;Hit &amp; Run Holiday&quot;, which combined the Kult&#x27;s signature electronic sound with a psychedelic surf rock/go-go theme reminiscent of 1960s garage rock and more modern acts like The B-52&#x27;s.

== Live shows ==
Mann and McCoy recruited Thomas Thorn (a.k.a. Buck Ryder) to play keyboards and administer samples on the band&#x27;s first tour. Brian Gillespie (a.k.a. Skip Town) from The Five and later Concussion Ensemble played a classic Slingerland Silver Sparkle drum set with sample triggers. The live act also featured female backup singers referred to as &quot;The Bomb Gang Girlz&quot;, among the first of whom were Jacky Blaque, Rhonda Bond and Kitty Killdare.

Thorn soon departed amicably from the live act to form his own band, The Electric Hellfire Club (which embraced the overtly Satanic themes that My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult had only flirted with).

My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult kept adding a revolving cast of characters to their stage show that, over the years, has included No Wave chanteuse Lydia Lunch, bassist Charles Levi, guitarist William Tucker, Chris &quot;Curse&quot; Mackey from the bands Evil Mothers and Grim Faeries, Lady Galore from Lords of Acid (who appeared in TKK as Cherrie Blue), and a great number of artists, sound technicians, musicians, and filmmakers. Creatively, however, the core of the band has always been Mann and McCoy, both on record and in the live act.

The &quot;Sexplosion!&quot; tour in 1991 achieved a particularly edgy reputation. In addition to its staging, which featured a bar and bartender onstage with the band, the show also featured a male/female duo known as Ten and Avaluscious White, who appeared onstage dressed in a number of different guises. At one point, Ten was dressed as Jesus strapped to a cross and featuring a large black dildo or alternately a large sausage between his legs, while Avaluscious White dress as a demon girl simulated oral sex on him. This created controversy and protest in a number of American locations, adding to the band&#x27;s notoriety.

In the summer of 2010, the band once again hit the road with Lords of Acid, with whom they toured on the Sextacy Ball Tour in 1995. The 2010 tour was originally titled Sextacy Ball 2, but was changed to the Sextreme Ball for legal reasons.

In 2012, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult announced their 25-year anniversary tour covering over 30 dates in the US tour featuring direct support by Left Spine Down.

== Record labels ==
Thrill Kill Kult left Wax Trax! Records after their third album, &quot;Sexplosion!&quot;, surpassed &quot;Confessions&quot; to become the biggest seller on the imprint, and major label Interscope Records took notice. TKK signed to Interscope, which re-released &quot;Sexplosion!&quot; and garnered the band their most familiar alternative radio hit, &quot;Sex on Wheelz&quot;. Their following two albums, &quot;13 Above the Night&quot; and &quot;Hit &amp; Run Holiday&quot;, were recorded for Interscope until they parted with the label in 1996. The band&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;A Crime for All Seasons&quot;, was released on Red Ant Records.

In 2001 the album &quot;The Reincarnation of Luna&quot; appeared on their own Sleazebox Records imprint, distributed by Invisible Records. The band released a companion piece to &quot;Luna&quot; called &quot;Golden Pillz: The Luna Remixes&quot;, as well as a live album called &quot;Elektrik Inferno&quot;. Rykodisc became the band&#x27;s next and most current home after putting out the rarities compilation &quot;Dirty Little Secrets&quot;. Rykodisc eventually released My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult&#x27;s entire back catalog, as well as a new &quot;best-of&quot; compilation, a non-stop megamix album featuring mash-ups of tracks from different eras called (&quot;Diamonds &amp; Daggerz&quot;), and a long-unreleased project entitled &quot;Gay, Black &amp; Married&quot;.

In 2009, the band&#x27;s own SleazeBox Records joined forces with Italy&#x27;s Rustblade label and have together released TKK&#x27;s most recent CDs &quot;Blood + Dope + Sin + Gold&quot; (2008), &quot;Death Threat&quot; (2009) and &quot;Sinister Whisperz&quot; (2011).

==Soundtracks==

Thrill Kill Kult has contributed songs to soundtracks of several movies, including &quot;Cool World&quot; (1992), &quot;Totally Fucked Up&quot; (1993), &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994), &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995), &quot;Baseketball&quot; (1998), &quot;The Amityville Legacy&quot; (2016) and &quot;Nemesis 5: The New Model&quot; (2018). They were used in dialog for &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sexy Evil Genius&quot; (2013). They also appeared in &quot;The Crow&quot; performing in the nightclub shootout scene.

<doc id="169846" wikidata="Q371535" url="?curid=169846" title="Skinny Puppy">
<text>Skinny Puppy was a Canadian electro-industrial band formed in Vancouver in 1982. The group was among the founders of the industrial rock and electro-industrial genres. Initially envisioned as an experimental side-project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of 13 studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre were the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986–1995, also died in 1995), Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie (long-time associate and producer from 1984 to 1996, and an official member from 1987 to 1988; not a relative of Kevin Ogilvie), Bill Leeb (1984–1986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Mark Walk (2003–2023), and a number of guests, including Al Jourgensen (1989), Danny Carey (2004), and many others.

After the self-release of their first cassette demo in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP &quot;Remission&quot; in 1984 to their 1992 album &quot;Last Rights&quot;, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following, fusing elements of industrial, funk,
noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing. In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, &quot;The Process&quot; (1996).

Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with producer Mark Walk, they released their ninth album, &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; (2004), which was followed by the release of the albums &quot;Mythmaker&quot; (2007) and &quot;HanDover&quot; (2011). In 2013, they released the album &quot;Weapon&quot;, which was inspired by allegations that their music had been used for torture in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

==History==
===Formation and first releases (1982–1985)===
Skinny Puppy formed in 1982 as a side project for Kevin Crompton in Vancouver, British Columbia. Crompton was dissatisfied with the pop direction of the band he was in, Images in Vogue, and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more compelling and experimental. Images in Vogue had become a popular act in Vancouver, achieving several radio hits and opening for groups such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and Roxy Music. Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue relocated to Toronto, Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project. Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join. Ogilvie had been a roommate of Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith and had met Crompton at a party in late 1982. To avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in one band, the pair created stage names, with Crompton becoming cEvin Key and Ogilvie becoming Nivek Ogre.

Using Key&#x27;s apartment as a studio, the duo began recording songs and in 1983 with the help of Images in Vogue recording engineer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie (no relation to Ogre), Skinny Puppy released the EP &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot;. This was the beginning of a long partnership between Skinny Puppy and Rave, who would serve as their producer until 1993, and again in 1995, and was occasionally listed as a member of the band in album liner notes. Though only 35 copies were ever printed, the self-released &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; drew the attention of Vancouver startup label Nettwerk, who signed the band later that year. The first live Skinny Puppy show was held at the Unovis art gallery in Vancouver in February 1984; the British group Alien Sex Fiend were among the 300 people in attendance.
Ogre has said that Skinny Puppy acted as an escape for Key, who wished to distance himself from Images in Vogue: &quot;He was looking for something to break out of [Images in Vogue], and maybe I was it&quot;. Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985. Key&#x27;s concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group&#x27;s first song ever recorded, &quot;K-9&quot;. The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored &quot;life as seen through a dog&#x27;s eyes&quot;. Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of &quot;B-grade horror movie visuals&quot;, including fake blood and props, into their live performances. Key justified these &quot;shock gore&quot; antics with the following:

What we&#x27;re presenting isn&#x27;t much different from what [the audience] is subjected to in everyday life. For example, a commercial is a very plastic view of existence and reality. When you watch a TV show and see a world with picture-perfect endings, all you have to do is switch the station and watch the news.

Having scored a record deal with Nettwerk and with interest surrounding the &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; EP growing, Skinny Puppy was invited to Vancouver&#x27;s Mushroom Studios to work on new material. It was here that the group recruited Bill Leeb to perform bass synth and backing vocals. Like Ogre and Key before him, Leeb created a stage name, Wilhelm Schroeder; &quot;my real name is Wilhelm&quot; said Leeb, &quot;Schroeder we picked out from the guy playing the piano in the Charlie Brown cartoon&quot;. Skinny Puppy released their second EP, &quot;Remission&quot; in December 1984, almost a year following &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot;.

&quot;Remission&quot; marked the first time Skinny Puppy would collaborate with artist Steven Gilmore, who created the album artwork. The EP was initially only released in vinyl, but was later given a cassette release in 1985. According to Nettwerk VP of A&amp;R and Marketing George Maniatis, &quot;Remission&quot; &quot;grabbed everybody by the you-know-whats&quot; and, for Nettwerk Records, brought with it an association with industrial dance music. The EP was supported by music videos for the songs &quot;Far Too Frail&quot; and &quot;Smothered Hope&quot;, the latter of which being the closest thing to a hit song any North American industrial act had achieved at the time.

Skinny Puppy released its first full-length album, &quot;Bites&quot;, in 1985 and was produced by Key and Dave Ogilvie. Tom Ellard of the Australian electronic act Severed Heads lent a hand to the production of &quot;Bites&quot;, acting as a producer and performing various sampling and mixing duties. Described by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as &quot;techno dance ... a la Kraftwerk&quot;, &quot;Bites&quot; yielded the underground hit &quot;Assimilate&quot;. Key and Ogre opened for Chris &amp; Cosey on their 1985 Canadian tour as Hell &#x27;O&#x27; Death Day; some of the material the duo had performed would appear on &quot;Bites&quot; as bonus tracks. One of these bonus tracks, a song called &quot;The Centre Bullet&quot;, featured lyrics by Legendary Pink Dots founder Edward Ka-Spel.

While Skinny Puppy had become well received by underground audiences in most major urban areas, due in part to their anti-consumerist themes and Cure-like aesthetics, not everyone was friendly to the group. Key described Skinny Puppy as the antithesis of &quot;the Bruce Springsteen mentality of music&quot;, rejecting &quot;Top 40 conformity&quot;. Toronto-based music journalist and DJ Greg Clow recalled Michael Williams, who was a VJ for Muchmusic, introducing him to Skinny Puppy, describing them as &quot;Canada&#x27;s answer to Depeche Mode.

===Dwayne Goettel and stylistic transition (1986–1987)===
In 1986, Nettwerk made a distribution deal with Capitol Records, allowing Skinny Puppy and others in Nettwerk&#x27;s roster to expand their respective audiences. Capitol manager Stephen Powers stated that signing groups such as Skinny Puppy gave the company &quot;a real credibility&quot; with the alternative and college music scenes. Skinny Puppy also signed to Play It Again Sam, allowing the group&#x27;s music to expand into Europe. It was this expansion into the European market that would help to make Skinny Puppy a &quot;cash cow&quot; for Nettwerk in the early years. In a 2007 interview with CraveOnline, Ogre commented on Skinny Puppy&#x27;s time with Capitol, saying:
We&#x27;re so lucky to have gotten here, and if we look back on the fact that we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being distributed and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn&#x27;t really happen in a lot of cases.

Bill Leeb left Skinny Puppy in 1986 to pursue his own musical project, Front Line Assembly. Leeb gave his reasons for leaving the group stating that his bandmates expressed different ideas from his own and that he had been interested in singing. Leeb&#x27;s replacement would be quiet Alberta native Dwayne Goettel. A classically trained musician, Goettel had been in a duo named Water with vocalist Sandy Weir and had worked with the synthpop band Psyche, among others.

Skinny Puppy&#x27;s production values improved with the addition of Goettel, with Key remarking that &quot;Dwayne brought us a whole new sense and aesthetic that we didn&#x27;t have. Up to that point, we were really punk rock in our approach&quot;. Key continued on that &quot;he [Goettel] had an incredible knowledge of equipment and at a very early stage was really the master of sampling, which had really just begun&quot;. Goettel&#x27;s contributions to Skinny Puppy&#x27;s second full-length effort, 1986&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, helped to propel the band towards the style of their &quot;chaotic future masterworks&quot;. To promote the album, the band made an appearance on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Brave New Waves&quot; program in September 1986, and released their first single, &quot;Dig It&quot;. A music video for &quot;Dig It&quot; was produced and received extensive airplay on MTV.

Further promotion for the album came from a world tour with the band Severed Heads. The tour proved to be a vital learning experience for the group, having encounters with, according to Key, &quot;tour managers and agents that didn&#x27;t pay us&quot;. In 1987, the song &quot;Stairs and Flowers&quot; was released as a single, as was a new song titled &quot;Chainsaw&quot;. The group attracted the attention of the Parent Music Resource Center (PMRC), which named &quot;Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse&quot; one of several albums believed to be &quot;violent, sexually explicit, or condoning substance abuse&quot;. The album was named by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine as one of the best releases of the year.

Later in 1987 came Skinny Puppy&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot;. Described as &quot;a turning point, where experimentation is just beginning to gel with innovation&quot;, the album marks the point where the group began to explore more political themes, delving into topics such as the AIDS epidemic and the Vietnam War. A song from the album, &quot;Addiction&quot; was released as a single. The group later went on tour, with a performance at Toronto&#x27;s Concert Hall being released on VHS in 1989 and CD in 1991 as &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Dead Yet?&quot;. Also released in 1987 was &quot;Bites and Remission&quot; (through Capitol Records) and &quot;Remission &amp; Bites&quot; (European release, through Pay It Again Sam), both compilations of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s first two Nettwerk releases.

===Subsequent success (1988–1989)===
Skinny Puppy&#x27;s live performances had become increasingly elaborate, with Ogre interacting with an onstage crucifix and other &quot;crudely constructed&quot; stage props. Craig MacInnis of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described their new stage show as &quot;neo-dadaist shock theatre&quot;, while Tom Lanham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; referred to it as &quot;grotesque&quot;. The band continued to tour in 1988 with the European &quot;Head Trauma&quot; tour, supported by Edward Ka-Spel. Following the tour, the group returned to the studio to record what Ogre described would be the band&#x27;s most critical statement regarding animal testing.

Skinny Puppy released their fourth album, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, in 1988; the album&#x27;s name is a pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the &quot;666 sect&quot;). The group&#x27;s primary aim with the album was to bring attention to the topic of vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album&#x27;s subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track &quot;Dogshit&quot; was released as a single in 1988 under the name &quot;Censor&quot;; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single &quot;Testure&quot;, which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No. 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. 

According to Ogre, &quot;Testure&quot; was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their &quot;anti-vivisectionist&quot; message. &quot;It&#x27;s the only song I think they will be able to play on the radio&quot;, he said. &quot;I hope they do play it because it&#x27;s the only way we can go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message&quot;. &quot;Testure&quot; also featured several well-chosen samples from the film &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; one of the best albums of 1988.

Skinny Puppy toured in support of the album, featuring an early incarnation of the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails as their opening act. The concept for the live show revolved around a vivisectionist (played by Ogre) who is eventually transformed into a tortured animal; the idea was to portray the &quot;inner workings of the mind under the strain of vivisection&quot;. The stage show included the mock vivisection of a stuffed dog the band had named Chud. Following a show in Cincinnati, Ohio, Key, Ogre, and tour manager Dan McGee were arrested for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; when an audience member, believing the stuffed animal Ogre was &quot;vivisecting&quot; to be a real dog, called the police. Two plainclothes officers entered the group&#x27;s dressing room demanding they inspect the prop. Following a heated argument, the trio spent the night in jail, but were released the following day after paying a $200 fine.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band members began working on various side projects. Key and Goettel were involved with The Tear Garden (a collaboration with The Legendary Pink Dots) and Doubting Thomas (an outlet for their non-Skinny Puppy instrumentals). The band Hilt, a collaboration between Key and Goettel, and Al Nelson, also started when Nettwerk challenged the group to produce an album for as little money as possible. Ogre struck up a friendship with Ministry&#x27;s Al Jourgensen, having first worked together during the recording of the PTP song &quot;Show Me Your Spine&quot; (featured in the 1987 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;).

For Skinny Puppy&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Rabies&quot;, released in 1989, Jourgensen joined Rave as producer. The album, featuring Jourgensen&#x27;s electric guitar work and backing vocals, drew mixed reception from fans. Despite these reactions, the album was a commercial success, selling 150,000 copies and receiving extensive airplay on college radio. The single &quot;Worlock&quot; – which featured samples of Charles Manson singing parts of the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; from The Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, accompanied by a fragmented portion of the songs guitar introduction – helped to bring the band &quot;massive popularity&quot;. A video produced for the song, featuring spliced-together footage from dozens of horror films and a statement denouncing censorship of the genre by the MPAA, was circulated widely as a promotional and bootleg item. The song &quot;Tin Omen&quot; was also released as a single and &quot;Hexonxonx&quot; received some airplay on alternative radio. In spite of the album&#x27;s initial mixed reception, Brad Filicky in a 2003 issue of &quot;CMJ&quot; magazine named &quot;Rabies&quot; as a classic album, calling it &quot;a masterpiece of the industrial genre&quot;.

This period marked the beginning of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of &quot;Rabies&quot;, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; (1989); Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also begun working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks. Key was later quoted saying of Ogre&#x27;s involvement with Ministry and, later on, Martin Atkins&#x27; Pigface that he sometimes felt &quot;like a wife that&#x27;s been cheated on&quot;.

===&quot;Too Dark Park&quot; (1990–1991)===
Following the production of &quot;Rabies&quot;, a divide grew between the group members, with Key and Goettel often siding against Ogre, feeling he was more interested in solo work. The group were ultimately disappointed with the outcome of &quot;Rabies&quot;, with Goettel saying that the completed product was &quot;less within the Skinny Puppy vision&quot;, and Key being displeased with Jourgensen&#x27;s involvement. Ogre also expressed his disapproval for the album, claiming that he had &quot;flopped&quot;. &quot;The work and artistic environment really weren&#x27;t there at all either. It was completely negative&quot;.

Key and Goettel completed work on some of their side projects such as Hilt, releasing their first effort, &quot;Call the Ambulance (Before I Hurt Myself)&quot;, which was produced by Rave. Key also reunited with Bill Leeb to form the project known as Cyberaktif; Goettel acted as an assistant producer and provided some instrumentation. Jourgensen offered Ogre the chance to tour with the Revolting Cocks, having provided vocals on their previous tour. Ogre refused the offer, citing some occurrences during his time with Ministry which led him to question his friendship with Jourgensen.

The group, having finished work on their various side projects, returned to the studio and released their sixth studio album, &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;, in 1990. Goettel said in a radio interview that the major intentions behind the album were to reevaluate what Skinny Puppy was and create a new style of music to mark the beginning of a new decade. This reevaluation included hiring Jim Cummins (I, Braineater) to design the cover artwork, feeling that their longtime designer Steven Gilmore had lost his creative spark.

Described as &quot;forceful and consistently abrasive&quot;, &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; was what Key referred to as the true successor to &quot;the last pure&quot; Skinny Puppy album, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;. Critics such as Staci Bonner of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine applauded the use of sampling and stated that the album was a &quot;return to the bloodbath&quot; for the group. The album yielded the singles &quot;Tormentor&quot; and &quot;Spasmolytic&quot;, the latter of which spawned a music video directed by Jim Van Bebber. &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Spasmolytic&quot; a &quot;delicious mind-altering affair&quot;, a sentiment shared by Wil Lewellyn of Treblezine who included the song in a list of the best underground songs of the 1990s.

Environmental degradation was a major theme on both the album and the North American &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour. For the tour, Key took on the role of drummer, leaving Goettel as lead keyboardist. Key told &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that &quot;we could very well have a backing tape and stand behind synths playing two notes on the keyboard, but we&#x27;ve decided to physically strain ourselves and learn additional parts along with what we&#x27;ve already written&quot;. Onstage theatrics included a segment with Ogre performing on stucco stilts and pneumatic crutches, Ogre being hoisted from the stage by cables, and a backing film featuring scenes of graphic violence, most notably sequences from the Japanese film series &quot;Guinea Pig&quot;. Ogre later gave insight on the backing film&#x27;s conception, saying:
 We did an experiment ... We&#x27;ve always been accused of celebrating violence for idiotic reasons. [So] we used some images in our show from a film called Guinea Pig. They&#x27;re these incredibly realistic, but simulated, Japanese snuff films. We inserted them into this roller-coaster ride of violent images and people were quite disgusted. People were vomiting in front of the stage. People came up to me after the show, saying I was the most disgusting human being-until they found out what it was all about. The whole reason we did that was to see if there was a difference. Will people react differently to something that&#x27;s real as opposed to something they know is staged? They will. There&#x27;s a whole different set of emotions people go through. It doesn&#x27;t look like it looks on TV. It&#x27;s quite sickening.

Ogre, who considered the tour to be a high point in his career, compared the band&#x27;s performances to something like intense car races. &quot;People go there expecting an accident to happen ... I was really running off that car-crash energy&quot;.

Following the tour, Ogre became involved with Martin Atkins&#x27; project Pigface in 1991, for a short time becoming the group&#x27;s lead vocalist. Pigface included talent from several other industrial groups such as William Rieflin of Ministry and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who helped record the song &quot;Suck&quot;. Ogre and Reznor performed the song together in the live album &quot;Welcome to Mexico... Asshole&quot;. Also on the album was a cover of the song &quot;T.F.W.O.&quot; from &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;, led by Ogre.

In 2003, Alexander Chow of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine named &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; an essential industrial album, stating that &quot;schizophrenic beats, manic-depressive mumblings, and just the right dose of fist-raising choruses&quot; made for a dance floor favorite.

===&quot;Last Rights&quot; (1992)===
Following &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;, Skinny Puppy was commissioned by the dance group La La La Human Steps to compose several songs for their 1991 production &quot;Infante C&#x27;est Destroy&quot;, a duty shared alongside the likes of Einstürzende Neubauten. During this time Ogre made a concerted effort to rid his drug addictions. In an interview with CITR-FM, Ogre discussed his ordeals with hepatitis A and subsequent hospilization; he also thanked Pigface for looking after him during his &quot;hour of need&quot;.

Skinny Puppy released their seventh studio album, &quot;Last Rights&quot;, in 1992. It was the last album the band released under Nettwerk/Capitol. Relationships between the band members during the album&#x27;s production were &quot;tense and unhealthy&quot;, with Ogre, under the supervision of Rave, coming into the studio at night to perform vocals for the music Key and Goettel composed earlier in the day. Ogre said that the production of &quot;Last Rights&quot; acted as a form of therapy which he used to help him come to terms with his addictions. &quot;It&#x27;s painful for me to be reminded of certain things, but for me to say it never happened is wrong. I&#x27;ll be glad to put it behind me, but I had to do this&quot;.

Described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as a &quot;nonstop stretch of horrific soundscapes&quot;, &quot;Last Rights&quot; became the first Skinny Puppy record to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 193. The album remained on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Heatseekers album chart for several weeks, peaking at No. 10. The track &quot;Inquisition&quot; was released as a single and included several alternative cuts of the song, as well as the b-side &quot;LaHuman8&quot; (one of the tracks produced for La La La Human Steps). A second single, &quot;Love in Vein&quot;, was never released, although an unfinished remix intended for it later appeared on &quot;&quot; in 1996. A music video was created for the song &quot;Killing Game&quot; which featured a student dance troupe performing in &quot;high-contrast black and white&quot;.

A track titled &quot;Left Handshake&quot; was excluded from &quot;Last Rights&quot;, leaving a blank track 10 on some copies of the album. Clearance for a lengthy vocal sample from Timothy Leary&#x27;s &quot;Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out&quot;, was approved by Leary, but denied by the copyright holder, Henry G. Saperstein. Commenting on the ordeal, Key said, &quot;We tried to convince him, but he [Saperstein] said, &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t matter what Leary said, he doesn&#x27;t own his own work&#x27;&quot;. The song, in which Ogre provides commentary to Leary&#x27;s instructions for avoiding a &quot;bad trip&quot;, was eventually released on the initial European edition of &quot;Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 &amp; 4&quot; in 1996, and on a limited edition single called &quot;Track 10&quot; sold at the Skinny Puppy reunion concert in 2000 at Dresden.

The stage show for the &quot;Last Rights&quot; tour in North America, much like the album itself, was built around a detailed narrative inspired by Ogre&#x27;s past ordeals with drug abuse. The show involved Ogre interacting with a backing film by way of a virtual reality machine, a tree made of human heads and fetuses, and numerous other props and costumes. For this tour, Key once more focused exclusively on live drumming, leaving Goettel on keyboard duty. One incident that occurred at a show in Boston involved several concert goers climbing on stage and grabbing at Ogre&#x27;s various masks and props, several of which were stolen. The band&#x27;s manager, Tim Gore, pursued the thieves but was punched by a security guard. Following the punch, Gore began having issues breathing and was taken to a hospital; the guard was fired as a result of the incident.

===&quot;The Process&quot;, Goettel&#x27;s death and breakup (1993–1999)===
In 1993, Skinny Puppy contributed the song &quot;Ode to Groovy&quot; to the compilation album &quot;In Defense of Animals&quot;, released through Restless Records. The album was named after the animal rights group of the same name. Though the track is credited to Skinny Puppy, Ogre and Rave were the only people to work on it.

Ogre, Key and Goettel, landed a three-album deal with American Recordings, and moved to Malibu to record &quot;The Process&quot;, a concept album inspired by 1960s cult The Process Church of The Final Judgment, with Roli Mosimann producing. The recording sessions were beset by everything from fires and floods, to the Northridge earthquake. Mosimann was eventually replaced with Martin Atkins. Atkins&#x27; presence exacerbated the rift that was forming between Ogre and the rest of the band. The band&#x27;s bickering and excessive drug use made the recording process so long and costly, that American reduced Skinny Puppy&#x27;s contract to one album. In 1994, Key and Goettel returned to Vancouver with the master tapes, but Ogre remained in Los Angeles and quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995. Goettel was found dead of a heroin overdose in his parents&#x27; home two months later.

&quot;The Process&quot; was eventually completed with Rave and released in 1996. It was dedicated to the memory of Goettel. It was an overall stylistic departure from their previous albums, prominently featuring untreated vocals, guitar, and more accessible song structures. The liner notes that accompanied the CD included thank-yous to &quot;Electronic Music Lovers&quot; and &quot;Puppy People&quot;, followed by the words &quot;The End&quot; in bold type. The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 102 and reached the No. 1 spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers album chart.

During the &quot;Process&quot; era, a loose-knit art/philosophy collective also known as The Process was formed, with early contributions from Ogre and Genesis P-Orridge, among others. P-Orridge and Chris Carter jammed with Skinny Puppy during this period, a recording of which was eventually released as &quot;Puppy Gristle&quot; on a limited basis in 2002. The creation of the Download project, which Key and Goettel formed with Mark Spybey and Phil Western, also occurred at this time. Download explored everything from electronic improvisation with spoken vocals to techno, and toured in 1996.

Earlier, in 1993, Goettel and Western had issued a breakbeat hardcore single (under the name aDuck) on their own label, Subconscious Records. After Goettel&#x27;s death, Subconscious evolved into a recording studio and record label imprint that Key used to release a number of his own and Skinny Puppy&#x27;s recordings. Key also continued to work with The Tear Garden, produced industrial/trance music with Western in the side project platEAU, and released his first solo album in 1998.

Ogre had toured extensively with Martin Atkins&#x27; industrial supergroup Pigface since 1991, and toured with them again after leaving Skinny Puppy. He recorded material for his side project WELT. with Ruby&#x27;s Mark Walk before quitting Skinny Puppy, but due to legal issues with American Recordings, this would not see release until 2001 under the new name, ohGr. In the meantime, he toured with KMFDM, and released an album with Martin Atkins under the name Rx (also known as Ritalin). The ohGr and Rx releases included some of Ogre&#x27;s most positive and forward-thinking songwriting to date. Several collections were released while Skinny Puppy was dormant, including &quot;&quot; in 1996, and &quot;The Singles Collect&quot; and &quot;B-Sides Collect&quot; in 1999. Nettwerk commissioned a remix album in 1998; titled &quot;remix dystemper&quot;, it featured various Skinny Puppy tracks re-worked by artists including Autechre, Deftones, and Guru. Ogre and Walk also took part, contributing a remix of &quot;Dig It&quot; and an updated version of &quot;Remission&quot;″s &quot;Smothered Hope&quot; with new vocals by Ogre.

In 1999, &quot;Draining Faces&quot; (1987) appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;.

===Reunion, &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; and &quot;Mythmaker&quot; (2000–2008)===
In August 2000, Ogre and Key reunited and performed live as Skinny Puppy for the first time since 1992, at Doomsday Festival. The show was meant to be a continuation of the &quot;Last Rights&quot; tour, with the stage design taking influence from those performances. Rather than find a replacement for Goettel, the band simply left the keyboard station on stage empty. The performance was filmed and recorded, and a live album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2001; a DVD release was planned but canceled by Nettwerk. Live clips of &quot;Testure&quot; and &quot;Worlock&quot; as well as a behind the scenes interview with the band were broadcast on &quot;Crazy Clip TV&quot; in Germany and &quot;Worlock&quot; was included on a VCD compilation by German magazine &quot;Sonic Seducer&quot; in 2002.

Key joined ohGr on drums for its 2001 tour, while Ogre appeared on the track &quot;Frozen Sky&quot; on Key&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;The Ghost of Each Room&quot;. When asked by &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine about the future of Skinny Puppy, Key responded:

 Our goals for the future are to combine everything, take the best of what we can do with Ogre, and the best of what we have from our past, as well as the future stuff that we can do, and put it into one touring situation which I&#x27;m sure will stroll back into bloodville.The first new Skinny Puppy track in several years, &quot;Optimissed&quot;, appeared on the &quot;Underworld&quot; soundtrack in 2003.

Ogre, Key, Mark Walk and various guests, including Danny Carey of Tool and Wayne Static of Static-X, recorded the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot;, released in 2004 on Synthetic Symphony, a sub-label of SPV. The album, described by Key as being based in &quot;pseudopop&quot;, received generally favorable reviews from critics and landed on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. A music video was made for the song &quot;Pro-Test&quot; which featured a style unlike many of the group&#x27;s previous work, so much so that some were unsure if it was an official video.

Since there was no tour support for &quot;The Process&quot;, 2004 marked the formal return of Skinny Puppy, with a full North America and Europe tour; selling out larger than usual venues. Shows in Toronto and Montreal were filmed for the live DVD &quot;Greater Wrong of the Right Live&quot;, which was released in September 2005. The DVD included &quot;Information Warfare&quot;, a documentary made by Morrison about the U.S.-led wars in Iraq. The anti-Bush administration stance taken by the band at their live shows drew the ire of PABAAH (Patriotic Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood), which attempted a boycott of college radio stations that played Skinny Puppy.

Skinny Puppy toured Europe again in 2005, and returned to the studio to complete their next album, &quot;Mythmaker&quot;, which was released in January 2007. The album reached No. 4 on the Independent Albums Chart, No. 5 on the Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, and No. 17 on the Heatseekers Chart, but barely broke the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s 2007 North American and European tour, titled &quot;Mythrus&quot;, began in May 2007. While some fans longed for the sounds of their earlier days, Ogre, speaking with Electronic Musician, stated the band&#x27;s intention was to move forward rather than dwell in the past. &quot;Some people think that the stuff we do now is a pale imitation of the past. All of the older stuff had a time and place, and we decided to move forward to where we are now&quot;.

===&quot;In Solvent See&quot; tour and &quot;HanDover&quot; (2009–2012)===
According to a news posting on the official Skinny Puppy website, the band&#x27;s next studio album was originally slated for release in October 2009, but the release of this album was delayed due to insolvency issues with the SPV label (thus leading to Ogre naming the 2009 tour the &quot;In Solvent See&quot; tour). These issues were not expected to be resolved until the end of 2009. However, the &quot;In Solvent See&quot; Tour took place as planned, and began on 30 October.

In October 2010, there were reports that the new Skinny Puppy album would be released in February 2011. In May 2011, Skinny Puppy announced that they finished recording a new album titled &quot;HanDover&quot;, and that they were soliciting it to other record labels for a September 2011 release date. On 27 August 2011, HanDover was officially confirmed as having a 25 October 2011, release in the United States and a 28 October 2011, release in Europe. Steven R. Gilmore created the artwork for the album once again. The album landed on a number of &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including a spot at No. 168 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 9 on the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

Skinny Puppy were scheduled to perform at numerous European festivals in the summer of 2010, including the Amphi Festival in Germany, the 2010 Waregem Gothic Festival in Belgium, and the Recession Festival in Denmark. A live album, titled &quot;Bootlegged, Broke and in Solvent Seas&quot; and recorded on the band&#x27;s 2010 European tour, was released on 12 June 2012.

===&quot;Weapon&quot;, subsequent tours, and Final Tour (2013–2023)===

Skinny Puppy announced that a new album, entitled &quot;Weapon&quot;, would be released on 28 May 2013. The album was inspired by news brought to the band by a former guard at Guantanamo Bay that their music had been used to torture inmates. Inspiration also came from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and from Ogre&#x27;s personal views on the human species; in an interview with &quot;Vice&quot;, Ogre stated that he &quot;view[s] the human being primarily as a weapon, and a lot of the things that we&#x27;ve created have had disastrous effects on us as a species&quot;. The album was released to generally favorable reviews from critics, several noting the 1980s-esque musical style, and included a re-hashed version of the &quot;Remission&quot;-era track &quot;Solvent&quot;.

Key told the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; that the band had been dissatisfied with &quot;HanDover&quot;″s production schedule, noting that it had taken them several years to produce the album. For &quot;Weapon&quot;, they made a return to the fast-paced, one-song-a-day style of their early years. The decision to remake the song &quot;Solvent&quot; helped to set the album&#x27;s quickened pace; Key said that the music they were making for the album wouldn&#x27;t sound correct &quot;If it didn&#x27;t sound like something we had just made quickly, like in the old days&quot;.

The band released a music video for the song &quot;Illisit&quot; and in October 2013, announced their &quot;Live Shapes for Arms&quot; Tour, a North American tour starting in January 2014 at The Observatory in Santa Ana, CA. In early 2014, Ogre and Key sent an invoice of $666,000 to the US government for the use of their music at Guantanamo Bay, bringing the issue to the attention of mainstream media outlets. Later in 2014, the &quot;Alliance of Sound&quot; tour was announced, with performances by Skinny Puppy, VNV Nation, Haujobb, and Youth Code. However, in early November, Front Line Assembly replaced VNV Nation and the tour was renamed &quot;Eye vs. Spy&quot;, which was a 17-city North American tour between 28 November to 20 December 2014.

In June 2015, Skinny Puppy performed at the Amnesia Rockfest in Montebello, Canada, alongside acts such as Ministry and The Dillinger Escape Plan. Following two successful tours with &quot;Weapon&quot;, the band yet again embarked with Youth Code, this time to play shows across North America in 2015 and across Europe in 2017 under the Down the SocioPath tour, which dropped all &quot;Weapon&quot; tracks and instead introduced many songs from the band&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;The Process&quot;, which had not been accompanied by any live performances due to the death of Goettel in 1995. Unlike the previous tours for &quot;Weapon&quot;, Down the SocioPath scaled back the theatrics and introduced Matthew Setzer as a live guitarist. Ogre began these concerts in a white hooded robe which was removed to reveal a suit into which a stagehand inserted oversized needles. The &quot;Down the Sociopath Too Euro 2017&quot; leg lasted from 30 May to 16 June 2017. The tour included stops at the Download Festival in France, Primavera Sound, and Wave-Gotik-Treffen.

In February 2023, the &quot;Skinny Puppy: Final Tour&quot; was announced. The tour coincided with the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The initial leg ran from April 5th to May 9th and included a stop at Sick New World on May 13th. In July 2023, a second leg of The Final Tour was announced, lasting from November 8th to December 5th, after which the group disbanded.

==Style==
===Sound===
Inspired by the music of Suicide, SPK, Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Cabaret Voltaire, Chrome, Throbbing Gristle, Bauhaus, Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode, Fad Gadget, Nocturnal Emissions, Portion Control, and The Legendary Pink Dots, music which had been accessible to the band primarily via tape exchange, Skinny Puppy experimented with analog and digital recording techniques, composing multi-layered music with synthesizers, drum machines, acoustic percussion, tape loops, samplers, and conventional rock music instruments to create what they called &quot;audio sculpture&quot;. Their extensive use of sampling from horror films and radio broadcasts served to &quot;clarify or obscure&quot; song meanings, and they applied liberal amounts of distortion and other effects to Ogre&#x27;s vocals, which are often delivered as a stream of consciousness. Lyrics commonly reference social and political subjects including animal rights, environmental degradation, drug addiction, suicide, war, privacy, and self-determination. They have also used their music to draw attention to events such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the AIDS epidemic, and the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Skinny Puppy&#x27;s often informal, improvisational approach to musical composition is indicated by use of the term &quot;brap&quot;, coined by them and defined as a verb meaning &quot;to get together, hook up electronic instruments, get high, and record&quot;.

Initially a dark synth-pop group, Skinny Puppy took on a more industrial sound following the inclusion of Dwayne Goettel in 1986, and later came to be recognized as pioneers of the electro-industrial genre. Their music has been described as encompassing a range styles including ambient music, avant-funk, noise rock and industrial metal. The music that followed Goettel&#x27;s death has been likened to genres such as glitch and intelligent dance music. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described Skinny Puppy&#x27;s early work as &quot;dark electro-pop&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Bill Coleman thought of them as a &quot;moody techno-outfit&quot; with an &quot;aggravating&quot; musical delivery. &quot;People&quot; magazine called Ogre&#x27;s vocals &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, and likened the group&#x27;s use of sampling to noises heard on &quot;a TV set in an adjoining hotel room&quot;. AllMusic referred to Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music as &quot;primal&quot; and &quot;Kraftwerk gone netherworld&quot;, going on to say that unlike the bands that followed in their wake, &quot;Ogre and Key knew how to craft tunes and marry them to the most ingenious of sound patterns&quot;. Ogre told the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; in 1986 that &quot;in some sense our music, or the feeling expressed by our music, is felt by a lot more people&quot; than had been anticipated.

Ogre said in an interview with &quot;Auxiliary Magazine&quot; in June 2013, &quot;there is a very military side to Industrial music, and we are far more in the psychedelic side.&quot;

===Music videos===
Due to their the majority of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s videos received limited commercial airplay, or were outright banned from broadcast. The music video for &quot;Stairs and Flowers&quot; was banned by the Canadian Censorship Bureau because of scenes depicting &quot;an excrement-covered woman being beaten by soldiers&quot;; the woman in question was Ogre soaked in mud. The letterbox effect used in the video for &quot;Dig It&quot;, which portrayed stock market footage, was accused by both the bureau and MuchMusic to instead be showing pornography. Also banned was the video for &quot;Testure&quot;, an action resulting from a viewer poll held by CityTV, as was the video for the song &quot;Worlock&quot;, which was banned from MTV. Ogre, a self-described horror fan, defended the &quot;Worlock&quot; video by saying &quot;I knew there was no way they&#x27;d play &#x27;Worlock&#x27; there [the United States]. But I went out to make that video so no one would play it!&quot;; he affirmed that the video was meant to draw attention to censorship in horror films. Some of the band&#x27;s videos have received airplay, such as those for the promotional songs &quot;Killing Game&quot; and &quot;Pro-test&quot;; &quot;Dig It&quot; was also regularly played on MTV. A 30-second television promo was produced for the band by Capitol Records in 1987, featuring a mix of scenes from the &quot;Stairs and Flowers&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; videos.

In a 1990 radio interview, Goettel explained the group&#x27;s outlook on music videos, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s great to do videos when you have the money to do them, but for Skinny Puppy&#x27;s part it&#x27;s less of a promotional tool&quot;. He said that touring and word of mouth were their preferred avenues of promotion. &quot;When a video gets made its not like &#x27;OK we&#x27;re going to spend $50,000 and it&#x27;s going to sell this many more records&#x27;... it doesn&#x27;t sell any more records&quot;.

===Live performances===
Skinny Puppy was noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music. Ogre has been critical of the band&#x27;s early performances, telling &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 1992 that &quot;I would do things on stage that would blow – they just wouldn&#x27;t work&quot;. Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy&#x27;s performances, Ogre remarked that &quot;our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine&quot;. He explained to the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 1988 that he wanted his act to have &quot;that grey area where anything could happen – where I can cut my head off by accident and people will go, &#x27;wow, that&#x27;s great&#x27;&quot;.

On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman&#x27;s noose, use of an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George W. Bush. Following the 2004 United States presidential election, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was &quot;decapitated&quot; by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to &quot;not insult the president&quot; while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a &quot;rough guideline&quot; during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are conceived spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre&#x27;s demeanor on stage could &quot;range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho&quot;. Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like &quot;dating hydrogen peroxide&quot;, referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring.

Though Ogre and Key were the only constant members of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s live act since Goettel&#x27;s death, the pair hired various other musicians to assist them onstage. They included drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer.

==Influence and legacy==
Despite little mainstream airplay, several Skinny Puppy releases have charted in North America and Europe, and their influence on industrial and electronic music is considerable. Widely considered originators of a unique sound and live performance style, Skinny Puppy were also known as pioneers of the industrial rock and electro-industrial genres. They were one of the earliest groups to help popularize industrial music, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; recognized Ogre as the &quot;first industrial rock star&quot;. Their gloomy and androgynous aesthetic helped attract the attention of the goth scene, from which they were able to draw a larger female audience than any previous industrial group. By the end of the 90s, they had sold some two million records for Nettwerk worldwide, and two of their releases, &quot;Remission&quot; and &quot;Bites&quot;, were certified gold in Canada.

Their music has spawned &quot;a litter of like-minded bands&quot;, including industrial rock project Nine Inch Nails, who opened for Skinny Puppy for a short time on their 1988 &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; tour. Trent Reznor also acknowledged that Skinny Puppy&#x27;s &quot;Dig It&quot; inspired the very first Nine Inch Nails track written, &quot;Down in It&quot;. Canadian synth-pop artist Grimes includes Skinny Puppy as an influence on her music, having grown up in Vancouver&#x27;s industrial music scene. Sara Taylor of the EBM group Youth Code has said that the song &quot;Worlock&quot; was &quot;one of the most influential songs&quot; she had ever heard. Other artists impacted by Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music include Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington, Moby, Jonathan Davis, Daron Malakian, 3Teeth, Foals vocalist Yannis Philippakis, Al Jourgensen, Chris Vrenna, John Grant, Mortiis, Blush Response, Celldweller, Finite Automata, Shooter Jennings, Death Grips vocalist MC Ride, X Marks the Pedwalk, Wumpscut, Haujobb, Orgy, Filter, Front Line Assembly, Orphx, Crystal Castles, AFI side project Blaqk Audio, and Mayhem vocalist Attila Csihar.

The band inspired a tribute album, &quot;Hymns of the Worlock: A Tribute to Skinny Puppy&quot; published by Cleopatra Records, which features groups such as Crocodile Shop and The Electric Hellfire Club. Skinny Puppy&#x27;s remix album &quot;Remix dystemper&quot; includes contributions from a wide array of musicians such as electronic music DJ Josh Wink, Guru, KMFDM, Deftones, and former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. Vrenna&#x27;s solo project, Tweaker, opened for Skinny Puppy during their 2004 North American tour. Danny Carey from Tool and Wayne Static of Static-X provided drums and backup vocals, respectively, for the song &quot;Use Less&quot; from &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot;.

Ogre worked with KMFDM on several occasions, touring with them in 1997 and providing vocals on the song &quot;Torture&quot; from their album &quot;Symbols&quot; (the song also features production from Dave Ogilvie) as well as for the songs &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; and &quot;Full Worm Garden&quot; from 1999&#x27;s &quot;Adios&quot;. Skinny Puppy also provided a remix for the Mötley Crüe song &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Holiday&quot;; Nikki Sixx reported that the band &quot;just dumped the whole song in the computer and went off&quot;.

Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music has been included in the soundtracks of films such as &quot;Bad Influence&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, and &quot;Saw II&quot;, among others. The group was given a brief role as the &quot;gang of goons&quot; in the 1995 dark comedy film &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;. The 1996 Video Game &quot;Descent II&quot; included original music from Ogre and Mark Walk, while the 2014 PlayStation exclusive &quot;LittleBigPlanet 3&quot; featured the song &quot;Rodent&quot; from the album &quot;Rabies&quot;.

Alternative Press included Skinny Puppy in their 1996 list of &quot;100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.&quot;

While discussing the possibility of Nine Inch Nails being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Richard Patrick of the band Filter remarked &quot;what about Skinny Puppy?&quot;, going on to say that while Nine Inch Nails is the more famous of the two, Skinny Puppy were one of the first groups to craft &quot;scary and mean&quot; industrial music.

==Side-projects==

Key and Ogre are active in a number of other projects besides Skinny Puppy. Key has released several solo albums including &quot;Music for Cats&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Each Room&quot; in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Doubting Thomas, a project led by Key and the late Dwayne Goettel, was an outlet for mostly instrumental compositions (save for several film and television samples). The projects only releases were &quot;Father Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; in 1990 and &quot;The Infidel&quot; in 1991, both released through Wax Trax! Records. Download was founded by Key and Goettel in 1995 and included the assistance of frequent Skinny Puppy contributors Ken Marshall and Anthony Valcic. The group has released a number of records since its formation and notably provided the soundtrack album &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Family&quot; in 1997 for the film &quot;The Manson Family&quot;, directed by Jim Van Bebber; the film was released six years after the album. Bebber had approached Key to produce the soundtrack, having previously directed several Skinny Puppy videos as well as the short horror film &quot;Chunk Blower&quot;, which starred Goettel and Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly. Other notable projects include The Tear Garden with Edward Ka-Spel for The Legendary Pink Dots, platEAU with Phil Western, and Cyberaktif with Goettel and Leeb. Key also works as Scaremeister, his film scoring alter ego, having previously contributed to John Debney&#x27;s score for &quot;End of Days&quot;. Scaremeister composed the album &quot;31 Spirits&quot;, a collection of short musical pieces which have been used in the trailers of numerous films such as &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Eli&quot;.

Ogre&#x27;s main project outside Skinny Puppy is ohGr, which has released five albums, &quot;Welt&quot; (2001), &quot;SunnyPsyOp&quot; (2003), &quot;Devils in my Details&quot; (2008), &quot;UnDeveloped&quot; (2011), and &quot;TrickS&quot; (2018). In the mid-nineties, Ogre and producer Martin Atkins created the project known as Rx (formerly known as Ritalin). Rx released only one album, &quot;Bedside Toxicology&quot;, in 1998. He also toured extensively with Pigface (1991–1995) and Ministry (1987–1990)&lt;ref name=&quot;prongs/al/ogre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on a number of Pigface and Ministry-related recordings.

==Guantanamo Bay torture allegations==


Skinny Puppy accused the US military of using their music to torture inmates at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, without the band&#x27;s knowledge or permission. In response, the band sent an &quot;invoice&quot; to the Pentagon.

<text>The Grisons (; ) or Graubünden (), more formally the Canton of the Grisons or the Canton of Graubünden, is one of the twenty-six cantons of Switzerland. It has eleven districts, and its capital is Chur. The German name of the canton, , translates as the &quot;Grey Leagues&quot;, referring to the canton&#x27;s origin in three local alliances, the Three Leagues. The other native names also refer to the Grey League: in Sutsilvan, in the other forms of Romansh, and in Italian. is the Latin name for the area. The Alpine ibex is the canton&#x27;s heraldic symbol.

The largest and easternmost canton of Switzerland, it is also one of the three large southern Alpine cantons, along with Valais and Ticino. It is the most diverse canton in terms of natural and cultural geography, as it encompasses both sides of the Alps and several natural and cultural regions. The diversity of the canton is often compared to that of Switzerland as a whole and warrants it the name of &quot;Little Switzerland&quot;. The Grisons is bordered by four cantons as well as Austria, Italy and Liechtenstein.

The state is the only trilingual canton of Switzerland. It is also the only one where Romansh, Switzerland&#x27;s fourth national language, has official status. Romansh language and culture is an important part of local identity. In the canton had a population of . It is the least densely populated canton of Switzerland. The only sizable city in the canton is Chur, as the majority of the population lives in mountainous areas, including some of the most remote valleys of the country. One of the birthplaces of winter sports, the canton is a major tourist destination year-round, including a large number of Alpine resort towns, notably Davos and St. Moritz. The canton is also renowned for its extensive narrow-gauge railway network, operated by the Rhaetian Railway, and linking the capital with most valleys of the Grisons.

Formerly occupied by the Rhaeti, most of the lands of the canton became part of the Roman province called Raetia, which was established in 15 BC, with &quot;Curia&quot;, a settlement dating back to the Pfyn culture, as capital city. The area later became part of the lands of the diocese of Chur. The late middle ages saw the foundation of the League of God&#x27;s House, the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions. In 1471 an alliance gave birth to the Three Leagues, and before the end of the 15th century, the latter became an ally of the Old Swiss Confederacy. In 1803 the Three Leagues finally became one of the cantons of the Confederation.

==Geography and climate==

The Grisons is Switzerland&#x27;s largest and at the same time easternmost canton. Its geography, essentially marked by the Alps, is complex and encompasses a wide range of climates and ecosystems. It is one of the three large southern Alpine cantons, along with Ticino and Valais, which include regions on the south side of the Alps. But in contrast to those (and all other cantons), it fully extends on both sides of the great Alpine barrier, from the northern plains at Maienfeld to the southern plains at Roveredo. However, a large portion of the canton is neither clearly north nor south of the Alps, it is the Engadin (the &quot;garden of the Inn&quot;), a large inner Alpine valley oriented towards eastern Europe. Therefore there are parts of this canton in four of the five drainage basins of the country. The north of the canton is drained by the Rhine (ending in the North Sea), the south by the Po and Adige through several affluents (Mediterranean Sea), and the Engadin by the Danube through the Inn (Black Sea).

The Grisons lies fully within the Alps, with elevations above sea-level ranging from . It is both one of the highest and lowest cantons, and the second-highest when considering mean elevation. As a consequence, its topography is extremely rugged and many of the highest settlements in the country (and Europe) are found there, notably in the Upper Engadin. The mountains are numerous; well over 1,000 summits are in the canton. The highest is Piz Bernina, closely followed by numerous peaks in the homonymous range. Other prominent mountains are Piz Russein, Piz Kesch, Calanda, Aroser Rothorn and Rheinwaldhorn, see list of mountains of Graubünden for a more exhaustive list. The canton includes numerous subranges of the Alps other than the Bernina. These are the Albula, the Bregaglia, the Glarus, the Gotthard, the Lepontine, the Livigno, the Plessur, the Oberhalbstein, the Ortler, the Rätikon, the Samnaun, the Sesvenna and the Silvretta ranges.
The regions on the north side of the Alps are all drained by the Rhine and form an intricate network of valleys. The Rhine is both one of the longest rivers within the canton and the only one flowing directly into a sea. The sources of the Rhine are found in the west of the canton and form the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine. These two rivers converge at Reichenau to form the Rhine in the strict sense of the term. Just after the convergence, the valley opens and its floor constitutes the flattest plains of the canton, from Domat/Ems to Fläsch at the St. Gallen border. In the area around Chur, at the foot of the Calanda, the Rhine progressively changes its direction, from eastward to northward. The Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine include numerous tributaries as well before their own convergence. The former constitutes a long and straight valley, the Surselva, shut off from the lower plains by the Rhine Gorge. Its biggest tributaries are the rivers Glogn, Valser Rhine, Rabiusa, forming respectively the Val Lumnezia, the Vals Valley and the Safiental. The other one, the Posterior Rhine, notably collects the waters of the Avers Rhine and the Albula, which in turn collects the waters of the Gelgia and the Landwasser. Similarly to the Anterior Rhine, the upper portion of the Posterior Rhine is also shut off from the plains by the Viamala Gorge. After the convergence with the Albula, the Posterior Rhine forms a wide valley, the Domleschg, until it meets its anterior counterpart. After that, the Rhine collects the water of two important rivers: the Plessur at Chur, forming the valley of the Schanfigg, and the Landquart at the homonymous town, forming the Prätigau.

The Engadin is entirely drained by the Inn and is the only valley in Switzerland in the Danube basin. The Inn is one of the longest rivers in the canton and forms an almost straight valley, from the Maloja Pass to Martina, with a change of direction near Zernez. Despite its length and numerous tributaries, only a few long rivers converge with the Inn. These are the Flaz (forming the Val Bernina), the Spöl (forming the Val da Spöl) and the Clemgia (forming the Val S-charl). In the lower part of the Engadin is also the side valley of Samnaun. The main passes connecting the Engadin with the northern Grisons are (from west to east): the Julier Pass, the Albula Pass and the Flüela Pass.

The valleys on the south side of the Alps are not contiguous to each other and form four distinct regions. The Mesolcina, drained by the Moesa, the Val Bregaglia, drained by the Mera, the Val Poschiavo, drained by the Poschiavino, and the Val Müstair, drained by the Rom. The first three are in the Po basin and the last one is in the Adige basin. While the first two (Mesolcina and Bregaglia) are contiguous to the region north of the Alps, through the San Bernardino Pass, and the Septimer Pass respectively, the three last ones (Bregaglia, Poschiavo and Müstair) are contiguous to the Engadin, through the Maloja Pass, the Bernina Pass, and the Ofen Pass.

Although no large bodies of water are found in the canton, numerous mountain lakes (above 800 m elevation) dot the landscape, some of them being used as reservoirs for hydroelectricity production. The largest natural lakes are Lake Sils, Lake Silvaplana, Lago di Poschiavo and Lake St. Moritz (all in Upper Engadin except that of Poschiavo). Artificial lakes are more numerous, the largest (over 100 ha) being Lago di Livigno, Lago di Lei, Lai da Sontga Maria, Zervreilasee, Lago Bianco, Lai da Marmorera and Lägh da l&#x27;Albigna. The total number of lakes has been estimated to 600. See list of mountain lakes of Switzerland for a more exhaustive list.

Unlike other large cantons, the Grisons includes very few cities. The largest (and capital city) is Chur. It is followed by Davos, Landquart, Domat/Ems and St. Moritz, which are, however, far less populated. The canton is particularly renowned for its numerous Alpine resort towns, notably two of the aforementioned ones (Davos and St. Moritz), but also Klosters, Arosa, Lenzerheide, Disentis, Flims, Pontresina and Scuol.

The diversity of the climate of the Grisons is high and comparable to that of Switzerland. In the southernmost and lowest regions, vineyards and olives are grown, while on the highest summits, snow is found year-round. The inner valleys, particularly the Engadin, are significantly drier than the north and south side of the Alps, being sheltered by the high mountains of the range. On the south side of the Alps, Grono is one of the top warmest places in the country with an average of . The nationwide record temperature of was registered there. The southern valleys are also significantly wetter than the rest of the canton (1,476 mm of rain in Grono, 849 mm in Chur, and 705 mm in Scuol). The coldest places are naturally at high elevations, such as on Piz Corvatsch. The localities of the Upper Engadin are amongst the coldest inhabited regions in the country, notably Samedan with an average temperature of . The cantonwide record-low temperature of was registered there. The low-elevation region of Chur, including the Bündner Herrschaft, experiences naturally less harsh temperatures with an average of .

The area of the Grisons is , 19.2% larger than the canton of Bern, the second largest canton. Only about a third of this is commonly regarded as productive land of which forests cover about a fifth of the total area.
The canton is almost entirely mountainous and it is the most sparsely populated region of the country. In its southeastern part lies the only official Swiss National Park. In its northern part, the mountains were formed as part of the thrust fault that was in 2008 declared a geologic UNESCO World Heritage Site, under the name Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona. Another Biosphere Reserve is the Biosfera Val Müstair adjacent to the Swiss National Park, while Ela Nature Park is one of the regionally supported parks.

The Grisons is sometimes included in the larger region of Eastern Switzerland, together with six other cantons. The Grisons shares border with numerous regions of Europe, reflecting its cultural diversity, and is the only canton adjacent to three different countries. On the national level it shares borders with four other cantons: Uri, Glarus, St. Gallen to the northwest (essentially across the Glarus Alps) and Ticino to the west (essentially across the Gotthard Massif and the Lepontine Alps but also at the level of the plain at Roveredo). On the international level, the canton shares borders with three countries: Liechtenstein to the north, the Austrian regions of Vorarlberg and Tyrol to the northeast and the Italian regions of Trentino-South Tyrol and Lombardy to the east and south.

==History==
The deep Alpine valleys of the present-day Grisons were originally settled by the Raetians (&quot;Rhaeti&quot;). In Chur, archaeological evidence of settlement goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900–3500 BC), making the capital city of the Grisons one of the oldest settlements in Switzerland.

Most of the lands of the canton were once part of a Roman province called &quot;Raetia&quot;, which was established in 15 BC. The current capital of the Grisons, Chur, was known as Curia in Roman times. The area later was part of the lands of the diocese of Chur.

In 1367 the League of God&#x27;s House (&quot;Cadi&quot;, &quot;Gottes Haus&quot;, &quot;Ca&#x27; di Dio&quot;) was founded to resist the rising power of the Bishop of Chur. This was followed by the establishment of the Grey League (&quot;Grauer Bund&quot;), sometimes called &quot;Oberbund&quot;, in 1395 in the Upper Rhine valley. The name &quot;Grey League&quot; is derived from the homespun grey clothes worn by the people and was used exclusively after 16 March 1424. The name of this league later gave its name to the canton of the Grisons. A third league was established in 1436 by the people of ten bailiwicks in the former Toggenburg countship, as the dynasty of Toggenburg had become extinct. The league was called League of the Ten Jurisdictions (&quot;Zehngerichtebund&quot;).
The first step towards the canton of the Grisons was when the league of the Ten Jurisdictions allied with the League of God&#x27;s House in 1450. In 1471 the two leagues allied with the Grey League. In 1497 and 1498 the Leagues allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy after the Habsburgs acquired the possessions of the extinct Toggenburg dynasty in 1496, siding with the Confederacy in the Swabian War three years later. The Habsburgs were defeated at Calven Gorge and Dornach, helping the Swiss Confederation and the allied leagues of the canton of the Grisons to be recognised. However the Three Leagues remained a loose association until the &quot;Bundesbrief&quot; of 23 September 1524.

The last traces of the Bishop of Chur&#x27;s jurisdiction were abolished in 1526. The Musso war of 1520 drove the Three Leagues closer to the Swiss Confederacy.

Between 1618 and 1639 it became a battleground between competing factions during the Bündner Wirren. The Protestant party was supported by France and Venice, while the Catholic party was supported by the Habsburgs in Spain and Austria. Each side sought to gain control of the Grisons to gain control over the important alpine passes. In 1618, the young radical Jörg Jenatsch became a member of the court of &#x27;clerical overseers&#x27; and a leader of the anti-Habsburg faction. He supervised the torture to death of the arch-priest Nicolò Rusca of Sondrio. In response, Giacomo Robustelli of the pro-Catholic Planta family, raised an army of rebels in the Valtellina. On the evening of 18/19 July 1620, a force of Valtellina rebels supported by Austrian and Italian troops marched into Tirano and began killing Protestants. When they finished in Tirano, they marched to Teglio, Sondrio and further down the valley killing every Protestant that they found. Between 500 and 600 people were killed on that night and in the following four days. The attack drove nearly all the Protestants out of the valley, prevented further Protestant incursions and took the Valtellina out of the Three Leagues.
In response, in February 1621, Jenatsch led a force of anti-Habsburg troops to attack Rietberg Castle, the home of a leader of the pro-Catholic faction, Pompeius Planta. They surprised Planta and according to legend he was killed by Jörg Jenatsch with an axe. The murder of Planta encouraged the Protestant faction and they assembled a poorly led and disorganized army to retake the Valtellina and other subject lands. However, the army fell apart before they could attack a single Catholic town. This Protestant invasion provided the Spanish and Austrians with an excuse to invade the Leagues. By the end of October, Spain and Austria had occupied all of the Grisons. The resulting peace treaty of January 1622, forced Grisons to cede the Müstair, the Lower Engadine and Prättigau valleys. The treaty also forbade the Protestant religion in these valleys. In response, in 1622, the Prättigau valley rebelled against the Austrians and drove them out of the valley. The Austrians invaded the valley twice more, attempting to reimpose the Catholic faith, in 1623–1624 and 1629–1631.

In 1623 the Leagues entered into an alliance with France, Savoy and Venice. Jürg Jenatsch and Ulysses von Salis used French money to hire an 8,000-man mercenary army and drive out the Austrians. The peace treaty of Monzon (5 March 1626) between France and Spain, confirmed the political and religious independence of the Valtellina. In 1627 the French withdrew from the Valtellina valley, which was then occupied by Papal troops. Starting in 1631 the League, under the French Duke Henri de Rohan, started to expel the Spaniards. However, Richelieu still did not want to hand the valley over to its residents. When it became clear that the French intended to remain permanently in the Leagues, but would not force the Valtellina to convert to Protestantism, Jürg Jenatsch (now a mercenary leader) converted in 1635 to the Catholic faith. In 1637, he rebelled and allied with Austria and Spain. His rebellion along with the rebellion of 31 other League officers forced the French to withdraw without a fight. On 24 January 1639, Jürg Jenatsch was killed during Carnival by an unknown attacker who was dressed as a bear. The attacker may have been a son of Pompeius Planta or an assassin hired by the local aristocracy. According to legend he was killed by the same axe that he used on Pompeius Planta. On 3 September 1639 the Leagues agreed with Spain to bring the Valtellina back under League sovereignty, but with the promise to respect the free exercise of the Catholic faith. Treaties with Austria in 1649 and 1652, brought the Müstair and Lower Engadine valleys back under the authority of the Three Leagues.

In 1798, the lands of the canton of the Grisons became part of the Helvetic Republic as the canton of Raetia except Valtellina, which was separated in 1797 for joining the Cisalpine Republic. It was later part of the Empire of Austria in 1814 before joining the Kingdom of Italy in 1859. With the Act of Mediation the &quot;perpetual ally&quot; of Switzerland became a canton in 1803. The constitution of the canton dates from 1892. In the following century, there have been about 30 changes made to the constitution.

The arms of the three original leagues were combined into the modern cantonal coat of arms in 1933.

==Government==

The Grand Council (; , ), the legislature of the canton, sits in Chur, the cantonal capital. Its 120 members, elected in 39 districts using a majority system, are in office for four years. The last district elections were in 2014. The cantonal government, exercising executive authority, is made up of five members, elected by the people for a term of four years and limited to three terms using a majority system.

The constitution of the Grisons, last revised on 14 September 2003, states in its preamble that the canton&#x27;s purpose is to &quot;safeguard freedom, peace, and human dignity, ensure democracy and the Rechtsstaat, promote prosperity and social justice and preserving a sane environment for the future generations, with the intention of promoting trilingualism and cultural variety and conserving them as part of our historical heritage&quot;.

The constitution allows for the enfranchisement of foreign residents at a municipal level, at discretion of the local governments. In 2009, the municipality of Bregaglia became the first in the canton to make use of this provision, granting voting rights to foreigners.

===Municipalities===
There are 100 municipalities in the canton ().

==Demographics==

The inhabitants of the Grisons are called &quot;Bündner&quot; or (rarely) Grisonians.

The population of the canton (as of ) is . , the population included 28,008 foreigners, or about 14.84% of the total population. The main religions are Catholicism and Protestantism. Both are well represented in the canton, with Roman Catholics forming a slight plurality (47% Catholic to 41% Protestant).

===Languages===


The Grisons is the only canton of Switzerland with three official languages: German (74.7%), Romansh (13.9%), and Italian (13.9%) with the remaining 13% speaking another language natively.

More speakers of the Romansh language live in the Grisons than in any other canton, although it has become a minority language there. Since the late Middle Ages the Romansh language has greatly reduced (by more than half the original territory, that included Liechtenstein and sections of western Austria) the area where it is spoken by the majority of the population.

Romansh consists of five dialect groups, each with its own written language: Sursilvan, Vallader, Puter, Surmiran and Sutsilvan. There also exists a common written language called Rumantsch Grischun.
Romansh has been recognized as one of four &quot;national languages&quot; by the Swiss Federal Constitution since 1938. It was declared an &quot;official language&quot; of the Confederation in 1996, meaning that Romansh speakers may use Romansh for correspondence with the federal government and expect to receive a response in Rumantsch Grischun.
Romansh has official language status at the canton level. Municipalities in turn are free to specify their own official languages.

==Economy==

Agriculture is still essential to keep remote valleys inhabited and cultivated, differing it from sheer wilderness. Agriculture is therefore supported by subsidies by the authorities both national and regional. Eight per cent of the population work in agriculture and forestry, where 50 per cent of the production is certified as organic. Agriculture includes forests and mountain pasturage in summer, particularly of cows, sheep and goats.
Since wolf and bear have returned, the use of Maremma Sheepdogs is not unusual. Although mountain pastures are predominant, there is also wine production in the Rhine Valley, particularly in Fläsch, Maienfeld, Jenins and Malans. This area is referred to as the Bündner Herschaft. In the southern valleys of Mesolcina and Val Poschiavo there is corn (maize) and chestnut farming, allowed by the milder climate. In the Mesolcina, olive trees are also grown.

24 per cent of the workforce are employed in industry whereas 68 per cent work in the service industry. The most industrialized region is naturally that of Chur. Ems-Chemie is based in Domat/Ems and is a major employer in the area.

The tourism industry is a major player and reaches a remarkable 14 per cent of the GDP. Tourism is concentrated around the towns of Davos, Klosters, Lenzerheide, Arosa, Flims, St. Moritz and Pontresina, which have large ski areas. There are, however, a great number of other tourist resorts in the canton, divided by the official tourist board for winter sports for example into categories &quot;Top - Large - Small and beautiful&quot;. St. Moritz is one of the oldest winter sport resorts, being popular in winter since 1864. The following year, Davos also saw its first tourists in winter. St. Moritz hosted the 1928 Winter Olympics and the 1948 Winter Olympics. Summer tourism is also an important source of revenue. Trekking, mountaineering, and mountain biking are some of the main activities. Business tourism is also a source of revenue, notably in Davos, where the World Economic Forum meetings are traditionally organised.

==Transport==
As the canton extends on both sides of the great Alpine barrier, many important mountain passes are found there, particularly on the north-south axis. Transport has always been an important issue in the area; cart tracks from the Roman era were found on Julier Pass and Septimer Pass was rebuilt for cart use in 1387 and, although it later became unimportant, it is still in its 1800 form (for hikers only). Corniche paths were necessary for long stretches, and gorges such as the Viamala gave construction problems for any kind of transport. The first real roads of width were built across the Alps from around 1816, one of which is still in a very good historical condition as this connection across Splügen Pass lost its importance after the opening of rail tunnels crossing the alps. The last valley to be connected to the road system in the Grisons was Avers, whose remote hamlet of Juf was only reached in 1897. After the Swiss Post expanded their Postal Bus transport services, the region&#x27;s inhabitants became more used to motorized traffic. In 1925, there were already 250 vehicles in service. Eventually, the inhabitants of the Grisons gave up their resistance against individual motor traffic in 1926, In 1967 opened San Bernardino road tunnel, built to host tourism traffic, is used also by heavy goods vehicles nowadays although not really suitable for them because of its ascent gradients. Most other passes have lost their importance for goods transport nowadays.

Unlike Valais and Ticino, the Grisons does not benefit from major railway axes across the Alps such as the Lötschberg and Gotthard. As a consequence, the only standard gauge railway in the canton is that of the Rhine Valley, ending at Chur station. Conversely, the latter has become a major railway station and a transport hub of the canton since the construction of the Rhaetian Railway, which links most regions of the canton from the Rhine Valley.

Huge efforts ensure public transport to (nearly) every settlement by an integrated timetable of different transport companies. Even Juf, inhabited by some 30 people only but holding a European record, is reached five times a day by public transport. The two main transport companies are PostBus, the national post bus company, and the Rhaetian Railway, essentially owned by the cantonal government. The latter uses the largest narrow-gauge railway network in Switzerland and serves most regions of the canton, with branches towards Central Switzerland and Italy. This network is notably travelled by two of the longest distance trains of Switzerland: the Glacier Express and the Bernina Express. The Swiss Federal Railways extend only a few kilometres into the canton, from Maienfeld, and serve essentially Landquart and Chur, where passengers transfer to the Rhaetian Railway and a large number of PostBus routes. The Albula Line became a UNESCO world heritage as did the Bernina Railway, the highest and only railway to cross the Alps without the use of a tunnel at the pass. In winter some of the road passes are closed whereas several high mountain passes such as the Julier, Bernina and Lukmanier are kept open all winter (subject to restrictions). Being the highest elevated state in Switzerland, the Grisons hosts huge alpine areas that are not accessible by any means of transport but have to be walked to. A large number of cable transport facilities provide easy access to some of the mountains of the Grisons, the highest being on Piz Corvatsch.

The Engadin valley has its own airport, Samedan Airport. It is the highest airport in Switzerland.

==Culture==
The Grisons is culturally the most diverse region of Switzerland. Its common denominator, however, is a strong mountain culture marked by life in isolated rural communities, notably depicted in Johanna Spyri&#x27;s Heidi. Traditional customs include Alpine transhumance in spring and autumn, and the Chalandamarz at the end of winter.

The canton has a large concentration of medieval castles (and ruins). The most notable, in the Engadin, is that of Tarasp, guarding the Inn valley. Many ruins and castles are found in the Domleschg area. Close by lies the church of Zillis, where 1130/40 a famous romanesque illustrated ceiling was added which is now treated as national heritage. Three World Heritage Sites are located in the canton: the Benedictine Convent of Saint John, the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona and the Rhaetian Railway in the Albula and Bernina Landscapes.
The gastronomy of the Grisons is mostly known for a dried-beef delicacy called Bündnerfleisch, often simply referred to as Grisons Meat. Other meat specialities include dried sausages (especially Salsiz, made of various meats), speck and ham. Cheeses produced in the Grisons are also numerous. Among notable dishes are the Capuns, predominantly made in the western part of the Grisons. Capuns consist of hearty dumplings with pieces of meat wrapped in chard leaves, then gratinated in oven with cheese and cream. The Maluns are another well-known dish of the Grisons. They are made of boiled potatoes mixed with flour, then fried in butter. Maluns are typically served with a compote of apples and various other local products such as cheeses and meat specialities. The Pizzoccheri are another dish, essentially eaten in the valley of Poschiavo. They consist of buckwheat noodles, cooked with potatoes, vegetables and cheese. The emblematic dessert of the Grisons is the Bündner Nusstorte. It is essentially a shortcrust pastry filled with a mix of caramelized walnuts and honey. Another similar pastry, but containing chestnuts instead, the Torta di Castagne, is made in the southern valleys, especially in the Val Bregaglia.

Wines are essentially produced in the Bündner Herrschaft. In the vineyards between Fläsch and Malans, 42 types of vines are found, Pinot Noir being the most popular. Wines are also naturally produced in the southern valleys but in smaller quantities. The valley of the Mesolcina is contiguous with the Ticino wine region and that of Poschiavo is contiguous with the Valtellina wine region. Numerous breweries can be found in the canton as well. The largest, located at Chur, is Calanda Bräu.

Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha is the Romansh-speaking division of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation and focuses on the Grisons. &quot;Die Südostschweiz&quot; (in German) and &quot;La Quotidiana&quot; (Romansh) are some of the most important written media of the region.

==Nature==
The Grisons successfully reintroduced ibex in the early 20th century after it had all but died out from the Alps, except for an area in the Aosta Valley in Italy, Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso. Similarly, it reintroduced the bearded vulture and lynx in the 21st century, which had been extinguished, though the lynx remains rare.

<text>The additional-member system (AMS) is a two-vote seat-linkage-based mixed electoral system used in the United Kingdom in which most representatives are elected in single-member districts (SMDs), and a fixed number of other &quot;additional members&quot; are elected from a closed list to make the seat distribution in the chamber more proportional to the votes cast for party lists. It is distinct from using parallel voting for the list seats (also known as the &quot;supplementary-member&quot; system) in that the &quot;additional member&quot; seats are awarded to parties taking into account seats won in SMDs (referred to as &quot;compensation&quot; or &quot;top-up&quot;) – these are ignored under parallel voting (a &quot;non-compensatory&quot; method).

AMS is the name given to a particular system used in the United Kingdom that aims to provide proportional representation. However, in theory it can fail to be proportional, a situation called a seat overhang. In practice, the proportionality of AMS depends on the number of additional (&quot;top-up&quot;) seats and the votes cast in a specific election. In parts of the United Kingdom where it is or was used, it has produced results closer to mixed-member proportional rather than mixed-member majoritarian representation. 

This article focuses on the use of the AMS in the United Kingdom. The AMS is used to elect the Scottish Parliament (in a regionalized top-up system) and the London Assembly (with at-large top-up seats), and up until the 2026 election, the Senedd in Wales.

== How AMS works ==
In an election using the additional member system, each voter casts two votes: a vote for a candidate standing in their local constituency (with or without an affiliated party), and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies (or a single nationwide constituency). In Scotland list members (&quot;top-up&quot; seats) are elected by region; in London there is a single London-wide pooling of list votes.

Voters are not required to vote for the same party in the constituency and regional votes. If a voter votes for different parties at the constituency and regional levels this is referred to as split-ticket voting. In the regional vote, the voter votes for a specific party, but has no control over which candidates from the party are elected. On the other hand, in the constituency vote, the voter votes for a specific candidate rather than a party.

=== Counting votes and allocating seats ===
The first vote is used to elect a member from their constituency under the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; first-preference plurality (FPP) system (i.e. in the constituency, the candidate with the most votes takes the seat).

The second vote is used to determine how many additional seats a party may get, which is based on how many seats a party should get in total. Parties receive additional seats to match the vote shares they received as close as possible, making the legislature more representative of voters&#x27; preferences.

In the model of the AMS as used in the United Kingdom, the regional seats are divided using a D&#x27;Hondt method. However, the number of seats already won in the local constituencies is taken into account in the calculations for the list seats, and the first average taken in account for each party follows the number of FPTP seats won. For example, if a party won 5 constituency seats, then the first D&#x27;Hondt divisor taken for that party would be 6 (5 seats + 1), not 1. In South Korea, which uses the largest remainder method, constituency seats are taken into account by subtracting the number of constituency seats that the party won from the number of seats initially won by the party proportionally (over all seats).

==== Example ====
In a 100 seat assembly 70 members are elected in single-member constituencies. Because the system generally favours the largest party and those parties/candidate that are strong in a particular region, the total result of the constituency (FPP) elections can be very disproportional. In this example, the party with a plurality in the popular vote (party A) won a majority of all seats (54), while the second largest party (B) only won 11 districts. One of the two smaller parties (party C) won no districts, despite having 13% support nationwide, but a smaller (regional) party with only 3% nationally did get 5 of their candidates elected, as their voters were concentrated in those constituencies.

In the example, additional seats are assigned on a nationwide level. Parties A and D are already overrepresented, so they are not entitled to additional seats. Parties B and C receive top-up seats, as there are only 30, this is not enough to make the results proportional. 
==== Compared to similar systems ====
If the 30 additional seats in the example were allocated independently by list-PR the system would be called parallel voting or a &quot;supplementary member&quot; system. This would be a mixed-member majoritarian system (MMM), under which even party A received additional seats, even though it is overrepresented even without getting any.

Some systems called mixed-member proportional systems (MMP), like the ones used for electing the national parliament New Zealand, at least partially compensate for overhang seats as well, by adding back that many seats to the assembly if needed, but this is not a perfect correction for the disproportionality. In Germany formerly even more seats were adding to the Bundestag, to get fully proportional results, but as per the latest reform, parties simply may not keep overhang seats, meaning they might not be able to keep all constituency seats they &quot;won&quot; in.

In this example, the assembly size would be increased by 13 seats to compensate for parties B and C&#x27;s seat deficits under the New Zealand type &#x27;MMP&#x27;, and by 65 (which allows parties A, B and C to receive more seats) under a flexible amount of additional leveling seats.

The additional member system might provide proportional representation when there are no overhang seats that would need to be compensated; in this case it would have the same outcome as other &#x27;MMP&#x27; systems, if the results of the FPTP elections were completely proportional (which is almost never the case in reality). If decoy lists and tactical voting were used (see below), the results under the AMS would be the same as under parallel voting.

In all other cases the AMS is more proportional than parallel voting, but sometimes less proportional than &#x27;MMP&#x27; in New Zealand.
=== Threshold ===
As in many systems containing or based upon party-list representation, in order to be eligible for list seats in some AMS models, a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote, or no candidates will be elected from the party list. Candidates having won a constituency will still have won their seat. In almost all elections in the UK there are no thresholds except the &quot;effective threshold&quot; inherent in the regional structure. However the elections for the London Assembly have a threshold of 5% which has at times denied seats to the Christian Peoples Alliance (in the 2000 election), the British National Party, Respect – The Unity Coalition (both in the 2004 election), and the Women&#x27;s Equality Party (in the 2016 election).

== Definitions and variations of AMS ==

=== AMS vs. MMP ===
AMS is used by some as another term to mean the broadly same type of system called mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in New Zealand. As the term additional member system is used here, AMS is unlike some MMP systems more true to its name, because it does not compensate for the disproportionate results caused by a party taking so many district seats that the fixed number of top-up seats cannot compensate. Such is the case where the leading party takes overhang seats and the legislature has a fixed number of seats. In &#x27;true&#x27; MMP systems, leveling seats (extra additional members) are filled in such a way as to ensure parties have proportional representation, but not in the AMS as used in the UK.

Due to the problem of district contests electing too many members for leading parties (overhang), the AMS systems discussed here, instead of producing fully proportional results, often produce only semi-proportional representation. However, even semi-proportional representation is a considered by some a great advance on an electoral system that uses only the first-past-the-post voting system, where the number of seats a party takes only vaguely reflects the number of votes that party receives.

The term &quot;additional member system&quot;, as introduced by the Hansard Society, has been confused in the literature with the term &quot;mixed member proportional&quot; &quot;representation&quot; (in the broader sense) coined by New Zealand&#x27;s Royal Commission on the Electoral System (1984–1986). The term AMS has been conflated also with parallel voting, which is not a compensatory system and in New Zealand was offered under the name &quot;supplementary member system&quot;. AMS has also been used to mean any system with additional members (both parallel voting and compensatory systems), therefore any two-tiered mixed system with first-past-the-post and additional list members. This is also why some unconventional systems, such as scorporo have also occasionally been described as &#x27;additional member systems&#x27;, although with compensatory systems this was also reinforced by the conflation of compensatory mixed systems and mixed-member proportional representation in general.

=== Variations of AMS ===
The Arbuthnott Commission recommended that Scotland change to a model where the voter can vote for a specific regional candidate as well (called an &quot;open list&quot;), but this has not been implemented. A similar system is used in Bavaria, where the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party&#x27;s regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts twice (Bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose). In Baden-Württemberg there are no lists; they use the &quot;best near-winner&quot; method (Zweitmandat) in a four-region model, where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it, but this model has not been copied in the United Kingdom. 

To produce more proportional results without increasing the number of seats in the chamber, reforms might include changing the way district members are elected. If STV or SNTV is used, the district elections are likely to be more proportional than if districts seats are filled through first-preference plurality (FPP), and thus the available top-up seats could be used to produce more proportional overall chamber composition.

== Strategic manipulation and tactical voting ==

=== Decoy lists ===
So-called &quot;decoy lists&quot; are a trick to unhinge the compensation mechanisms contained into the proportional part of the AMS, so to &quot;de facto&quot; establish a parallel voting system.

Although a theoretical possibility, decoy lists are not used in Scotland, Wales, or other places using AMS in the UK, where most voters vote for candidates from parties with long-standing names. In the run up to the 2007 Scottish election, the Labour party had considered not fielding list candidates in the Glasgow, West of Scotland, and Central Scotland regions, as their constituency strength in the previous two elections had resulted in no list MSPs; instead they proposed to support a list composed of Co-operative Party candidates. Before this the Co-operative party had chosen not to field candidates of its own but merely to endorse particular Labour candidates. However the Electoral Commission ruled that as membership of the Co-operative party is dependent on membership of the Labour party they could not be considered distinct legal entities.

In contrast, in the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, Forward Wales had its candidates (including sitting leader John Marek) stand as independents, to attempt to gain list seats they would not be entitled to if Forward Wales candidates were elected to constituencies in the given region. However the ruse failed: Marek lost his seat in Wrexham and Forward Wales failed to qualify for any top-up seats.

In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, former SNP leader, Alex Salmond announced his leadership of the newly formed Alba Party, with the stated aim of winning list seats for pro-independence candidates. At the party&#x27;s public launch, Salmond quoted polling suggesting the SNP would receive a million votes in the forthcoming election but win no regional seats. He said that having Alba candidates on the regional lists would end the &quot;wasted votes&quot;, and the number of independence supporting MSPs could reach 90 or more.

== Use ==
The AMS is used in some elections in the United Kingdom

*Scotland: the Scottish Parliament
* London: the London Assembly

In 1976, the Hansard Society recommended that a mixed electoral system in a form different from the German be used for UK parliamentary elections, but instead of using closed party lists, it proposed that seats be filled by the &quot;best runner-up&quot; basis used by the German state of Baden-Württemberg, where the compensatory seats are filled by the party&#x27;s defeated candidates who were the &quot;best near-winner&quot; in each of the state&#x27;s four regions. It was the way that compensatory seats were allocated that made their report the origin of the additional member system, the term which the report also invented, which was then applied along with the much older &quot;mixed system&quot; by English-speaking writers on voting systems to West Germany&#x27;s system and similar models until the term mixed member proportional (MMP) was coined for the adoption of the German system proposed for New Zealand in a royal commission report in 1986, which would explain why &quot;AMS&quot; and &quot;MMP&quot; have been used as synonyms. The system the Hansard Society proposed was eventually adopted but with closed lists instead of the &quot;best runner-up&quot; (popularly known in Britain as &quot;best losers&quot;) provision for elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd and the London Assembly, but not for that proposed for elections to the House of Commons.

This system was proposed by the Independent Commission in 1999, known as Alternative vote top-up (AV+). This would have involved the use of the Alternative Vote for electing members from single-member constituencies, and regional open party lists. However, contrary to the Labour Party&#x27;s earlier manifesto promises, no referendum was held before the 2001 general election and the statement was not repeated.

The AMS system in use in the London Assembly would have been used for the other proposed regional assemblies of England, but after the overwhelming No vote in the 2004 North East England devolution referendum, the Government abolished all the regional assemblies in 2008-2010.

=== Scotland ===

The system implemented for the Scottish Parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority, compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the UK Parliament in Westminster. However, in 2011, the Scottish National Party won 69 seats, a majority of four.

In the first election for Scotland&#x27;s new Parliament, the majority of voters surveyed misunderstood some key aspects of the difference there between the &quot;first&quot; (constituency) vote and the &quot;second&quot; (regional list) vote; indeed in some ways the understanding worsened in the second election.

The Arbuthnott Commission found references to first and second votes fueled a misconception that the constituency vote should be a first preference and the regional vote a second one.

To deal with the misunderstanding between &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; votes, the ballot for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election was changed as recommended by the Arbuthnott Commission. The British government announced on 22 November 2006 that the two separate ballot papers used in the previous Scottish Parliament elections would be replaced for the elections in May 2007 by a single paper, with the left side listing the parties standing for election as regional MSPs and the right side the candidates standing as constituency MSPs.

<text>The Scottish Greens (also known as the Scottish Green Party; ) are a green political party in Scotland. The party has 7 MSPs of 129 in the Scottish Parliament, the party holds 35 of the 1226 councillors at Scottish local Government level.

They held two ministerial posts in the first Yousaf government following a power-sharing agreement with the SNP from August 2021 until the end of the Bute House Agreement in April 2024, marking the first time Green Party politicians formed part of a government in the UK.

The Scottish Greens were created in 1990 when the former Green Party separated into two independent parties, representing Scotland and England and Wales. The party is affiliated to the Global Greens and the European Green Party.

Party membership increased dramatically following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, during which it supported Scotland&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom.

==History==
=== Origins in the Ecology Party (1978–1999) ===

The Scottish Green Party originated as the Scottish branch of the Ecology Party, founded in 1978 by Leslie Spoor. The Ecology Party became the UK Green Party and it remained a constituent party until 1990, when the Scottish Green Party became a separate entity.

The 1990 Highland Regional Council election gave the Greens their first ever councillor in the UK. Roger (aka Rory) Winter, representing the Highland Green Party (Known in Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Uainich na Gàidhealtachd&quot;), was elected in Nairn. However, Cllr Winter broke away from the Greens in 1991 and continued his four-year term as an Independent Green Highlander.

=== First electoral successes (1999–2013) ===

==== Successful Scottish elections ====
In the first election to this Parliament, in 1999, the Scottish Green Party got one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) elected by proportional representation, Robin Harper, the UK&#x27;s first elected Green parliamentarian.

In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish Greens added six new MSPs to their previous total. The result was a surprise for the party. Afterwards, Harper stood for election for First Minister, securing six votes.

Despite the breakthrough in Holyrood, the party failed to elect any candidates in the 2004 European Parliament election, 2005 Westminster elections.

In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the party lost five seats in Holyrood, leaving the party with just two MSPs. The result was disappointing as polls initially suggested the party would remain with seven MSPs. However, in the council elections, taking place under the new Single Transferable Vote voting system, they gained three Councillors on the City of Edinburgh Council and five Councillors on Glasgow City Council.

Co-convenor Robin Harper blamed the loss on spoiled ballot papers and the campaign focusing on larger parties. 

==== Supporters of the first SNP government. ====
Despite the loss of MSPs, the party gained influence with the new SNP government. On 11 May, the Greens signed an agreement with the Scottish National Party (SNP), which meant that the Greens voted for Alex Salmond as First Minister and supported his initial Ministerial appointments. In return, the SNP backed a climate change bill as an early measure and promised to legislate against ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth. The SNP also agreed to nominate Patrick Harvie, one of the Green MSPs, to convene the Scottish Parliament Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change.

Differences, primarily over transport policy, were cited for the limited nature of the agreement. But they left open the door to further negotiations should the Scottish Liberal Democrats join the First Salmond government.
During the election, co-convenor Shiona Baird lost her seat, and did not re-stand for election as co-convenor. She was replaced by then Edinburgh councillor Alison Johnstone in November 2007.

Robin Harper and Johnstone did not seek re-election in 2008 as co-convenor. While Harvie was the sole nominee for the male co-convenor, there was 3 candidates for female co-convenor: former MSP Eleanor Scott, Glasgow councillor Nina Baker and Edinburgh councillor Maggie Chapman. The role of female co-convenor was won by Scott.

During the 2009 Scottish budget process, the Scottish Greens demanded an £1 billion home insulation programme over 10 years. The SNP Scottish Government offered £22 million for a &#x27;pilot&#x27; project. The party decided this compromise was not acceptable.

On 28 January 2009, the two Green MSPs were instrumental in the defeat of the Government&#x27;s budget. The move surprised some commentators, whose leadership had until this point been marked with increased cooperation with the SNP government.

A slightly amended version of the budget was passed easily the following week with the support of other parties.

==== 2011 Scottish parliament election ====
At the party&#x27;s 2010 conference, Robin Harper announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. The party&#x27;s election campaign was launched with a focus on investment into public services paid for by tax raises. In the end, the party only elected 2 MSPs in the 2011.

Despite not moving forward, the party was the only &#x27;minor&#x27; Scottish party which achieved representation in the Scottish Parliament after 2011 when the Scottish Socialist Party, Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party and others lost seats.

=== Independence referendum and rapid growth (2014–2019) ===

==== 2014 Independence referendum ====
In November 2013, Edinburgh councillor Maggie Chapman succeeded Glasgow councillor Martha Wardrop as the party&#x27;s female co-convenor after she did not seek re-election, while Patrick Harvie was re-elected. 

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the party participated in the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign in favour of Scottish independence. Co-convenor Patrick Harvie sat on the campaign&#x27;s advisory board. Briefly, the party withdrew from Yes Scotland. However, the party&#x27;s 2012 conference overturned the decision. The party also joined the Radical Independence Campaign. 

The party&#x27;s own campaign of &#x27;Green Yes&#x27; launched in October 2013, and advocated that only independence could deliver radical change, with Harvie also arguing that the party&#x27;s vision of independence was progressive, and explicitly not nationalistic. He also argued that devolution did not go far enough to tackle issues important to Scots like austerity.

However, some in the party were opposed to independence, including former convenor Robin Harper who said that he would &quot;absolutely vote No&quot;.
After the independence referendum, the Scottish Greens experienced a massive surge in membership, including future co-leader Lorna Slater. The party claimed that, for a period in the day after the referendum, it gained a member every 15 seconds. 
The party&#x27;s then co-convenors, Harvie and Chapman were chosen by the party to serve as its representatives on the post-referendum Smith Commission. The party argued that full powers on income tax, the bulk of welfare policy, energy, transport, employment law and human rights law should be transferred to Holyrood.
==== 2016 Scottish Parliament election and Brexit ====
In 2015, Maggie Chapman was challenged as co-convenor by activist Zara Kitson in the party&#x27;s internal elections. The election was notable as it was the first time an incumbent co-convenor faced a serious challenge, all to date had been re-elected as the sole nominees. Chapman was re-elected.
In the leadup to the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the party campaigned with a focus on tax-rises for the rich, with co-convenor Patrick Harvie saying it would be &quot;agenda item one&quot; in any post-election talks with the SNP. The party&#x27;s selection process of co-convenor Maggie Chapman as lead candidate in the North East Scotland region for the 2016 election attracted controversy. 

In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the party won 6 more seats, its best result since 2003. The result pushed the party ahead of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in seat numbers, making it the fourth-largest party for the first time. The Scottish Greens also elected the youngest MSP ever, Ross Greer at the age of 21.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the party called for a &#x27;Remain&#x27; vote. Subsequently, the party began more strongly advocating for a second Scottish independence referendum.

In February 2015, the party announced that it would field candidates in 32 seats for the 2015 United Kingdom general election with 40% of their candidates being women. In 2017 the party generated some controversy by standing only 3 candidates at the general election. In the 2019 general election they contested significantly more seats in 22 constituencies. They failed to win any seats and lost their deposit in every contest.

The 2017 Scottish local elections saw &#x27;real progress&#x27; with the party returning 14 councillors across Scotland, with 8 in the City of Edinburgh Council.

=== Inaugural co-leaders and first Green ministers (2019–present) ===

The Scottish Greens contested the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, with co-convenor Maggie Chapman as lead candidate and rising stars Lorna Slater and Gillian Mackay also on the list. The party failed to elect any MEPs despite other Green parties having significant success across Europe.

In August 2019, a newly adopted constitution by the party led to the 2019 Scottish Green Party co-leadership election, where Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater were elected as co-leaders with 43.1% and 30.2% respectively.

==== 2021 Scottish Parliament election and power-sharing agreement ====

In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the party won a record eight Holyrood seats. Alison Johnstone was one of the eight MSPs elected for the Scottish Greens in the election, however on 13 May 2021 she gave up her party affiliation in order to become Holyrood&#x27;s Presiding Officer as the position is a politically neutral role. 

After two months of negotiations, on 20 August 2021, the Scottish Greens announced a new power-sharing agreement with the SNP Scottish Government. While not an official coalition, for the first time in Scottish and UK history it offered the Greens two ministerial posts. The agreement saw both parties pledge for a second referendum on Scottish independence, an increase investment in active travel and public transport, enhancing tenants rights, a ten-year £500m Just Transition and establishing a National Care Service. The agreement was approved by 83% of Scottish Green members, and secured a two-thirds majority vote of the party&#x27;s National Council. This was required under the party&#x27;s constitution for the agreement to be ratified.

Academic Professor Nicola McEwen suggested that the agreement &quot;sometimes pushes [the SNP] further&quot; particularly on climate, social and fair work policy. She also argues that the two parties had already converged on many issues over the preceding decade. However, critics and supporters of the party agreed that the agreement had allowed the party to have a lot of influence on the Scottish government.After the election of Humza Yousaf as Leader of the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Green Party National Council unanimously voted to direct its MSPs to vote for Yousaf to become First Minister and continue their power-sharing agreement. During the leadership campaign, the party had suggested it would not support a government led by the other candidates. The party&#x27;s co-leaders served as ministers in the first Yousaf government from August 2021 to April 2024.

In government, the party introduced the first government bill from a Green Minister. 
On 3 August 2023, Robin Harper, the party&#x27;s first MSP resigned, claiming the party had &#x27;lost the plot&#x27;. Harper announced he would vote Labour in the 2024 UK general election. Nonetheless, the party also enjoyed an unprecedented level of support.

==== Success in local government ====
The 2022 Scottish local elections saw a record result for the party, doubling its seat count to 35. The party elected councillors for the first time in North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Shetland, East Lothian, Moray and the Scottish Borders. The party committed to introduce policies in local government based on climate and social justice.

In the central belt cities, the party also got closer to power, either supporting a minority administration or attempting to form a coalition with the SNP in Glasgow and Edinburgh. In March 2024, the party won its first ever by-election, electing Seonad Hoy as a councillor in Hillhead ward in Glasgow.

==== End of the Bute House agreement ====

Following the announcement by Màiri McAllan that the Scottish Government&#x27;s legally binding target to see a 75% percent reduction in emissions by 2030 would not be achieved and was to be scrapped, an extraordinary general meeting was called by Scottish Green Party members to discuss the future of the agreement. On the 25th April 2024, following a meeting at Bute House, it was decided that the power sharing agreement would come to an end.

The Scottish Greens intend to contest the 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland.

==Organisation==
The Scottish Greens are fully independent, but work closely with the green parties from Ireland: the Green Party Northern Ireland and the Green Party of Ireland. Until October 2022, it also cooperated with the Green Party of England and Wales; this partnership was suspended due to differences of opinion on trans rights. It is a full member of the European Green Party. The party currently has seven MSPs and 36 councillors, but has no representation in Westminster.

===Membership===
Within days of the Scottish independence referendum being held, the membership swelled to more than 5,000. Launching its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, the Scottish Greens stated a membership of over 8,500. By October 2015 the party were holding their biggest ever conference, with their membership standing at more than 9,000. In mid-2021 it had fallen back somewhat, reported as standing at 7,500. In April 2023, the number of members had risen to 7,646.

===Conferences===
The Scottish Greens hold conferences every Spring and Autumn, where members from throughout Scotland attend to deal with all the business of the party, with members voting on conference motions and policy motions.

=== Internal party bodies ===
There are two key bodies which steer the party between conferences: party council and the national executive. The party council can, with some exceptions, act as a more frequent conference on issues that appear outside conference season. The national executive oversees the day-to-day administration of party activities.

The party has a Conduct and Complaints Committee. In May 2024, it expelled thirteen members after a disciplinary investigation. Those expelled were accused of breaching the party&#x27;s code of conduct by signing the eight-point Scottish Green Declaration For Women&#x27;s Sex-Based Rights that asserted that &quot;sex is a biological reality&quot;, of which it was complained made the party less safe for transgender and non-binary members. The party has stated that &quot;trans-exclusionary individuals of any kind are not welcome as members&quot;.

===Branches===
The party is made up of branches, who usually cover one or more local authority areas, and meet on a regular basis.

===Representation groups===
The Scottish Greens have six self-organised representation groups:
* Disabled Greens
* Greens of Colour
* Rainbow Greens (LGBT+ group)
* Scottish Green Trade Union Group
* Scottish Young Greens
* Women&#x27;s Network

These groups have additional meetings and discussions which are separate from the main party meetings.

== Ideology ==
The Scottish Greens are a party whose ideology is shaped by green politics, Scottish independence, Scottish republicanism and pro-Europeanism.

Co-leader Patrick Harvie has described the party&#x27;s ideals as:

=== Four principles ===
According to the party&#x27;s website, the Scottish Greens are committed to forming a sustainable society and are guided by four interconnected principles:
* Ecology: &quot;Our environment is the basis upon which every society is formed. Whenever we damage our environment, we damage ourselves. Respect for our environment is therefore essential&quot;.
* Equality: &quot;A society that is not socially and economically just cannot be sustainable. Only when released from immediate poverty can individuals be expected to take responsibility for wider issues. Our society must be founded on cooperation and respect. We campaign hard against discrimination on grounds of gender, race, sexuality, disability, age or religion&quot;.
* Radical democracy: &quot;Politics is too often conducted in a polarised, confrontational atmosphere and in a situation remote from those that it affects. We must develop decentralised, participative systems that encourage individuals to control the decisions that affect their own lives&quot;.
* Peace and nonviolence: &quot;Violence at all levels of human interaction must be rejected and succeeded by relations characterised by flexibility, respect and fairness&quot;.

The party claims that, taken together, these principles give the party a holistic view that is in common with all green parties around the world.

=== Factions ===

==== Eco-socialism ====
There are internal factions which seek to transform the party&#x27;s ideology to be eco-socialist. In the party&#x27;s 2019 internal elections, the Green Futures Group ran a slate of candidates on a platform of a Green New Deal, eco-socialism and independence. The group&#x27;s candidates were all elected and hold key positions in the party as of 2019. In 2015, future MSP and then co-convenor Maggie Chapman, former MSP Mark Ballard and influential member Peter McColl were reported to be part of a &quot;leftist grouping inside the Greens&quot;. McColl argued that Chapman&#x27;s election and subsequent role as lead candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election marked an increased socialist influence on the party. In 2023, the Scottish Green Party Trade Union Group called the party&#x27;s parliamentary group a &quot;group of ecosocialist MSPs in their own right.&quot;

In 2021, the party&#x27;s conference backed a motion calling for the party to work &quot;towards building a democratic ecosocialist system&quot;, which was taken by some internal groups, such as the Scottish Young Greens as the party backing eco-socialism. The party&#x27;s critics on the Labour left like Coll McCail and Finn Smyth claim that it has taken a neo-liberal turn in office and is simply maintaining the status-quo by reneging on commitments like the establishment of a government owned energy company. Radical Independence Campaign co-founder Cat Boyd noted that while the party had been &quot;a consistent ally of the radical left&quot; she was concerned that may end as the party got closer to power due to &quot;the temptations of &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; coalition government&quot;.

McCail and Smyth&#x27;s criticism was engaged with by the party. Green MSP Ross Greer who co-authored the party&#x27;s power-sharing agreement with the SNP Scottish Government argued that they had identified the wrong problem, and that the Government&#x27;s lacking capital borrowing powers was what forced the end of the policies they discussed.

After the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, in which she was elected as an MSP, Chapman argued that the left had &quot;won the Scottish Green Party&quot;. She argued the election was the first which the party &quot;run a campaign on the basis of policies rather than personalities or tactical voting messages&quot; and that those policies emphasised social justice and climate justice.

== Policy ==
While associated mainly with environmentalist policies, the party has a history of support for communitarian economic policies, including well-funded, locally controlled public services within the confines of a steady-state economy, is supportive of proportional representation and takes a progressive approach to social policies. The party is also strongly opposed to both nuclear power and the Trident nuclear programme.

The party&#x27;s 2019 manifesto included pledges to implement a green new deal to tackle climate change and for future investment, the introduction of a universal basic income, the phasing in of a four-day week, support for rent controls and treating drug use as a health issue rather than a crime.

=== Climate change ===
The party favours strong action to combat climate change, including phasing out single-use plastic, the creation of more Low Emission Zones in cities and a ban on the sale of new petrol cars, diesel cars and fossil fuel boilers. The party also seeks &quot;ambitious&quot; climate action, and in 2019 abstained on the Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill claiming it was not &quot;anywhere near meaningful action to address the climate emergency&quot;. However, the BBC News journalist Philip Sim argued in 2021 that since then the party position has shifted to &quot;hitting these [carbon emissions reduction targets] than stretching them&quot;.

The party is also against oil and gas developments in Scotland, such as the proposed Cambo and Rosebank oil and gas fields.

In government, the party&#x27;s ministers announced a ban on new waste incinerators and a new biodiversity strategy.

=== Transport ===
The Greens are against plans to dual the A9 and the A96, arguing that the plans are incompatible with climate commitments. Instead, the party advocates for the expansion of Scotland&#x27;s railway network, such as a tunnel across the Forth constructed between Leith and Kirkcaldy, an aim to connect every town with more than 5,000 people to the railway network and to completely electrify the Scottish network by 2030.

The Scottish Greens also supported the nationalisation of ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper, and advocates for &quot;the whole of Scotland&#x27;s railways – both track and train – to be brought into public ownership&quot;. The party, as part of its co-operation agreement with the Scottish Government scrapped peak-time rail fares for at least one year.

The party also supports a wider nationalisation of all rail, bus and ferry companies, alongside further investment in walking, wheeling and cycling.

=== Scottish independence ===
It is the second largest party to both support Scottish independence and have representation in the Scottish Parliament. At the party&#x27;s 2005 conference, a motion passed to support Scottish independence.

The Scottish Green Party supports Scotland having its own currency if it were to become an independent country. The party has said this would be in order to establish full economic independence, rather than being tied to the pound sterling.

The party backed the Scottish government&#x27;s attempt to hold a second Scottish independence referendum in 2023, and made it a key part of its 2022 autumn conference.

However, in an interview at the party&#x27;s 2023 autumn conference, co-leader Lorna Slater suggested that independence was not a &quot;red line&quot; for any future power-sharing deals with Scottish Labour, re-affirming similar comments during the independence referendum.

=== LGBT+ rights ===
The party has campaigned strongly for LGBT rights, with the party publishing a specific LGBT+ manifesto co-produced with its LGBT wing. The party supports gender self-identification, banning conversion therapy, improving LGBT+ inclusive education and improving transgender healthcare. The party has also campaigned to get more non-binary people into politics, and voted to &#x27;suspend ties&#x27; with the Green Party of England and Wales due to transphobia concerns.

The party was the only party to support same-sex civil partnerships upon its entry to the Scottish Parliament in 1999. In 2003, the party&#x27;s MSP Patrick Harvie introduced a bill to allow civil partnerships in Scotland. The bill failed, but was key to creating the debate on the topic which let to its passing at Westminster.

The Scottish Greens have also firmly supported reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004. The party&#x27;s MSP Andy Wightman, and later, the party&#x27;s first MSP Robin Harper both left the party over the policy. Despite this, the party remained committed to the policy, arguing that &quot;...human rights, including the rights of trans people, are at the core of our vision and have been since our party was founded over 30 years ago&quot;. The party opposed the UK Government&#x27;s veto of the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill.

==Leadership==
The Scottish Greens is led by a six-person leadership team. This is made up of the co-leaders of the party, the co-chairs of the national executive of the party and the co-convenors of the party council.

The political leadership roles are generally held by a present or aspiring elected politician, while internal leadership is held by a mixture of ordinary members and aspiring or elected politicians.

=== Political leadership ===
Alongside many other green parties, the Scottish Greens initially shunned the idea of a singular leader, despite key party figures like Robin Harper commenting that it must &quot;have an official Leader and face to represent it if it is to sustain political effectiveness.&quot; Increasingly, during Patrick Harvie&#x27;s tenure as co-convenor, the role became more like a traditional party leader, as his profile as an MSP tended to overshadow his fellow co-convenor. In 2019, as a part of internal party reforms, the role of two co-leaders was introduced, with Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater elected as inaugural co-leaders. A maximum of one of the co-leaders may identify as a man.

Unlike party leaders in most other political parties, the Scottish Greens&#x27; co-leaders are only elected for two year terms, after which they may seek re-election. Generally, incumbents are returned without opposition, but the inaugural co-leadership election, and 2015 co-convenorship election were contested.
=== Internal leadership ===
The other four members of the party&#x27;s leadership team are drawn from its national council and executive. They serve for two year terms, and are elected by a ballot of party members.

==== Party Council ====

Between conferences, the Party Council provides the forum for strategic decisions, policy discussions, oversight and branch coordination. The council is composed of two delegates from branches, usually branch co-convenors, representative and special interest groups. Its decisions can only be overridden by a party conference or AGM.

The council is currently led by council co-convenors Laura Moodie and Kate Nevens.

==== Party Executive Committee ====
The National Executive oversees the day-to-day administration of the party. It is led by two co-chairs, directly elected by party members, and who manage the party staff and its volunteer-led National Committees which focus on specific party functions like policy development or engagement with the European Greens. Its decisions may be overridden by the party council or conference.

It is presently chaired by Ross Greer and Carolynn Scrimgeour, who was co-opted after the resignation of Ellie Gomersall in December 2023. This committee also oversees the work of the elected National Committees; Finance &amp; Fundraising, Elections &amp; Campaigns, Policy, Membership and International.
==Elected representatives==
The Scottish Greens have representation in the Scottish Parliament and several Scottish councils. It does not have any representation in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, unlike its sister party the Green Party of England and Wales.

===MSPs===
All of the Scottish Green Party&#x27;s members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) have been elected under the list in the Scottish Parliament. The party elected a record eight MSPs in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. However the party&#x27;s representation was reduced to seven after Green MSP Alison Johnstone was elected as the Parliament&#x27;s non-partisan Presiding Officer.

==== Previous MSPs ====
* John Finnie for Highlands and Islands. Finnie was elected Green within this region in May 2016, having previously been SNP then Independent. Stood down in 2021.
* Shiona Baird for North East Scotland. Baird served as party co-convener from 2004 to 2007.
* Chris Ballance for the South of Scotland.
* Mark Ballard for the Lothians.
* Robin Harper for the Lothians. Harper was the first elected Green parliamentarian in the UK and was the party&#x27;s convener from the time of that position&#x27;s creation in 1999 until 2002. He later served as one of its co-conveners from 2004 to 2008.
* Eleanor Scott for the Highlands and Islands. Scott was party convener from 2002 to 2004, and a co-convener of the party from 2008 to 2011.
* Andy Wightman was an MSP for the Lothian region 2016 to 2021. He was elected for the party in the 2016 election, but left in December 2020 after facing possible complaints and disciplinary action for the way he intended to vote on an amendment to the Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) (Scotland) Bill. He had planned to vote against the party and for the amendment, in conflict with the party&#x27;s policy on trans rights. He stated in his resignation letter that he felt the party had an &quot;alienating and provocative&quot; stance on trans rights.
* John Wilson, a member of the Greens, sat as an independent MSP in the 4th Scottish Parliament, having left the SNP in September 2014 because of its change in policy on NATO membership. He stood for the Greens in the 2016 election, but was unsuccessful.
* Alison Johnstone is an MSP for the Lothian and was elected Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, 13 May 2021, giving up her party affiliation on election to the role.

=== Councillors ===
Prior to the 2007 elections, the Party had only ever elected one councillor at local level: in May 1990, Roger (aka Rory) Winter, representing the Highland Green Party (&quot;Uainich na Gàidhealtachd&quot;), was elected in Nairn as Scotland&#x27;s first Green regional councillor to the then Highland Regional Council. Cllr Winter broke away from the Greens in 1991 and continued his four-year term as an Independent Green Highlander.

The party made its first major breakthroughs at council level in the 2007 local elections, electing eight councillors between Glasgow City and the City of Edinburgh Councils.

In the 2012 local elections, this was increased to 14. The party elected councillors for the first time to Aberdeenshire, Stirling &amp; Midlothian Councils.

At the 2017 local elections, the party returned a record 19 councillors, including elected councillors to Orkney Islands Council for the first time. However, the party lost its sole councillor on Midlothian Council.

The 2022 local elections saw another record number of Green councillors elected. Thirty five candidates gained seats across 13 local authorities, an increase of 16. This included the first ever Green councillors in North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Argyll &amp; Bute, Clackmannanshire, Shetland, East Lothian, Moray and the Scottish Borders. In March 2024, the party won its first ever by-election, electing Seonad Hoy as a councillor in Hillhead ward in Glasgow.

<text>Nicholas Peter John Hornby (born 17 April 1957) is an English writer and lyricist. He is best known for his memoir &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1992) and novels &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;About a Boy&quot;, all of which were adapted into feature films. Hornby&#x27;s work frequently touches upon music, sport, and the aimless and obsessive natures of his protagonists. His books have sold more than 5 million copies worldwide as of 2018. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Hornby was named the 29th most influential person in British culture. He has received two Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nominations for &quot;An Education&quot; (2009), and &quot;Brooklyn&quot; (2015).

==Early life and education==
Hornby was born in Redhill, Surrey, the son of Sir Derek Hornby, the chairman of London and Continental Railways, and Margaret Audrey Withers. He was brought up in Maidenhead, and educated at Maidenhead Grammar School and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read English. His parents divorced when he was eleven.

Before becoming a novelist, Hornby worked for a time as a secondary-school English teacher.

==Career==
Hornby published his first book in 1992, a collection of essays about American writers such as Tobias Wolff and Ann Beattie, titled &quot;Contemporary American Fiction&quot;. Hornby&#x27;s second book, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, also published in 1992, is an autobiographical story detailing his fanatical support for Arsenal Football Club. As a result, Hornby received the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award. In 1997, the memoir was adapted for film in the UK, and in 2005 an American remake was released, following Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s character&#x27;s obsession with the Boston Red Sox, a baseball team. With the book&#x27;s success, Hornby began to publish articles in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot; and the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, in addition to his music reviews for the &quot;New Yorker&quot;.

&quot;High Fidelity&quot; — his third book and first novel — was published in 1995. The novel, about a neurotic record collector and his failed relationships, was adapted into a 2000 American film starring John Cusack, a Broadway musical in 2006, and a television show &quot;High Fidelity&quot; starring Zoë Kravitz in 2020.

His second novel, &quot;About a Boy&quot;, published in 1998, is about two &quot;boys&quot; — Marcus, an awkward yet endearing adolescent from a single-parent family, and the free-floating, mid-30s Will Freeman, who overcomes his own immaturity and self-centredness through his growing relationship with Marcus. Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult starred in the 2002 film version. In 1999, Hornby received the E. M. Forster Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Hornby&#x27;s next novel, &quot;How to Be Good&quot;, was published in 2001. The female protagonist in the novel explores contemporary morals, marriage and parenthood. It was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2001 and won the W.H. Smith Award for Fiction in 2002.

Part of the money he earned with his next book, &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot; in 2002, was donated to TreeHouse, a charity for autistic children: Hornby&#x27;s own son is autistic. He was editor of the book, which contained twelve short stories written by his friends. He also contributed to the collection with the story &quot;NippleJesus&quot;.

In 2003, Hornby wrote a collection of essays on selected popular songs and the emotional resonance they carry, called &quot;31 Songs&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Songbook&quot;). Also in 2003, Hornby was awarded the London Award 2003, an award that was selected by fellow writers.

Hornby has also written essays on various aspects of popular culture and, in particular, he has become known for his writing on pop music and mix tape enthusiasts. Since 2003, he has written a book review column, &quot;Stuff I&#x27;ve Been Reading&quot;, for the monthly magazine &quot;The Believer&quot;; all of these articles are collected between &quot;The Polysyllabic Spree&quot; (2004), &quot;Housekeeping vs. The Dirt&quot; (2006), &quot;Shakespeare Wrote for Money&quot; (2008), and &quot;More Baths Less Talking&quot; (2012).

Hornby&#x27;s novel &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; was published in 2005, with a film version of this book released in 2014. It was on the shortlist for the Whitbread Novel Award. Hornby has also edited two sports-related anthologies: &quot;My Favourite Year&quot; and &quot;The Picador Book of Sports Writing&quot;.

Hornby&#x27;s book &quot;Slam&quot; was published on 16 October 2007; it is his first novel for young adults and was recognised as a 2008 ALA Best Books for Young Adults. The protagonist of &quot;Slam&quot; is a 16-year-old skateboarder named Sam, whose life changes drastically when his girlfriend gets pregnant.

Hornby&#x27;s following novel, titled &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot;, was published in September 2009. Addressing similar themes as his earlier novel &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, the book is about a reclusive 1980s rock star who is forced out of isolation, after the release of demo recordings of the songs on his most famous album brings him into contact with some of his most passionate fans.

In 2010, Hornby co-founded the Ministry of Stories, a non-profit organisation in East London dedicated to helping children and young adults develop writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.

Hornby discussed his bouts of depression in 2012 on the BBC Radio 4 broadcast of &quot;Fever Pitched: Twenty Years On&quot;.

Hornby&#x27;s most recent novels are &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (2014), about a 1960s beauty queen determined to make her mark upon television comedy, &quot;State of the Union&quot; (2019) and &quot;Just Like You&quot; (2020).

===Screenwriting===
Hornby has also developed a career as a screenwriter, and has said that he enjoys the challenge of working in film as opposed to writing novels. In his BAFTA and BFI Screenwriters&#x27; Lecture he said: &quot;once you get to a certain point in your novelistic career, unless you screw up very badly the book is going to come out. With a screenplay there are all these hurdles that seem to have some kind of objectivity to them. The screenplay has to work and I love that.&quot;

In 2009, Hornby adapted an autobiographical memoir by the journalist Lynn Barber for the screen as &quot;An Education&quot;, a feature film starring Peter Sarsgaard and Carey Mulligan. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and for two BAFTAs.

In 2014, Hornby adapted another autobiographical memoir, Cheryl Strayed&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. &quot;Wild&quot;, which starred Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, was nominated for Best Actress for Witherspoon and Best Supporting Actress for Dern. Speaking on the challenge of adapting such a packed book, Hornby said it was really a case of boiling everything down and making the realisation that he could have made a two-hour film without mentioning walking at all.

In 2015, he wrote the script for the film &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, an adaptation of Colm Tóibín&#x27;s novel of the same name. Tim Robey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said it was &quot;his strongest work ever as a screenwriter&quot;. According to Metacritic, the film is on eighty &quot;top 10&quot; lists for 2015. He was nominated for his second Oscar for writing the screenplay and received two BAFTA nominations, winning one.

In 2016, Hornby adapted Nina Stibbe&#x27;s book &quot;Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life&quot; into a television series. &quot;Love, Nina&quot; received its debut on BBC One on 20 May 2016, and ran for five episodes.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
Several of Hornby&#x27;s books have made the jump from page to screen. Hornby wrote the screenplay for the first, a 1997 British adaptation of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, starring Colin Firth. It was followed by &quot;High Fidelity&quot; in 2000, starring John Cusack, with the action shifted from London to Chicago. After this success, &quot;About a Boy&quot; was quickly picked up, and released in 2002, starring Hugh Grant. An Americanized &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, in which Jimmy Fallon plays a hopelessly addicted Boston Red Sox fan who tries to reconcile his love of the game with that of his girlfriend (Drew Barrymore), was released in 2005. Johnny Depp purchased film rights to the book &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; before it was published. The book was made into the 2014 film of the same name starring Pierce Brosnan, Aaron Paul, Toni Collette and Imogen Poots. The film adaptation of &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot; was released in 2018 starring Rose Byrne, Ethan Hawke and Chris O&#x27;Dowd.

===Stage===
&quot;High Fidelity&quot; was also the basis for a 2006 eponymous musical that shifted the action to Brooklyn; its book is by David Lindsay-Abaire with lyrics by Amanda Green, and music created by Tom Kitt. The production ran for a month in Boston, then moved to Broadway, closing after 18 previews and 14 regular performances.

===Television===
&quot;About a Boy&quot; was adapted for television and aired on NBC from 22 February 2014 to 17 February 2015. The show was developed by Jason Katims and it is the second adaptation based on the 1998 novel. The series stars David Walton, Minnie Driver and Benjamin Stockham.

Hulu premiered a 10-episode reboot of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; starring Zoë Kravitz on 14 February 2020.

==Music==
The importance of music in Hornby&#x27;s novels, and in his life, is evidenced by his long-standing and fruitful collaborations with the rock band Marah, fronted by Dave and Serge Bielanko. Hornby has even toured in the United States and Europe with the band, joining them on stage to read his essays about particular moments and performers in his own musical history that have had a particular meaning for him.

Hornby&#x27;s music criticism (most notably for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and in his own &quot;Songbook&quot;) has been widely criticised by writers such as Kevin Dettmar (in his book &quot;Is Rock Dead&quot;), Curtis White (in an essay at www.centreforbookculture.org, titled &quot;Kid Adorno&quot;), Barry Faulk and Simon Reynolds for his embrace of rock traditionalism and conservative take on post-rock and other experimental musics (exemplified in Hornby&#x27;s negative review of the Radiohead album &quot;Kid A&quot;).

Hornby has also had extensive collaboration with American singer/songwriter Ben Folds. Their album &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot; was released in September 2010. Folds wrote the music, with Hornby contributing lyrics. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the single &quot;Picture Window&quot; was released on Ben Folds&#x27; website. A bootleg version of a song about Levi Johnston written by Hornby and Folds and performed by Folds, appeared on the internet. Remaining Hornby lyrics provided the title song of the 2012 Ben Folds Five reunion album, &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot;.

In 2022, Hornby released the book &quot;Dickens and Prince&quot;, where he makes connections between the musician Prince and author Charles Dickens.

==Personal life==
Hornby has been married twice. He and his first wife have one son, born in 1993, who is autistic. Hornby&#x27;s second wife is producer Amanda Posey. They separated in 2021. They have two sons, born in 2001 and 2004. Hornby&#x27;s sister, writer Gill Hornby, is married to writer Robert Harris.

Nick Hornby was directly involved in the creation of the charity Ambitious about Autism, then known as TreeHouse Trust, and its school TreeHouse School, as a result of trying to find specialist education for his son Danny. Hornby remains a major donor to the charity and is still involved as a vice-president.

In 2010, Nick Hornby co-founded Ministry of Stories, a writing charity based in Hoxton, east London. The charity was inspired by Dave Eggers&#x27; 826 Valencia model in San Francisco and aims to offer young people a chance to develop writing and literacy skills and develop a love of writing for pleasure.

Hornby supports Arsenal Football Club.

<text>J Sainsbury plc, trading as Sainsbury&#x27;s, is a British supermarket and the second-largest chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom.

Founded in 1869 by John James Sainsbury with a shop in Drury Lane, London, the company was the largest UK retailer of groceries for most of the 20th century. In 1995, Tesco became the market leader when it overtook Sainsbury&#x27;s, which has since been ranked second or third: it was overtaken by Asda from 2003 to 2014, and again for one month in 2019. In 2018, a planned merger with Asda was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority over concerns of increased prices for consumers.

The holding company, J Sainsbury plc, is split into three divisions: Sainsbury&#x27;s Supermarkets Ltd (including convenience shops), Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank, and Argos. The group also owns and operates the Habitat furniture retailer, Nectar card, Tu clothing brand and Bush electronics brand. As of 2021, the largest overall shareholder is the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, the Qatar Investment Authority, which holds around 15% of the company. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
===Origin and growth (1869–1955)===

Sainsbury&#x27;s was established as a partnership in 1869, when John James Sainsbury and his wife Mary Ann opened a shop at 173 Drury Lane in Covent Garden, London. Sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar. His trading philosophy, as stated on a sign outside his first shop was: &quot;Quality perfect, prices lower&quot;.

Shops started to look similar, so a high cast-iron &#x27;J. SAINSBURY&#x27; sign featured on every London shop so that it could be recognised from a distance, and round-the-back deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to Sainsbury&#x27;s popularity.

In 1922, J Sainsbury was incorporated as the private company &#x27;J. Sainsbury Limited&#x27;.

Groceries were introduced in 1903, when John James purchased a grocer&#x27;s branch at 12 Kingsland High Street, Dalston. Every shop offered home delivery, as there were fewer cars in those days. Sites were carefully chosen, with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop. This allowed a larger display of products, which could be kept cooler in summer, which was important as there was no refrigeration.

By the time John James Sainsbury died in 1928, there were over 128 shops. He was replaced by his eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, who had gone into partnership with his father in 1915.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of shop design, convenience, and cleanliness. The company acquired the Midlands-based Thoroughgood chain in 1936.

The founder&#x27;s grandsons Alan Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury) and Sir Robert Sainsbury became joint managing directors in 1938, after their father, John Benjamin Sainsbury, had a minor heart attack.
In the Second World War, many of the men who worked for Sainsbury&#x27;s were called to perform National Service and were replaced by women. The war was a difficult time for Sainsbury&#x27;s, as most of its shops were trading in the London area and were bombed or damaged. Turnover fell to half the prewar level. Food was rationed, and one particular shop in East Grinstead was so badly damaged on Friday 9 July 1943 that it had to move to the local church, temporarily, while a new one was built. This shop was not completed until 1951.

===Self-service and heyday (1956–1991)===
In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sainsbury&#x27;s was a keen early adopter of self-service supermarkets in the United Kingdom. On a trip to the United States, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of self-service shops and believed the future of Sainsbury&#x27;s was self-service supermarkets of , with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience. The first self-service branch opened in Croydon in 1950.

Sainsbury&#x27;s was a pioneer in the development of own-brand goods; the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price. It expanded more cautiously than Tesco, shunning acquisitions, and it never offered trading stamps.

Until the company went public on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, the company was wholly owned by the Sainsbury family. It was at the time the largest ever flotation on the London Stock Exchange; the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible. A million shares were set aside for staff, which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value. Within one minute the list of applications was closed: £495 million had been offered for £14.5 million available shares. The Sainsbury family at the time retained 85% of the firm&#x27;s shares.

Most of the senior positions were held by family members. John Davan Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover), a member of the fourth generation of the founding family, took over the chairmanship from his uncle Sir Robert Sainsbury in 1969, who had been chairman for two years from 1967 following Alan Sainsbury&#x27;s retirement.

Sainsbury&#x27;s started to replace its High Street shops with self-service supermarkets above , which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres. Sainsbury&#x27;s policy was to invest in uniform, well designed shops with a strong emphasis on quality; its slogan was &quot;good food costs less at Sainsbury&#x27;s&quot;. During the 1970s, the average size of Sainsbury&#x27;s shops rose from to around ; the first edge of town shop, with of selling space, was opened at Coldhams Lane in Cambridge in 1974. The last counter service branch closed in Peckham in 1982. To participate in the hypermarket sector, Sainsbury&#x27;s formed a joint venture, known as SavaCentre, with British Home Stores. The first SavaCentre shop was opened in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in 1977; nearly half the space, amounting to some , was devoted to textiles, electrical goods and hardware. As the hypermarket format became more mainstream, with rivals such as Asda and Tesco launching ever larger shops, it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed, and the shops were converted to the regular Sainsbury&#x27;s superstore format in September 1999.

Sainsbury&#x27;s diversified further in 1979, forming a joint venture with the Belgian retailer, GB-Inno-BM, to set up a chain of do-it-yourself shops under the Homebase name. Sainsbury&#x27;s also trebled the size of its Homebase do it yourself business during 1996, by merging its business with Texas Homecare, which it acquired in January 1995 from Ladbroke for £290 million. Sainsbury&#x27;s sold the Homebase chain in December 2000, in a twofold deal worth £969 million. Sales of the stores to Schroder Ventures generated £750 million and sale of 28 development sites, which had been earmarked for future Homebase shops, were sold for £219 million to rival B&amp;Q&#x27;s parent company, Kingfisher plc. During the 1980s, the company invested in new technology: the proportion of sales passing through EPOS scanning checkouts rose from 1% to 90%.

In November 1983, Sainsbury&#x27;s purchased 21% of Shaw&#x27;s Supermarkets, the second largest retailer of groceries in the northeastern United States (primarily in New England). In June 1987, Sainsbury&#x27;s acquired the rest of the company.

In 1985, the chairman reported that over the preceding 10 years profits had grown from £15 million to over £168 million, a compound annual rise of 30.4% – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of 17.6%. In 1991, the Sainsbury&#x27;s group boasted a twelve-year record of dividend increases, of 20% or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long. Also in 1991, the company raised £489 million, in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores.

With the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the 1980s, Sainsbury&#x27;s was one of the many big retail names to open new shops in such complexes – notably with its shop at the Meadowhall Shopping Centre, Sheffield (originally as a SavaCentre) in 1990, and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, which opened in September 1989.

Sainsbury&#x27;s expanded into Scotland in 1992 with a shop in Darnley (the SavaCentre at Cameron Toll in Edinburgh had opened in 1984). In June 1995, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced its intention to move into the Northern Ireland market, until that point dominated by local companies. Between December 1996 and December 1998, the company opened seven shops. Two others at Sprucefield, Lisburn, and Holywood Exchange, Belfast would not open until 2003, due to protracted legal challenges. While Sainsbury&#x27;s outlets in Northern Ireland were all new developments, Tesco (apart from one Tesco Metro) instead purchased existing chains from Associated British Foods (see Tesco Ireland).

===Decline (1992–1998)===
In 1992, the long time CEO John Davan Sainsbury retired, and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin, David Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury of Turville); this brought about a change in management style – David was more consensual and less hierarchical, but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the company&#x27;s place in the market.

Mistakes by David Sainsbury and his successors, Dino Adriano and Peter Davis, included the rejection of loyalty cards, the reluctance to move into non-food retailing, the indecision between whether to go for quality or for value, &quot;the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers&quot; which led to suppliers favouring Tesco over Sainsbury&#x27;s, and an unsuccessful advertising campaign fronted by John Cleese.

At the end of 1993, it announced price cuts on three hundred of its most popular own label lines. Significantly, this came three months after Tesco had launched its line &quot;Tesco Value&quot;. A few months later, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced that margins had fallen, that the pace of new superstores construction would slow down, and that it would write down the value of some of its properties.

In 1994, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced a new town centre format, Sainsbury&#x27;s Central, again a response to Tesco&#x27;s Metro, which was already established in five locations. Also in 1994, Sainsbury&#x27;s lost the takeover battle for William Low (like Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s had long been under-represented in Scotland). Also that year, David Sainsbury dismissed Tesco&#x27;s clubcard initiative as &#x27;an electronic version of Green Shield Stamps&#x27;; the company was soon forced to backtrack, introducing its own Reward Card eighteen months later.

For much of the 20th century, Sainsbury&#x27;s had been the market leader in the supermarket sector in the United Kingdom, but in 1995, it lost this position to Tesco. Some new ventures were successful, notably the launch of a retail bank, Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank, in partnership with Bank of Scotland.

In addition to Shaw&#x27;s, Sainsbury&#x27;s bought a minority stake in another supermarket group, Giant Food, based in Washington, DC, although this shareholding was subsequently sold when Ahold of the Netherlands made a full bid for the company.

An arrangement in late 1995 with Supermarket Direct made Sainsbury&#x27;s the first major grocery retailer in the UK to offer a home delivery service.

In May 1996, the company reported its first fall in profits for 22 years. David Sainsbury announced management changes, involving the appointment of two chief executives, one in charge of supermarkets within the United Kingdom (Dino Adriano) and the other responsible for Homebase, and the United States (David Bremner). Finally, in 1998, David Sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics. He was succeeded as non executive chairman by George Bull, who had been chairman of Diageo, and Adriano was promoted to be group chief executive.

===Brand relaunch (1999–2003)===

In June 1999, Sainsbury&#x27;s unveiled its new corporate identity. This was developed by 20/20 Design and Strategy, and included

*the current company logo, 
*new corporate colours of &quot;living orange&quot; and blue,
*Interstate as the company&#x27;s new general use font, replacing the old all-uppercase font, and 
*new slogan &quot;Making life taste better&quot;, created by M&amp;C Saatchi, which replaced its old slogan from the 1960s,
* new staff uniforms.

The strapline was dropped in May 2005, and replaced in September of that year by &quot;Try something new today.&quot; This new brand statement was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO. While the Interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years, the company introduced another informal font in 2005, which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature.

In 1999, Sainsbury&#x27;s acquired an 80.1% share of Egyptian Distribution Group SAE, a retailer in Egypt with one hundred shops and 2,000 employees. However, poor profitability led to the sale of this share in April 2001. On 8 October 1999, the CEO Dino Adriano lost control of the core supermarket business within the United Kingdom, instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group. David Bremner became head of the supermarkets in the United Kingdom. This was &quot;derided&quot; by the city and described as a &quot;fudge&quot;. On 14 January 2000 Sainsbury&#x27;s reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of Adriano by Sir Peter Davis effective from March. Davis was CEO between 2000 and 2004, with his appointment well received by investors and analysts.

In his first two years, he exceeded profit targets, although by 2004 the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the groceries market within the United Kingdom. Davis also oversaw an almost £3 billion upgrade of shops, distribution and IT equipment, entitled &#x27;Business Transformation Programme&#x27;, but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability. Part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots, which at £100 million each cost four times more than standard depots.

In 2001, Sainsbury&#x27;s moved into its current headquarters at Holborn, London. Sainsbury&#x27;s previously occupied Stamford House and twelve other buildings around Southwark. The accounting department remained separate at Streatham. The building was designed by architectural firm Foster and Partners, and had been developed on the former Mirror Group site for Andersen Consulting (now Accenture); Sainsbury&#x27;s acquired the 25-year lease when Accenture pulled out.

Sainsbury&#x27;s was a founding member of the Nectar loyalty card scheme, which was launched in September 2002, in conjunction with Debenhams, Barclaycard and BP; Debenhams, Barclaycard and BP have all subsequently left the scheme, although until the chain&#x27;s demise Nectar points continued to be awarded for online purchases at Debenhams made through the Nectar app. The Nectar scheme replaced the Sainsbury&#x27;s Reward Card; accrued points were transferred over.

In January 2003, Wm Morrison Supermarkets (trading as Morrisons) made an offer for the Safeway group, prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets. The Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, referred the various bids to the Competition Commission, which reported its findings on 26 September. The Commission found that all bids, with the exception of Morrison&#x27;s, would &quot;operate against the public interest&quot;. As part of the approval Morrison&#x27;s was to dispose of 53 of the combined group&#x27;s shops.

In May 2004, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced that it would acquire fourteen of these shops, thirteen Safeway shops and one Morrison&#x27;s outlet, located primarily in the Midlands and the North of England.

===&#x27;Making Sainsbury&#x27;s Great Again&#x27; (2004–2006)===
At the end of March 2004, Davis was promoted to chairman and was replaced as CEO by Justin King. King joined Sainsbury&#x27;s from Marks &amp; Spencer where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and Kings Super Markets, Inc. subsidiary in the United States. Schooled in Solihull near Birmingham, and a graduate of the University of Bath, where he took a business administration degree, King was also previously a managing director at Asda with responsibility for hypermarkets.

In June 2004, Davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt, over his salary and bonuses. Investors were angered by a bonus share award of over £2 million, despite poor company performance. On 19 July 2004, Davis&#x27; replacement Philip Hampton, was appointed as chairman.

King ordered a direct mail campaign to one million Sainsbury&#x27;s customers as part of his six-month business review, asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve. This reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts: the group was not ensuring that shelves were fully stocked, due to the failure of the IT systems introduced by Peter Davis.

On 19 October 2004, King unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the company&#x27;s fortunes, in a three-year recovery plan entitled &#x27;Making Sainsbury&#x27;s Great Again&#x27;.

This was generally well received by both the stock market and the media. Immediate plans included laying off over 750 headquarters staff, and the recruitment of around 3,000 shop floor staff, to improve the quality of service and address the firm&#x27;s main problem: stock availability. The aim would be to increase sales revenue by £2.5 billion by the financial year ending March 2008. Another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality.

King hired Lawrence Christensen as supply chain director in 2004. Previously he was an expert in logistics at Safeway, but left following its takeover by Morrisons. Immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres. At the time of the business review on 19 October 2004, referring to the availability problems, Justin King said &quot;Lawrence hadn&#x27;t seen anything that he hadn&#x27;t seen before. He just hadn&#x27;t seen them all in the same place at the same time&quot;.

In 2006, Christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by Davis, saying &quot;not a single day went by without one, if not all of them, breaking down... The systems were flawed. They have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance. But because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up. It was a vicious circle.&quot; Christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once, rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others.

In 2007, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced a further £12 million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots. In addition, it did a deal with IBM to upgrade its Electronic Point of Sale systems as a result of increased sales.

Sainsbury&#x27;s sold its subsidiary in America, Shaw&#x27;s, to Albertsons in March 2004. Also in 2004 Sainsbury&#x27;s expanded its share of the convenience shop market through acquisitions.

After the launch of King&#x27;s recovery programme, the company reported nineteen consecutive quarters of sales growth, most recently in October 2009. Early sales increases were credited to solving problems with the company&#x27;s distribution system. Later sales improvements were put down to price cuts and the company&#x27;s focus on fresh and healthy food.

===Takeover bids (2007)===
On 2 February 2007, after months of speculation about a private equity bid, CVC Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Blackstone Group announced that they were considering a bid for Sainsbury&#x27;s. The consortium grew to include Goldman Sachs and Texas Pacific Group. On 6 March 2007, with a formal bid yet to be tabled, the Takeover Panel issued a bid deadline of 13 April.

On 4 April, KKR left the consortium to focus on its bid for Alliance Boots. On 5 April, the consortium submitted an &quot;indicative offer&quot; of 562p a share to the company&#x27;s board. After discussions between Sir Philip Hampton and the two largest Sainsbury family shareholders Lord Sainsbury of Turville and Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover the offer was rejected. On 9 April, the indicative offer was raised to 582p a share, however this too was rejected. This meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid, most importantly 75% shareholder support; the combined Sainsbury family holding at the time was 18%.

Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who then held 7.75% of Sainsbury&#x27;s, stated that he could see no reason why the Sainsbury&#x27;s board would even consider opening its books for due diligence for anything less than 600p per share. Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price. He believed any offer at that stage of Sainsbury&#x27;s recovery was likely to undervalue the business, and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, saw no reason to sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors. He claimed the bid &#x27;brought nothing to the business&#x27;, and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long term, which would have an adverse effect on Sainsbury&#x27;s stakeholders. On 11 April, the CVC-led consortium abandoned its offer, stating that &quot;it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer.&quot;

In May 2007, Sainsbury&#x27;s identified five areas of growth: Growth of non-food ranges; opening of new convenience shops and growth of online home delivery and banking operations; Expansion of supermarket space through new shops and development of the company&#x27;s &quot;largely underdeveloped shop portfolio&quot;; and &quot;active property management&quot;.

On 25 April 2007, Delta Two, a Qatari investment company, bought a 14% stake in Sainsbury&#x27;s causing its share price to rise 7.17%, and then increased its holding to 17.6%. Its interest in Sainsbury&#x27;s is thought to centre on its property portfolio. It increased its stake to 25% in June 2007. On 18 July 2007, BBC News reported that Delta Two had tabled a conditional bid proposal. Paul Taylor, the principal of Delta Two, flew David and John Sainsbury to Sardinia to reveal and discuss the potential bid which amounted to 600p per share.

The family had reservations about the price of the bid. They were also concerned about the proposed structure, which involved splitting the business into an operating company and a highly leveraged property company. They were additionally concerned about adequacy of funding, both for the bid and for the company&#x27;s pension scheme. On 5 November 2007, it was announced Delta Two had abandoned its takeover bid due to the &quot;deterioration of credit markets&quot; and concerns about funding the company&#x27;s pension scheme.

===Administrative changes===

In January 2008, Sainsbury&#x27;s brought the number of its supermarkets in Northern Ireland to eleven, with the purchase of two Curley&#x27;s Supermarkets in Dungannon and Belfast.

In November 2007, Sainsbury&#x27;s centralised its HR department, relocating to the 17th and 18th floors of the Manchester Arndale Centre to form a Shared Service Centre, which was initially trialled to deal with Recruitment in Scotland and was later rolled out to the whole of the United Kingdom. July 2009 saw the HR Shared Service Centre in Manchester expand to include most HR Processes in its Colleague Administration Department and Occupational Health enquiries in a dedicated unit.

Since April 2012, the centre has begun a gradual relocation to its new offices in the centre of Lincoln, along with a rebrand as Sainsbury&#x27;s HR Services.

===Developing business (2009–2016)===
In March 2009, Sainsbury&#x27;s reached an agreement to buy 24 shops from The Co-operative Group, 22 of which were Somerfield shops, which the group was required to sell as a condition of its takeover of Somerfield. A further nine shops were purchased from The Co-operative Group in June 2009. These were concentrated in West Wales, the North of England and Scotland, where Sainsbury&#x27;s market share is low.

In May 2010, Sainsbury&#x27;s confirmed a multimillion-pound deal with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) to be the main sponsor of the 2012 Paralympic Games. Under the deal, Sainsbury&#x27;s sold Paralympic merchandise and became involved in high-profile events, such as the torch relay. It became one of only two sponsors able to take advantage of the limited branding allowed within the Games. The promotional rights did not extend to the Olympics. After the Paralympic Games, the company decided to sponsor the British Paralympic Association through to Rio 2016.

On 30 November 2011, Sainsbury&#x27;s reached the first milestone in its &quot;Vision for 2020&quot;, by opening its thousandth self-service shop in Irvine, Scotland. To celebrate this, Sainsbury&#x27;s doubled its staff discount to 20% for the first four days of December. In January 2014, Sainsbury&#x27;s completed the purchase of the 50% share in Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank, owned by Lloyds Banking Group.

In July 2014, the company began powering one of its shops by converting food waste into bio methane gas to generate electricity. The group became the first retailer to come off the National Grid by its own means. In July 2016, Arcus FM extended its facilities management contract with Sainsbury&#x27;s, securing a ten-year renewal. Arcus won the initial contract in 2009, and saw the contract extended in 2011.

===Multi-channel retailer and restructuring (2016–present)===
After a four-month pursuit, in April 2016 Home Retail Group agreed to be taken over by Sainsbury&#x27;s for £1.4 billion. Sainsbury&#x27;s completed the acquisition in September 2016. The deal included catalogue chain Argos and furnishing retailer Habitat. As a result, the new Sainsbury&#x27;s group was organised into four divisions: the core Sainsbury&#x27;s food retail business; General Merchandising (including Argos) &amp; TU Clothing; Financial Services (Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank and Argos financial services businesses); and various property investments.

Throughout 2016 and 2017 Sainsbury&#x27;s pursued expansion of its multi-channel strategy, increasing the number of groceries Click and Collect points and online fulfilment locations to serve its online delivery network including opening a dark store in Bromley by Bow to serve the London area, increasing geographical coverage of its same-day groceries delivery network and integrating concessions into its shops such as Argos, Habitat, Timpson&#x27;s and Starbucks.

In November 2016, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced its intention to cut £500 million of costs from its business. In March 2017 400 jobs were cut and 4,000 jobs were re-organized, mainly affecting employees in night shift and commercial operation (cash office and price control) roles.

In August 2017, 1000 jobs were cut throughout all of its Head Office and support centres, affecting a variety of functions.

In October 2017, changes to security contracts meant that provider Mitie reduced the number of security officers within shops. In the same month Sainsbury&#x27;s announced plans to axe all shop-based Human Resource employees, including HR managers, payroll clerks, administration clerks and Learning and Development managers, overall affecting 1400 jobs. Additionally another 600 jobs at its Head Offices were cut.

In January 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced proposals to overhaul shop management structures which would result in job losses &#x27;in the thousands&#x27;.

On 1 February 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced the purchase of Nectar from AIMIA for £60 million; this gave full control of all Nectar data to Sainsbury&#x27;s.

In March 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced that it would be increasing the base rate of pay for its staff to retain the best workers. It said it would increase pay by 15% in the year, spending an extra £100 million on a plan that would also simplify the number of job roles.

In April 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s entered talks with Walmart about a proposed merger with Asda, which, if approved, could have formed the largest UK supermarket company. Under the proposal, Walmart would have owned 42% of the group, with day-to-day operations being led by the chief executive of Sainsbury&#x27;s at the time, Mike Coupe. The group also outlined plans to open branches of Argos within Asda shops. However, the Competition and Markets Authority (the UK&#x27;s regulator on anti-competitive practices) said in February 2019 that it could block the merger. On 25 April 2019, the Competition and Markets Authority blocked the merger and it was abandoned by Sainsbury&#x27;s.

In November 2020, Sainsbury&#x27;s stated that up to 3,500 jobs were at risk due to the closure of supermarket counters and the closure of further Argos standalone stores. In March 2021, the group announced further restructuring with the loss of 1150 head office and warehousing roles. Office sites Victoria and Saffron House in London, as well as Walsgrave in Coventry, were closed; office space was reduced at other sites at Milton Keynes, Coventry, London and Manchester. The restructure also included the closure of the company&#x27;s only online fulfilment centre in Bromley-by-Bow, London; with online orders instead being fulfilled by nearby stores with online fulfilment capabilities The group reported a £261 million loss in April 2021, citing £485 million of investment in &#x27;additional safety measures&#x27; in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, additional staffing costs and additional staff bonuses. The group&#x27;s financial results included the one-off costs of announced restructuring as well as writedowns of its estate valuations and banking assets. The group&#x27;s new CEO Simon Roberts has started to focus the grocery business on a &#x27;food first strategy&#x27;; the company&#x27;s slogan changed in May 2021 and an advertising campaign followed promoting healthier eating choices and sustainable food, designed to complement the company&#x27;s partnership of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference being held in the UK.

On 31 October 2024, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced the sale of its Argos Financial Services cards portfolio to NewDay Group for £720 million ($934 million) as part of its plan to concentrate on its main retail operations.

== Leaders ==
== Shops ==
In March 2019, Sainsbury&#x27;s shop portfolio was as follows:

It is particularly strong in London and the South-East, where it is based, and has powerful positions within many UK cities. The company acquired the Midlands-based firm Thoroughgood in the 1930s. Expansion since 1945 has given the company national reach, although the chain is not as well-represented in Scotland as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons.

=== Supermarkets ===

On 29 September 2010, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened one of its largest UK shops, an extension of its existing shop in Crayford, South East London, which now has over of retail space and is its largest supermarket to be built in the UK. Bybrook Superstore in Ashford, Kent, which reopened on 16 November 2011 has over .

The refurbished Lincoln, Lincolnshire shop opened on 24 November 2010, making it the UK&#x27;s second-largest Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket after Crayford at .

Shops in the &#x27;supermarket&#x27; category all have similar layouts and operations but may vary in their choice of range to the customer. Most will have a convenience kiosk for cigarette sales and refunds/exchanges, produce, meat, fish, groceries and frozen food, plus staffed and self-service checkouts. However depending on the size of the premises, they may also have an in-shop bakery, pizza counter, a cafe or Fresh Kitchen, Tu clothing, general merchandise with some stores having an on-site Argos and / or petrol station along with an online picking department. Some shops also feature concessions such as a beauty hall, travel agents, Jessops, Patisserie Valerie, Specsavers, Carte D&#x27;or and Ben and Jerry&#x27;s ice cream stands, Zizzi pizza counters, Sushi Gourmet counters, and The Fragrance Shop. Others also feature a &quot;Centre for Dentistry&quot; where dental treatments are offered and/or an &quot;Explore Learning&quot; centre where children are offered extra English and Maths tuition. Some shops also feature a Starbucks café instead of a Sainsbury&#x27;s branded cafe.

In March 2020, due to the declaration of the UK lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the panic buying that followed nationwide as a result, Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarkets allowed shoppers to buy no more than three of each food item, to ensure all visitors have access to the products they need.

==== Sainsbury&#x27;s Fuel ====
Sainsbury&#x27;s operates a chain of fuel forecourts located at some of its supermarkets selling diesel, petrol and City Diesel. The chain first opened a forecourt in 1974 at its Croydon SavaCentre hypermarket, the forecourts were initially supplied by and marketed as Jet stations. However, from 1980 onwards Sainsbury&#x27;s operated its own forecourts and sourced its own fuel. In 2004, BP became the supplier of fuel and operated its forecourts at supermarkets where possible. This deal ended in 2009 and operation of all forecourts and fuel sourcing returned to the control of Sainsbury&#x27;s.

==== Sainsbury&#x27;s Café ====
Several shops operate self-service cafés, marketed as Sainsbury&#x27;s Café, of which most are open for the same hours as the supermarket itself. In 2022, 200 of these cafes were closed which placed 2,000 jobs at risk. In January 2025, Sainsbury&#x27;s confirmed that it would be closing its final 61 cafes, subject to consultation. The supermarket stated that the decision was an effort to reduce expenses in anticipation of a £140 million increase in costs resulting from upcoming budget tax measures set to take effect within weeks.

=== Sainsbury&#x27;s Local Stores ===
As well as developing its own sites, Sainsbury&#x27;s expanded its convenience portfolio through acquisitions of Bell&#x27;s Stores, Jackson&#x27;s Stores, JB Beaumont and SL Shaw Ltd. Sainsbury&#x27;s initially retained the strong Bells, Jacksons and Beaumont branding. For example, refurbished shops were called &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s at Bells&quot;. These were effectively Sainsbury&#x27;s Local shops with a revised fascia, retaining some features of the former local chain. Unrefurbished shops retained the original brand and logo, but still offered Sainsbury&#x27;s own brand products, pricing and some point of sale; however they did not accept Nectar cards to collect points. The old websites were also retained with some Sainsbury&#x27;s branding. However, all of these acquired shops were fully converted to the Sainsbury&#x27;s Local fascia from 4 May 2007.

In July 2013, chief executive Justin King announced plans to focus on expanding its convenience shops.

=== Sainsbury&#x27;s Online ===
Sainsbury&#x27;s operates an internet shopping service branded as &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s Online&quot;. It offers a wide range of other products, including electronic goods, books and financial services. To use this service customers choose their groceries online, or by phone (which includes a &quot;phone order&quot; fee). Sainsbury&#x27;s also provide the Sainsbury&#x27;s Gift Cards and Sainsbury&#x27;s Business Direct transactional websites that sell gift cards, gift vouchers and food tokens with credit or value that can be spent at any Sainsbury shop. Usage of these products is restricted, with either one not valid for buying certain products or services. The Gift Card website promotes the card as an ideal gift due to the large range of products and the number of shops available to spend them in. The Business Direct website, operated by MBL Solutions Ltd, promotes the cards as ideal for rewarding and motivating employees.

Sainsbury&#x27;s started e-commerce home delivery operations in 1995 when it introduced ‘Wine Direct&#x27; for internet wine sales. In 1996, on Monday 30 December it was announced that Sainsbury&#x27;s has joined forces with Hewlett-Packard for the development of an Internet-based supermarket offering a full range of products. The new, digital supermarket was expected to be launched in March 1997.

On 22 November 1999, Sainsbury&#x27;s started e-business in partnership with LineOne.

=== Distribution ===

== Subsidiaries ==
=== Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank ===

In 1997, Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank was established – a joint venture between J Sainsbury plc and the Bank of Scotland, later a part of the Lloyds Banking Group. Services offered include car, life, home, pet and travel insurance as well as health cover, loans, credit cards, savings accounts and individual savings accounts. On 8 May 2013, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced it would buy the 50% share in the business owned by Lloyds Banking Group. In October 2024, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced the sale of its personal loans, credit Cards and savings business to National Westminster plc, with an expected completion by Q1 2025.

=== Sainsbury&#x27;s Energy ===
Founded in 2011, Sainsbury&#x27;s Energy is a virtual utility provider in partnership with nPower who offer gas and electricity. Sainsbury&#x27;s no longer have face-to-face salespersons in-shop but there are leaflets and posters etc. advertising Sainsbury&#x27;s Energy in its supermarkets. Sainsbury&#x27;s Energy was previously supplied by British Gas; the agreement ended in 2019 with nPower commencing supply from February. nPower in November 2019 was acquired by E.On Group as part of the acquisition of Innogy which led to E.On Next being the supplier for Sainsbury&#x27;s Energy as of July 2020.

=== Argos ===

The company was founded in 1972 and its Green Shield Stamps catalogue shops were rebranded as &quot;Argos&quot; beginning in July 1974.

=== Habitat ===

Habitat is a furniture store, it was acquired by Sainsbury&#x27;s in 2019, all standalone shops closed and now the brand soley exists as a replacement for Sainsbury&#x27;s home in their supermarkets. Its larger sets of furniture are now provided by Argos, another one of Sainsbury&#x27;s brands.

== Former formats and ventures ==
;Sainsbury&#x27;s Freezer Centres
Sainsbury&#x27;s Freezer Centres were a frozen food chain operated between 1974 and 1986, the shops were entirely dedicated to frozen food. Due to competition from specialist frozen food chains such as Bejam, Sainsbury&#x27;s converted its original service shops that were too small for modern use to small frozen specialist shops. The first shop opened at Southbourne near Bournemouth in 1974. Only 11% of households at that time owned freezers. Nine other branches that followed suit in that year, however, had greater success. They sold about 3,000 lines, many with deep discounts. The chain expanded to 21 shops at its height. As freezers became more popular, frozen food departments were designed into Sainsbury&#x27;s main supermarkets, and the chain was sold to Bejam in 1986, who were ultimately sold to Iceland in 1989.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s SavaCentre

SavaCentre was a chain of 13 hypermarkets and 7 discount supermarkets operated between 1977 and 2005, initially in a joint venture with BHS. The shops ranged in size between and , and the discount supermarkets between and . At the time of its inception it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. Shop layout consisted of a 50:50 split between food and non-food shopping, with a complete range of both retailers&#x27; products, and later included input from Habitat and Mothercare as they merged with BHS. Some shops also included features such as a petrol station and in-shop cafe. In 1989 Sainsbury&#x27;s bought out BHS&#x27;s stake, but still allowed BHS to retail from SavaCentres until it offered its own clothing and merchandise offering.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Calais Wine Shop
Sainsbury&#x27;s operated one alcohol hypermarket in partnership with Auchan in Calais, France for the lucrative UK booze cruise market. The shop closed in 2010 after describing the operation as &#x27;economically unviable&#x27;.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Market
In 2002, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened an experimental shop in the Bluebird Building in Chelsea, London. The concept of the &#x27;Market&#x27; shop was to provide a large range of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen items and bread through staff serving over counters. Staff were specially hired for their skill and passion for their roles in-shop. The layout also provided a larger than usual area for retailing fresh produce. The shop closed in 2004 after poor results. A second, much larger version in Pimlico was designated as a &#x27;Market&#x27; shop, but the shop&#x27;s branding and layout was gradually reverted to a standard Sainsbury&#x27;s shop.

;Fresh Kitchen
In 2011, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened a trial food to go shop in Fleet Street London selling sandwiches, baguettes and hot snacks in an effort to expand its business into new areas of opportunity. The shop closed a year later, after the shop&#x27;s lease was not renewed. Sainsbury&#x27;s commented that footfall was too high to offer high standards of quality and service however it was not ruling out performing another trial in another location, explaining that it had learnt a lot. In 2020, Sainsbury&#x27;s began to rebrand some in-store cafés to &quot; Fresh Kitchen&quot;.

;Mobile by Sainsbury&#x27;s

Sainsbury&#x27;s operated a virtual mobile network from 2001 until 2003 which closed due to being commercially unsustainable. In 2013 Sainsbury&#x27;s re-entered the UK telecommunications industry when it launched a mobile phone network called Mobile by Sainsbury&#x27;s. The virtual network was operated in partnership with Vodafone. The network was promoted heavily in-shop and most supermarkets started retailing SIM cards and handsets for the network. However, in 2015 Sainsbury&#x27;s announced that the service would be closing in January 2016 after a breakdown in the relationship with its provider Vodafone.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Compare and Save
Sainsbury&#x27;s Compare and Save was a comparison and switching service website that promoted a wide range of television, broadband and telephone deals from a variety of providers. The service, free to Sainsbury&#x27;s customers, claimed to list 15,000 different packages. The website and service launched in 2008 and was operated by SimplifyDigital.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Pharmacy
Sainsbury&#x27;s operated 270 pharmacies within its supermarkets. Sainsbury&#x27;s also operated pharmacies at three major UK hospitals: Guy&#x27;s Hospital, St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and James Cook University Hospital. In July 2015 Sainsbury&#x27;s announced it was selling its 281 pharmacies to Lloydspharmacy for £125 million with all 2,500 pharmacy employees being transferred and new rent agreements being made. In June 2023, Lloyds Pharmacy announced that all Lloyds Pharmacies within Sainsbury&#x27;s stores would close.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Entertainment
Sainsbury&#x27;s Entertainment was a transactional website which provided films as downloads or for streaming, using Rovi Corporation software. The site arranged to register with ATVOD as a video on demand service. The website also sold MP3 downloads as well as eBooks through aNobii. The site began operating in 2010 and until March 2014 also sold physical products including DVDs, CDs, Blu-ray discs and books. These were posted to the customer by a distributor, which after 2011 was Sainsbury&#x27;s subsidiary company: Global Media Vault Ltd. Customers received nectar points from shopping at Sainsbury&#x27;s Entertainment. Sainsbury&#x27;s announced in September 2016 that it would close the business on 30 November 2016.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Welcome Break Partnership

In 2006, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened a Convenience store at Birchanger Green services, operated by owners Welcome Break.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Euro Garages Partnership 
Sainsbury&#x27;s trialed franchising its convenience store format to Euro Garages who planned to operate six small stores within its service stations, replacing some of its hundreds of SPAR stores, the first time Sainsbury&#x27;s has trusted a third party to operate a Sainsbury&#x27;s store since 2006. Beginning in Blackburn in 2016 Sainsbury&#x27;s re-trained EuroGarages staff of 15 to operate the convenience store and later followed with stores in Heathrow and Bury. In February 2018 Sainsbury&#x27;s issued a statement calling a mutual end to the trial: &quot;following a commercial review, a joint decision has been made to bring the trial to a close.&quot; In 2019, the partnership was continued with a new format called &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s on the Go&quot; aimed at travellers, carrying travel and snack products. These stores were opened in spaces at former Little Chef restaurants and in the petrol stations, replacing SPAR. In October 2020, the Issa Brothers bought ASDA and rebranded some stores to &quot;ASDA on the Move&quot; and the ones in the former Little Chef restaurants to SPAR. Few stores remain in the petrol stations, waiting for a rebrand whilst others in the former restaurants are now empty.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Club Store
Not to be confused with SavaCentre stores, this was a one-off store at Castle Court in Bristol, designed purely to satisfy an existing planning requirement. Shoppers were only allowed to enter the store if registered members and resident within a 20 mile radius. This was due to having been opened by wholesaler Nurdin and Peacock (now part of Booker Group) in 1995 as a &#x27;Cargo Club&#x27; members only store similar in format to Costco. Within a year new planning permission was obtained and all membership and residence options were dropped, the store was renamed and has been a regular supermarket since.

== Marketing and branding ==
=== Shop fascias ===
The flagship supermarket in Greenwich, South London, first trialled a modern &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s&quot; look, leading to the term &#x27;Greenwich Blue&#x27;, which was used to describe the signature colour of new identity. After its success most supermarkets were refurbished with dark blue walls, bright orange wall panels and grey shelving, as well as new checkouts. Individual counters also had different, brightly coloured panels behind them. Gradually the format was rolled out across the entire Sainsbury&#x27;s estate. The &#x27;Greenwich Blue&#x27; look has been phased out and new supermarkets now have a fresher look. Old external signage bearing the &#x27;J Sainsbury&#x27; name was still to be found in use as recently as summer 2011 in Swindon, Ashbourne in Derbyshire and Blackheath, West Midlands.

=== Nectar loyalty card ===

Sainsbury&#x27;s was a founding member of the UK&#x27;s largest retail loyalty scheme, called &#x27;Nectar&#x27;, in 2002. The scheme allows customers to earn points on almost everything bought from Sainsbury&#x27;s as well as from other participating retailers in return for a large range of rewards. For every pound spent the customer earns 1 point - a reward equivalent to 0.5% of supermarket purchases. Since 2015 Sainsbury&#x27;s no longer offers 1 bonus point for every carrier bag the customers reuses.

From April 2015, Sainsbury&#x27;s halved the number of points that customers earned for every pound, to one point per pound. Sainsbury&#x27;s previously operated Sainsbury&#x27;s Reward Scheme between 1995 and 2002 where customers used &#x27;Reward Cards&#x27; or &#x27;Storecards&#x27; to earn and spend points in a similar way, but limited to Sainsbury&#x27;s businesses.

On 1 February 2018, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced that it had acquired all assets, staff, systems and licences required for the full and independent operation of the Nectar loyalty programme in the UK through the acquisition of the shares of Aimia Inc&#x27;s UK business for £60 million.

=== Sainsbury&#x27;s Active Kids ===
Until 2017, Sainsbury&#x27;s ran an annual voucher scheme for local organisations to redeem against equipment for sports and other activities. Customers earned vouchers from their shopping which they donated to an organisation of their choice, who then redeemed the vouchers with Sainsbury&#x27;s, crediting their account with points to spend on items from a catalogue.

=== Brand match ===
In 2011, Sainsbury&#x27;s introduced brand match which matched the prices of rival supermarke chains. In March 2014, it stopped matching prices with Tesco. In August 2015 it rolled out the match pricing online. In April 2016, it stopped the brand match completely, but still allowed customers to use the vouchers for two weeks after the offer closed. Tesco took Sainsbury&#x27;s brand match vouchers for two months after the offer finished.

=== Brand ambassadors ===
2000–2011: Jamie Oliver was the public face of Sainsbury&#x27;s, appearing on television and radio advertisements and in-shop promotional material. The deal earned him an estimated £1.2 million every year. In the first two years of these advertisements were estimated to have given Sainsbury&#x27;s an extra £1 billion of sales or £200 million gross profit.

2010–2017: Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds was a Sainsbury&#x27;s Active Kids ambassador.

2012–2014: Former footballer David Beckham was a Sainsbury&#x27;s Active Kids ambassador, in a deal that was claimed to be worth over £3.5 million.

=== Slogans ===

Over the years, Sainsbury&#x27;s has used many slogans:
* &quot;Quality perfect, Prices Lower&quot; – The slogan used on the shop-front of the Islington shop in 1882.
* &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s For Quality, Sainsbury&#x27;s For Value&quot; – Used from the early 20th century.
* &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s. Essentials for the Essentials.&quot; – Used from around 1993.
* &quot;Good Food Costs Less At Sainsbury&#x27;s&quot; – Used from the 1960s to the 1990s. Described by BBC News as &quot;probably the best-known advertising slogan in retailing.&quot;
* &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s – Everyone&#x27;s Favourite Ingredient&quot; – Used in a series of TV commercials in the 1990s which featured celebrities cooking Sainsbury&#x27;s food.
* &quot;Value to shout about&quot; – A 1998/1999 campaign fronted by John Cleese which was widely claimed to have been a major mistake. Sainsbury&#x27;s said it actually depressed sales. However, the company had been losing sales for years because of the rise of Tesco.
* &quot;Making Life Taste Better&quot; – Introduced in 1999 and used until May 2005.
* &quot;Try something new today&quot; – Introduced in September 2005 until September 2011.
* &quot;Value where it matters&quot; – Used in advertising from late 2010 until May 2011.
* &quot;Clothes You Can&#x27;t Wait To Wear&quot; – Used in all new advertising for TU Clothing as part of advertising campaign throughout May 2011.
* &quot;Live Well For Less&quot; – Introduced in September 2011 until February 2021 following an 18-month business review.
* &quot;Christmas is for Sharing&quot; – Used for all Sainsburys&#x27; Christmas adverts from 2013 to present.
* &quot;Here&#x27;s to Extraordinary&quot; – Used only throughout 2012 to promote sponsorship of the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
* &quot;Helping Everyone Eat Better&quot; – Introduced in February 2021 after being named Principal Supermarket Partner of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) summit in Glasgow.
* &quot;Good food for all of us&quot; – Launching in November 2023

Sainsbury&#x27;s was a sponsor of the Paralympic Summer Games in London 2012 and it was the largest sponsorship signing in the history of the Games.

=== Street name ===
When Sainsbury&#x27;s opened its new supermarket in Kingston upon Thames on part of the site of the former Kingston Power Station in the 2000s, a decision was made to name a new road leading to the supermarket &quot;Sury Basin&quot;, a pun on the name of &quot;Surrey&quot; (Kingston&#x27;s historic county) but in fact an anagram of the company&#x27;s name.

== Staffing ==
In 2010, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened seven food colleges that teach fishmongery, butchery, breadmaking and confectioning. 21,000 staff have been trained at these venues so far. Qualifications can be gained through training given in-house, and so far 15,400 staff have been awarded City and Guild qualifications.

&#x27;Our Sainsbury&#x27;s&#x27; is a social and information website for staff to use to access staff benefits and information, and to interact with other colleagues.

=== Employee relations ===
;Great Place to Work Group
Each supermarket or group of conveniences shops elects a group of &#x27;representatives&#x27; from across their shop or region to meet once a month to discuss the working life of their branch and the company. The meetings can include communication from Head Office, the chance to organise charity or local events and the opportunity for employee&#x27;s to discuss issues and feedback or question the attending Store Manager. The group controls a budget for donating to local charities and a budget for investing in employee facilities. The group was previously known as the &#x27;Colleague Council&#x27;, a separate version for young employees was called &#x27;Youth Forum&#x27; and another separate group called &#x27;SSA Council&#x27; existed to organise events in shops. A change in 2014 combined all three into &#x27;Great Place To Work Groups&#x27;. The shop groups are part of a national structure, meeting monthly at shops and depots, then monthly at a regional level and then finally at a national meeting less frequently. The shop level is chaired by Store Managers, regional level by a Store Manager and Regional Operations Manager and nationally by the Groups HR Director.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Staff Association
Sainsbury&#x27;s Staff Association was founded in 1947. It is owned and run by Sainsbury&#x27;s staff. All permanent staff can join at a cost of £1 every 28 days for one person (or £1.20 every 28 days for two people). The funds raised are collected into accounts in every shop, and spent on whatever the shop&#x27;s SSA staff wish, usually social events and experiences out of shop. Benefits also include further discounts with other retailers.

;Sainsbury&#x27;s Veterans Association
Sainsbury&#x27;s Veterans Association was started in 1947 by eight staff who wished all staff to stay in touch with each other. Today members enjoy a range of benefits including Honorary SSA membership, 10% discount, newsletters, invitation to an annual reunion, a visitor service, birthday and anniversary gifts, donation upon bereavement and transfer of benefits to spouse upon death. To qualify staff have to serve 25 years with the company at the time of their retirement or redundancy. The association&#x27;s current and former presidents have included former Sainsbury&#x27;s CEO and later Chairman Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover KG and former Sainsbury&#x27;s CEO Dino Adriano until his death.

==Controversy==

=== Animal welfare ===
Sainsbury&#x27;s supplies a vast majority of its meat from intensive farms, as such there is frequent reporting of animal abuse in its supply chains. In December 2021 footage emerged from an intensive chicken farm in the Sainsbury&#x27;s supply chain showing dead and wounded turkeys amongst living ones. The birds were confined to a large shed with no natural light.

In December 2023 animal rights activists secretly filmed at a duck farm in the Sainsbury&#x27;s supply chain. Workers were captured swinging ducks by their necks and slamming them into draws. The video showed insanitary sheds, with dead ducks piled up.

In February 2024, a BBC News investigation revealed 20% of chickens sold at Sainsbury&#x27;s had severe ammonia burns from living in excrement. They stated hock burn was &quot;a sign of poorer welfare on farms&quot;.

In March 2024, a farm in the Sainsbury&#x27;s supply chain was found to be keeping egg laying hens in &quot;appalling conditions&quot;. Footage showed injured and collapsed hens, a sick hen with a bloody head, many dead hens, prolapses, feather loss and poor &#x27;enrichment&#x27; facilities for the birds.

In April 2024, cameras were placed in a slaughterhouse that was processing pigs for Sainsbury&#x27;s. Footage showed workers hitting pigs in the face before they entered a carbon dioxide gas chamber to die. After the footage emerged, the RSPCA called for the government to end gas chamber killings.

=== VAT avoidance scheme ===
Prior to 2005, Sainsbury&#x27;s devised a scheme to avoid VAT by treating a 2.5% &quot;card transaction fee&quot; as exempt from the tax, although the total charged to the customer remained the same. HMRC used a test case against Debenhams to outlaw the practice in 2005.

===Kenyan worker conditions===
In 2006, anti-poverty charity War on Want investigated the production of cut flowers to supermarkets, and criticised the conditions faced by workers at Sainsbury&#x27;s Kenyan suppliers.

=== Dairy price fixing ===
In 2007, Sainsbury&#x27;s was fined £26 million for its involvement in a dairy product cartel.

===Fairtrade tea===
In May 2017, the supermarket was criticised by organisations including Oxfam for dropping its Fairtrade label from tea. They queried how Sainsbury&#x27;s own standards would be higher than those of Divine Chocolate, an ethical trading company part-owned by cocoa farmers in Ghana, said Sainsbury&#x27;s move was tipping the balance back in favour of retailers.

===Receipt scanning===

In 2022 Sainsbury&#x27;s began to introduce new security arrangements in some stores to reduce shoplifting. Customers are held within a barriered area and must scan their printed receipt on an optical scanner to open an automatic gate, before they are permitted to exit the store. The change has been criticised in the media for inconveniencing customers and presuming all customers to be potentially guilty of theft until they are able to prove their innocence. Sainsbury&#x27;s have stated that the new system was necessary following a 22% increase in shoplifting as a result of the cost-of-living crisis.

== Archive ==
Sainsbury&#x27;s archive of over 16,000 items relating to the business since its foundation is kept at the Museum of London. The archive contains documents, product packaging and advertising.

== Ownership ==
Ownership in February 2023 was as follows:
*Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) shareholding stood at 14.3% of the shares.
*Vesa Equity Investment, the vehicle of Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský&#x27;s shareholding, stood at 10% of the shares.
*Costcutter owner Bestway shareholding stood at 4.47% of the shares.

<doc id="169882" wikidata="Q4777387" url="?curid=169882" title="Ants of medical importance">
<text>Most ants are capable of biting, stinging, and spraying irritant chemicals. However, only relatively few species can harm humans; among which some can cause significant injury or, in rare cases, death. Like wasps, individual ants are capable of stinging multiple times as they do not lose their stingers.

==Fire ants==

The fire ants are a group of 20 species of New World ants which are reputed after their aggressiveness and painful stings. Four species are considered of relevant medical importance: &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;, &quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot;, &quot;Solenopsis geminata&quot;, and &quot;Solenopsis saevissima&quot;. The Red Imported Fire Ant &quot;S. invicta&quot; is the best studied among them, and reputed as the most dangerous species. &quot;S. invicta&quot; is expanding in range around the world and thus it is most often involved in medical emergencies. A person typically encounters problems with fire ants by inadvertently stepping onto one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the person&#x27;s legs, attacking &quot;en masse&quot;. The ants quickly respond to alarm pheromones that are released by the first disturbed ants, causing a swarm followed by aggressive stinging. Fire ant stings are typically accompanied by burning and urticaria, followed by a welt formation. The welts often develop into white pustules that should not be scratched, as to avoid secondary infections. A few individuals are sensitive to the venom, and can, on rare occasions, die of anaphylaxis. In a survey of 29,300 physicians in the United States of America (in 1989), reports of 83 fatalities were obtained. Some fire ant attacks on humans confined to beds have also been noted; in some locations, fire ants can be a particular threat in medical facilities since they can have nesting colonies inside human habitations.

It has been demonstrated that, whilst the burning sensation and pustule formation is an effect of the sting injecting insoluble venom alkaloids, the more serious allergic reactions are caused by venom protein allergens.

==Other species==

Apart from &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot; and &quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot;, serious allergic reactions are known from ants belonging to 6 different subfamilies (Formicinae, Myrmeciinae, Ponerinae, Ectatomminae, Myrmicinae, and Pseudomyrmecinae) and 10 genera (&quot;Solenopsis&quot;, &quot;Formica&quot;, &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, &quot;Tetramorium&quot;, &quot;Pogonomyrmex&quot;, &quot;Pachycondyla&quot;, &quot;Odontomachus&quot;, &quot;Rhytidoponera&quot;, &quot;Pseudomyrmex&quot;, and &quot;Hypoponera&quot;).

The Argentine ant, &quot;Linepithema humile&quot; is found in Argentina, Southern Europe, Southern US and California. They are small and are found in human habitations. They often kill other ant species. They have been noted as having the potential to carry pathogens in hospital environments.

The pharaoh ant, &quot;Monomorium pharaonis&quot; is found around the world. It is not known for its sting, but has been involved in respiratory allergies
Bulldog ants, from the genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, are native to Australia, with all but one of the ninety or so species found on the continent. Belonging to the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, they are among the most primitive extant ants in the world. This species is known to cause some fatalities in sensitive humans.
Bullet ants, from the genus &quot;Paraponera&quot;, are found from Nicaragua southward to the Amazon Basin. They are and close relatives of the genus &quot;Dinoponera&quot;, which are New World ponerines known for their painful stings.
Driver ants, from the genus &quot;Dorylus&quot;, are found in the Old World, especially West Africa and the Congo Basin. Unlike the army ants of the New World, Old World army ants have a functional sting but rarely use it, preferring their razor-sharp, falcate mandibles for defense instead. &quot;Dorylus&quot; spp. colonies also reach larger sizes than &quot;Eciton&quot;.

The &quot;Pogonomyrmex maricopa&quot;, found in Western US, are bright red myrmicine ants whose venom is the most potent of any ant species.

<doc id="169887" wikidata="Q324645" url="?curid=169887" title="Celtic Frost">
<text>Celtic Frost () was a Swiss heavy metal band from Zürich. They are remembered for their strong influence on the development of several metal subgenres, particularly extreme metal, and for their avant-garde approach to music in general.

In June 1984, guitarist and vocalist Thomas Gabriel Fischer and bassist Martin Eric Ain formed Celtic Frost after disbanding their previous band, Hellhammer, a month earlier. Celtic Frost&#x27;s debut record, &quot;Morbid Tales&quot;, was released in November of that year. This was followed by the full-length studio albums &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; (1985) and &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; (1987). All three records are considered highly influential landmarks in heavy metal. While each contains elements of avant-garde composition, &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; is particularly noted for its unique style and experimentation with musical boundaries beyond the heavy metal genre.

Celtic Frost&#x27;s next album, &quot;Cold Lake&quot; (1988), featured a new lineup and a dramatic stylistic shift, which was widely criticized for its commercial and flamboyant tone. After releasing &quot;Vanity/Nemesis&quot; (1990), the band temporarily disbanded. Celtic Frost re-formed in 2001 and released the critically acclaimed &quot;Monotheist&quot; (2006), eventually disbanding permanently following Fischer&#x27;s departure in 2008.

Throughout the band&#x27;s career, their music incorporated elements from various extreme metal styles. Their early work is often classified as thrash metal or black metal with experimental tendencies, while their final album is described as doom metal. Celtic Frost drew inspiration from early heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Venom, gothic rock acts like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Christian Death, and Joy Division, as well as hardcore punk groups like Discharge and GBH.

==History==
===Formation and first recordings (1984–1987)===
Celtic Frost&#x27;s frontman, guitarist, and singer, Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain – also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan base, was signed to Noise Records in Germany, and recorded their debut EP, &quot;Apocalyptic Raids&quot;, in March 1984.

Many metal-centered publications were skeptical of Hellhammer&#x27;s musical efforts. &quot;Metal Forces&quot; loathed the group, sparking a lasting feud between the zine and Warrior, which prevented Celtic Frost from performing in England for several years. Writers at &quot;Rock Power&quot; were similarly critical of Hellhammer, describing it as &quot;the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing &#x27;musicians&#x27; were ever allowed to record&quot;. In fact, they were &quot;receiving miserable reviews everywhere&quot;, Warrior concluded.

Reflecting on the impact of his first band, Fischer said:

Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost&#x27;s first two albums &quot;Morbid Tales&quot; and &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;, Hellhammer stayed with us almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had reconsidered our goals and conceived the Frost, HH&#x27;s remnants kept being significant obstacles in our path. Many people viewed Frost as simply a renamed version of the same band. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it nearly destroyed all our work and dreams.

By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut EP, &quot;Morbid Tales&quot;, was well received in the underground metal scene, and the band embarked on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed by the EP &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Return&quot;. Both of these early releases have since been packaged together and are available on a single CD.

The next of Celtic Frost&#x27;s influential recordings was 1985&#x27;s &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;, which did not feature Ain on bass, but instead used stand-in bassist Dominic Steiner. The cover artwork is a painting by H.R. Giger entitled &quot;Satan I&quot;, which Giger gifted to the band after corresponding with Fischer through the mail. The album was a major influence on the emerging genres of death metal and black metal. Ain rejoined the band after the album was recorded. 

===Stylistic changes, internal struggles, and first breakup (1987–1993)===

In 1987, Celtic Frost released their second full-length studio album, &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;. The album is noticeably eclectic compared to the band&#x27;s previous works, featuring love songs, industrial rhythmic pieces, symphonic and operatic influences, female vocal parts, and an unlikely cover of Wall of Voodoo&#x27;s &quot;Mexican Radio.&quot;

The album is often regarded as a unique departure from the band&#x27;s earlier material and helped solidify their description as an avant-garde band. It marks a shift away from the heavier, more direct style found on the band&#x27;s previous releases, &quot;Morbid Tales&quot; and &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;, although these albums also contained elements of experimentation and symphonic collaboration. &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; blends a heavy metal foundation with elements of industrial and gothic rock, and even includes an electronic body music-inspired rhythm, particularly evident in the song &quot;One in Their Pride.&quot; Despite this stylistic evolution, the album retains sparse elements of extreme metal, noticeable in Fischer&#x27;s vocals and guitar work.

During a North American tour, the band added a second guitarist, Ron Marks. However, shortly thereafter, financial difficulties, along with tensions between band members and their record label, led to a brief dissolution of the group. Six months later, Warrior reformed the band, with Stephen Priestly returning on drums, Oliver Amberg on guitars, and Curt Victor Bryant on bass. This lineup recorded the studio album &quot;Cold Lake&quot;, released in September 1988 by Noise Records. Despite being marketed to capitalize on the mass appeal of glam metal, the album was poorly received, failing to resonate with fans of the band&#x27;s extreme style.

Afterward, Bryant dismissed Amberg, leading to the return of former live guitarist Ron Marks for the recording of &quot;Vanity/Nemesis&quot; in 1990. Another significant change was the return of early bassist Martin Eric Ain. Despite these changes, Celtic Frost&#x27;s reputation never fully recovered from the backlash caused by &quot;Cold Lake&quot;. In 1992, the band&#x27;s label released a collection of rare recordings titled &quot;Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying&quot;, the title of which is derived from an ancient Roman prayer. This compilation featured unreleased material, re-recorded versions of older songs, and studio session tracks.

A final proposed album titled &quot;Under Apollyon&#x27;s Sun&quot; was never completed, although Fischer would later co-found a new group called Apollyon Sun.

===Post-breakup (1993–2001)=== 
Several years after Celtic Frost disbanded, Fischer co-founded a new group called Apollyon Sun with his friend Erol Unala on guitar. They recorded an EP, &quot;God Leaves (And Dies),&quot; and a full-length album, &quot;Sub&quot;. Although rooted in Celtic Frost&#x27;s more experimental sound, Apollyon Sun was an industrial metal project. During his hiatus from metal music, Fischer also completed an autobiographical book titled &quot;Are You Morbid?&quot;, which was published by London-based Sanctuary Publishing to fan acclaim in 2000.

===Reunion and &quot;Monotheist&quot; (2001–2008)=== 
In late 2001, Fischer and Ain began writing music together, with Unala on guitar and, soon after in 2002, Swiss drummer Franco Sesa. Their goal was to develop and record a new dark and heavy album. The completion of the project took longer than anticipated, partly due to the DIY nature of the project and its financing, but it ultimately resulted in what Fischer and Ain described as &quot;perhaps the darkest album Celtic Frost has ever recorded.&quot;

The final Celtic Frost album was financed by the band through its own label, Prowling Death Records. This label had originally been self-founded to release the Hellhammer demos and manage Hellhammer&#x27;s career in 1983 and 1984. The album was produced by Celtic Frost with Peter Tägtgren and mixed by Fischer and Ain. Celtic Frost and Prowling Death Records eventually entered into a worldwide licensing deal with Century Media Records. The album, titled &quot;Monotheist&quot;, was released in May 2006. It was well-received by both critics and fans of the band. While experimental and heavy in nature, it is viewed as an evolution from the extreme metal styles first developed on &quot;Morbid Tales&quot; and &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;, as well as the avant-garde style of &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;.

On 29 May 2006, Celtic Frost embarked on the most extensive tour of the band&#x27;s career, the &quot;Monotheist Tour&quot;. They initially headlined festivals (e.g., Wacken Open Air) across Europe and the United States/Canada in 2006, followed by the group&#x27;s first-ever shows in Japan in early 2007. The European leg of the tour took place afterward, followed by a return to the United States to complete the tour with Type O Negative. Additional festival appearances and concerts continued in mid-2007.

On stage, Celtic Frost performed with an additional touring guitarist to handle rhythm guitar parts. This position was initially filled by Anders Odden, and later by V Santura.

===Second breakup (2008–present)===
There has been no discussion of recording a new album since the band&#x27;s most recent breakup. Celtic Frost&#x27;s final two performances took place in Mexico: one on 12 October 2007, in Monterrey, and the last on the following day in Mexico City.
Fischer resigned from Celtic Frost on 9 April 2008, with the following message displayed on the band&#x27;s official website:

Celtic Frost singer and guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer has left Celtic Frost due to the irresolvable, severe erosion of the personal basis so urgently required to collaborate within a band so unique, volatile, and ambitious.

After this announcement, bassist Martin Eric Ain stated that the band was &quot;still alive, albeit in a coma of sorts.&quot; He added that the remaining members would not &quot;continue recording or touring,&quot; as it would be &quot;preposterous&quot; without Fischer. Fischer went on to form the band Triptykon with Celtic Frost&#x27;s touring guitarist V Santura, former Celtic Frost drummer Reed St. Mark, and bassist Vanja Slajh. Fischer stated that his new band would pursue a sound similar to the direction Celtic Frost took on their final album, &quot;Monotheist&quot;.

On 9 September 2008, Celtic Frost&#x27;s founding members, Martin Eric Ain and Tom Gabriel Fischer, confirmed on the band&#x27;s official website that they had &quot;jointly decided to lay Celtic Frost to rest for good&quot;.

On 21 October 2017, Martin Eric Ain died at the age of 50 following a heart attack.

In a 2021 interview with Heavy Culture, Tom Gabriel Fischer discussed the possibility of performing &quot;one or two&quot; Celtic Frost tribute shows in memory of Ain, featuring former members. He clarified that he had no interest in reforming the band since his departure, but might reunite former members for tribute shows: &quot;Should this ever happen, it would not be a permanent project, nor would it be &#x27;Celtic Frost,&#x27; despite the fact that it would Celtic Frost alumni. It would simply be a means to pay deference, perhaps for one or two concerts, to the deceased co-founder of the band.&quot; On 8 December 2022, Fischer&#x27;s current band, Triptykon, announced they would be performing a Celtic Frost tribute set during the Saturday special guest slot at Bloodstock Open Air Festival in the United Kingdom, following the withdrawal of Anthrax from that slot.

==Musical style and influences==
Celtic Frost&#x27;s sound has undergone significant evolution over the years, making them difficult to categorize. The band&#x27;s early work has been described as thrash metal and death metal. Celtic Frost are also often described as black metal, though some dissent, such as authors Axl Rosenberg and Christopher Krovatin, argue that the band&#x27;s &quot;music was too tight, and its connection to old-school rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music too readily apparent, to be black metal.&quot; In some instances, Celtic Frost is described as avant-garde due to a combination of ambient, classical, and electronica elements in their music. Celtic Frost&#x27;s later work, particularly &quot;Monotheist&quot;, has been described as doom metal.

Fischer has stated that two main genres influenced Celtic Frost: heavy metal and new wave. &quot;In Heavy Metal, it&#x27;s fair to say bands like Black Sabbath, Angel Witch, and Venom influenced us. Martin and I were heavily influenced by the New Wave music of the time too, such as Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Christian Death, and I think it&#x27;s a mix of these musical directions that influenced the sound of Celtic Frost.&quot; 

Ain was also noted for his interest in Joy Division, while Fischer&#x27;s taste originated in a jazz and prog background. &quot;I loved the &#x27;70s prog bands like Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and early Roxy Music.&quot; The online music website The Quietus published an interview with Fischer about his favorite albums, comprising a list of 13 notable influences. At the top of this list was the album &quot;Gula Matari&quot; by Quincy Jones. Additionally, the band was influenced by Killing Joke.

==Legacy==
When Fischer was asked to comment on their influence on heavy metal, he replied: &quot;No, I try to stay away from that. I&#x27;m a musician, I don&#x27;t want to get involved with all that. It&#x27;s not healthy. I want to do good albums. I&#x27;m still alive and I feel there&#x27;s still so much in front of me. I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with who has influence and where we stand and all that. I think it&#x27;s a negative thing.&quot;

Despite this, Celtic Frost have influenced a variety of metal bands. The band Therion, for example, took its band name from Celtic Frost&#x27;s album &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;. Other metal bands which have either cited Celtic Frost as an influence or covered Celtic Frost include: Darkthrone, Entombed, Tormentor, Godflesh, From Ashes Rise, Repulsion, Crowbar, Integrity, Rorschach, Shai Hulud, Deviated Instinct, Doom, Moonspell, Anthrax, Obituary, Death, Benediction, Brutal Truth, Neurosis, Eyehategod, Cradle of Filth, Marduk, Dimmu Borgir, Goatwhore, Sepultura, Cancer, Asphyx, Pro-Pain, Gorgoroth, Gallhammer, Paradise Lost, Evoken, Napalm Death. Coroner, another pioneering Swiss extreme metal band, originally started off as road crew for Celtic Frost.

Dave Grohl and Mark Tremonti have both stated on several occasions that Celtic Frost were an influence. Grohl consequently invited Fischer to participate in the recordings of his 2004 solo album, &quot;Probot&quot;, resulting in the song &quot;Big Sky&quot;. Alternative country singer Ryan Adams has also claimed influence from Celtic Frost.

In 1996, Dwell Records released &quot;In Memory of Celtic Frost&quot;, a collection of Celtic Frost songs covered by other bands. Notable bands that appeared in this tribute include Enslaved, covering &quot;Procreation of the Wicked&quot;; Opeth, covering &quot;Circle of the Tyrants&quot;; Grave, covering &quot;Mesmerize&quot;; Slaughter, covering &quot;Dethroned Emperor&quot;; Apollyon Sun (featuring Fischer himself), covering &quot;Babylon Fell&quot;; Emperor, covering &quot;Massacra&quot;, and Mayhem, covering &quot;Visual Aggression&quot;. This hard to find CD is now out of print.

In 2015, Corpse Flower Records released a tribute of their own entitled &quot;Morbid Tales! A Tribute to Celtic Frost&quot;. It too compiles a number of Celtic Frost covers by other bands, including Child Bite, Acid Witch, Municipal Waste, and Hayward, among others.

In 2018, British deathcore band, Black Tongue covered the song &quot;A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh&quot; on their second album, Nadir which was released on Halloween of 2018.

The hip-hop group &quot;Circle of Tyrants&quot; featuring Necro, Ill Bill, Goretex, and Mr Hyde also took their name from the Celtic Frost song.

<text>Murat &amp; Jose are a Slovene hip hop duo of writers, producers and MC. Both were born in 1978 in Ljubljana, Slovenia where they still live. Together with Nikolovski they performed for some time under the name &quot;Nedotakljivi&quot; (EN: &quot;The Untouchables&quot;). Together they published one of their first releases on the first Slovene hip hop compilation &quot;5&#x27;00&quot; of Fame za narodov blagor&quot; (EN: &quot;5&#x27;00&quot; of Fame for the National Welfare&quot;).

Their first solo LP was &quot;V besedi je moč&quot; (EN:&quot;The power is in the word&quot;) from 2002. The album featured some contributions from other artists: Tomi M, singer of Slovene rock group Siddharta, appeared on socially conscious single &quot;Od ljudi za ljudi&quot; (EN: &quot;From people for people&quot;); Zagreb duo Bolesna brača on the song &quot;Na izi&quot; (EN: &quot;On easy goin″&quot;); Semo, a vocalist from Kočevje, featured on reggae-balkan-soul track &quot;Če hočem&quot; (&quot;If I want&quot;) and &quot;Dokler bova skupi&quot; (&quot;As long as we&#x27;re together&quot;). Nikolovski collaborated on &quot;Neki ne štima&quot; (&quot;Something&#x27;s wrong&quot;) and on &quot;V besedi je moč&quot;. &quot;Kdo je gengsta&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s the Gangsta&quot;) features Kemal Trofi &amp; Jozafat. Unusually for a Slovene hip-hop album, &quot;V besedi je moč&quot; does not include any swearing, regional, sexual, or between-band provocations, claims of illegal behaviour, or drug references.

Murat &amp; Jose have shared the stage with Das Efx, Afu-Ra, Little Brother and many other internationally known hip-hop acts. Alongside Heavy Les Wanted they also appeared at Slovenia&#x27;s first urban festival Breakbeatnikk.

Murat &amp; Jose formed a live band in 2007 and are now performing under the name Murat &amp; Jose Band. They recorded a fully live album with the band, entitled &quot;Tuki Not&quot; released in September 2008. Its first single &quot;Nazaj&quot; (&quot;Back&quot;) featured Slovene rock and soul singer Janez Bončina, who rose to fame in the mid seventies. The second single, &quot;Be your own&quot;, featured local soul singer Maya.

<text>The Paleoproterozoic Era (also spelled Palaeoproterozoic) is the first of the three sub-divisions (eras) of the Proterozoic eon, and also the longest era of the Earth&#x27;s geological history, spanning from (2.5–1.6 Ga). It is further subdivided into four geologic periods, namely the Siderian, Rhyacian, Orosirian and Statherian.

Paleontological evidence suggests that the Earth&#x27;s rotational rate ~1.8 billion years ago equated to 20-hour days, implying a total of ~450 days per year. It was during this era that the continents first stabilized.

== Atmosphere ==

The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was originally a weakly reducing atmosphere consisting largely of nitrogen, methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide and inert gases, in total comparable to Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. When oxygenic photosynthesis evolved in cyanobacteria during the Mesoarchean, the increasing amount of byproduct dioxygen began to deplete the reductants in the ocean, land surface and the atmosphere. Eventually all surface reductants (particularly ferrous iron, sulfur and atmospheric methane) were exhausted, and the atmospheric free oxygen levels soared permanently during the Siderian and Rhyacian periods in an aerochemical event called the Great Oxidation Event, which brought atmospheric oxygen from near none to up to 10% of the modern level.

== Life ==

At the beginning of the preceding Archean eon, almost all existing lifeforms were single-cell prokaryotic anaerobic organisms whose metabolism was based on a form of cellular respiration that did not require oxygen, and autotrophs were either chemosynthetic or relied upon anoxygenic photosynthesis. After the Great Oxygenation Event, the then mainly archaea-dominated anaerobic microbial mats were devastated as free oxygen is highly reactive and biologically toxic to cellular structures. This was compounded by a 300-million-year-long global icehouse event known as the Huronian glaciation — at least partly due to the depletion of atmospheric methane, a powerful greenhouse gas — resulted in what is widely considered one of the first and most significant mass extinctions on Earth. The organisms that thrived after the extinction were mainly aerobes that evolved bioactive antioxidants and eventually aerobic respiration, and surviving anaerobes were forced to live symbiotically alongside aerobes in hybrid colonies, which enabled the evolution of mitochondria in eukaryotic organisms.

The Palaeoproterozoic represents the era from which the oldest cyanobacterial fossils, those of &quot;Eoentophysalis belcherensis&quot; from the Kasegalik Formation in the Belcher Islands of Nunavut, are known. By 1.75 Ga, thylakoid-bearing cyanobacteria had evolved, as evidenced by fossils from the McDermott Formation of Australia.

Many crown node eukaryotes (from which the modern-day eukaryotic lineages would have arisen) have been approximately dated to around the time of the Paleoproterozoic Era.
While there is some debate as to the exact time at which eukaryotes evolved,
current understanding places it somewhere in this era. Statherian fossils from the Changcheng Group in North China provide evidence that eukaryotic life was already diverse by the late Palaeoproterozoic.

== Geological events ==
During this era, the earliest global-scale continent-continent collision belts developed. The associated continent and mountain building events are represented by the 2.1–2.0 Ga Trans-Amazonian and Eburnean orogens in South America and West Africa; the ~2.0 Ga Limpopo Belt in southern Africa; the 1.9–1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson, Penokean, Taltson–Thelon, Wopmay, Ungava and Torngat orogens in North America, the 1.9–1.8 Ga Nagssugtoqidian Orogen in Greenland; the 1.9–1.8 Ga Kola–Karelia, Svecofennian, Volhyn-Central Russian, and Pachelma orogens in Baltica (Eastern Europe); the 1.9–1.8 Ga Akitkan Orogen in Siberia; the ~1.95 Ga Khondalite Belt; the ~1.85 Ga Trans-North China Orogen in North China; and the 1.8-1.6 Ga Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies in southern North America.

That pattern of collision belts supports the formation of a Proterozoic supercontinent named Columbia or Nuna. That continental collisions suddenly led to mountain building at large scale is interpreted as having resulted from increased biomass and carbon burial during and after the Great Oxidation Event: Subducted carbonaceous sediments are hypothesized to have lubricated compressive deformation and led to crustal thickening.

Felsic volcanism in what is now northern Sweden led to the formation of the Kiruna and Arvidsjaur porphyries.

The lithospheric mantle of Patagonia&#x27;s oldest blocks formed.

<text>A margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice. Some margarita recipes include simple syrup as well and are often served with salt on the rim of the glass. Margaritas can be served either shaken with ice (on the rocks), without ice (straight up), or blended with ice (frozen margarita). Most bars serve margaritas in a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe called a margarita glass. The margarita is one of the world&#x27;s most popular cocktails and the most popular tequila-based cocktail.

==Origin==
The history of the margarita is shrouded in mystery and folklore due to its numerous origin stories. According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the margarita is related to the brandy daisy (&quot;margarita&quot; is Spanish for &quot;daisy&quot;), remade with tequila instead of brandy. (Daisies are a family of cocktails that include a base spirit, liqueur, and citrus. A sidecar and gin daisy are other related drinks.) There is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita &quot;creation myths&quot;.

The &quot;Cafe Royal Cocktail Book&quot;, published in the UK in 1937, contains a recipe for a Picador using the same concentrations of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice as a margarita. One of the earliest stories is of the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos &quot;Danny&quot; Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California, created for customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits, but not to tequila. This story was related by Herrera and also by bartender Albert Hernandez, acknowledged for popularizing a margarita in San Diego after 1947, at the La Plaza restaurant in La Jolla. The story was debunked in 1992 by the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;.

According to Jose Cuervo, the cocktail was invented in 1938 by a bartender in honor of Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa.

Hussong&#x27;s Cantina also claims to have been the site of the margarita&#x27;s creation in Ensenada, Baja California, in 1941. Bartender Don Carlos Orozco reputedly named a new drink after Mexican-German patron Margarita Henkel Cesena, a frequent customer to the cantina. Cesena was a ranch operator by trade, and it is disputed whether she was the daughter of a German ambassador as the story claims. Hussong&#x27;s, however, has enjoyed widespread popularity as the home of the original margarita.

There are also claims that the margarita was first mixed in Juárez, Chihuahua at Tommy&#x27;s Place Bar on July 4, 1942, by Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Morales. Morales later left bartending in Mexico to become a US citizen, where he worked as a milkman for 25 years. Mexico&#x27;s official news agency Notimex and many experts have said Morales has the strongest claim to having invented the margarita.

Others say the inventor was Dallas socialite Margarita Sames when she concocted the drink for her guests at her Acapulco, Guerrero vacation home in 1948. Tommy Hilton reportedly attended, bringing the drink back to the Hilton chain of hotels. However, Jose Cuervo was already running ad campaigns for the margarita three years earlier, in 1945, with the slogan, &quot;Margarita: It&#x27;s more than a girl&#x27;s name.&quot;
Another common origin tale begins the cocktail&#x27;s history at the legendary Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas, where, in 1948, head bartender Santos Cruz created the margarita for singer Peggy Lee. He supposedly named it after the Spanish version of her name, Margarita.

The first known publication of a margarita recipe was in the December 1953 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, with a recipe calling for an ounce of Sierra tequila, a dash of triple sec, and the juice of half a lime or lemon. A recipe for a tequila-based cocktail first appeared in the 1930 book &quot;My New Cocktail Book&quot; by G. F. Steele. Without noting a specific recipe or inventor, a drink called the Tequila Daisy was mentioned in the &quot;Syracuse Herald&quot; as early as 1936. Margarita is Spanish for Daisy, which is a nickname for Margaret.

A later, certainly false, story is that the margarita was invented in October 1961, at a party in Houston, Texas, by partygoer Robert James &quot;Rusty&quot; Thomson while acting as bartender. He concocted a mixture of equal parts tequila, Controy orange liqueur, lime, and crushed ice in a salt-rimmed glass.

==Variations==

The IBA (IBA Official list of Cocktails) standard is 10:4:3, that is, tequila:triple sec:fresh lime juice.

The &quot;Original Margarita&quot; recipe, as given by Cointreau on their website, has slightly more of their own sweet liqueur: 1 part white tequila, part Cointreau, and part fresh squeezed lime juice.

===Flavored tequila===
Apple-cinnamon tequila, triple sec, cranberry juice, fresh lime juice, and an apple wedge or lemon twist for garnish combine to form the Cranberry Margarita With Apple-Cinnamon Tequila, a fall seasonal drink.

===Flavored liqueurs===
Besides Cointreau, other orange-flavored liqueurs that might be used include Grand Marnier (yielding the &quot;Cadillac Margarita&quot;), Gran Gala, other brands of triple sec, or blue curaçao (yielding the &quot;blue margarita&quot;). When sweeter fruit juices or freshly puréed fruits are added to the margarita, the orange-flavored liqueur is often reduced or omitted. In addition to orange-flavored liqueurs, secondary liqueurs may occasionally be added to a cocktail, including melon-flavored or black raspberry-flavored. Other flavors include pineapple and watermelon.

===Fresh lime juice===
Freshly squeezed lime juice is the key ingredient. The most common lime in the United States is the thick-skinned Persian lime. However, margaritas in Mexico are generally made with Mexican limes (Key limes). These are small, thin-skinned limes with a more tart and often bitter flavor than Persian limes.

===Frozen margarita===
The frozen margarita is a margarita served as an ice slush, similar to other tropical-inspired frozen mixed drinks like the hurricane or piña colada. The ingredients can be processed with ice in a kitchen blender, or for larger output, a slush or soft-serve ice cream machine is used: a cooled, horizontal cylinder has a rotating impeller that churns the mix so it will not freeze solid, and the thick half-frozen slush is dispensed from a spout. Frozen margaritas were first served in La Jolla, when Albert Hernandez Sr. stopped using crushed ice and instead combined the ingredients in a blender in 1947. The dedicated frozen margarita machine was introduced by Mariano Martinez in Dallas in 1971.

A lemonade or limeade margarita can be quickly whipped up by using frozen lemonade or limeade concentrate in place of lime juice.

===Fruit sodas and sports drinks===
Fruity sodas such as fruit punch, lime, pineapple, or mandarin orange Jarritos, or sports drinks such as blue or orange Gatorade, can substitute for triple sec. A margarita made with orange soda and beer is a sunrise beer margarita; if it is made with carbonated fruit punch soda, it is a sunset margarita. The variant that uses grapefruit soda is called a Paloma.

===Other fruits and vegetables===
Alternate fruits and juice mixtures can also be used in a margarita. Fruits like mango, peach, strawberry, banana, cranberry, melon, raspberry, blueberry, or avocado are suitable for creating this drink. Orange juice and pomegranate juice (poured down the inner side of the glass) can make a sunset margarita (so named because the orange is at the top and the red at the bottom). Many recipes call for a splash of orange juice. These days, margaritas can be prepared in many different ways. When the word &quot;margarita&quot; is used by itself, it typically refers to the lime or lemon juice margarita. Still, when other juices are used, the fruits are typically added as adjectives in the name, with lime juice or lemon juice added to give it a characteristic margarita flavor (a wedge of lime is often added to the glass). Other varieties of margarita include fruit margarita, top-shelf margarita, and virgin margarita.

Coconut cream, coconut milk, and coconut water can also be added to margaritas, e.g., skinny margaritas that substitute, e.g., pineapple juice for liqueurs.

Margaritas can also be made with vegetables such as carrots, beets, cucumber, and celery.

===Beer cocktails===
A beergarita (or Coronarita) is a beer cocktail that has a bottle of Corona beer or other light-flavored beer poured upside down into a margarita on the rocks.

===Skinny===
A skinny margarita may be purportedly lower in calories (possibly using artificial sweeteners) or one that uses fresh juices rather than a prepared mix.

One recipe uses fresh lime juice, orange juice, and agave nectar.

Another recipe uses only tequila and some concentrated lime juice.

==Related drinks==
A margarita with vodka substituted for tequila is a kamikaze.

==Glass==

Margaritas may be served in a variety of glasses, most notably the margarita glass, a variant of the classic champagne coupe; this is particularly associated with blended fruit margaritas, and the glass is also used for dishes such as guacamole or shrimp cocktails. Margaritas are often served in a standard cocktail glass in formal settings. In contrast, in informal settings, particularly with ice, margaritas may be served in an old fashioned glass, cocktail glass, wine glass, pint glass, and even large schooners.

==Popularity==
The margarita cocktail was the December 1953 &quot;Drink of the Month&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, with this recipe:

:1 ounce tequila
:Dash of triple sec
:Juice of lime or lemon

:Pour over crushed ice, stir. Rub the rim of a stem glass with rind of lemon or lime, spin in salt—pour, and sip.

It was further popularized by the 1977 song &quot;Margaritaville&quot; by Jimmy Buffett. In 2004 it was described as &quot;the most popular mixed drink in America&quot;. It was used in the title of the 1983 single &quot;Margarita Time&quot; by the English rock band Status Quo and was the inspiration for the cover artwork.

The margarita may be popular because it includes salt, sweet, and sour flavors.

<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev (, born 1 March 1970) is a Russian serial killer, also known as the Novokuznetsk Monster and the Siberian Ripper, convicted for the killing of four people in Novokuznetsk in 1991 and 1996.

Spesivtsev, with the assistance of his mother Lyudmila, targeted street children and young women across Novokuznetsk by luring them into their apartment, where they would be tortured and killed, and sometimes cannibalized. He confessed at some point to nineteen murders, but later retracted his confession and was convicted for only four. Based on found evidence he is suspected of having committed over 80 murders starting from as early as 1991.

==Early life==

Alexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev was born on 1 March 1970 and raised in an apartment on Pionerskiy Prospekt in central Novokuznetsk, the largest city in Kemerovo Oblast, RSFSR, Soviet Union. He was underweight at birth but survived, although he was frequently ill afterwards. During childhood, Spesivtsev was considered unsocial, did not have friends, and was bullied while at school. His mother Lyudmila Spesivtseva worked at a nearby school and the prosecutor&#x27;s office and was very affectionate towards her son. His father was an abusive alcoholic who abandoned the family. Spesivtsev and his mother held a strong, but unusual, relationship, as Lyudmila would regularly show her son photographs of corpses from books about criminal cases at a very young age, and the two shared a bed until Alexander was 12.

Growing up, Spesivtsev showed increasing sadistic tendencies, and in 1988, met his first girlfriend. Ostensibly poetic by nature, they often went for walks together, but the facade didn&#x27;t last. Arguments led to her breaking up with him, which Spesivstev did not accept. He kidnapped her and tortured her for a month in his apartment until she died of sepsis. For this, at the age of 18, Spesivstev was assigned to the Oryol Special Psychiatric Hospital.

==Crimes==
Though in official databases, he was, at the time, still listed as undergoing treatment, in 1991, he was discharged. Once out, he began associating with transients and beggars and developed a deep-seated hatred of street children, whom he viewed as a byproduct of Russia&#x27;s emerging democracy. Spesivstev was likewise particularly embittered by an episode during his commitment at the Oryol Hospital, in which he asked another patient to insert a metal ball into his urethra to make him more virile. This had the opposite effect, causing erectile dysfunction and genital pains.

Alexander and then Lyudmila began to lure victims into their apartment, chosen at random, where Alexander would torture and eventually kill them. Unaccompanied street children attending discothèques and playing in construction sites had become commonplace in the impoverished city of Novokuznetsk since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and they became his main target. The bodies of victims would sometimes be cannibalized. Lyudmila would dispose of unwanted remains by throwing them from buckets into the Aba River, late at night.

==Investigation==

The first sign of his victims arose when the gangrenous severed heads, torsos, and arms of unidentifiable children were found washed up on the banks of the River Aba. It was not immediately believed there was a serial killer, and only after several large groups of unattended children disappeared was a serial mass murderer suspected as being active in the city.

Otherwise, investigators in the regional Directorate of Internal Affairs suspected that organ smugglers were acting within the city&#x27;s boundaries. Several criminal gangs from the Caucasus region were active in Novokuznetsk at the time, and police searched the baggage of outward flights. Additionally, several hundred internal troops and police officers were deployed to search for the killer, who at some point was thought to be Oleg Rylkov.

==Arrest and sentencing==

Spesivtsev&#x27;s crimes were discovered by chance in October 1996, when plumbers sent to the apartment where he lived with his mother could not get access. They called the police to open the door. Inside they found the dismembered body of a girl in the bathtub, and a severely wounded girl, 14-year-old Olga G. Spesivtsev and his mother Lyudmila were immediately arrested.

Olga G. died soon after of her knife wounds, but before her death she told the investigators that Spesivtsev had killed two of her friends, forcing her to dismember the corpses. She also said that Lyudmila had cooked the victim&#x27;s flesh for consumption by herself and her son; they had also fed some to their dog and forced the captive girls to eat it.

In June 1996, the police had already found the buried bones of children, identified as belonging to at least 15 victims aged from three to fourteen. After his arrest, these were identified as possible victims of Spesivtsev, who indeed initially confessed to having murdered them, but later retracted his confession. In 1997, he was convicted for the murders of Olga G. and her two friends, but not for any other cases due to insufficient evidence. His mother was sentenced to 13 years in prison for having assisted him.

Spesivtsev is permanently confined to the Kamyshin Regional Hospital.

Lucius Mummius (2nd century BC) was a Roman statesman and general. He was consul in the year 146 BC along with Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus. 

Mummius was the first of his family to rise to the rank of consul thereby making him a novus homo. He received the agnomen Achaicus for his victories over the Achaean League destroying the famous ancient city of Corinth, at that time a leading city of the League, as part of his campaign. Mummius&#x27; victory over the Achaean League and the sack of Corinth placed Rome firmly in control of all Greece from a political standpoint - something Rome had avoided doing even though their involvement in the Greek East dated back as far as 226 BC when they confronted Illyrian piracy. The destruction of Corinth marked the end of free Greece.

==Career==
Almost nothing is known about Lucius Mummius&#x27; early career. He won one of the praetorships (for 154 BC) during the elections of 155 BC.

===Hispania===
In 154 BC the Senate assigned Mummius the task of restoring order in Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain), which was reeling from a revolt by native Lusitanian (the Lusitanian Rebellion of 155–150 BC). The rebellion was led by the Lusitanian chieftains Punicus and Caesarus. In the initial phases of his campaign he experienced several reverses, but he regrouped and at Ocile he led his army of 9,000 foot and 500 horse in a victorious battle against a numerically superior force of Lusitanians, killing about 15,000 rebels and lifting the siege; his successor, Marcus Atilius, went on to take Oxthracae, the largest city in Lusitania. Mummius was awarded a triumph for his victory over the Lusitanians.

===Corinth===
Mummius was elected consul for 146 BC. He was appointed to take command of the Achaean War, inheriting the command from Metellus Macedonicus. Having obtained an easy victory over the incapable Achaean leader Diaeus, Mummius entered Corinth after a victory over the defending forces. All the men of Corinth were put to the sword, the women and children were sold into slavery, and the statues, paintings and works of art were seized and shipped to Rome. Corinth was then reduced to ashes. However, at least two ancient authors give accounts that suggest Corinth was not completely destroyed. The apparently needless cruelty of Mummius in Corinth is explained by Mommsen as due to the instructions of the senate, prompted by the mercantile party, which was eager to dispel a dangerous commercial rival. According to Polybius, Mummius was unable to resist the pressure of those around him.

In the subsequent settlement of affairs, Mummius exhibited considerable administrative powers and a high degree of justice and integrity, which gained him the respect of the inhabitants. He especially abstained from offending their religious sensibilities. On his return to Rome he was honored with a triumph, and was the first &quot;novus homo&quot; to receive an agnomen for military services.

===Censor===
In 142 BC he was censor with Scipio Aemilianus Africanus, whose severity frequently brought him into collision with his more lenient colleague.

==Art==
His indifference to works of art and ignorance of their value is shown by his well-known remark to those who were contracted for the shipment of the treasures of Corinth to Rome, that &quot;if they lost or damaged them, they would have to replace them.&quot; He was, in other words, unaware that a &quot;new-for-old-deal&quot; was inappropriate for such valuable antiques. Mummius plundered Corinth and sent home ship loads of its priceless art and rich furniture to Rome. For the theatrical pageants exhibited by him he erected a theatre with improved acoustical conditions and seats after the Greek model, thus marking a distinct advance in the construction of places of entertainment.

<text>The  () was a private art school for painting and sculpture founded in Paris, France, in 1867 by French painter and teacher Rodolphe Julian (1839–1907) that was active from 1868 through 1968. It remained famous for the number and quality of artists who attended during a great period of effervescence in the arts in the early twentieth century. After 1968, it integrated with the École supérieure de design, d&#x27;art graphique et d&#x27;architecture intérieure
(ESAG) Penninghen.

==History==
Rodolphe Julian established the Académie Julian in 1868 at the Passage des Panoramas, as a private studio school for art students.
The Académie Julian not only prepared students for the exams at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts, but offered independent alternative education and training in arts. &quot;Founded at a time when art was about to undergo a long series of crucial mutations, the Academie Julian played host to painters and sculptors of every kind and persuasion and never tried to make them hew to any one particular line&quot;.

In 1880, women who were not allowed to enroll for study to the École des Beaux-Arts were accepted by the new Académie Julian. Foreign applicants who had been deterred from entering the Ecole des Beaux Arts by a vicious French language examination were welcome at the Académie Julian.
Men and women were trained separately, and women participated in the same studies as men, including drawing and painting of nude models. &quot;Human exchange went forward in an atmosphere that was collegial, easygoing and mutually supportive. It nurtured some of the best artists of the day&quot;.

Académie Julian became popular as fertile ground with French as well as foreign students from diverse backgrounds from all over the world, from the United Kingdom, Canada, Hungary, and particularly the United States; French art critic Egmont Arens wrote in 1924 that American art, at least for a period of time, reflected the teachings of Académie Julian. In 1989, on the occasion of the exhibition at the Shepherd Gallery, in Manhattan, devoted to the Academie Julian in Paris as it existed between 1868 and 1939, John Russell wrote:

By my count, more than 50 nationalities were represented at the school during its glory years. To be at the Academie Julian was to be exposed to a kind of white magic that seems to have worked in almost every case. What was learned there stayed forever with alumnus and alumna, and it related as much to the conduct of life as to the uses of brush and chisel. – in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Russell: &quot;An Art School That Also Taught Life&quot;, 19 March 1989.

The South African painter Strat Caldecott (1886–1929) worked and studied at the Académie Julian in preparation for his admission to the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts. He vividly described the Académie Julian as: &quot;A huge room, lighted from above, and smelling strongly of turpentine; tobacco-smoke, sweat and garlic, for the models were mostly children of the South. A room plastered to the full height of a man&#x27;s reach with palette scrapings whose many colours mingled to make a warm grey background, hung with the prize studies of decades of &quot;concourse&quot;, furnished with a huge Godin stove, and tall grass-plaited stools, and a heavy mobile podium on which the model was posed each week by a quarreling agora of tousle-headed youths.&quot;

The early success of the Académie was also secured by the famous and respected artists whom Rodolphe Julian employed as instructors: Adolphe William Bouguereau (1825–1905), Henri Royer, Jean-Paul Laurens, Gabriel Ferrier, Tony Robert-Fleury, Jules Lefebvre and other leading artists of that time trained in Academic art. Eventually, Académie Julian students were granted the right to compete for the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot;, a prize awarded to promising young artists. and participate in the major &quot;Salons&quot; or art exhibitions.

In the late 19th century the term &quot;L&#x27;art pompier&quot; had entered the scene as a derisive term for the traditional academic art espoused by the Académie&#x27;s instructors. As a result, the Académie Julian embraced a more liberal regime pushing a less conservative, more sincere approach to art which corresponded to the Secessionist art movement in Germany and the Vienna Secession in Austria. It was followed and fully articulated by the Nabis, an avant-garde movement that participated in paving the way to modern art in 1888–1889.

Over time, Académie Julian opened schools in other locations. In addition to the original school at Passage des Panoramas, studios were at no. 5 Rue de Berri in the 8th arrondissement, no. 31 Rue du Dragon in the 6th arrondissement, no. 51, rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement for female student artists, overseen by painter Amélie Beaury-Saurel, Julian&#x27;s spouse. Subsequent faculty included former students (Edgar Chahine, for example).
Académie Julian remained open during World War I, albeit with a lesser number of students. By contrast during World War II, after the 1941 exhibition &quot;Vingt jeunes peintres de tradition française&quot; considerations on &quot;degenerate art&quot; by the German military administration forced the school to close. In 1946 some of the studios were sold.

For his services to the arts, Rodolphe Julian, described by the Anglo-Irish novelist and critic George Moore as &quot;a kind of Hercules, dark-haired, strong, with broad shoulders, short legs, a soft voice and all the charm of the Midi&quot; was awarded the Legion of Honour.

The artist records still extant are those of the men&#x27;s section, covering the 1870–1932 period, and those of the women&#x27;s section, covering the 1880–1907 period.

In 1968, an important year in France&#x27;s history with the May events, particularly in relation to education, the Académie Julian integrated with ESAG Penninghen.

<doc id="169906" wikidata="Q594322" url="?curid=169906" title="Sociology of sport">
<text>Sociology of sport, alternately referred to as sports sociology, is a sub-discipline of sociology which focuses on sports as social phenomena. It is an area of study concerned with the relationship between sociology and sports, and also various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and organizations or groups involved with sport. This area of study discusses the positive impact sports have on individual people and society as a whole economically, financially, and socially. Sociology of sport attempts to view the actions and behavior of sports teams and their players through the eyes of a sociologist.

Sport is regulated by regulations and rules of behavior, spatial and time constraints, and has governing bodies. It is oriented towards a goal, which makes known both the winner and the loser. It is competitive, and ludic. All sports are culturally situated, intertwined with the value systems and power relations within the host society.

The emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first social psychological experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides cultural anthropology and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in a more general way was Johan Huizinga&#x27;s &quot;Homo Ludens&quot; or Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;. Homo Ludens discusses the importance of the element of play in culture and society. Huizinga suggests that play, specifically sport, is primary to and a necessary condition of the generation of culture. These written works contributed to the rise of the study of sociology of sport. In 1970, sports sociology gained significant attention as an organized, legitimate field of study. The North American Society for the Sociology of Sport was formed in 1978 with the objective of studying the field. Its research outlet, the &quot;Sociology of Sport Journal&quot;, was formed in 1984.

It is a common assumption that sports can be viewed as a ritual and a game at the same time. Sports as a result can be viewed as a parallel ritual process which is connected to leisure time and freedom. The symbolic effect of a ritual allows classification of social relationships among men and between women and men, as well as the impact sports has on nations. Some national sports like baseball in Cuba, cricket in the West Indies, and football in a majority of Latin American countries drive passion that goes past the ethnic status, regional origins, or class lines. Therefore, sport is an important field of analysis for achieving better understanding of the functioning of modern societies. 

==Race and sports==
===1936 Berlin Games===
There was controversy around the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, as the rhetoric and laws of the host country (Nazi Germany) encompassed, and indeed were largely based on, overt and extreme racism. Many Germans were dismayed that nonwhite athletes were allowed to compete; the &quot;Nazis were deeply offended by sporting contacts with &#x27;primitive&#x27; races and by competing against Negro athletes, in particular.&quot; 

Adolf Hitler agreed with the proposition people who had ancestors who &quot;came from the jungle&quot; were &quot;primitive because their physiques were stronger than those of civilized whites.&quot; and wanted to impose racial segregation on the games, but the Olympic Committee refused. The Nazi regime did, however, use any results they could to propagandize the superiority of what they called the Aryan race.

===Historical racist theories===
Sport has always been characterized by racial social relationships. The first scientific look at race came at the end of the 19th century, when count Arthur de Gobineau attempted to prove the physical and intellectual superiority of the white race. Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection was used in service of racism as well. After the athletic ability of black sportspeople was proven, the theory shifted toward physical ability at the expense of intellect.
Several racist theories were advanced. Black people were athletically able because animals ate all the slow ones. The myth of &quot;middle passage&quot; posited only the most athletically able of black people were able to survive the slave trade and plantation work. The matriarchal theory suggested that absent fathers made black people channel their anger into sports, with coaches becoming father figures. The mandigo theory assumed that the most physically potent black men were bred with the most physically potent black women. The psychological theory claimed that black athletes did not have the intellectual capacity to assume leadership positions in sports. The &quot;dumb jock theory&quot; saw black people enrolling on sport scholarships as they were unable to find success in academia. Lastly, the genetic theory suggested that black sportspeople had more of certain muscle fibers.

===Current sociology===
Young African-Americans see sports as means of upward social mobility, which is denied to them through conventional employment. Race often interplays with class, gender and ethnicity to determine how accessible certain sports are, and how the athlete is perceived. For example, golf is inaccessible to African-Americans less because of race, and more because of the high economic and social capital needed.

Race is often connected to gender, with women having less opportunities to access and succeed in sports. Once a woman does succeed, her race is downplayed and her sexuality is accentuated. In certain cultures, especially Muslim ones, women are denied access to sports all-together.

In team sports, white players are often placed in central positions which demand intelligence, decisiveness, leadership, calmness and reliability. Black players are in turn place in positions that demand athletic ability, physical strength, speed and explosiveness. For example, white players in the role of central midfielders and black players as wingers.

==Gender in sports==
Female participation in sports is influenced by patriarchal ideologies surrounding the body, as well as ideas of femininity and sexuality. Physical exertion inevitably leads to development of muscle, which is connected to masculinity, which is in contrast to the idea of women as presented by modern consumer culture. Women who enter sports early are more likely to challenge these stereotypes.

Television networks and corporations focus on showcasing female athlete which are considered as attractive, which trivializes the achievements of these sportswomen. Women&#x27;s sports are less covered by news than male sports. During sporting events, the camera focuses on specifically on attractive women. Allen Guttman argues that erotic component of sports cannot be rooted out, and as such remains one of its key components. Further, attractive male and female athletes will always be more sought after. The erotic component of sports should be researched, instead of being outright rejected.

Jennifer Hargreaves sees three political strategies for women in sports:

* Co-option: this strategy rejects conservative claims of biological differences and traditional gender values. Liberal feminists believe women will gradually take over more roles within sport created and controlled by men.
* Separatism: position held by radical feminists, which advocates self-realization through organization of sport events and governing bodies independent of men. It would further increase the number of women competing in various sports.
* Cooperation: advocated by socialist feminists who believe that cooperation between men and women would help to establish new sporting models that would negate gender differences. They recognize the diversity of struggles within modern capitalist societies, and aims at liberation from them. Unlike separatism it engages with men, and is more extensive than co-option. Co-operation posits that men are not inherently oppressive, but are socialized into reproducing oppressive roles.

== Theories in sociology of sport ==
===Functionalism===
Structural functionalist theories see society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. Sport itself developed from religious ceremonies, which served to promote social and moral solidarity of the community.

Bromberger saw similarities between religious ceremonies and football matches. Matches are held in a particular spatial configuration, pitches are sacred and may not be polluted by pitch invaders, and lead to intense emotional states in fans. As with religious ceremonies, spectators are spatially distributed according to social distribution of power. Football seasons have a fixed calendar. Group roles on match day are ceremonial, with specially robed people performing intense ritual acts. As a church, football has an organizational network, from local to global levels. Matches have a sequential order that guides the actions of participants, from pre-match to post-match actions. Lastly, football rituals create a sense of communitas. Songs and choreography can be seen as an immanent ceremony through which spectators transfer their strength to the team.

Accounting for the fact that not all actions support the existing societal structure, Robert K. Merton saw five ways a person could react to the existing structure, which can be applied to sports as well: conformism, innovation, ritualism, withdrawal, and rebellion.

Erving Goffman drew on Durkheim&#x27;s conception of positive rituals, emphasizing the sacred status of an individual&#x27;s &quot;face&quot;. Positive (compliments, greetings, etc.) and negative (avoiding confrontation, apologies, etc.) rituals all serve to protect one&#x27;s face. Sport journalists, for example, utilize both the positive and negative rituals to protect the face of the athlete they wish to maintain good relations with. Birrell furthermore posits sport events are ritual competitions in which athletes show their character through a mix of bravery, good play and integrity. A good showing serves to reinforce the good face of the athlete.

===Interpretative sociology===
Interpretative sociology explores the interrelations of social action to status, subjectivity, meaning, motives, identities and social change. It avoids explaining human groups through general laws and generalizations, preferring what Max Weber called &quot;verstehen&quot; - understanding and explaining individual motivations. It allows for a more complete understanding of diverse social meanings, symbols and roles within sport. Sport allows for creation of various social identities within the framework of a single game or match, which may change during it or throughout the course of multiple matches. Ones role as a sportsperson further affects how they act outside of a game or a match, i.e. acting out the role of a student athlete.

Weber introduced the notion of rationalization. In modern society, relationship are organized to be as efficient as possible, based on technical knowledge, instead of moral and political principles. This creates bureaucracies that are efficient, impersonal and homogeneous. Allen Guttmann identified several key aspects of rationalization, which can likewise be applied to sports:

* Secularization: modern sports have become independent of the religious institutions from which they have evolved. In the pre-modern societies, sport and religious festivities were interconnected. Religion does hold some importance in sports, which can be seen in the pre-match rituals, superstitions and prayer.
* Meritocracy: Sports promote fair competition, while pre-modern sports were exclusive. For example, the ancient Olympics excluded women and non-citizens. In contrast, modern sports offer opportunities to the disadvantaged, while fair judging/refereeing offer a level playing field. Social status still plays a role in sport access and success. Richer countries will have more numerous and successful athletes, while the higher class will have access to better training and preparation.
* Specialization: modern sports, just like industry, has a complex division of labor. Athletes have a very specialized role inside of a team, which they must learn and perform, i.e. the kicker in american football. This does not apply to all sports, as some value the ability to cover a number of roles as necessary.
* Rationalization: modern sports identify the most efficient way to achieve the desired goal. On the other hand, Giulianotti points out that sports are dominated by irrational actions.
* Bureaucratization: sports are controlled by organizations, committees and supervisory boards on local, continental and global levels. Leading positions are supposed to be given based on qualifications and experience, instead of charisma and nepotism. This is not always the case, as powerful and charismatic personage are often put in charge of said organizations and committees.
* Quantification: Statistics measure and compare modern sport events, often throughout multiple generations, reducing complex events to understandable information which can be easily grasped by the mass public. Statistics are not the dominant factor in sport culture, with the socio-psychological and aesthetically pleasing factors still being the most important.

===Neo-Marxism===
Karl Marx saw sports as rooted in its economic context, subject to commodification and alienation. Neo-Marxism sees sport as an ideological tool of the bourgeoisie, used to deceive the masses, in order to maintain control. As laborers, athletes give up their labour power, and suffer the same fate as the alienated worker. Aside from supporting industrial capitalism, sport propagates heavy physical exertion and overworking as something positive.

Specialized division of labor force athletes to constantly perform the same movements, instead of playing creatively, experimentally and freely. The athlete if often under the illusion of being free, unaware of losing control over his labor power. Spectators themselves support the alienation of athletes&#x27; labor through their support and participation.

Marxist theories have been used to research the commodification of sport, for example, how players themselves become goods or promote them, the hyper-commercialization of sports during the 20th century, how clubs become like traditional firms, and how sport organizations become brands.

This approach has been criticized for their tendency toward raw economism, and supposing that all current social structures function to maintain the existing capitalist order. Supporting sport teams does not necessarily contradict the development of class consciousness and participating in the class struggle. Sport events have a number of examples of political protest. Neo Marxist analysis of sports often underestimate the aesthetic side of sport as well.

===Cultural studies===
Hegemony research describes the relations of power, as well as methods and techniques used by dominant groups to achieve ideological consent, without resorting to physical coercion. This ideological consent aims to make the exploratory social order seem natural, guaranteeing that the subordinate groups live out their subordination. A hegemony is always open to contestation, and thus counter-hegemonic movements may emerge.

The dominant groups may use sports to steer the use of the subordinate classes in the desired direction, or towards consumerism. However, the history of sport shows that colonized are not necessarily manipulated through sport, while sport professionalization, and their own popular culture, helped the working class avoid mass subordination to bourgeois values.

Resistance is a key concept in cultural studies, which describes how subordinate groups engage in particular cultural practices to resist their domination. Resistance can be overt and deliberate or latent and unconscious, but always counters the norms and conventions of the dominant groups. John Fiske differentiated between confrontational semiotics and avoidance.

==Body and sports==
Body became a subject of research in the 80s, with the work of Michel Foucault. For him, power is exercise in two different ways - through biopower and disciplinary power. Biopower centers on the political control of key biological aspects of the human body and whole populations, such as birth, reproduction, death, etc. Disciplinary power is exercised by means of the everyday disciplining of bodies, particularly through controlling time and space.

Eichberg sees three different types of bodies as highlighting the difference between disciplined and undisciplined bodies in sport: the dialogic body, of different shapes and sizes, which are given to freeing oneself from control, and were the main type in pre-modern festivals and carnivals. The streamlined, improved body for sports accomplishment and competition. The healthy, straight body, which is shaped through disciplined regimes of fitness. The grotesque body could be seen in pre-modern festivals and carnivals, i.e. folk wrestling or three-legged race. Modern sport pedagogy fluctuates between strictness and freedom, discipline and control, but the hierarchical relations of power and knowledge between the coach and athlete remain.

Segel claimed that the cultural raise of sports reflected the wider turn of modern society toward physical expression, which revived militarism, war and fascism. Some representatives of the Frankfurt school, saw sport as a cult of the fascistic idea of the body. Tännsjö claimed that overly complimenting sport prowess reflects the fascistic elements in society, as it normalizes the ridicule of the weak and defeated.

===Sports and injury===
Prizefighting allows research into the violent body. Prizefighters transform their bodily capital into prizefighting capital, for the purpose of winning fame, status and wealth. Their bodies are exploited by managers, of which they are aware, describing themselves alternatively as prostitutes, slaves and stallions. Prizefighters accept the routine damage their bodies sustain, while at the same time fearing the effects of such damage. A frequent response to this is attempting to turn themselves into heroic personalities. All contact sports have violence as part of strategy to a certain extent. Sports violence is not individual, but is a product of socialization. Finn see footballers as socializing into a culture of quasi-violence, which accentuates different values than those in regular life. It accepts violence as central to the game.

Physical injury of sportspeople can be seen through Beck&#x27;s theory of a &quot;risk society&quot;. A risk society is characterized by reflexive modernity, where members of society are well informed, critical and participate in the shaping of social structures. Unlike the routine risk of traditional society, modern societies identify and minimize risks. Reflexive modernity in sports is evinced in isolation, minimizing and removal of causes of physical injury, while at the same time keeping the techniques and strategies particular to those sports. The lower classes have lower access to risk assessment and avoidance, and as such have a higher rate of participation in riskier sports.

Despite this, athletes are still thought to ignore and attempt to overcome pain, as overcoming pain is seen as brave and heroic. The capacity of the athlete to make the body seem invincible is an integral part of sports professionalism. This ignoring of pain is often a key part of some sport subcultures. Children are also often exposed to acute pain and injuries, i.e. gymnastics.

== Emotion in sports ==
Emotion has always been a huge part of sports as it can affect both athletes and the spectators themselves. Theorists and sociologists who study the impact of emotions in sports try to classify emotions into categories. Controversial, debated, and discussed intensely, these classifications are not definitive or set in stone. Emotion is very important in sports; athletes can use them to convey specific and significant information to their teammates and coaches and they can use emotion to send false signals to confuse their opponents. In addition to athletes using emotion to their advantage, emotion can also have a negative impact on athletes and their performances. For example, &quot;stage fright,&quot; or nervousness and apprehension, can impact their performance in their sport, be it in a positive or negative way.

Depending on the level of sports, the level of emotion differs. In professional sports, emotions can be extremely intense because there are many more people in many distinct roles who are involved. There are the professional athletes, the coaching staff, the referees, the television crew, the commentators, and last but not least, the fans and spectators. There is much more public press, pressure, and self-pressure. It is extremely difficult to not get emotionally invested in sports; sports are very good at bringing out the worst qualities in people. There have been violent brawls when one team beats another in an intense game, loud fighting and yelling, and intense verbal arguments as well. Emotion is also highly contagious, especially if there are many emotional people in one space.

== Binary divisions within sports==
There are many perspectives through which sport can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, and many sports sociologists have shown that those divisions can create constructs within the ideologies of gender and affect the relationships between genders, as well as advocate or challenge social and racial class structures. Some of these binary divisions include: professional vs. amateur, mass vs. top-level, active vs. passive/spectator, men vs. women, sports vs. play (as an antithesis to organized and institutionalized activity).

Not only can binary divisions be seen within sports themselves, but they are also seen in the research of sports. The field of research has mainly been dominated by men because many believe that women&#x27;s input or research is inauthentic compared to men&#x27;s research. Some women researchers also feel as though they have to &quot;earn&quot; their place within the sports research field whereas men, for the most part, do not. While women researchers in this field do have to deal with gender-related issues when it comes to their research, it does not prevent them from being able to gather and understand the data they are collecting. Sports sociologists believe that women can have a unique perspective when gathering research on sports since they are able to more closely look at and understand the female fan side of sporting events.

Following feminist or other reflexive and tradition-breaking paradigms, sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the center of various people/groups interests (connection of sports and gender, mass media, or state-politics). These perspectives provide people with different ways to think about sports and figure out the differences between the binary divisions. Sports have always been of tremendous impact to the world as a whole, as well as individual societies and the people within them. There are so many positive aspects to the world of sport, specifically, organized sport. Sports involve community values, attempting to establish and exercise good morals and ethics. Spectator sports provide watchers with an enlivenment through key societal values displayed in the &quot;game&quot;. Becoming a fan teaches you a large variety of skills as well that are a very important part of everyday life in the office, at home, and on the go. Some of these skills include teamwork, leadership, creativity, and individuality.

<text>Stetson University is a private university in DeLand, Florida, United States. Established in 1883 as DeLand Academy, it was later renamed John B. Stetson University in honor of John B. Stetson.

The university&#x27;s main campus in DeLand spans 175 acres and is composed of four colleges and schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Music, the School of Business Administration, and the Stetson University College of Law.

==History==
Stetson University was founded in 1883 as DeLand Academy after Henry Addison DeLand, the principal founder of the town. In 1887, the institution was incorporated as DeLand University. In 1889, its name was changed to John B. Stetson University to honor John B. Stetson, a hat manufacturer who made generous donations to the university and served alongside DeLand as a founding trustee.

The first director of the academy was John H. Griffith, a minister. When the college was founded, John Franklin Forbes took over as the first President. Lena B. Mathes was an early faculty member. Lincoln Hulley served as president from 1904 to 1934.

Until 1995, Stetson had an affiliation with the Florida Baptist Convention and was considered a &quot;Baptist school&quot;.

==Campus==
Stetson University is located roughly halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida in a town called DeLand, Florida. The main campus sits just north of the downtown area. The DeLand campus is home to the university&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences, School of Business Administration, School of Music, and most graduate programs.

The campus in DeLand is nationally designated by the National Register of Historic Places as the Stetson University Campus Historic District.

=== DeLand Hall ===

DeLand Hall opened in 1884. The original cost of the building was $4,000. DeLand Hall was known as the first academic building on campus. Today, it is known as the oldest building in Florida in continuous use for higher education. DeLand Hall houses the Office of the President and the offices of other administrators.

=== Lynn Business Center ===
The Lynn Business Center is home for the university&#x27;s School of Business. Constructed in 2003, Stetson&#x27;s Lynn Business Center earned LEED certification and became not only Stetson&#x27;s first green building on campus, but also the first green building in the state of Florida.

=== Lee Chapel ===
Lee Chapel is located in the historic Elizabeth Hall. It is a 100-year-old performance hall that seats 700. The acoustical properties are well-suited for classical music performances. It was built in 1897 and dedicated to the memory of John B. Stetson&#x27;s late son, Ben, who died at age 6. It is currently named after H. Douglas Lee, who served as Stetson&#x27;s eighth president from 1987 until 2009. It accommodates up to 787 people. William Sharp, an art professor, designed all the stained glass windows in the chapel. The organ is a 1961 Beckerath Organ. It is made up of 2,548 pipes and came here in 56 crates from Hamburg, Germany.

==Academics==
Stetson University offers more than 55 majors and minors leading to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Education, and Bachelor of Business Administration degree. There are 18 graduate programs in Business, Law, Education, Counseling, and Master of Fine Arts.

The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The student-faculty ratio is 12–1. Total full-time faculty in all Stetson&#x27;s colleges and schools is 265.

===College of Arts and Sciences===
With 19 academic departments and several interdisciplinary programs, the College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college on campus in terms of total undergraduate majors and total number of faculty. It includes the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, education and the arts. There is a student to faculty ratio of 12:1.

===School of Music===
Performance opportunities for students include the symphony orchestra, band, choirs, opera, musical theater, jazz, chamber music, and solo recitals. The curriculum includes degree options in performance, education, theory, and composition. Music students may combine music study with business, pre-law, and many other fields. The School of Music has been an accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1938.

===School of Business Administration===
Founded in 1897, it is accredited in both accounting and business by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The School of Business Administration offers a customized field of study within business.

===College of Law===

The Stetson University College of Law was founded in 1900 in DeLand. In 1954, the law school was relocated to Gulfport, Florida where Stetson Law still exists today. The college has been a member of the Association of American Law Schools since 1931.

===Libraries===
Before the first library was established in 1887, DeLand University had started to accumulate a small collection of books. At this time, fewer than 1,300 volumes were housed on bookshelves in Deland Hall, sharing space with the science lab. The library collection began to expand rapidly in November 1887 when the college was selected to become Florida&#x27;s first federal depository. The library has been receiving State of Florida publications since 1968.

In 1906, the university received $40,000 from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Elizabeth S. Stetson, wife of John B. Stetson, matched Carnegie&#x27;s contribution allowing for the Sampson Library to be built as a Carnegie library, one of fourteen in the state. Opening in 1908, it was named after university trustee C.T. Sampson, who was a major donor to the Stetson library fund. In 1964, the duPont-Ball Library became the campus&#x27;s new main library building.

The duPont-Ball Library&#x27;s databases provide access to 50,000 full-text journals, magazines and newspapers. As of October 2022, the library&#x27;s physical collection contains 934,251 items organized by Library of Congress Classification.

==Student life==

Stetson has approximately 20 honorary academic and professional organizations and over 100 other student organizations on campus. The Greek Community at Stetson consists of approximately 30 percent of the student body.

===Patrick Smith Model United States Senate===
Stetson University hosts a college-level Model United States Senate program (established in 1970) every year in March.

==Athletics==
Stetson is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the university&#x27;s 18 intercollegiate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams compete on the Division I level in the ASUN Conference, the Pioneer Football League (Football Championship Subdivision - FCS) and MAAC – Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. The school&#x27;s mascot is &quot;John B.&quot;, a stylized version of John B. Stetson, the benefactor for whom the university is named. The basketball, baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, sand volleyball and softball teams have either earned conference championships or gained national rankings or recognition.

Since 1970, the baseball program has earned seven ASUN Conference championships and 16 trips to the NCAA Regionals. In 2013, women&#x27;s basketball made its third NCAA tournament appearance. The team won the A-Sun Conference Championship in 2005, 2011, and 2013. Stetson also has a signature win in the 2024 NCAA regional against the University of Alabama. Stetson participated in football from 1901 until 1956 achieving an all-time record of 155–127–27 (.545). The football team earned its 100th victory in 1935. In 2010, university officials gathered information and evaluated the feasibility of starting a Division I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) non-scholarship program. In March 2011, SU President Wendy B. Libby announced the return of Hatters Football. and the addition of women&#x27;s lacrosse. In July 2011, Stetson named Roger A. Hughes as head football coach. Stetson&#x27;s sand volleyball team had its inaugural season in 2012, after the sport was officially approved for conference play. In 2013, both the lacrosse and football teams played their first games.

<text>The flag of Vatican City is the national flag of Vatican City. It was adopted in 1929, the year Pope Pius XI signed the Lateran Treaty with Italy, creating the new independent state of Vatican City.

The flag is a vertical bicolour of yellow and white, with the white half charged with the emblem of the Holy See (a papal tiara and the crossed keys of Saint Peter). It was modeled after the 1808 flag of the Papal States, a yellow-and-white bicolour defaced with the tiara and keys in the centre. It is one of only two national flags that use a 1:1 aspect ratio, along with the flag of Switzerland.

The flag of Vatican City is also referred to as the flag of the Holy See. The Holy See, which governs Vatican City, has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the worldwide Catholic Church. As a result, the flag is also a symbol of Catholic faith or identity, and it is sometimes displayed at Catholic churches.

==Description==
The 2023 Fundamental Law of Vatican City State states: &quot;The flag of the Vatican City State is made up of two vertically divided sides, one yellow adhering to the hoist and the other white, and in the latter carries the tiara with the keys, all according to the model on Annex A of this Law&quot;.

== Regulations ==

=== Current regulations ===
The flag is described in Article 23 of the 2023 Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, with a visual model appended as Attachment A.

=== Previous regulations ===
The flag is described in Article 19 of the 1929 Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, with a visual model appended as Attachment A.

The flag is also described in Article 20 of the 2000 Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, with a visual model appended as Attachment A. The 2000 Fundamental Law of Vatican City State&#x27;s Attachment A, shows a square flag.

In 2010, the Apostolic Nunciature to Germany stated that the flag does not have to be square.

==History==

Before 1808, the Papal States commonly used a bicolor, yellow-red flag, which was derived from the colours of the Holy See&#x27;s coat of arms, as well as being the two traditional colours of the Senate and the Roman people. In 1798, Napoleon established the Roman Republic, which introduced a black, white, and red flag; after the Papal rule was restored, Pope Pius VII restored the Papal cockade, which was described as red and yellow.

In 1808, Pope Pius VII ordered the Vatican&#x27;s Noble Guard and other troops to replace red color with white, in order to distinguish them from the troops that had been incorporated into Napoleon&#x27;s army.

In 1803, the Papal States started using a white merchant flag with the Papal coat of arms in the centre. This flag was made official on 7 June 1815. On 17 September 1825, it was replaced with a yellow and white flag which took its colours from the materials of the two keys (yellow for gold, white for silver). These colors were probably taken from the 1808 flag of the Palatine guard. This was the first bicolour used by the Papal States and the ancestor of the modern flag of Vatican City. The merchant flag also served as a state flag on land.

Starting in 1831, the papal infantry flew square yellow and white flags. At first, they were diagonally divided, but after 1849 they were vertically divided like the merchant flag. The last infantry colour, adopted in 1862, was a plain square white and yellow flag.

On 8 February 1849, while Pope Pius IX was in exile in Gaeta, a Roman Republic was declared. The new government&#x27;s flag was the Italian tricolor with the motto &quot;Dio e Popolo&quot; on the central stripe. The papal government and its flags were restored on 2 July 1849. On 20 September 1870, the Papal States were conquered by Italy.

After the Lateran Treaty was signed in 1929, papal authorities decided to use the 1825–1870 merchant flag as the state flag of the soon to be independent Vatican City state. The treaty came into effect on 7 June 1929.

=== Previous versions ===
== Raising of the flag at the United Nations ==
Since September 2015, the United Nations headquarters has begun displaying the flags of UN observer states alongside the 193 member state flags. On September 25, 2015, the flag of the Holy See was raised for the first time at the UN headquarters.

== Incorrect version ==
An incorrect version of the flag has been commonly used. In this version, the visible inner lining of the papal tiara is colored red instead of white, and a different shade of yellow or gold is used in some portions of the coat of arms. This version has been said to be due to a depiction of the Vatican flag used on Wikimedia Commons between 2006 and 2007 and between 2017 and 2022, widespread on the Internet, but it pre-dates Commons. 

==Controversies==
During Pope Francis&#x27;s 2018 visit to Ireland, the South Dublin County Council refused to fly the Vatican flag; a local petrol station began to fly the flag in response.

A Police Scotland list of flags which could be a criminal offence to display &quot;in a threatening manner&quot; included the Vatican flag; sectarianism is common in Scotland, especially in Glasgow, and the Vatican flag could supposedly be flown as a sign of Catholic identity to intimidate Protestant neighbours.

<doc id="169915" wikidata="Q223440" url="?curid=169915" title="Lucius Junius Brutus">
<text>Lucius Junius Brutus (died ) was the semi-legendary founder of the Roman Republic, and traditionally one of its first consuls in 509 BC. He was reputedly responsible for the expulsion of his uncle the Roman king Tarquinius Superbus after the suicide of Lucretia, which led to the overthrow of the Roman monarchy. He was involved in the abdication of fellow consul Tarquinius Collatinus, and executed two of his sons for plotting the restoration of the Tarquins.

He was claimed as an ancestor of the Roman gens Junia, including Decimus Junius Brutus, and Marcus Junius Brutus, the most infamous of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassins. Traditions about his life may have been fictional, and some scholars argue that it was the Etruscan king Porsenna who overthrew Tarquinius. The plebeian status of the &quot;Junia gens&quot; has also raised doubts about his position as a consul and the alleged initial patrician domination of the office. Depicted as the nephew of Tarquinius, he may have symbolized the internal tensions that occurred during the transition between the monarchy and the republic.

== Background and historicity ==
Prior to the establishment of the Roman Republic, Rome had been ruled by kings. 

The account is from Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; and deals with a point in the history of Rome prior to reliable historical records (virtually all prior records were destroyed by the Gauls when they sacked Rome under Brennus in 390 BC or 387 BC).

Modern historians have challenged almost every part of the traditional story from Livy:

==Overthrow of the monarchy==

According to Roman tradition, Brutus led the revolt that overthrew the last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. The coup was prompted by the rape of the noblewoman Lucretia by a son of the king, Sextus Tarquinius; Brutus was joined in this plotting by among others, Lucretia&#x27;s father, Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus and Publius Valerius Poplicola.

Brutus was the son of Tarquinia, daughter of Rome&#x27;s fifth king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus and sister to Rome&#x27;s seventh king Tarquinius Superbus.

According to Livy, Brutus had a number of grievances against his uncle the king. Amongst them was the fact that Tarquinius had put to death a number of the chief men of Rome, including Brutus&#x27; brother. Brutus avoided the distrust of Tarquinius&#x27;s family by feigning that he was slow-witted (in Latin &quot;brutus&quot; translates to dullard).

He accompanied Tarquinius&#x27;s sons on a trip to the Oracle of Delphi. The sons asked the oracle which of them was going to be Rome&#x27;s next king. The Oracle of Delphi responded that the first among them to kiss their mother &quot;shall hold supreme sway in Rome.&quot; Brutus interpreted &quot;mother&quot; to mean Gaia, so he pretended to trip and kissed the ground.

Brutus, along with Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, Publius Valerius Poplicola, and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus were summoned by Lucretia to Collatia after she had been raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the king Tarquinius Superbus. Lucretia, believing that the rape dishonoured her and her family, committed suicide by stabbing herself with a dagger after telling of what had befallen her. According to legend, Brutus grabbed the dagger from Lucretia&#x27;s breast after her death and immediately shouted for the overthrow of the Tarquins.

The four men gathered the youth of Collatia, then went to Rome where Brutus, being at that time &quot;Tribunus Celerum&quot;, summoned the people to the forum and exhorted them to rise up against the king. The people voted for the deposition of the king, and the banishment of the royal family.

The leaders of the revolt were close relatives of the king: Brutus was the king&#x27;s nephew and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus was king&#x27;s cousin. The king, who was conducting a war near and camped at Ardea, rushed to Rome on news of the coup, but found the city barred; at the same time, the coup leaders won over the army and then expelled the king&#x27;s sons. Tarquinius Superbus fled with his family into exile.

In the aftermath following the overthrow Brutus is credited by later historians such as Tacitus as &quot;establishing liberty and the consulate&quot;.

=== The Oath of Brutus ===
According to Livy, Brutus&#x27; first act after the expulsion of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was to bring the people to swear an oath never to allow any man again to be king in Rome.

: (First of all, by swearing an oath that they would suffer no man to rule Rome, it forced the people, desirous of a new liberty, not to be thereafter swayed by the entreaties or bribes of kings.)

This is, fundamentally, a restatement of the &#x27;private oath&#x27; sworn by the conspirators to overthrow the monarchy:

: (By this guiltless blood before the kingly injustice I swear – you and the gods as my witnesses – I make myself the one who will prosecute, by what force I am able, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus along with his wicked wife and the whole house of his freeborn children by sword, by fire, by any means hence, so that neither they nor any one else be suffered to rule Rome.)

There is no scholarly agreement that the oath took place; it is reported, although differently, by Plutarch (&quot;Poplicola&quot;, 2) and Appian (&quot;B.C.&quot; 2.119). Nevertheless, the spirit of the oath inspired later Romans including his descendant Marcus Junius Brutus.

==Consulship and death==
Brutus and Lucretia&#x27;s bereaved husband, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, were elected as the first consuls of Rome (509 BC). Tradition says that this election was conducted by Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, whom Brutus had appointed as interrex in his position as &quot;tribunus celerum&quot;. Brutus&#x27; first acts during his consulship, according to Livy, included administering an oath to the people of Rome to never again accept a king in Rome (see above) and replenishing the number of senators to 300 from the principal men of the equites. 

Later-day Romans attributed many institutions to Brutus, including:
* the taking of auspices before entering office,
* use of the Curiate Assembly to bestow consular &quot;imperium&quot;,
* alternation of fasces between the consuls (also attributed to others),
* expansion of the senate in adding the &quot;minores gentes&quot;, and
* dedication of a temple to Carna on the Coelian hill.

The new consuls also created a new office of rex sacrorum to carry out the religious duties that had previously been performed by the kings.

During his consulship the royal family made an attempt to regain the throne, firstly by their ambassadors seeking to subvert a number of the leading Roman citizens in the Tarquinian conspiracy. Amongst the conspirators were two brothers of Brutus&#x27; wife, Vitellia, and Brutus&#x27; two sons: Titus Junius Brutus and Tiberius Junius Brutus. The conspiracy was discovered and the consuls determined to punish the conspirators with death. Brutus gained respect for his stoicism in watching the execution of his own sons, even though he showed emotion during the punishment. Following this, he either forced his co-consul Collatinus to resign or otherwise had him removed – either because of enmity to his relationship to the Tarquins or due to his lack of harshness in punishing the conspirators – and then presided over the election of a suffect consul, Publius Valerius Poplicola.

Tarquinius again sought to retake the throne soon after at the Battle of Silva Arsia, leading the forces of Tarquinii and Veii against the Roman army. Valerius led the infantry, and Brutus led the cavalry. Arruns Tarquinius, the king&#x27;s son, led the Etruscan cavalry. The cavalry joined the battle and Arruns, having spied from afar the lictors, and thereby recognising the presence of a consul, soon saw that Brutus was in command of the cavalry. The two men, who were cousins, charged each other, and speared each other to death. The infantry also soon joined the battle, the result being in doubt for some time. The right wing of each army was victorious, the army of Tarquinii forcing back the Romans, and the Veientes being routed. However the Etruscan forces eventually fled the field, the Romans claiming the victory.

Some time during his consulship, he is supposed to have signed a treaty with Carthage and dedicated the Capitoline temple, reported in Polybius. This, along with the unanimous reporting of Roman sources, is the main evidence of his historicity.

The surviving consul, Valerius, after celebrating a triumph for the victory, held a funeral for Brutus with much magnificence. The Roman noblewomen mourned him for one year, for his vengeance of Lucretia&#x27;s violation.

== Brutus in literature and art ==
The profile of Lucius Junius Brutus is on a coin that was minted by Marcus Junius Brutus following the assassination of Julius Caesar.

Lucius Junius Brutus is prominent in English literature, and he was popular among British and American Whigs.

A reference to Lucius Junius Brutus is in the following lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tragedie of Julius Cæsar&quot;, (Cassius to Marcus Brutus, Act 1, Scene 2).

: &quot;O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
: There was a Brutus once that would have brookt
: Th&#x27;eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
: As easily as a king.&quot;

One of the main charges of the senatorial faction that plotted against Julius Caesar after he had the Roman Senate declare him dictator for life, was that he was attempting to make himself a king, and a co-conspirator Cassius, enticed Brutus&#x27; direct descendant, Marcus Junius Brutus, to join the conspiracy by referring to his ancestor.

Lucius Junius Brutus is a leading character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Rape of Lucrece&quot;, in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; based on André Obey&#x27;s play &quot;Le Viol de Lucrèce&quot;, and in Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s Restoration tragedy, &quot;Lucius Junius Brutus; Father of his Country&quot;. Before the Glorious Revolution, Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s Lucius Junius Brutus was banned in December of 1680 for portraying the Whig cause (Protestantism, no royal prerogatives, encouragement to trade and industry, empire) as Roman republicanism.

Lucius Junius Brutus (referred to simply as &quot;Brutus&quot;) is discussed briefly in Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s work, &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;. There, Brutus serves as an example of what Kierkegaard calls &quot;tragic heroism.&quot; Alongside the examples of Agamemnon and Jephthah, the tragic heroism of Brutus is presented in stark contrast to the faith of the Biblical figure, Abraham.

In &quot;The Mikado&quot;, the protagonist Nanki-poo refers to his father the Emperor as &quot;the Lucius Junius Brutus of his race&quot;, for being willing to enforce his own law even if it means killing his son.

The memory of L. J. Brutus also had a profound impact on Italian patriots, including those who established the ill-fated short-lived Roman Republic in February 1849.

Brutus was a hero of republicanism during the Enlightenment and Neoclassical periods. In 1789, at the dawn of the French Revolution, master painter Jacques-Louis David publicly exhibited his politically charged master-work, &quot;The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons&quot;, to great controversy. David&#x27;s contemporary, Guillaume Guillon-Lethière depicted the scene of Brutus&#x27; sons&#x27; executions in grand style in his work &quot;Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death&quot; (1788).
