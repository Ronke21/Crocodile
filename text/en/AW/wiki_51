<text>Fishbone is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1979, the band plays a fusion of ska, punk, funk, metal, reggae, and soul. AllMusic has described the group as &quot;one of the most distinctive and eclectic alternative rock bands of the late &#x27;80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious diversity, goofy sense of humor, and sharp social commentary, the group gained a sizable cult following&quot;.

Fishbone first assembled as school students in 1979 with John Norwood Fisher (bass), his brother Philip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher (drums), Angelo Moore (vocals, saxophones, theremin), Kendall Jones (guitar), &quot;Dirty&quot; Walter A. Kibby II (vocals, trumpet), and Christopher Dowd (keyboards, trombone, vocals). They achieved their greatest commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which they went through many personnel changes. From 2003 to 2010, John Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore were the last remaining original members of the band. In the 2010s, all the other original members except Kendall Jones rejoined the band for various reunion tours and anniversary activities. As of January 2025, the lineup consists of Moore, Dowd, guitarist Tracey &quot;Spacey T&quot; Singleton, drummer Hassan Hurd, trumpeter JS Williams, and bassist Jeffrey Connor.

==History==
===Early career (1979–1987)===
Fishbone got started in 1979 as a &quot;disparate, all-black oddball crew&quot; when the members were in junior high school. The Fisher brothers, Jones, Dowd, and Kibby were all from South Central Los Angeles and were included in a school busing program that sent them daily to the San Fernando Valley, where they met Moore, who was native to the area. After first using the name Megatron with Titus Norris on vocals, the sextet adopted the name Fishbone and formed a unique stew of different styles that became popular in the Los Angeles club scene and was a great influence on several subsequent alternative bands. Their first club date was at Madame Wong&#x27;s, the influential venue in Los Angeles&#x27;s Chinatown that had been a showcase for a variety of seminal punk bands in the 1980s. They formed strong friendships with Los Angeles bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Thelonious Monster, and Psi Com. Fishbone were signed to Columbia Records in 1983 after being spotted at a club gig by Brian O&#x27;Neal of The BusBoys. Their first release was the 1985 single &quot;Party at Ground Zero&quot;, followed by a self-titled EP, &quot;Fishbone&quot; produced by David Kahne. They released their first full-length album &quot;In Your Face&quot; in 1986, and the following year they performed &quot;Jamaica Ska&quot; in the Annette Funicello/Frankie Avalon reunion movie &quot;Back to the Beach&quot;. Fishbone&#x27;s first major international tour was as the opening act for Beastie Boys on the 1987 &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; tour.

===Rise to fame (1988–1994)===
Fishbone was primarily considered a ska and funk band during their early years, but later became more guitar-driven with a focus on rock and soul music. The 1988 album &quot;Truth and Soul&quot; brought Fishbone wide critical acclaim. With this album, the band also added social commentary to their lyrics, covering topics such as the breakup of families, contemporary racism, fascism, nuclear war, and oppression in lower income housing projects. The album was highlighted by a hard rock-inspired version of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s classic &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; from the film &quot;Super Fly&quot;. The music video, directed by Douglas Gayeton, became the band&#x27;s first hit on MTV. That same year, the group toured with Red Hot Chili Peppers and became nationally known in the burgeoning alternative music scene. Also that year, Fishbone and Little Richard recorded the Lead Belly song &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; for the tribute album &quot;&quot;.

The band added former Miles Davis sideman John Bigham on guitar and keyboards in 1989. The 1991 album &quot;The Reality of My Surroundings&quot; was a critical and commercial success, reaching #49 on the Billboard albums chart. One month before the album&#x27;s release, the group played a performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; of &quot;Sunless Saturday,&quot; a song which later featured an MTV video directed by Spike Lee. The song &quot;Everyday Sunshine&quot; also became a modest hit on radio and MTV.

While the band retained their roots in funk and ska, the 1993 album &quot;Give a Monkey a Brain and He&#x27;ll Swear He&#x27;s the Center of the Universe&quot; included songs with free jazz, hard rock, punk, and heavy metal elements. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, the band began to tear apart internally. Just before Fishbone joined the 1993 Lollapalooza tour, guitarist Kendall Jones was accused of mental instability and quit the band, moving to Northern California. Bassist John Norwood Fisher tracked Jones down in the belief that he needed rescue from a religious cult, only to be charged with attempted kidnapping; Fisher was acquitted at trial. A benefit concert to help with Fisher&#x27;s legal expenses featured Porno for Pyros, Primus, Tool, and Alice in Chains. Keyboardist Christopher Dowd left Fishbone in 1994 and released an album titled &quot;Puzzle&quot; in 1997 under the name The Seedy Arkhestra, with various guests including Jeff Buckley and N&#x27;Dea Davenport. The album included an anti-Fishbone song called &quot;Flog Your Dead Horse.&quot;

===Post-Sony years (1995–2002)===
Now a five-piece, Fishbone was dropped by Sony Records (formerly Columbia) in 1995, upon presenting their next album. The band added more heavy metal and hardcore punk influences to their sound on the 1996 concept album &quot;Chim Chim&#x27;s Badass Revenge&quot;, released by Rowdy Records and produced by Dallas Austin. The album went largely unnoticed by the general public, peaking at just #158 on the Billboard albums chart. In 1996, the band contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1998 the band lost another founding member, drummer Philip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher, who became a session drummer and later appeared in the heavy metal band Wicked Wisdom. After brief periods with various drummers, the position was filled definitively by John Steward. John Bigham also left the band during this period to pursue his own career, later founding the band The Soul of John Black; Bigham was replaced by former Sound Barrier and Mother&#x27;s Finest guitarist Tracey &quot;Spacey T&quot; Singleton. Keyboardist and horn player Anthony Brewster (The Untouchables) was a member of the group from 1997 to 1998, while John McKnight (from Ben Harper&#x27;s band) joined on keyboards, trombone, and guitar. During the latter part of the 1990s, Fishbone was without a recording contract and earned their keep through constant touring.

Fishbone maintained their dedicated fan base and achieved another major record deal with Hollywood Records in 2000. They were given the chance to record a new album with several special guests, including H.R. of Bad Brains, Gwen Stefani, George Clinton, Rick James, Donny Osmond, and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The resulting album, &quot;Fishbone and the Familyhood Nextperience Present: The Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx&quot;, saw poor sales, though AllMusic called it the band&#x27;s best album in a decade. The band was dropped from Hollywood Records and headed back on the road. John McKnight left the band in 2001, and the group continued as a five-piece. In 2002, on their own independent record label, they released &quot;Live at the Temple Bar and More&quot; which contained all new songs recorded live throughout 2001 and 2002. This was later complemented by a live CD/DVD, &quot;Live in Amsterdam&quot;, containing most of their hits and filmed at the 2002 Cannabis Cup Festival in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

===Shifting membership and a documentary (2003–2015)===

In late 2003 Fishbone lost another founding member when Walter Kibby left the band. Guitarist Tracy Singleton departed as well. After leaving Fishbone, Kibby released two albums with his band Dirty Walt &amp; The Columbus Sanitation: &quot;To Put It Bluntly&quot; (2000) and &quot;Still Smokin&#x27; &quot;(2009). Kibby and Singleton also collaborated in the band Year of the Dragon, releasing the albums &quot;A Time to Love Is a Time to Bleed&quot; (2006) and &quot;Blunt Force Karma&quot; (2009). Together, they also recorded tracks with Swade G (Kibby&#x27;s younger brother Wade Antonio Kibby) for the album &quot;Ghetto Life&quot; (2010).

After the 2003 departure of Kibby and Singleton, the last two founding members John Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore, along with drummer John Steward, restarted Fishbone with Rocky George of Suicidal Tendencies and Tori Ruffin of The Time on guitars (though Ruffin left soon thereafter), and Dre Gipson on keyboards. In 2005 John McKnight returned on trombone and guitar. Trumpet players during this period were PaDre Holmes, Fernando Pullum, Mervin Campbell, and Curtis Storey. The line-up of Fisher, Moore, Steward, George, Gipson, Storey, and McKnight recorded the studio album &quot;Still Stuck in Your Throat&quot; with producer David Kahne, who had worked on the band&#x27;s early albums. The album was released in October 2006 in Europe, and in April 2007 in the United States. Music videos were recorded for the cover song &quot;Date Rape&quot; by Sublime, and for the song &quot;Let Dem Ho&#x27;s Fight.&quot;

In 2008 and 2009, departed original members Walter Kibby, Christopher Dowd, and Kendall Jones joined Fishbone on stage on various occasions, most notably for the shoot of the Pepsi &quot;Pass&quot; commercial, which aired in January 2009. In April 2008, Stephan Kraemer directed the shoot of a live CD/DVD recorded in Bordeaux, France. The DVD &quot;Fishbone Live&quot; was released on May 10, 2009.

In January 2010, John McKnight left Fishbone for the second time. During this period original member Walter Kibby returned on trumpet and vocals. During a 2011 tour, Tom &quot;Tom-Bone&quot; Ralls, formerly of Weapon of Choice, filled in on trombone. Tori Ruffin also briefly returned to play guitar in place of Rocky George, who was unable to tour. After the tour, Jay Armant, a former student of Fernando Pullum, joined as the new trombone player. Fishbone released a seven-track EP titled &quot;Crazy Glue&quot; on October 11, 2011.

Current and former members of the band were deeply involved in the making of the documentary film &quot;Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone&quot;, directed by Lev Anderson and Chris Metzler. Narrated by Laurence Fishburne and featuring interviews with Les Claypool, Gwen Stefani, Flea, Branford Marsalis, George Clinton, Ice-T, and Gogol Bordello, the film debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 19, 2010. The film has screened at more than 100 film festivals in twenty countries, winning 12 awards for Best Documentary. One of the top-reviewed documentaries of 2011–2012, the film has a ranking of 100% on RottenTomatoes.com and was nominated for a Golden Tomato Award. The film was rolled out in United States theaters nationwide with bookings in over seventy-five cities, including extended runs in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, plus week-long engagements in 20+ cities including Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Portland, Detroit, New Orleans, Baltimore, and Kansas City. A DVD was released by The Cinema Guild on February 21, 2012, and received a national TV broadcast on the public television series &quot;AfroPoP&quot;.

In February 2013, keyboardist Dre Gipson left the band after nine years to focus on a new project called Hunter Green. Fishbone was in the midst of a US tour, and reggae musician Freddie Flint filled in temporarily on keyboards. In July 2013, Paul Hampton (formerly of The Skeletones) joined as Fishbone&#x27;s new keyboardist. In February 2014, federal judge Jan E. DuBois ruled that Fishbone had to pay $1.4 million to a woman who suffered a fractured skull and collarbone during a 2010 concert in Philadelphia when Angelo Moore stage-dove and landed on top of her. A five-track EP titled &quot;Intrinsically Intertwined&quot; was released on April 22, 2014.

===Original lineup reforms and disbands again (2016–present)===
On November 18, 2016, founding member and original drummer Philip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher played his first show with the band since his departure in 1998. On November 26, Fishbone performed at a Jimi Hendrix tribute concert at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater, at which time drummer John Steward departed Fishbone after 18 years to make room for the returning Fish. In January 2017 the band announced a tour to commemorate the 1996 album &quot;Chim Chim&#x27;s Badass Revenge&quot;. Former guitarist John Bigham returned to the band, after which Rocky George departed after 14 years of service. 

In late 2017 Moore, Kibby, and John Norwood Fisher were featured on the song &quot;Creatures of Habit&quot; by John Heintz&#x27;s funk-rock supergroup The Big Ol&#x27; Nasty Getdown. Their song &quot;Creatures of Habit&quot; was chosen for the &quot;New York Times&quot; top ten playlist on January 5, 2018. Fisher played bass for The Big Ol&#x27; Nasty Getdown song &quot;Mantra&quot; while he and Moore have made several appearances on subsequent albums by the supergroup. 

In January 2018, Christopher Dowd made a guest appearance with the band onstage and decided to rejoin, thus replacing both trombonist Jay Armant and keyboardist Paul Hampton. The band&#x27;s 2018 lineup consisted of Angelo Moore, John Norwood Fisher, Fish, Walter Kibby, Christopher Dowd, and John Bigham, thus recreating the classic Fishbone lineup minus Kendall Jones. In December 2019, John Bigham announced that he was no longer playing with Fishbone to focus on his solo work. Guitarist Mark Phillips joined the band shortly thereafter. In November 2020, Kendall Jones made a rare appearance with the band for a performance of &quot;Them Bones&quot; by Alice in Chains for a tribute to the band arranged by the Museum of Pop Culture. Phillip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher left the group again in late 2021, after which John Steward rejoined on drums.

On May 26, 2023, Fishbone released a self-titled EP, including one song in collaboration with NOFX. In January 2024, Steward left the band for a second time. On April 25, 2024, Fishbone made a vague post on Facebook, indicating a major lineup change for their upcoming live dates. The following day, Dowd revealed that Fisher and Kibby had left the band due to disagreements over songwriting and recording schedules. Dowd and Moore vowed to continue, alongside new musicians to be announced, as Fishbone. This left Moore as the only member who has been with Fishbone throughout its entire history; Dowd was also a founding member but with a lengthy hiatus before rejoining. New members Aroyn Day, Hassan Hurd, and JS Williams were added. Guitarist Mark Phillips left the band four months later, and was replaced by Tracey &quot;Spacey T&quot; Singleton who had previously left the band in 2003.

In October 2024, the new lineup released the single &quot;Racist Piece of Shit&quot;, denouncing Donald Trump.

<text>Beat Happening was an American indie pop band formed in Olympia, Washington, in 1982. Calvin Johnson, Heather Lewis, and Bret Lunsford have been the band&#x27;s continual members. Beat Happening were early leaders in the American indie pop and lo-fi movements, noted for their use of primitive recording techniques, disregard for the technical aspects of musicianship, and songs with subject matters of a carefree or coy nature.

==History==
===Formation===
Beat Happening met while attending the Evergreen State College and began recording in 1983. The band took its name from a student art film, &quot;Beatnik Happening&quot;, made by Bret&#x27;s girlfriend. The band&#x27;s basic line-up was drums, guitar, and vocals, though when they formed, their only instruments were a pair of maracas and a Sears Silvertone guitar purchased at a thrift shop. Heather once joked in an interview that the history of the band could be told through a list of the various people whose drums they had borrowed. Heather and Calvin had been members of a previous band and approached Bret, who had no musical experience at the time, saying they ought to start a band and go to Japan.

Early recordings made use of an Echoplex machine to add heavy reverb to Bret&#x27;s guitar, in an attempt to mask his poor performance.

The band traveled to Tokyo in 1984 with intentions of touring. Their first show in Japan was at the high school of a former exchange student Calvin knew. The band members recorded &quot;Three Tea Breakfast&quot;, a five-song EP that marked the band&#x27;s first release.

===Studio albums===
&quot;Beat Happening&quot; (1985), their full-length debut, was critically acclaimed, as was &quot;Jamboree&quot; (1988). By the release of &quot;Dreamy&quot; in 1991, Beat Happening was one of the most popular bands in the indie rock community, leading to their pivotal role in the International Pop Underground Convention, which brought anti-corporate rock its earliest mainstream acceptance. Their last full-length album was 1992&#x27;s &quot;You Turn Me On&quot;, which represented the band breaking many of their established conventions from earlier albums, most notably on &quot;Godsend&quot;, which runs 9 minutes and features blatant use of multitrack recording. The album was described by allmusic.com as a &quot;masterpiece.&quot; Though never announcing a break-up and claiming at one point to still practice once a month, the members of Beat Happening have moved on to various other projects. In 2000 they released the &quot;Angel Gone&quot; single, their first new release in eight years.

&quot;Crashing Through&quot;, which collects all of the band&#x27;s officially released music except for two of their tracks from a live cassette split with The Vaselines, was released in 2002. The box set included a booklet containing a lengthy essay on the history and impact of the band by Lois Maffeo, as well as rare photos of Calvin, Heather, and Bret.

In September 2015, the band announced the release of a new compilation spanning their entire career entitled &quot;Look Around&quot;, which was released by Domino Records on 20 November 2015.

With the full cooperation of the band and Calvin&#x27;s K Records label, Domino released a vinyl box set of the entire Beat Happening discography, &quot;We Are Beat Happening&quot;, in November of 2019.

===Influence===
The English indie-pop band This Many Boyfriends are named after a Beat Happening song - namely The This Many Boyfriends Club. The Swedish band Friendly Boyfriend, likened to a &quot;corrupted Beat Happening,&quot; has a name that recalls the lyric &quot;You got a friendly boyfriend&quot; from Beat Happening&#x27;s song &quot;T.V. Girl.&quot; The United States band The Snogs have also been compared to Beat Happening, and have released tracks such as &quot;Tastes Like Candy,&quot; &quot;Couple of Sleepyheads,&quot; and Teenage Sleepyhead&quot; recalling Beat Happening song titles &quot;Black Candy&quot; and &quot;Sleepy Head.&quot; 

Beat Happening&#x27;s live performances stood out for Calvin&#x27;s dancing moves (pogo, hula, and shimmy), which he&#x27;d seen on news reports about UK punks. His onstage behavior did not ingratiate the band to hardcore audiences when they toured with Fugazi in the late 1980s, and audiences were openly hostile, even throwing an ashtray at the band. Nonetheless, rock critic Michael Azzerrad suggests that Beat Happening &quot;was a major force in widening the idea of a punk rocker from a mohawked guy in a motorcycle jacket to a nerdy girl in a cardigan.&quot; The presence of Heather Lewis on drums and Calvin&#x27;s non-threatening stage presence presented a wider variety of behaviors and identities than other acts in the hardcore scene of the time, which was predominantly male and focused on aggression or hyper-masculinity. Beat Happening has been cited as an influence on early riot grrl acts such as Bratmobile and Kathi Wilcox of Bikini Kill. Kurt Cobain had the K Records logo tattooed on his forearm, saying it was to &quot;try and remind me to stay a child.&quot; The song &quot;Lounge Act&quot; on &quot;Nevermind&quot; references his logo tattoo in the line, “I&#x27;ll arrest myself and wear a shield.” Cobain also played guitar on a K Records release, &quot;Bikini Twilight,&quot; with Johnson, released as The Go Team.

Calvin Johnson was one of the founders of indie-rock label K Records, and comprised one-half of the indie pop band The Go Team, along with Tobi Vail; they had an approach and aesthetic similar to that of Beat Happening.

===Current status===
Though not officially broken up, the band has not performed together in public since the early 1990s.

<doc id="171225" wikidata="Q156957" url="?curid=171225" title="Amelanchier">
<text>Amelanchier ( ), also known as shadbush, shadwood or shadblow, serviceberry or sarvisberry (or just sarvis), juneberry, saskatoon, sugarplum, wild-plum or chuckley pear, is a genus of about 20 species of deciduous-leaved shrubs and small trees in the rose family (Rosaceae).

&quot;Amelanchier&quot; is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxonomically in North America, especially in the northeastern United States and adjacent southeastern Canada, and at least one species is native to every U.S. state except Hawaii and to every Canadian province and territory. Two species also occur in Asia, and one in Europe. 

The taxonomic classification of shadbushes has long perplexed botanists, horticulturalists, and others, as suggested by the range in number of species recognized in the genus, from 6 to 33, in two recent publications. A major source of complexity comes from the occurrence of hybridization, polyploidy, and apomixis (asexual seed production), making species difficult to characterize and identify.

A pome fruit, the berries are commonly consumed by wildlife and picked by humans for uses in baked goods. The Canadian city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after the berry via a Cree term describing the sweet fruit which was wild-harvested for food by Aboriginal people and early settlers of western Canada.

==Description==
The various species of &quot;Amelanchier&quot; grow to tall; some are small trees, some are multistemmed, clump-forming shrubs, and yet others form extensive low shrubby patches (clones). The bark is gray or less often brown, and in tree species smooth or fissuring when older. The leaves are deciduous, cauline, alternate, simple, lanceolate to elliptic to orbiculate, 0.5–10 x 0.5–5.5 cm, thin to coriaceous, with surfaces above glabrous or densely tomentose at flowering, and glabrous or more or less hairy beneath at maturity.

The inflorescences are terminal, with 1–20 flowers, erect or drooping, either in clusters of one to four flowers, or in racemes with 4–20 flowers. The flowers have five white (rarely somewhat pink, yellow, or streaked with red), linear to orbiculate petals, 2.6–25 mm long, with the petals in one species (&quot;A. nantucketensis&quot;) often andropetalous (bearing apical microsporangia adaxially). The flowers appear in early spring, &quot;when the shad run&quot; according to North-American tradition (leading to names such as &quot;shadbush&quot;). The fruit is a berry-like pome, red to purple to nearly black at maturity, 5–15 mm diameter, insipid to delectably sweet, maturing in summer.

&quot;Amelanchier&quot; plants are valued horticulturally, and their fruits are important to wildlife. Some orchards are cultivated in the Canadian prairie provinces which are subjected to severe winter cold of , indicating the hardiness of the plant having a lifespan up to 50 years.

==Species==

Species accepted by the Plants of the World Online as of :

===Natural hybrids===
* &quot;Amelanchier × lamarckii&quot; ( A. arborea × A. laevis.)– Juneberry
* &quot;Amelanchier × neglecta&quot; (A. bartramiana × A. laevis.)
* &quot;Amelanchier × quinti-martii&quot; (A. arborea × A. bartramiana. )
* &quot;Amelanchier × spicata&quot; (A. alnifolia × A. humilis.) - low juneberry

===Garden hybrids===
Since classifications have varied greatly over the past century, species names are often used interchangeably in the nursery trade. Several natural or horticultural hybrids also exist, and many &quot;A. arborea&quot; and &quot;A. canadensis&quot; plants that are offered for sale are actually hybrids, or entirely different species. &quot;A&quot;. × &quot;grandiflora&quot; is another hybrid of garden origin, between &quot;A. arborea&quot; and &quot;A. laevis&quot;. The cultivar &#x27;La Paloma&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

A taxon called &quot;Amelanchier lamarckii&quot; (or &quot;A.&quot; x &quot;lamarckii&quot;) is very widely cultivated and naturalized in Europe, where it was introduced in the 17th century. It is apomictic, breeding true from seed, and probably of hybrid origin, perhaps descending from a cross between &quot;A. laevis&quot; and either &quot;A. arborea&quot; or &quot;A. canadensis&quot;. While &quot;A. lamarckii&quot; is known to be of North American origin, probably from eastern Canada, it is not known to occur naturally in the wild in North America.

==Etymology==

The origin of the generic name &quot;Amelanchier&quot; is probably derived from &quot;amalenquièr&quot;, &quot;amelanchièr&quot;, the Provençal names of the European &quot;Amelanchier ovalis&quot;.

The name &quot;serviceberry&quot; comes from the similarity of the fruit to the related European &quot;Sorbus&quot;. Juneberry refers to the fruits of certain species becoming ripe in June. The name saskatoon originated from a Cree noun &quot;misâskwatômina&quot; (&quot;misāskwatōmina&quot;, &quot;misaaskwatoomina&quot;) for &quot;Amelanchier alnifolia&quot;. The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is named after this plant.

Shadberry refers to the shad runs in certain New England streams, which generally took place about when the trees bloomed.

==Ecology==
&quot;Amelanchier&quot; plants are preferred browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as the brimstone moth, brown-tail, grey dagger, mottled umber, rough prominent, satellite, winter moth, red-spotted purple and white admiral (both &quot;Limenitis arthemis&quot;), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on &quot;Amelanchier.&quot; Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and &quot;Gymnosporangium&quot; rust. In years when late flowers of &quot;Amelanchier&quot; overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.

==Uses and cultivation==

The fruit of several species is safe to eat raw, possessing a mild sweetness strongly accented by the almond-like flavour of the seeds. Selections from &quot;Amelanchier alnifolia&quot; have been chosen for fruit production, with several named cultivars. Other cultivars appear to be derived from hybridization between &quot;A. alnifolia&quot; and &quot;A. stolonifera&quot;. Propagation is by seed, divisions, and grafting. Serviceberries graft so readily that grafts onto other genera, such as &quot;Crataegus&quot; and &quot;Sorbus&quot;, are often successful.

The fruit can be harvested for pies, muffins, jams, and wine. The saskatoon berry is harvested commercially. One version of the Native American food pemmican was flavored by serviceberry fruits in combination with minced dried meat and fat.

The wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The heartwood is reddish-brown, and the sapwood is lighter in color. It can be used for tool handles and fishing rods. Native Americans used it for arrow shafts. Members of the Pit River Tribe would use the wood to create a sort of body armor, crafting it into a heavy robe or overcoat and corset armor worn during fighting.

===Garden history===
Several species are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their flowers, bark, and fall color. All need similar conditions to grow well, requiring good drainage, air circulation (to discourage leaf diseases), watering during drought, and soil appropriate for the species.

George Washington planted specimens of &quot;Amelanchier&quot; on the grounds of his estate, Mount Vernon, in Virginia.

<text>The Orchids are a Scottish band. Formed in Penilee in Glasgow in 1985, the Orchids released a series of underground singles on Sarah Records. The group&#x27;s line-up was James Hackett (vocals), Pauline Hynds Bari (vocals), John Scally (guitar), Chris Quinn (drums), Matthew Drummond (guitar), and James Moody (bass). Their producer, Ian Carmichael, often played keyboards on their records. They changed their line-up in 1993 when Moody left. Ronnie Borland, a long time collaborator and supporter of the band, then took over on bass. They went quiet after their 1994 album release, their last on Sarah Records, resurfacing in 1995 to play at the Sarah Records farewell party. After that they took a break until 2004 when they reformed.

Starting with a melancholy guitar pop sound on &quot;Lyceum&quot; and contemporaneous singles, they moved on to become more keyboard and sample/effects-based for their second and third albums, &quot;Unholy Soul&quot; and &quot;Striving For the Lazy Perfection&quot;, developing a more electronic sound, possibly as a result of their producer, Ian Carmichael, who was a member of dance band One Dove.
Their entire back catalogue was re-released on CD on LTM in 2005. In 2007, they released their fourth album, &quot;Good to Be a Stranger&quot;. The album was issued on Madrid based label Siesta, with the band playing live gigs for the first time in eleven years. In 2010, the group released a fifth album, &quot;The Lost Star&quot;, through Pebble Records, mixed by a returning Ian Carmichael. In October 2014, they released their sixth album, &quot;Beatitude#9&quot;, under another Spanish record label, Acurela.

In September 2017, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their first physical release (a flexi disc on the sha la la label), they released a retrospective featuring 20 &quot;best of&quot; songs from their singles and albums, plus an 18 track rarities disc. Titled, &quot;Who Needs Tomorrow... A 30 Year Retrospective&quot;, was released on Cherry Red Records.

Their most recent album, &quot;Dreaming Kind&quot;, was released on Skep Wax Records on 2 September 2022.

<doc id="171228" wikidata="Q7733724" url="?curid=171228" title="The Field Mice">
<text>The Field Mice were an English indie pop band on the independent record label Sarah Records. They had top 20 success in both the singles and albums UK Independent Charts.

==Career==
The Field Mice initially formed as a duo from South London suburb of Mitcham comprising Robert Wratten (for vocals and guitar) and Michael Hiscock (on bass guitar). The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Emma&#x27;s House&quot;, was released in November 1988, and reached number 20 in the UK Independent Chart. But it was with their second single &quot;Sensitive&quot; that they first received significant critical attention, giving them a top-20 indie hit and with a subsequent placing in John Peel&#x27;s 1989 Festive Fifty. Debut mini-album &quot;Snowball&quot; reached number 3 on the UK Indie Albums Chart. The original duo were joined by Harvey Williams (of Another Sunny Day) on guitar: the first fruits of this new line-up being the &quot;Skywriting&quot; mini-LP and in late 1990 the band expanded to include Anne Mari Davies on vocals, keyboards and guitar and Mark Dobson on drums. This five-piece line-up later recorded what was to be their final album (but their first full length for Sarah Records), &quot;For Keeps&quot;.

Over a five-year career, the band were often dogged with the reputation of having a post-C86 indie pop, or generic Sarah Records sound, despite producing tracks with numerous styles and influences. Early singles and even their sleeves harked back to early Factory Records bands such as New Order and the Wake, with many tracks often featuring sequencers and samples. Many of the group&#x27;s recordings, notably &quot;Triangle&quot; and their epic seven-minute swan song, &quot;Missing the Moon&quot;, displayed a strong influence from the popular dance music of the time. Most of the group&#x27;s records were produced by Ian Catt, who later went on to develop the pop dance sound of &quot;Missing the Moon&quot; further with Saint Etienne (whose second single was a cover version of the Field Mice&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss and Make Up&quot;).

==Split and legacy==
The band split up in 1991 after a fractious tour to promote the &quot;For Keeps&quot; album, during which lead singer/guitarist Robert Wratten announced he was leaving.

Later, Field Mice members Wratten, Anne Mari Davies (Wratten&#x27;s ex-girlfriend) and Mark Dobson briefly formed Yesterday Sky before becoming the more synth-oriented outfit Northern Picture Library. Wratten went on to form Trembling Blue Stars in 1995 and Lightning in a Twilight Hour.

A double-album compilation of the now long-deleted Field Mice releases, &quot;Where&#x27;d You Learn to Kiss That Way?&quot;, was released in 1998 and sold more copies than any Field Mice record ever sold at the time. Their entire back catalogue was reissued on CD for the first time by LTM Recordings in 2005.

<doc id="171230" wikidata="Q1191761" url="?curid=171230" title="Spacemen 3">
<text>Spacemen 3 were an English rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire, by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce, known respectively under their pseudonyms Sonic Boom and J Spaceman. Their music is known for its brand of &quot;trance-like neo-psychedelia&quot; consisting of heavily distorted guitar, synthesizers, and minimal chord or tempo changes.

The band drew inspiration from acts like the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, and Suicide. Following their debut album &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot; (1986), Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and through albums &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; (1987) and &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; (1989), went on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album &quot;Recurring&quot; post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways.

They gained a reputation as a &#x27;drug band&#x27; due to the members&#x27; drug-taking habits and Kember&#x27;s candid interviews and outspoken opinions on recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Pierce has enjoyed considerable success with his subsequent project—Spiritualized. Kember has since found acclaim for his production work with indie artists, most often under the stage name Sonic Boom.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1982–85)===
The creative and song-writing force throughout Spacemen 3&#x27;s history were Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. They met at the (now defunct) Rugby Art College on Clifton Road, Rugby, Warwickshire in autumn 1982, both aged 16, and became close friends. Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them near the end of 1982 to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home, which they used. Shortly afterwards Pete Bain joined on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then at a couple of gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song &quot;O.D. Catastrophe&quot;.

In autumn 1983, Pierce, having finished his course at Rugby Art College, started attending an art school in Maidstone, Kent. This prompted Bain and Morris to leave and join a new local band, The Push, being formed by Gavin Wissen. Kember and Pierce recruited a replacement drummer, Nicholas &quot;Natty&quot; Brooker. They continued without a bassist and Pierce would regularly return to Rugby for rehearsals. In early 1984, they only performed at a few local, low-key venues. Still a trio, they changed their name to Spacemen 3. Kember explained:

Eventually, Spacemen 3 decided to produce a demo tape. In 1984 they made their first studio recordings at the home studio of Dave Sheriff in Rugby. This material – which included early iterations of the songs &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Jesus&quot;, &quot;Come Down Easy&quot; and &quot;Things&#x27;ll Never be the Same&quot; – was used for a short demo tape entitled &quot;For All The Fucked Up Children Of The World We Give You Spacemen 3&quot;. They got a few hundred cassette copies made and produced their own artwork and booklet to accompany it, selling the tapes for £1 at a local record shop. Spacemen 3&#x27;s music at this stage had a loose, swampy blues feel; some songs included harmonica and slide guitar, and their style sounded akin to The Cramps. These early demo recordings, which Kember later recalled as being &quot;really dreadful&quot;, would later be released unofficially in 1995 on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label, thus providing an insight into the band&#x27;s embryonic sound.

Around 1984 and 1985, Spacemen 3 were doing gigs every two or three months on the local Rugby/Northampton/Coventry circuit, and had a regular spot at The Black Lion public house in Northampton. Their gigs had an &#x27;anti performance&#x27; element: Kember and Pierce would play their guitars sitting down and would barely acknowledge the audience. They would illuminate the stage with some cheap, old optokinetic disco light-show equipment which they had acquired, providing a psychedelic backdrop.

By summer 1985, Spacemen 3 were headlining at The Black Lion and becoming one of the biggest local bands. Around this time they started to co-host a weekly club night together with another local band, Gavin Wissen&#x27;s &#x27;The Cogs of Tyme&#x27;. &#x27;The Reverberation Club&#x27;, as it was called, was held at The Blitz public house in Rugby on Thursdays. &quot;50s, 60s and 70s punk&quot; records were played and it soon provided a live venue for Spacemen 3 and various other local bands. At one of their gigs at The Black Lion in 1985, they came to the attention of Pat Fish, the leader of the recording band The Jazz Butcher; he felt Spacemen 3 were &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;like nothing else&quot;.

===&quot;Sound of Confusion&quot; era (1986)===

====Northampton demos====
In November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones.

At Pierce&#x27;s instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name Spacemen 3. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3&#x27;s signature sound.

In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the Studio Morocco based at the home of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. with studio manager Dave Howard dealing with the technicalities. These &quot;fine set of performances&quot; would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album &quot;Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To&quot; on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as &quot;rehearsals in Rugby&quot;).

Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish&#x27;s band The Jazz Butcher were signed. Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with Glass Records in early 1986.

====Debut album====
Spacemen 3 were sent to record their first album, &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot;, at the studios of Bob Lamb in the King&#x27;s Heath area of Birmingham. With a recording budget of less than £1,000, they completed the album in five days, with the last two days dedicated to mixing. Attempts at recording the title song &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Jesus (Sound of Confusion)&quot; were unsuccessful and abandoned.

Pat Fish was slated to produce the album, but he had commitments with his band, and Bob Lamb produced it. Kember and Pierce were unhappy with the results, and they preferred the Northampton demos instead.

The seven-track &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot; album had a heavy psychedelic style. It was &quot;a full on, fuzzed up drone of relentless guitar pounding&quot; (Ian Edmond, &quot;Record Collector&quot;), with a &quot;rough garage energy &quot; and &quot;minimal, bluntly entrancing riffs&quot;. A &quot;NME&quot; review of the 1990 re-release said that the album was &quot;A lo-fi, mostly low-key affair.&quot;

&quot;Sound of Confusion&quot; was released in July 1986. The cover artwork included shots of the band illuminated by their light-show equipment. The album was not received well, making little impression at the time, although it went on to reach no. 2 on the UK Independent Chart in 1989. Publicity for the album suffered from lack of funding by Glass Records.

During 1986, Spacemen 3 made live performances every few weeks. These continued to occur at local venues, with the exception of gigs in Chesterfield, Birmingham and, in August, their first appearance in London. The latter gig saw them receive their first reviews in both &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;.

To follow up their album, Spacemen 3 made their first single, &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Jesus&quot; in 1986; the received decent reviews from &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;, and peaked at no. 29 on the UK Independent Chart, and no. 46 in the indie chart published by &quot;Sounds&quot;.

It was in 1986 that guitarist Peter Kember started to use his long-term alias &#x27;Sonic Boom&#x27;. He had earlier employed the aliases &#x27;Mainliner&#x27; and &#x27;Peter Gunn&#x27;. Bassist Pete Bain also adopted his alias—&#x27;Bassman&#x27; or &#x27;Pete Bassman&#x27;.

===&quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; era (1987–88)===
====1987====
In January 1987, Spacemen 3 commenced work on their second album, &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot;, which was recorded at Paul Adkins&#x27; VHF Studios, near Rugby; it was at the request of sound engineer Graham Walker. It took eight months and £3,000 to produce.

Whilst working on the album, &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot;—a cover of a song by the Red Crayola—was recorded, and released as a single in July 1987. &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot; was awarded &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; by &quot;Sounds&quot;, and matched the previous single in reaching no. 29 on the independent chart. The B-side included &quot;Ecstasy Symphony&quot;, an experimental piece using an organ drone.

&quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; was completed in September 1987 and released the same month.
Kember described it as &quot;kind of a concept album, it&#x27;s about our better and worse experiences with drugs&quot;. Produced by Kember and Pierce, they agreed to restrict the amount of guitar overdubs in order that it would be easier to replicate the songs live. &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; received little critical attention in the UK, being better received in the United States. However, it represented Kember and Pierce&#x27;s &quot;collaborative zenith&quot; (Erik Morse), and the album &quot;is practically a best-of in all but name&quot;.

&quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; &quot;marked a serious artistic development, drawing deeper from gospel, ambient, and spiritual music, granting a serenity and depth to their spaced-out garage psychedelia&quot;. Much of the album did not feature drums. This was the first album on which Kember contributed lead vocals.

Spacemen 3 performed live on about twenty occasions during 1987. This included several gigs in the Netherlands and Belgium in March, and a few dates in London, Sheffield and Leeds later on in the year.

====1988====
In January–February 1988, Spacemen 3 undertook a six-week tour of continental Europe, encompassing Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium. Comprising nearly thirty gigs, the tour saw tensions and discontent arise between band members. After they returned to England, drummer Stewart Roswell quit.

Relations between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were beginning to suffer as a result of Pierce&#x27;s romantic relationship with Kate Radley, whom he had been dating since summer 1987. Kember resented the amount of time his song-writing partner was spending with her at his expense.

A UK tour in spring 1988 used stand-in drummers to fulfil live dates. Roswell&#x27;s departure was followed by that of Pete Bain at the end of May. A replacement bassist was immediately appointed: Will Carruthers, a friend of the band who had recently been playing in another Rugby group, &#x27;The Cogs of Tyme&#x27;.

In July 1988, Spacemen 3&#x27;s third single, &quot;Take Me to the Other Side&quot;, was released, from &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; album. The single received good press and was &quot;NME&quot; Single of the Week.

Spacemen 3 reached a deal with Glass Records where in return for providing a live album, their contractual obligations would be deemed to have been met, and they would be allowed to leave. The album, a recording of their gig at the Melkweg venue, Amsterdam, was released in July 1988.

Following their departure from Glass Records, Spacemen 3 were without a record deal. The only offer they received was from the prominent independent label Creation Records. However, Creation owner Alan McGee was only able to offer a one-album deal and with no advance. This was not pursued.

It was at this juncture that Kember and Pierce chose to enter into a contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a Northamptonshire businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the master tapes of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to record labels for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember and Pierce an advance of £1,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember and Pierce and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember and Pierce, meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only the two of them together with Palmer. In addition, Palmer became Spacemen 3&#x27;s manager.

===&quot;Playing with Fire&quot; era (1988–89)===
====1988====
Around spring 1988 Kember was using his 4-track recorder to develop his ideas and several songs for the next album.

Recording for Spacemen 3&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, started in June 1988. Palmer, booked ARK Studios in Cornwall for a month, though these sessions were not particularly productive. ARK Studios only had 8-track facilities and some of Spacemen 3&#x27;s recordings were accidentally wiped by the in-house sound engineer. Rough demos were managed for Kember&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot; and Pierce&#x27;s &quot;Lord Can You Hear Me?&quot;. They still did not have a drummer at this point.

New bassist Will Carruthers made his first live appearance with Spacemen 3 at London Dingwalls on 20 June, where they were supported by My Bloody Valentine. It was after this gig that a confrontation occurred between Kember, Pierce and his girlfriend Kate Radley. Tired of Radley&#x27;s persistent presence around the band of late – at recording sessions, touring and backstage at gigs – Kember enforced an agreed &#x27;no girls on the bus&#x27; policy and barred Radley from boarding the tour van, leaving Pierce and Radley to find their own way home.

Recording for &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; recommenced despite a deteriorating relationship between Kember and Pierce; they returned to VHF Studios, outside Rugby, where they had recorded &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot;. Of the eventual tracks on &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, six were Kember&#x27;s compositions, whilst only three were Pierce&#x27;s. For the recording, individual parts were recorded separately, which meant band members did not have to be present at the same time.

On 19 August, Spacemen 3 gave an unusual live performance. Palmer had booked them to provide &#x27;An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music&#x27; in the foyer of the Waterman&#x27;s Art Centre in Brentford, London, to act as a prelude to a screening of the film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. Kember, Pierce and Carruthers were joined by Rugby musician Steve Evans. They played a 45-minute jam, based around a single chord strummed by Evans, featuring riffs from some of the songs from their as yet unreleased &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; material. This performance was recorded and was later released, in 1990, as . The crowd assembled for the film was not impressed, and, according to Pat Fish, one of the patrons remarked to the other: &quot;To think that Elvis died for this!&quot;

After initial plans to use drummers from The Weather Prophets and Thee Hypnotics for the recording of &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, a permanent drummer was recruited in late August: Jonny Mattock. Despite this, he does not appear on &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; – a drum machine was used on all of the songs and no drummer is credited on the album. Mattock had been playing in a Northampton band called The Apple Creation. He was recommended by future Spacemen 3 guitarist Mark Refoy. Mattock made his live debut on 24 August at a gig at the Riverside in Hammersmith, London, and contributed to the new album. The new rhythm section of Carruthers and Mattock would remain constant for the rest of Spacemen 3&#x27;s existence.

In summer 1988, Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a two-album deal with independent label, Fire Records. At a gig on 15 November 1988, advertised as &#x27;Sonic Boom and Jason of Spacemen 3&#x27;, only Kember and Carruthers performed.

The single &quot;Revolution&quot; was released in November 1988. The title track was a powerful, anthemic &quot;mind-melting crunch&quot;. &quot;&#x27;Revolution&#x27; was the chest-tearing noise that propelled them from complete obscurity to the cultosphere of young indie rock godz&quot; (Jack Barron, &quot;NME&quot;, 29/7/1989). The single peaked in the top 10 of the indie charts, representing Spacemen 3&#x27;s highest chart position yet, and was voted by radio listeners for inclusion in John Peel&#x27;s end-of-year Festive Fifty. Awarded Single of the Week by the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, it was extremely well received by the music press whose general attitude towards the band changed at this juncture:

Spacemen 3 &quot;became the indie phenomenon of late 1988&quot; (Erik Morse). They were receiving more media attention and got their first cover story in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; 19 November 1988 issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melody Maker, 19/11/1988&quot;&gt;&quot;Melody Maker&quot;, 19/11/1988&lt;/ref&gt; Kember participated in many interviews, which provided controversy and journalistic focus on his drug-taking habits and his forthright views on recreational drug use. On one occasion, Kember invited his interviewer to accompany him as he collected his methadone prescription. Kember was regularly described in the music papers, incorrectly, as the &quot;leader&quot; of Spacemen 3, although he had not helped in this portrayal: in the Melody Maker article referred to above, Kember had stated, &quot;This band is my design and the rest are totally into it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NME, 29/7/1989&quot;&gt;&quot;NME&quot;, 29/7/1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sounds, 05/12/1988&quot;&gt;&quot;Sounds&quot;, 05/12/1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Completion of the &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album was delayed due to recording delays and a dispute about song-writing credits, which resulted in a physical altercation. Palmer mediated to resolve the feud. Palmer finally managed to obtain a compromise with Kember conceding split song-writing credits for &#x27;Suicide&#x27;.

====Sonic Boom solo project====
In late 1988, Peter Kember was already working on new material for post &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;. His productivity meant he had a surfeit of songs, and he advised his bandmates of his intention to produce a solo album. New indie label Silvertone Records offered Kember a generous one-off album deal which he accepted. Kember finished recordings for his debut solo album and single in March 1989, prior to the commencement of Spacemen 3&#x27;s European tour. Other members of Spacemen 3, including Pierce, as well as other musicians, had contributed sessions. Release of Kember&#x27;s solo album (&quot;Spectrum&quot;) and single – under the moniker of Kember&#x27;s alias, Sonic Boom – were put on hold in order to avoid a marketing clash with &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;.

====1989: &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album release and tour====
Spacemen 3&#x27;s eagerly awaited &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album was finally released on 27 February 1989. The album&#x27;s front cover sleeve bore the slogan, &quot;Purity, Love, Suicide, Accuracy, Revolution&quot;. &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; was Spacemen 3&#x27;s first record to chart and one of the breakthrough indie albums of the year. Within weeks of its release, it was No. 1 in both the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; indie charts. It was &quot;their most critically and commercially successful album&quot;. Reviews were extremely positive and the album garnered wide critical acclaim.



With the exception of &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Suicide&quot;, the other songs on the album were mellower and softer than Spacemen 3&#x27;s previous work, continuing the development of their previous album. &quot;&quot;Playing with Fire&quot;... shows another side of Spacemen 3 – a slower, melancholic, blissfully refined pop band&quot; (Ron Rom, &quot;Sounds&quot;). The band &quot;created glazed, liquid songs with subtle arrangements and sheer reveling in aural joys...[&quot;Playing with Fire&quot; is] a feast of sound&quot;.

The &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album was distributed in the United States on Bomp! Records, the label of Greg Shaw, who paid $10,000 for the rights. Spacemen 3 were popular in America and a prospective US tour was planned to start in September 1989. Greg Shaw organised the tour.

In February–March 1989, Spacemen 3 undertook a four-week UK tour comprising 21 dates, coinciding with the new album&#x27;s release. Comments from gig reviews included:

At the start of the UK tour Kate Radley was again travelling in the tour van, thus causing tension between Kember and Pierce. After several gigs, Kember told Pierce this could not continue. For the rest of the UK dates Pierce and Radley, now living in a new flat together, made their own way to gigs.

The UK tour was shortly followed by an extensive and gruelling four-week tour of continental Europe in April–May 1989. This incorporated 22 dates across the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Austria and Italy. (Radley was not present on this tour). Setlists remained more or less consistent around this period. For the purposes of live performances, Spacemen 3 played their more powerful or heavier – and therefore mostly older – songs, featuring little from &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;; although the odd softer song was played occasionally. Sets typically ended with the song &quot;Suicide&quot; which could last up to 45 minutes.

===Break-up, final album, and formation of Spiritualized (1989–91)===

====1989====
At the beginning of 1989 Spacemen 3 had been one of the &quot;hottest indie bands in England&quot; (Erik Morse) and were gaining the attention of major US record labels.

Spacemen 3 used the short break between the UK and European tours in spring 1989 as an opportunity to record a new single. Two songs were recorded, at VHF Studios: &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, a new song by Pierce, who had recently acquired his own 4-track recorder; and &quot;Just To See You Smile&quot;, by Kember. However, Kember accused Pierce of copying his sounds.

Whilst Spacemen 3 were on tour, Palmer prepared the new single for release. Without consulting Kember or Pierce, Palmer mastered the tracks, had the sleeve artwork designed, and selected &quot;Hypnotized&quot; for the A-side. When Kember found out he was furious; however, Palmer refused to postpone the pressing of the single. A resulting feud permanently damaged Kember and Palmer&#x27;s working relationship.

In June, Spacemen 3 played ten UK gigs. Initially, Pierce was making his own way to these dates, but when he instead used the tour van there was a bad atmosphere between the two men.

The single &quot;Hypnotized&quot; was released on 3 July 1989. It was their &quot;most anticipated release yet&quot; (Erik Morse) and immediately charted inside the top 10 of the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; indie charts. It was &quot;Sounds&quot; Single of the Week. After two weeks, &quot;Hypnotized&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; indie chart, and No. 2 on the &quot;NME&quot; indie chart (second only to The Stone Roses&#x27; &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot;). It was voted No. 33 in John Peel&#x27;s end of year Festive Fifty.

A third guitarist, Mark Refoy, had been recruited at the beginning of summer 1989, to play on later live dates and work on the next album. Refoy had been a friend of the band for several years, and had contributed to Kember&#x27;s solo album. Refoy made his first live performance with Spacemen 3 at their Rugby &#x27;homecoming&#x27; gig on 20 July.

On 23 July, Spacemen 3 played their biggest headlining gig at The Town &amp; Country Club, London, a 2,000-capacity venue. On 22 August, they played a warm-up gig at Subterranea, London, for the Reading Festival, their first festival gig. Spacemen 3 played at the Reading Festival on 25 August 1989. This would transpire to be their last ever live performance.

At the beginning of September 1989, Spacemen 3 were about to undertake a substantial tour of the United States. The tour schedule had been finalised and they were due to be in America for the rest of the year, playing about 50 gigs. The band had grievances with Palmer, resulting in a meeting with no resolution or compromise. In an interview in 1991, Kember described Palmer as &quot;the most devious guy I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune to meet&quot;.

Kember and Pierce dismissed Palmer a few days after the meeting; however, Palmer was still one third of Spacemen 3. Additionally, he had already incurred at least £10,000 in recording expenses for the next album, and he stopped backing the imminent US tour, which resulted in a waste of resources.

The official explanation at the time – and that reported in the UK music press – was that the US tour had been cancelled because they had not been able to obtain work permits due to the drug convictions of band members. However, it has since transpired that this was not the case: work permits had been obtained for the band, albeit with difficulty.

Recording for Spacemen 3&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Recurring&quot;, had commenced at the beginning of August 1989, again at VHF Studios. According to Mark Refoy, Kember and Pierce rarely appeared at the studio at the same time and there was &quot;quite a tense atmosphere&quot; between them, particular over accusations from Kember that Pierce had copied him.

Afterwards, the two were now estranged and working completely separately. They agreed to have separate sides of the album for their own songs, all of which they had written and composed individually. The other three band members – Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy – who all went on to join Spiritualized (Pierce&#x27;s project), were called in to contribute sessions when required.

In late September, Kember made a solo performance at a gig supporting The Telescopes. Kember and Pierce agreed to be in the studio together to record a cover of Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;When Tomorrow Hits&quot;, for a prospective split single with Mudhoney. When Kember heard Mudhoney&#x27;s version of &quot;Revolution&quot;, with altered lyrics, he was offended and this collaborative Sub Pop release was called off however. The recording of &quot;When Tomorrow Hits&quot; was the last occasion Kember and Pierce would work together. Disconsolate Will Carruthers left the band at this point, fed up with the discord and lack of remuneration.

Recording for the album proceeded slowly and was still ongoing in Autumn 1989, by which point Kember had used two to three times the amount of studio time as Pierce. According to band members, Kember&#x27;s behaviour was becoming increasingly obsessive and erratic. He was regularly missing booked studio slots. In late October, Kember&#x27;s debut solo single, &quot;Angel&quot; was released. It received a lukewarm reception.

On 14 November 1989, the four remaining Spacemen 3 band members met to discuss finishing the album and arranging future live dates. The meeting was unproductive. Reportedly, Kember and Pierce both said little. Jonny Mattock told Kember he was difficult to work with. Mattock and Mark Refoy, both peeved, left the meeting prematurely and effectively resigned from Spacemen 3. In December, Gerald Palmer attempted to mediate between his business partners, Kember and Pierce, meeting them individually because Pierce reportedly refused contact with Kember.

====Dedicated record deal====

During 1989, Gerald Palmer had been courting interest and offers from US major record labels. Palmer had been postponing a decision hoping the US tour would lever improved offers. Negotiations with Dedicated Records, a satellite label of BMG, had been ongoing for several months. The poor intra-band relations had remained secret for the sake of outward appearance. By October 1989, the latest offer from Dedicated was a five-album, multimillion-dollar deal, with a £60,000 advance. Palmer had expended £15,000 on legal fees, and because he had managed to negotiate out the standard Leaving Member Clause, Kember and Pierce were in a &#x27;win-win situation&#x27;.

In December, the three met to arrange signing the Dedicated record deal. Pierce insisted that Kember sign an agreement stating that the two of them had equal rights to Spacemen 3, to mutually protect them by preventing either party potentially claiming ownership of the Spacemen 3 name should the other quit. Coerced by the attraction of his portion of the Dedicated advance, Kember signed it. Mattock claims Kember attacked Pierce in the street the next morning. At the beginning of 1990, Kember and Pierce attended the London offices of Dedicated separately to sign the record contract. A few days later, at a dinner (at the Paper Tiger Chinese restaurant in Lutterworth, Leicestershire) with Dedicated executives, Kember and Pierce were cordial with the other guests but didn&#x27;t talk with one another. The pretence was kept up until the end; Palmer did not inform Dedicated about the band breaking up until March.

====1990====
In late 1989, Jason Pierce, dissatisfied with his mixes at VHF Studios, took his recordings for the &quot;Recurring&quot; album to Battery Studios, London. Assisted by engineer/producer Anjali Dutt, Pierce completed final remixes of his songs in January 1990. However, Peter Kember&#x27;s side of the album was far from ready, and he resorted to calling on the help of Richard Formby, a producer. According to Formby, when he arrived, Kember&#x27;s recording was only half done; some songs were incomplete, and two had to be re-recorded from scratch.

In January 1990, Kember&#x27;s side project and debut solo album, &quot;Spectrum&quot; (Sonic Boom), was released. Recorded nearly a year previously, Kember had used the project as a vehicle for a group of melancholic themed songs, having decided to save his more upbeat work for Spacemen 3 and &quot;Recurring&quot;. The &quot;Spectrum&quot; album was advertised as being by the &quot;founder member/leader of Spacemen 3&quot;.

Also in January, Pierce was developing ideas for forming a new band or side project of his own. He invited Spacemen 3 compatriots, Refoy, Carruthers and Mattock, to jam and rehearse with him at a small church hall and his flat. Initially it was informal, but this was the origin of Pierce&#x27;s Spacemen 3 &#x27;splinter&#x27; band, Spiritualized, comprising all the same members as Spacemen 3 except for Kember. In February 1990, this new grouping recorded &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot;. This was recorded at VHF Studios; the purpose of these sessions was kept secret from Kember who was still working there. Speaking in 1991, Pierce explained the purpose of starting Spiritualized:

Kember continued on completing his &quot;Recurring&quot; material. His indecision and constant remixing was prolonging the recording of the album. Gerald Palmer was still funding the studio time, and warned Kember to finish. Eventually, intolerant of any more delays, Palmer attended VHF Studios. He seized Kember&#x27;s tapes, carrying out a previous threat, and chose the final mixes for release. There were reportedly dozens of different mixes for each song.

In June 1990, Spiritualized released their debut single, &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot;. This was a cover of a song by The Troggs which Spacemen 3 had demoed in 1988 during their &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; sessions. The single&#x27;s cover sleeve, which had no text on it, controversially bore a sticker saying &quot;Spacemen 3&quot;. Furthermore, adverts for the single featured the Spacemen 3 logo.

The release of the Spiritualized single was the first Kember had definite knowledge of the band&#x27;s existence. The circumstances surrounding the single and its marketing prompted Kember to announce that he was leaving Spacemen 3 and that the band no longer existed. Kember, interviewed in 1991:

In the latter half of 1990, Pierce&#x27;s new band, Spiritualized, toured around the UK. They performed songs from the then as yet unreleased &quot;Recurring&quot;, as well as new material. Spiritualized signed a record deal with Dedicated and recorded their debut album in winter 1990/91.

====1991====
In January 1991, the Spacemen 3 single &quot;Big City&quot;/&quot;Drive&quot; was released. Both songs from the double A-side single were from the soon to be released &quot;Recurring&quot;. Kember and Pierce had been due to be at the studio for the mastering of the single, however Pierce did not attend. At that point the two had hardly spoken face to face in over six months. Kember decided to fade out several minutes of Pierce&#x27;s song from the single, &quot;Drive&quot;.

The last Spacemen 3 album, &quot;Recurring&quot;, was finally released in February 1991. Although the band had not officially disbanded, for all intents and purposes it was a posthumous release. The two sides of the album – one by Kember (A-side), the other by Pierce (B-side) – reflected the split between the band&#x27;s two main personnel.

The songs on &quot;Recurring&quot; had been composed in 1989. It expanded on the sounds of the previous, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album. Musically, it was richer and lusher, but Kember and Pierce&#x27;s respective halves of &quot;Recurring&quot; were distinctly different and presaged the solo material which they were already working on by the time of the album&#x27;s release. Kember&#x27;s side demonstrated his pop and ambient sensibilities; Pierce&#x27;s side indicated his sympathy for gospel and blues music and his interest in lush production.



In 1991 Kember and Pierce were pursuing their musical careers with their own bands, Spectrum and Spiritualized respectively. The release of &quot;Recurring&quot; prompted renewed press speculation about the future of Spacemen 3. No official statement explained why, or confirmed whether, Spacemen 3 had broken up.

===Band members&#x27; activities post Spacemen 3===
Most members of Spacemen 3 have continued to produce music and record either collaboratively or in solo projects. Peter Kember (alias &#x27;Sonic Boom&#x27;) has had a solo career releasing music under the monikers Spectrum and E.A.R., and has also done production work for MGMT, Panda Bear, Beach House Dean &amp; Britta and The Flowers of Hell. Jason Pierce (alias &#x27;J. Spaceman&#x27;) remains the leader and creative force, and only constant member, of the alternative band Spiritualized who have achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success. Both Kember and Pierce continue to perform some Spacemen 3 songs live (e.g. &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Suicide&quot;, &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, &quot;Che&quot; and &quot;Let Me Down Gently&quot; [Kember]; and &quot;Take Me to the Other Side&quot;, &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Jesus&quot;, &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;Lord Can You Hear Me?&quot; [Pierce]).

Will Carruthers, Jonny Mattock and Mark Refoy formed Spiritualized with Pierce in early 1990. Carruthers left the band after the first album in 1992; followed by Mattock and Refoy in 1994. Refoy then fronted Slipstream who released two albums. Refoy played guitar for the Pet Shop Boys on their live tour in 2007. Will Carruthers took a hiatus from the music industry after leaving Spiritualized; but subsequently has worked with Kember, recorded two solo albums as Freelovebabies, and has most recently toured with The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy have also collaborated on projects together.

After leaving Spacemen 3 in 1988, both Pete Bain and Sterling Roswell (aka Rosco) joined the neo-psychedelic band the Darkside who released several albums. Following the end of Darkside, Bain formed Alphastone, and has assisted Kember on some of the latter&#x27;s solo projects. As of 2010 he provides vocals and guitar in The Urgz. Stewart Roswell (alias Sterling Roswell) released a solo album, &quot;The Psychedelic Ubik&quot;, in 2004.

In the early 1990s, early Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker played bass under the alias Mr Ugly in a garage rock band The Guaranteed Ugly, with Gavin Wissen. They released two albums. Brooker provided cover artwork for Spacemen 3&#x27;s &quot;Recurring&quot; album and early Spiritualized releases. Brooker died of cancer on Friday 18 April 2014.

A partial and unofficial &#x27;reunion&#x27; of Spacemen 3 occurred on 15 July 2010 at a benefit gig dubbed &#x27;A Reunion of Friends&#x27;, organised for former Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker (diagnosed with terminal cancer) at the Hoxton Bar and Grill in London where there was a retrospective exhibition of his artwork. Will Carruthers said of the event, &quot;This is as close as you&#x27;ll get to a Spacemen 3 reunion, trust me.&quot; The participants were: Peter Kember (keyboard/guitar/vocals); Will Carruthers (bass); Jonny Mattock (drums); Mark Refoy (guitar); Jason Holt (guitarist from Kember&#x27;s touring Spectrum band); and guest appearances from Pat Fish (vocals), and Kevin Shields (guitar) of My Bloody Valentine. They played a 45-minute set comprising the songs &#x27;Walkin&#x27; with Jesus&#x27;, &#x27;Revolution&#x27; and &#x27;Suicide&#x27;.

==Musical style and influences==
Sonically, Spacemen 3&#x27;s music was characterised by fuzzy and distorted electric guitars, stuttering tremolo effects and wah-wah, the employment of &#x27;power chords&#x27; and simple riffs, harmonic overtones and drones, softly sung/spoken vocals, and sparse or monolithic drumming. Their earlier record releases were guitar &#x27;heavy&#x27;, sounding Stooges-esque and &quot;a bit like a punked-up garage rock band&quot;; whilst their later work was mostly sparser and softer with more textural techniques and augmented by organs, resulting in &quot;their signature trance-like neo-psychedelia&quot;. Kember described it as &quot;very hypnotic and minimal; every track has a drone all the way through it&quot;.

Spacemen 3 were adherents to the &quot;minimal is maximal&quot; philosophy of Alan Vega, singer for the American duo Suicide who were known for their ominously repetitive music. Kember has articulated the maxim: &quot;One chord best, two chords cool, three chords okay, four chords average&quot;.

Spacemen 3 had the dictum &quot;taking drugs to make music to take drugs to&quot;. Kember candidly admitted to his frequent drug taking—including cannabis, LSD, magic mushrooms, MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine—and being a former heroin addict. Much of Spacemen 3&#x27;s music concerned documenting the drug experience and conveying the related feelings. In &quot;NME&quot; 2011 list, the &#x27;50 Druggiest Albums&#x27; of all time, Spacemen 3&#x27;s Northampton Demos release, &quot;Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To&quot;, was ranked No. 23.

The group took influence from The Stooges, The Velvet Underground, and The Rolling Stones. Additionally, various proto-punk and psychedelic bands influenced them.

Spacemen 3 recorded and performed numerous covers and re-workings of other bands&#x27; songs, particularly earlier on in their history, and this was indicative of their influences. The Spacemen 3 song &quot;Suicide&quot; was a clear acknowledgement of one of their influences: when performed live it was usually introduced as &quot;this song is dedicated to Martin Rev and Alan Vega – Suicide&quot;.

Kember was also interested in drone music and everyday ambient sounds such as those created by electric razors, washing machines, lawnmowers, planes, motor engines and passing cars.

Their musical style has been described as neo-psychedelia, space rock, psychedelic rock, alternative rock, garage rock and blues rock.

==Legacy==
&quot;Spacemen 3 were one of the most revolutionary UK guitar bands&quot; (Ian Edmond, &quot;Record Collector&quot;). They produced &quot;some of the most visceral and psychedelic music of all time...and set a sonic template that influenced a generation, inspiring countless bands&quot; (Julian Woolsey, &quot;Rock Edition&quot;). Writing in spring 1991, just after the band had split, &quot;Vox&quot; Stephen Dalton referred to Spacemen 3 as &quot;one of the most influential underground bands of the last decade&quot;.

&quot;Amen&quot; is used as the theme song for the Vice show &quot;Abandoned&quot;.

In 1998, a tribute album to Spacemen 3 was released by the Rocket Girl label. &quot;A Tribute to Spacemen 3&quot; included covers by bands such as Mogwai, Low, Bowery Electric and Bardo Pond. The album liner notes stated: &quot;There are so many current bands who draw their influences from Spacemen 3 that now seems an appropriate time to show tribute to this underrated band.&quot;

In 2004, US journalist Erik Morse&#x27;s biography of the band&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Spacemen 3 &amp; The Birth of Spiritualized&quot;, was published.

===Rereleases since the band disbanded===
In the two decades following the break-up of Spacemen 3, a large amount of previously unreleased recordings has been released, adding significantly to the Spacemen 3 canon. This material includes: live recordings; demos; earlier iterations of certain songs; alternate versions of many songs; some unfinished work; and some entirely previously unreleased songs. These releases have been both official and unofficial, and some have been issued by the Kember/Palmer-affiliated label Space Age Recordings.

&quot;Losing Touch with Your Mind&quot;, an unofficial release of 1991, was a compilation of alternate song versions and rare releases. The 1993 re-release of on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label – which included the intriguing live 44-minute Eastern-inspired drone music performance at the Watermans Art Centre, Brentford, London, of August 1988 – was augmented with a previously unreleased recording of a jam.

1995 saw the unofficial release of the band&#x27;s first demo tape: &quot;For All the Fucked Up Children of This World We Give You Spacemen 3&quot;. Dating to 1984, this provided an interesting insight into the band&#x27;s earliest work and &quot;rougher&quot; sound. These recordings pre-dated the other early demos previously made available on the 1990 unofficial, Father Yod release entitled &quot;Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To&quot;.

The 1994 re-release of the &quot;Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To&quot; (Northampton Demos) album included several previously unreleased alternate song versions and other bonus tracks.

Two live albums were released in 1995: &quot;Live in Europe 1989&quot; (also released in 1995 as &quot;Spacemen Are Go!&quot; on the Bomp! label, but without &#x27;Take Me to the Other Side&#x27; and an alternate take of &#x27;Suicide&#x27;) which represented the first release of the band&#x27;s live work from their lengthy 1989 contintental tour; and &quot;Revolution or Heroin&quot;, a bootleg of performances from the band&#x27;s 1988 gig at the University of London Students Union. The former has been described as &quot;far better than the more ragged earlier Spacemen 3 live album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Performance&quot;&quot;.

In 1999, Spacemen 3&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, was given a special, 10th-anniversary re-release. This official double disc release comprised all the original recordings together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Perfect Disaster&#x27;s &quot;Girl on Fire&quot; and The Troggs&#x27; &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot;) from the same studio sessions. This re-release has been described as the &quot;definitive&quot; version of the &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; album.

In 2004, Spacemen 3&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot;, was also given the special re-release treatment. The double disc official release, entitled &quot;Forged Prescriptions&quot;, comprised alternate mixes of the original album tracks together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Spades&#x27; &quot;We Sell Soul&quot; and The Troggs&#x27; &quot;I Want You&quot;) from the same studio sessions. Kember&#x27;s liner notes explain that the alternative mixes represent the more multi-layered versions which he and Pierce agreed not to use because they would be unable to satisfactorily reproduce their sound live.

A bootleg called the &quot;Out of It Sessions&quot; comprises demo recordings of early iterations of songs from &quot;The Perfect Prescription&quot; album.

In 2005, Kember produced and released his own limited edition, double disc album, &quot;How the Blues Should&#x27;ve Turned Out&quot;. This wholly comprised previously unreleased material, including alternate versions, rough demos, unfinished work etc.

<text>Terius Gray (born March 26, 1975), better known by his stage name Juvenile, is an American rapper best known for his work with Birdman&#x27;s Cash Money Records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both solo and as a member of the label&#x27;s then-flagship group, Hot Boys.

Juvenile&#x27;s career began in the early 1990s as a teenager with bounce music recordings that earned him local recognition. After releasing his debut studio album—&quot;Being Myself&quot; (1995)—to regional success, he signed with Cash Money and saw his mainstream breakthrough with his second and third albums, &quot;Solja Rags&quot; (1997) and &quot;400 Degreez&quot; (1998). The latter peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was supported by the singles &quot;Ha&quot; and &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot; (featuring Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne)—his first entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He released three subsequent albums—&quot;Tha G-Code&quot; (1999), &quot;Project English&quot; (2001) and &quot;Juve the Great&quot; (2003)—for the label to continued success, the latter of which spawned the 2004 single &quot;Slow Motion&quot; (featuring Soulja Slim), which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became his only song to do so.

Following his departure from Cash Money, Juvenile briefly signed with Atlantic Records. His seventh album, &quot;Reality Check&quot; (2006) debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was followed by &quot;Cocky &amp; Confident&quot; (2009). He then independently released the albums &quot;Beast Mode&quot; (2010), &quot;Rejuvenation&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; (2014). During his solo work, he formed the hip hop group UTP in 2002, with whom he has released two albums; the former of which spawned the 2004 single &quot;Nolia Clap.&quot; He returned to Cash Money in 2014.

==Early life==
Born Terius Gray in 1975, Juvenile was raised in the Magnolia Projects of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd Ward and attended Our Lady of Grace Catholic School. He began rapping around age 11. But because his mother disapproved of that, Gray usually sneaked out of home to perform raps. Neighbors would taunt Gray as ignorant and call him a &quot;little juvenile&quot;, so Gray began using the rap name Juvenile as a teenager.

==Career==

===1991–1997: Beginnings, &quot;Being Myself&quot; and &quot;Solja Rags&quot;===
After being noticed at local talent shows, Juvenile made his recording debut in tracks by bounce music artist DJ Jimi, &quot;It&#x27;s Jimi&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Bounce (For the Juvenile)&quot; in 1993. Juvenile&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Being Myself&quot;, was released in 1994 by Warlock Records. The album did not gain much national attention and did not chart, but did fairly well on a local level.

After &quot;Being Myself&quot;, Juvenile left Warlock due to creative differences, where he disagreed with the label wanting him to record bounce music. Juvenile then got a job at a gas processing plant. After work one day, he encountered Cash Money Records CEO Bryan &quot;Baby&quot; Williams at a bus stop. They had a brief conversation, before Juvenile improvised a freestyle rap for Baby. Juvenile later visited Baby and producer Mannie Fresh at Cash Money Records, performing raps for about a half hour.
In 1997, Juvenile released his second album &quot;Solja Rags&quot; through Cash Money. It became popular among local rap audiences, and also saw some national success as it charted on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was the first time he worked with Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh, who would go on to produce all of Juvenile&#x27;s albums on Cash Money in their entirety except &quot;Juve the Great&quot;. Also in 1997, Juvenile joined the Hot Boys with fellow Cash Money rappers B.G., Turk, and Lil Wayne. They released their debut album as a group, &quot;Get It How U Live!&quot; that same year.

===1998–2002: &quot;400 Degreez, Tha G-Code&quot; and &quot;Project English&quot;===
Juvenile&#x27;s third album, &quot;400 Degreez&quot;, was released in November 1998. The Cash Money label entered a distribution deal from Universal Records during the same time, which gave the label further national promotion. Its first single, &quot;Ha&quot; was released the month prior and became his first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album spawned the follow up single, &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne and Mannie Fresh) which was released commercially in June 1999 and peaked at number 19 on the chart, and number five on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. This, along with wider critical praise and it becoming his best-selling album, made Juvenile a prominent figure in hip hop. However, disputes arose regarding the rights to &#x27;Back That Azz Up,&#x27; as another New Orleans performer, DJ Jubilee, alleged that Juvenile&#x27;s song closely resembled one of his own. In January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans denied the case.
Capitalizing off the album&#x27;s success, Warlock released a remixed version of his debut &quot;Being Myself&quot;, and commercial reissue of his second, &quot;Solja Rags&quot; that same year. In July 1999, he released his second album with Hot Boys, &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, which also received platinum certification.

Juvenile released two further solo albums for Cash Money: &quot;Tha G-Code&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Project English&quot; in 2001, which received double platinum and platinum certifications respectively by the RIAA. Moreover, the albums reached numbers ten and two respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but failed to match the success of &quot;400 Degreez&quot;. UTP Records announced an album titled &quot;600 Degreez&quot; during this time, which was never released.

===2003–2006: &quot;Juve the Great&quot; and &quot;Reality Check&quot;===
In March 2003, the Hot Boys released their album, &quot;Let &#x27;Em Burn&quot;. Juvenile&#x27;s manager Aubrey Francis and Birdman met and negotiated a deal for Juvenile and CMR to release one further solo album for the latter&#x27;s label. His sixth album, &quot;Juve the Great&quot; was released by Cash Money and UTP Records in December 2003. It received platinum certification and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Slow Motion&quot; featuring Soulja Slim. It was the Juvenile and label&#x27;s first, and Slim&#x27;s only number one song prior to his death in November 2003.

In 2005, Juvenile signed with Atlantic Records as a both a solo act and for his UTP Records imprint, which was co-founded by his longtime manager Aubrey &quot;Pied Piper&quot; Francis and older brother Corey. The namesake group UTP (Juve, Skip, and Wacko) released the 2004 hit song &quot;Nolia Clap&quot; as part of the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; (2004). The song was produced by Juvenile along with producer Donald &quot;XL&quot; Robertson. Juvenile has also performed the song &quot;Booty Language&quot; for the soundtrack for the of the 2005 film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. Juvenile&#x27;s Slidell, Louisiana home was damaged during Hurricane Katrina; him, fellow New Orleans rapper Master P, and other hip hop artists raised funds and supplies for affected victims following the storm. He briefly moved to Atlanta afterwards, and in the following year, he returned to New Orleans.

&quot;Reality Check&quot;, Juvenile&#x27;s 2006 album, debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and remains his only release to do so. It received gold certification by the RIAA. Production began in May 2005, most of which was done at a Holiday Inn hotel room in New Orleans. Its first single was &quot;Animal&quot;, followed by &quot;Rodeo&quot;, &quot;Get Ya Hustle On&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Happenin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Way I Be Leanin&#x27;&quot; featuring Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Skip, and Wacko. A portion of the album was recorded with engineer, Stewart Cararas at his studio Paradigm Park Studios in New Orleans. Within one month, the studio suffered the wrath of Hurricane Katrina. On signing to Atlantic, Juvenile criticized his former label Cash Money for not giving him enough creative freedoms as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency over his perceptions over their handling of Hurricane Katrina. Shaheem Reid noted &quot;Get Ya Hustle On&quot; as a criticism of Ray Nagin&#x27;s and the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s handling of the storm.

===2007–2013: &quot;Cocky &amp; Confident,&quot; &quot;Beast Mode&quot; and &quot;Rejuvenation&quot;===
In a 2009 interview with Allhiphop.com, Juvenile stated that his album &quot;Cocky &amp; Confident&quot; &quot;would take a totally different direction from his last project, which was made when he was still &#x27;mourning Katrina.&#x27;&quot; He also revealed that he decided to work only with fresh, young producers on the album and discussed his respect for younger artists like Soulja Boy.

&quot;Cocky &amp; Confident&quot; was released in December 2009. It peaked at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and contained one charting single, &quot;Gotta Get It&quot;, which peaked at number 53 on the Billboard R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. After the album, he parted ways with Atlantic. His ninth album &quot;Beast Mode&quot; was released independently in July 2010. It was preceded by the single, &quot;Drop That Thang&quot; in May of that year.

Juvenile released his tenth studio album, &quot;Rejuvenation&quot; on June 19, 2012 through Rap-A-Lot Records.

The first single from the album is &quot;Power&quot; featuring Rick Ross. Juvenile collaborated with Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled, and Drake for the album.

===2014–present: &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; and Cash Money Reunion===
On February 18, 2014, Juvenile released his eleventh studio album &quot;The Fundamentals&quot;. On October 28, 2014, Juvenile announced and confirmed that he re-signed to Cash Money. On March 28, 2019, both Juvenile and Birdman released a joint album called &quot;Just Another Gangsta&quot;.

In April 2021, Juvenile was awarded a key to the city of New Orleans by mayor LaToya Cantrell.

On June 30, 2023, Juvenile performed on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concert series to very positive reviews. The performance was a result of Twitter user @theylovemyke&#x27;s request that Juvenile play a Tiny Desk concert in April 2023, to which Juvenile initially replied, &quot;WTF is a Tiny Desk and no!&quot;. He subsequently changed his mind, as a result of enthusiastic fan requests to perform on the show. As of July 19, 2023, the video has 4 million views. The performance featured guests including producer Mannie Fresh, Jon Batiste, Trombone Shorty, Alvin Ford, the singing duo The Amours, and the Louisiana Philharmonic.

==Personal life==

Juvenile had a daughter, Jelani, with Joy Deleston. On February 29, 2008, 4-year-old Jelani was shot and killed in her home, along with mother Deleston and older half sister. It was reported that Deleston&#x27;s oldest child, 17-year-old son Anthony Tyrone Terrell Jr., returned to the home after police arrived and implicated himself in the murder of his mother and siblings. Terrell was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of aggravated assault. He remains in the DeKalb County jail. Though Juvenile received some criticism for not attending the funeral for his daughter and her mother, several statements were released that the rapper was &quot;shocked and devastated&quot; by the event. The rapper stated that he made the decision not to appear at the funeral to prevent subsequent media attention, and was concerned that it would divert attention away from the ceremony. Terrell was given two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to killing Joy Deleston, 39, and her daughters, Micaiah, 11, and Jelani. Due to his age, he could not be sentenced to death in Georgia.

Juvenile endorsed Tom Steyer in the 2020 United States presidential election. A video of him dancing with Steyer to his hit song &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot; went viral on the internet shortly before the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary was held.

===Legal issues===
In the summer of 2002, Juvenile was arrested for assaulting his barber over charges that the barber was bootlegging his music.

In January 2003, Juvenile was arrested in New Orleans on drug charges. The next month, he was sentenced to 75 hours of community service for a fight outside a nightclub in Miami, Florida in 2001.

Juvenile was involved in a legal dispute over failure to pay child support for his daughter Jelani with Joy Deleston, a deputy sheriff in Gwinnett County, Georgia. A paternity lawsuit was issued by Deleston in 2004, resulting in a DNA test and both parties agreeing that Juvenile was Jelani&#x27;s father. His attorney stated that the case was resolved peacefully by consent order in 2006.

On February 25, 2010, Juvenile was arrested in Arabi, Louisiana. While Juvenile was recording music at a house there, a neighbor called police to report smelling marijuana. He was cited on a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession and later released on bond. He pleaded guilty in August 2010 and received a suspended three-month jail sentence and six months of probation and paid a $250 fine and court costs.

In 2017, Juvenile was arrested for failing to pay $170,000 in child support.

==Business ventures==
In 2020, Juvenile started up a furniture company called &quot;Made by Juvie&quot;. In 2023, Juvenile teamed up with Urban South Brewery for a new flavored drink called &quot;Juvie Juice&quot;.

<doc id="171240" wikidata="Q7225714" url="?curid=171240" title="Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.">
<text>Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429 (1895), affirmed on rehearing, 158 U.S. 601 (1895), was a landmark case of the Supreme Court of the United States. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the income tax imposed by the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act for being an unapportioned direct tax. The decision was superseded in 1913 by the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allows Congress to levy income taxes without apportioning them among the states.

The US Congress had introduced an income tax during the American Civil War, but the tax was repealed in 1872. In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, which lowered tariff rates and made up for some of the lost revenue by introducing taxes on income, corporate profits, gifts, and inheritances. Chief Justice Melville Fuller&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Pollock&quot; held that a federal tax on income derived from property was unconstitutional when it was not apportioned among the states according to representation in the House of Representatives. Fuller also held that federal taxation of interest earned on certain state bonds violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. In one dissent, Associate Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote that the majority opinion &quot;involves nothing less than the surrender of the taxing power to the moneyed class.&quot;

The Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Pollock&quot; was unpopular but effectively prevented Congress from implementing another income tax over the next two decades since the apportionment requirements were widely regarded as unworkable. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment essentially overturned the key holding in &quot;Pollock&quot;, and Congress established a new federal income tax in the Revenue Act of 1913. The Court&#x27;s holding regarding the taxation of interest income on certain bonds was later overruled in the 1988 case of &quot;South Carolina v. Baker&quot;.

== Before &quot;Pollock&quot; ==
===Early income tax===

In order to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War, Congress imposed the first federal income tax in U.S. history through passage of the Revenue Act of 1861. The act created a flat tax of three percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms). The taxation of income reflected the increasing amount of wealth held in stocks and bonds, rather than property, which the federal government had taxed in the past. Congress later further raised taxes, and by the end of the war, the income tax constituted about one fifth of the revenue of the federal government. The federal income tax remained in effect until its repeal in 1872. The constitutionality of the federal income tax was later upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1881 case of &quot;Springer v. United States&quot;.

The Socialist Labor Party advocated a graduated income tax in 1887. The Populist Party &quot;demanded a graduated income tax&quot; in its 1892 platform.

===Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act===
After winning control of Congress and the presidency in the 1892 elections, the Democratic Party made tariff reduction a key priority. President Grover Cleveland and his congressional allies proposed a bill that affected moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000, equivalent to $ today. Corporate profits, gifts, and inheritances would also be taxed at a two percent rate. The bill would restore the federal income tax for the first time since the 1870s; supporters of the income tax believed that it would help reduce income inequality and shift the burden of taxation to the wealthy.

The Democratic controlled Congress was ambivalent about the income tax but included it in the proposed bill in large part because of the efforts of Congressmen William Jennings Bryan and Benton McMillin. Despite strong conservative opposition to the income tax in the U.S. Senate, it remained a component of the final tariff bill, partly because many members of Congress believed that the US Supreme Court would eventually declare the tax to be unconstitutional. In August 1894, the bill became law as the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act.

== Plaintiff ==

In compliance with the Act, the New York-based Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Company announced to its shareholders that it would not only pay the tax but also provide, to the collector of internal revenue in the Department of the Treasury, the names of all people for whom the company was acting and thus were liable for being taxed under the Act.

Charles Pollock was a Massachusetts citizen who owned only ten shares of stock in the Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Company. He sued the company to prevent the company from paying the tax. He lost in the lower courts but finally appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

Arguing for Pollock was Joseph Hodges Choate, one of the most eminent Wall Street lawyers of his day.

== Decision ==

The Court handed down its decision on April 8, 1895, with Chief Justice Melville Fuller delivering the opinion of the Court. He ruled in Pollock&#x27;s favor by stating that the taxes levied by the Wilson-Gorman Act on income from property were unconstitutional. The Court treated the tax on income from property as a direct tax. The Constitution of the United States then said that such direct taxes were required to be imposed in proportion to the states&#x27; population. The tax in question had not been apportioned and so was invalid. As Chief Justice Fuller stated:

First. We adhere to the opinion already announced—that, taxes on real estate being indisputably direct taxes, taxes on the rents or income of real estate are equally direct taxes.

Second. We are of opinion that taxes on personal property, or on the income of personal property, are likewise direct taxes.

Third. The tax imposed by sections 27 to 37, inclusive, of the act of 1894, so far as it falls on the income of real estate, and of personal property, being a direct tax, within the meaning of the constitution, and therefore unconstitutional and void, because not apportioned according to representation, all those sections, constituting one entire scheme of taxation, are necessarily invalid.

The decrees hereinbefore entered in this court will be vacated. The decrees below will be reversed, and the cases remanded, with instructions to grant the relief prayed.

The Supreme Court did not rule that all income taxes were direct taxes. Instead, the Court held that although generally income taxes are indirect taxes (excises) authorized by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, taxes on interest, dividends, and rents in the 1894 Act had a profound effect on the underlying assets. The Court ruled that the tax on dividends, interest, and rent should be viewed as a direct tax, as they fell on the property itself, rather than as an indirect tax. Direct taxes were required to follow the rule of apportionment found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3. The rule of apportionment requires the amount of a direct tax collected to be divided by the number of members in the United States House of Representatives, with the quotient then multiplied by the number of representatives each state has to determine each state&#x27;s share of the tax that it then needs to lay and collect, through its own taxing authority.

A separate holding by the Court in &quot;Pollock&quot;, that federal taxation of interest earned on certain state bonds violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, was declared by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 to have been &quot;effectively overruled by subsequent case law&quot; (see &quot;South Carolina v. Baker&quot;).

=== Dissent ===
Justices John Marshall Harlan, Howell Edmunds Jackson, Edward Douglass White, and Henry Billings Brown dissented from the majority opinion. Justice White argued:

It is, I submit, greatly to be deplored that after more than 100 years of our national existence, after the government has withstood the strain of foreign wars and the dread ordeal of civil strife, and its people have become united and powerful, this court should consider itself compelled to go back to a long repudiated and rejected theory of the constitution, by which the government is deprived of an inherent attribute of its being—a necessary power of taxation.

In his dissent, Justice Brown wrote:

The decision involves nothing less than the surrender of the taxing power to the moneyed class. By resuscitating an argument that was exploded in the Hylton Case, and has lain practically dormant for a hundred years, it is made to do duty in nullifying, not this law alone, but every similar law that is not based upon an impossible theory of apportionment. Even the spectre of socialism is conjured up to frighten Congress from laying taxes upon the people in proportion to their ability to pay them.

== Subsequent history ==
In a nation in which the federal government was beginning its battle against monopolies and trusts, and the great bulk of wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, the decision in &quot;Pollock&quot; was unpopular, much like the decision in &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot;, of the same year. The following year, the Democratic Party, which had grabbed hold of the Populist movement, included an income tax plank in its election platform. Nonetheless, in the years after &quot;Pollock&quot;, Congress did not implement another federal income tax, partly because many Congressmen feared that any tax would be struck down by the Supreme Court. Few considered attempting to impose an apportioned income tax since such a tax was widely regarded as unworkable. Justice Harlan had predicted that in his dissent in &quot;Pollock&quot;:

When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does now adjudge, that Congress cannot impose a duty or tax upon personal property, or upon income arising either from rents of real estate or from personal property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds, except by apportioning the sum to be so raised among the States according to population, it practically decides that, without an amendment of the Constitution—two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States concurring—such property and incomes can never be made to contribute to the support of the national government.

=== Subsequent court treatments of &quot;Pollock&quot; and the Sixteenth Amendment ===

Nebraska Republican Senator Norris Brown publicly decried the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Pollock&quot; and proposed a constitutional amendment to remove the requirement that certain income taxes to be apportioned among the states by population. Brown&#x27;s proposal would be ratified in 1913 as the Sixteenth Amendment. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the requirement for &quot;those income taxes deemed to be direct&quot; in substance (such as taxes on income from property) to be apportioned among the states according to population. Thus, the effect of &quot;Pollock&quot; has indeed been overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment. The Revenue Act of 1913, which greatly lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax, was enacted shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.

Three years after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in the case of &quot;Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad&quot;. In &quot;Brushaber&quot;, the Court reviewed the history of the dichotomy between excises (indirect taxes) and direct taxes. The Court noted that the 1913 Income Tax Act was written as an indirect tax and did not violate the rule of uniformity. Thus, it was not written as a direct tax and was not subject to the rule of apportionment. The Court summarized what it had decided in &quot;Pollock&quot; and then went on to state the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment with respect to income taxes:

[T]he command of the amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to the rule of apportionment by a consideration of the source from which the taxed income may be derived forbids the application to such taxes of the rule applied in the Pollock case by which alone such taxes were removed from the great class of excises, duties, and imposts subject to the rule of uniformity and were placed under the other or direct class.

The Court in &quot;Brushaber&quot; also noted that before &quot;Pollock&quot;, taxes on income from professions, trades, employments, or vocations were excises. They were indirect in both form and substance and therefore had never been apportioned and thus they were entitled to be so enforced afterwards.

In contrast, with respect to taxes on income from property, the &quot;Pollock&quot; decision had disregarded form and considered substance alone. Justice White&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brushaber&quot; shows how the Sixteenth Amendment was written to prevent consideration of the direct effects of any income tax laid by Congress.

The Supreme Court in &quot;Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.&quot; added that the &quot;Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged.&quot; 240 U.S. 112 (1916).

That effect was reaffirmed in &quot;Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co.&quot;, , in which the Supreme Court reviewed &quot;Pollock&quot;, the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and the Sixteenth Amendment. The Court concluded, &quot;It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had power to tax all incomes.&quot;

<text>James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson (December 18, 1897 – December 29, 1952) was an American pianist, bandleader, arranger and composer, important in the development of big band jazz and swing music. He was one of the most prolific black musical arrangers and, along with Duke Ellington, is considered one of the most influential arrangers and bandleaders in jazz history. Henderson&#x27;s influence was vast. He helped bridge the gap between the Dixieland and the swing eras. He was often known as &quot;Smack&quot; Henderson (because of smacking sounds he made with his lips).

==Early life, family and education==

James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson was born in Cuthbert, Georgia. He was raised in a middle-class African-American family. His father, Fletcher Hamilton Henderson (1857–1943), was the principal of the nearby Howard Normal Randolph School from 1880 until 1942. Their home is a historic site. Henderson&#x27;s mother, a teacher, taught him and his brother Horace to play the piano. He began lessons by age six. His father would occasionally lock Fletcher in his room to practice for hours. By age 13, Henderson possessed a keen ability to read music and sense pitch. He pursued the studies with his mother and further engaged himself in lessons on European art.

Although a talented musician, Henderson initially dedicated himself to mathematics and science. At age 18, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and changed his name to Fletcher Henderson, giving up James, his grandfather&#x27;s name. He attended Atlanta University (where he was a member of the fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha) and graduated in 1920 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and mathematics.

==Career==
After graduation, Henderson moved to New York City with the intention of attending Columbia University for a master&#x27;s degree in chemistry. However, there is no evidence that he actually enrolled. He did land a part-time job as a lab assistant in a downtown Manhattan chemistry firm, but this only lasted a year.

In New York City, Henderson shared an apartment with a pianist who worked as a musician in a riverboat orchestra. When his roommate was too sick to perform, Henderson substituted, and this soon led to a job as a full-time replacement. In late 1920, he found work as a song demonstrator with the Pace and Handy Music Co. Henderson now found that music would be more profitable than chemistry and left his job as a laboratory chemist to begin a life in music. When Harry Pace left the company to start Black Swan Records, he took Henderson with him to be musical director, a job which lasted from 1921 until 1923. From 1920 to 1923, he primarily played piano accompaniment for blues singers. Henderson toured with the Black Swan Troubadours featuring Ethel Waters from October 1921 to July 1922. After hearing cornetist Louis Armstrong (then around 20 years old) in New Orleans while on tour in April 1922, Henderson sent him an offer, but Armstrong refused because Henderson would not hire Zutty Singleton as well.

Henderson&#x27;s activities up to the end of 1923 were mainly recording dates for Black Swan and other labels. His band at this point was only a pick-up unit for recordings, not a regular working band. In January 1924, the recording band became the house band at the Club Alabam at 216 W. 44th St. Despite many erroneous publications indicating otherwise, this 1924 band was Henderson&#x27;s first working band.

In July 1924, the band began a brief engagement at the Roseland Ballroom. Although only meant to stay for a few months, the band was brought back for the autumn season. Henderson called on Armstrong for a second time to join the band. On October 13, 1924, history was made when Henderson&#x27;s band began their re-engagement at Roseland, with Armstrong now in the orchestra. The band quickly became known as the best African American band in New York. By late 1924, the arrangements by Don Redman were featuring more solo work.

Redman arranged Armstrong&#x27;s repertoire with the King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, such as turning &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot; into &quot;Sugar Foot Stomp&quot;. Armstrong played in the band for only a year, because he could not grow accustomed to the arrangements and to the &quot;pretension&quot; of the other band members.

Henderson&#x27;s band boasted the formidable arranging talents of Don Redman. After Redman&#x27;s departure from the band in 1927, Henderson took on some of the arranging, but Benny Carter was Redman&#x27;s replacement as saxophone player and arranger from 1930 to 1931, and Henderson also bought scores from freelance musicians (including John Nesbitt from McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers). Henderson developed his arranging skills from 1931 to the mid-1930s.

His band around 1925 included Armstrong, Howard Scott, Coleman Hawkins (who started with Henderson in 1923, playing the tuba parts on a bass saxophone, and quickly moving to tenor saxophone and a leading solo role), Charlie Dixon, Kaiser Marshall, Buster Bailey, Elmer Chambers, Charlie Green, and Ralph Escudero. In 1925, with Henry Troy, he wrote &quot;Gin House Blues&quot;, recorded by Bessie Smith and Nina Simone, among others. His other compositions include &quot;Soft Winds&quot;. Henderson recorded extensively in the 1920s for nearly every label, including Vocalion, Paramount, Columbia, Ajax, Pathé, Perfect, Edison, Emerson, Brunswick, and the dime-store labels Banner, Oriole, Regal, Cameo, and Romeo. From 1925 to 1930, he recorded primarily for Columbia and Brunswick/Vocalion under his own name and a series of acoustic recordings as the Dixie Stompers for Harmony Records and associated dime-store labels (Diva and Velvet Tone). Besides playing at the Roseland, Henderson played at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, playing until 3:30 in the morning.

During the 1930s, he recorded for Columbia, Crown (as &quot;Connie&#x27;s Inn Orchestra&quot;), ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, Vocalion), Bluebird, Victor, and Decca. Starting in the early 1920s, he recorded popular hits and jazz tunes. In 1924, he and his band recorded 80 sides. His version of the pop tune &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get the One I Want&quot;, recorded about June 19, 1924, was issued on at least 23 labels.

In addition to Armstrong, lead trumpeters included Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen, Joe Smith, Rex Stewart, Tommy Ladnier, Doc Cheatham and Roy Eldridge. Lead saxophonists included Coleman Hawkins, Buster Bailey, Benny Carter and Chu Berry. Sun Ra also worked as an arranger during the 1940s, during Henderson&#x27;s engagement at the Club DeLisa in Chicago. Other jazz musicians who also played with Henderson included trumpeter Cootie Williams and trombonist Benny Morton.

Although Henderson&#x27;s band was popular, he had little success in managing it and was still little-known outside of New York. His lack of recognition outside of Harlem had to do more with the times in which he lived, apparently lackluster management, and the hard times that resulted after the 1929 stock market crash. Henderson had a knack for finding talent, but he did not have much luck keeping it. On many occasions he lost talented members to other bandleaders. He also had trouble with finances. When the band split up in 1934, he was forced to sell some of his popular arrangements to Benny Goodman to keep them together.

After about 1931, his own arrangements became influential. In addition to arrangements for his band, he wrote arrangements for Teddy Hill, Isham Jones and Benny Goodman. His shoulder was injured in an auto accident in 1928. His wife, Leora, blamed the accident for his diminishing success. She said that John Hammond and Goodman bought Henderson&#x27;s arrangements to support him, that Goodman always gave Henderson credit for the arrangements and said that he played them better than his own. In addition, Goodman and Hammond organized broadcasts and recordings to help Henderson when he was ill.

===Benny Goodman===
In 1935, Goodman&#x27;s Orchestra was selected as a house band for the NBC radio program &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Since Goodman needed new charts every week for the show, his brother-in-law John Hammond suggested that he purchase some from Henderson. Many of Goodman&#x27;s hits from the swing era were played by Henderson and his own band in the late 1920s and early 1930s, usually as head arrangements, which he transcribed from his own records and then sold to Goodman. However, his brother Horace Henderson recounted that the clarinetist made heavy demands on Henderson for fresh charts when his band was engaged for the &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; show in 1934–1935, and that he himself helped his brother complete some of them. The singer Helen Ward also stated that Henderson was delighted to hear the Goodman Orchestra realize his creations with such impeccable musicianship.

In 1939, Henderson disbanded his band and joined Goodman&#x27;s, first as pianist and arranger and then working full-time as staff arranger. Henderson re-formed bands of his own several times in the 1940s and toured with Ethel Waters again in 1948 and 1949.

Henderson suffered a stroke in 1950, resulting in partial paralysis that ended his career as a pianist. He died in New York City in 1952, 11 days after his 55th birthday.

===Contributions===
Henderson, along with Don Redman, established the formula for swing music. The two broke the band into sections (sax section, trumpet section, etc.). These sections worked together to create a unique sound. Sometimes, the sections would play in call-and-response style, and at other times one section would play supporting riffs behind the other.

Henderson was also responsible for bringing Louis Armstrong from Chicago to New York City in October 1924, thus flipping the focal point of jazz in the history of the United States (although Armstrong left the band in November 1925 and returned to Chicago). He also played a key role in bringing improvisatory jazz styles from New Orleans and other areas of the country to New York, where they merged with a dance-band tradition that relied heavily on arrangements written out in musical notation.

Henderson created a band that was capable of playing dance music and complex arrangements. Louis Metcalf said: &quot;The sight of Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s men playing behind music stands brought on a learning-to-read-music kick in Harlem which hadn&#x27;t cared before it. There were two years of real concentration. Everybody greeted you with &#x27;How&#x27;s studying?

A museum was established in Henderson&#x27;s memory in his native Cuthbert, Georgia.

<text>Madawaska County (2016 population 32,741), also known as the &quot;New Brunswick [[Salient (geography)|Panhandle]]&quot;, is located in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada.

==History==
The first inhabitants of what is now called Madawaska County were the Maliseet or Wolastoqiyik, who occupied and used the land along the Saint John River Valley north to the St. Lawrence River and south to the Penobscot River. There is debate concerning the true origin of the word &quot;Madawaska&quot;. The earliest settlers were from Quebec. The area was the focus of the bloodless Aroostook War, a border dispute led by businessman and political activist John Baker.

The earliest settlers of the Upper Saint John River Valley have been clearly verified, with census results of the Madawaska region taken in 1820 showing where most families had originated from Quebec.

<doc id="171252" wikidata="Q242725" url="?curid=171252" title="Ethel Waters">
<text>Ethel Waters (October 31, 1896 – September 1, 1977) was an American singer and actress. Waters frequently performed jazz, swing, and pop music on the Broadway stage and in concerts. She began her career in the 1920s singing blues. Her notable recordings include &quot;Dinah&quot;, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, &quot;Taking a Chance on Love&quot;, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, &quot;Supper Time&quot;, &quot;Am I Blue?&quot;, &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Virginia&quot;, and her version of &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot;. Waters was the second African American to be nominated for an Academy Award, the first African American to star on her own television show, and the first African-American woman to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.

==Early life==
Ethel Waters was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, on October 31, 1896 (some sources incorrectly state her birth year as 1900) to African-American mother Louise Anderson (1881–1962). Her birth was the result of the rape of teenaged Louise Anderson by 17-year-old John Wesley (a.k.a. Wesley John) Waters (1878–1901), a pianist and family acquaintance from a middle-class African-American background. Waters&#x27; family was very fair-skinned, his mother in particular. Waters played no role in raising his daughter. Many sources, including Ethel herself, reported for years that her mother was 12 or 13 years old at the time of the rape, and 13 when Ethel was born. Stephen Bourne opens his 2007 biography, &quot;Ethel Waters: Stormy Weather&quot;, with the statement that genealogical research has shown that Louise Anderson may have been 15 or 16 years old. 

Soon after Waters was born, her mother married Norman Howard, a railroad worker, with whom she had a daughter, Juanita Howard, Ethel&#x27;s half-sister. Ethel used the surname Howard as a child and then reverted to using the surname Waters. She was raised in poverty by Sally Anderson, her grandmother, who worked as a housemaid, and with two of her aunts and an uncle. Waters never lived in the same place for more than 15 months. Of her difficult childhood, she said &quot;I never was a child. I never was cuddled, liked, or understood by my family.&quot;

Waters grew tall, standing in her teens. According to jazz historian and archivist Rosetta Reitz, Waters&#x27;s birth in the North and her peripatetic (or nomadic) life exposed her to many cultures. Waters first married in 1910 at the age of 13, but her husband was abusive, and she soon left the marriage and became a maid in a Philadelphia hotel, working for $4.75 per week. On her 17th birthday, she attended a costume party at a nightclub on Juniper Street. She was persuaded to sing two songs and impressed the audience so much that she was offered professional work at the Lincoln Theatre in Baltimore. The job singing and dancing in Baltimore netted her $9 a week, with two of her friends weekly skimming $16 for getting her the job.

==Career==
===Singing===
After her start in Baltimore, Waters toured on the black vaudeville circuit, in her words &quot;from nine until unconscious.&quot; Despite her early success, she fell on hard times and joined a carnival traveling in freight cars headed for Chicago. She enjoyed her time with the carnival and recalled, &quot;the roustabouts and the concessionaires were the kind of people I&#x27;d grown up with, rough, tough, full of larceny towards strangers, but sentimental and loyal to their friends and co-workers.&quot; But she did not last long with them and soon headed south to Atlanta, where she worked in the same club as Bessie Smith. Smith demanded that Waters not compete in singing blues opposite her. Waters conceded and sang ballads and popular songs. Around 1919, Waters moved to Harlem and became a performer in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.

Her first Harlem job was at Edmond&#x27;s Cellar, a club with a black patronage that specialized in popular ballads. She acted in a blackface comedy, &quot;Hello 1919&quot;. Jazz historian Rosetta Reitz pointed out that by the time Waters returned to Harlem in 1921, women blues singers were among the most powerful entertainers in the country. In 1921, Waters became the fifth black woman to make a record, for tiny Cardinal Records. She later joined Black Swan, where Fletcher Henderson was her accompanist. Waters later commented that Henderson tended to perform in a more classical style than she preferred, often lacking &quot;the damn-it-to-hell bass.&quot;

She recorded for Black Swan from 1921 through 1923. Her contract with Harry Pace made her the highest paid black recording artist at the time. In early 1924, Paramount bought Black Swan, and she stayed with Paramount through the year.

Around that time, Waters was approached by Maury Greenwald for the London run of &quot;Plantation Days&quot;, although she later joined the company on its return to Chicago in August 1923, as an &quot;extra added attraction&quot; to &quot;save the fast-flopping revue&quot;.

She started working with Pearl Wright, and they toured in the South. In 1924, Waters played at the Plantation Club on Broadway. She also toured with the Black Swan Dance Masters.

She first recorded for Columbia in 1925, achieving a hit with &quot;Dinah&quot;.

With Earl Dancer, she joined what was called the &quot;white time&quot; Keith Vaudeville Circuit, a vaudeville circuit performing for white audiences and combined with screenings of silent movies. They received rave reviews in Chicago and earned the unheard-of salary of US$1,250 in 1928. In September 1926, Waters recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Virginia&quot;, composed by Donald Heywood with lyrics by Will Marion Cook. She is often wrongly attributed as the author. The following year, Waters sang it in a production of &quot;Africana&quot; at Broadway&#x27;s Daly&#x27;s Sixty-Third Street Theatre. In 1929, Waters and Wright arranged the unreleased Harry Akst song &quot;Am I Blue?&quot;, which was used in the movie &quot;On with the Show&quot; and became a hit and her signature song.

===Film, theater and television===

In 1933, Waters appeared in a satirical all-black film, &quot;Rufus Jones for President&quot;, which featured the child performer Sammy Davis Jr. as Rufus Jones.

She went on to star at the Cotton Club, where, according to her autobiography, she &quot;sang &#x27;Stormy Weather&#x27; from the depths of the private hell in which I was being crushed and suffocated.&quot; In 1933, she had a featured role in the successful Irving Berlin Broadway musical revue &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; with Clifton Webb, Marilyn Miller, and Helen Broderick. She became the first black woman to integrate Broadway&#x27;s theater district more than a decade after actor Charles Gilpin&#x27;s critically acclaimed performances in the plays of Eugene O&#x27;Neill beginning with &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; in 1920.

Waters held three jobs: in &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot;, as a singer for Jack Denny &amp; His Orchestra on a national radio program, and in nightclubs. She became the highest-paid performer on Broadway. Despite this status, she had difficulty finding work. She moved to Los Angeles to appear in the 1942 film &quot;Cairo&quot;. During the same year, she reprised her starring stage role as Petunia in the all-black film musical &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; directed by Vincente Minnelli, and starring Lena Horne as the &quot;ingénue&quot;. Conflicts arose when Minnelli swapped songs from the original script between Waters and Horne: Waters wanted to perform &quot;Honey in the Honeycomb&quot; as a ballad, but Horne wanted to dance to it. Horne broke her ankle and the songs were reversed. She got the ballad and Waters the dance. Waters sang the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Happiness is Just a Thing Called Joe&quot;.

In 1939, Waters became the first African American to star in her own television show: &quot;The Ethel Waters Show&quot;, a variety special, appeared on NBC&#x27;s New York station on June 14, 1939. It included a dramatic performance of the Broadway play &quot;Mamba&#x27;s Daughters&quot;, based on the Gullah community of South Carolina and produced with her in mind. The play was based on the novel by DuBose Heyward.

Waters was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the film &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949) under the direction of Elia Kazan after the first director, John Ford, quit over disagreements with Waters. According to producer Darryl F. Zanuck, Ford &quot;hated that old...woman (Waters).&quot; Ford, Kazan stated, &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to reach Ethel Waters.&quot; Kazan later referred to Waters&#x27;s &quot;truly odd combination of old-time religiosity and free-flowing hatred.&quot;

In 1950, she won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for her performance opposite Julie Harris in the play &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;. Waters and Harris repeated their roles in the 1952 film version.

In 1950, Waters was the first African-American actress to star in a television series, &quot;Beulah,&quot; which aired on ABC television from 1950 through 1952. It was the first nationally broadcast weekly television series starring an African American in the leading role. She starred as Beulah for the first year of the TV series before quitting in 1951, complaining that the portrayal of blacks was &quot;degrading.&quot; She was replaced by Louise Beavers in the second and third season. She guest-starred in 1957 and 1959 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. In a 1957 segment, she sang &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;.

==Personal life==
Her first autobiography, &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot;, (1951), written with Charles Samuels, was adapted for the stage by Larry Parr and premiered on October 7, 2005.

In 1953, she appeared in a Broadway show, &quot;At Home With Ethel Waters&quot; that opened on September 22, 1953, and closed October 10 after 23 performances.

Waters married three times and had no children. When she was 13, she married Merritt &quot;Buddy&quot; Purnsley in 1909; they divorced in 1913. She married Clyde Edwards Matthews in 1929, and they divorced in 1933. She married Edward Mallory in 1938; they divorced in 1945. Waters was the great-aunt of the singer-songwriter Crystal Waters. Waters may have also been married briefly to Earl Dancer in 1927.

According to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Waters identified as bisexual early in her career, though she never spoke publicly about her sexuality, and had a large gay and lesbian following that included photographer Carl Van Vechten. During the early 1920s, she reportedly lived in Harlem with dancer Ethel Williams, identified by several historical retrospectives as her romantic partner. This residence has been documented by the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, who write that Waters was &quot;well known in Harlem&#x27;s lesbian circles&quot; and that she and Williams were known to lesbian activist Mabel Hampton as &quot;the two Ethels&quot;. Singer Elisabeth Welch gave a similar account to British lesbian magazine &quot;Diva&quot; in 1997.

In 1938, Waters met artist Luigi Lucioni through their mutual friend, Carl Van Vechten. Lucioni asked Waters if he could paint her portrait, and a sitting was arranged at his studio at 64 Washington Square South. Waters bought the finished portrait from Lucioni in 1939 for $500. She was at the height of her career and the first African American to have a starring role on Broadway. In her portrait, she wore a tailored red dress with a mink coat draped over the back of her chair. Lucioni positioned Waters with her arms tightly wrapped around her waist, a gesture that conveyed vulnerability, as if she were trying to protect herself. The painting was considered lost because it had not been seen in public since 1942. Huntsville (Alabama) Museum of Art Executive Director Christopher J. Madkour and historian Stuart Embury traced it to a private residence. The owner considered Waters to be &quot;an adopted grandmother&quot; but she allowed the Huntsville Museum of Art to display &quot;Portrait of Ethel Waters&quot; in the 2016 exhibition &quot;American Romantic: The Art of Luigi Lucioni&quot; where it was viewed by the public for the first time in more than 70 years. The museum acquired &quot;Portrait of Ethel Waters&quot; in 2017, and it was shown in an exhibition in February 2018.

A turning point came in 1957 when she attended the Billy Graham Crusade in Madison Square Garden. Years later, she gave this testimony of that night: &quot;In 1957, I, Ethel Waters, a 380-pound decrepit old lady, rededicated my life to Jesus Christ, and boy, because He lives, just look at me now. I tell you because He lives; and because my precious child, Billy, gave me the opportunity to stand there, I can thank God for the chance to tell you His eye is on all of us sparrows.&quot; In her later years, Waters often toured with the preacher Billy Graham on his crusades. She was a baptized Catholic and considered herself a member of that religion throughout her life.

Waters died on September 1, 1977, aged 80, from uterine cancer, kidney failure, and other ailments, in Chatsworth, California. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale). Waters had given a collection of her papers, recordings, and personal effects to her friend Joan Croomes, which were later placed at the Harry Ransom Center where they are now available for research.

&quot;Ethel&quot; was written and performed by Terry Burrell as a one-woman tribute to Waters. It ran as a limited engagement in February and March 2012.

<text>Goodie Mob is an American hip hop group based in Atlanta, Georgia, consisting of CeeLo Green, Khujo, T-Mo, and Big Gipp.

== History ==
The group was formed in 1991 by Cameron &quot;Big Gipp&quot; Gipp, Willie &quot;Khujo&quot; Knighton Jr., CeeLo Green (born Thomas Callaway), and Robert &quot;T-Mo&quot; Barnett in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1995, Goodie Mob released their debut album, &quot;Soul Food&quot;, which was critically acclaimed and certified Gold. The album aired social and political issues such as racism, discrimination, geopolitics, and gentrification. Their debut single &quot;Cell Therapy&quot; reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles chart. Goodie Mob is part of the hip hop/R&amp;B musical collective, Dungeon Family, also based in Atlanta. Like numerous musicians in Atlanta&#x27;s hip hop scene, their career would in fact emerge from the so-called &quot;Dungeon,&quot; the name given to the recording studio which was located in the basement Rico Wade&#x27;s mother.

In 1998, Goodie Mob released their second album, &quot;Still Standing&quot;. The album continued the group&#x27;s style of social commentary, and CeeLo&#x27;s singing talents were used more frequently. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;World Party&quot;, veered away from their gritty style and instead incorporated lighter beats and party related subject matter. During its production, CeeLo left the group to pursue a solo career when he was unhappy with the project&#x27;s direction. Goodie Mob&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;One Monkey Don&#x27;t Stop No Show&quot;, was released in 2004 and suffered a poor reception, resulting in Big Gipp also leaving the group. T-Mo and Khujo formed the duo Lumberjacks, which they released the album &quot;Livin&#x27; Life as Lumberjacks&quot; in 2005. Big Gipp, as part of the duo Ali &amp; Gipp, released their album Kinfolk in 2006.

Also in 2006, all four members of Goodie Mob performed together following a Gnarls Barkley concert, marking the group&#x27;s reunion. In 2011, Goodie Mob signed with Elektra Records and worked on a new album, which would eventually become &quot;Age Against the Machine&quot;, released in 2013.

After a seven years gap, they released a new album &quot;Survival Kit&quot; in November 2020.

=== Recent history ===
On August 19, 2008, Goodie Mob performed on stage together unannounced at the Tabernacle in Atlanta during a free Nelly concert.

On September 19, 2009, Goodie Mob performed for the first official reunion concert at the Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia. The group also performed with all the original members at the Smoke Out festival in San Bernardino, California, on October 23, 2009.

As of 2011, Goodie Mob is signed with Elektra Records.

On March 12, 2010, Goodie Mob performed &quot;Get Rich to This&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada, for part of the Red Bull Soundclash concert that featured CeeLo.

On April 28, 2011, CeeLo brought out Goodie Mob during his performance at Sunfest in West Palm Beach, Florida. The group performed four songs together, including &quot;Black Ice (Sky High)&quot;, &quot;Cell Therapy&quot;, and &quot;Soul Food&quot;.

On July 25, 2011, CeeLo announced via his Twitter that Goodie Mob&#x27;s reunion album would be titled &quot;We Sell Drugs Too.&quot; However, in February 2012 CeeLo tweeted that the name has been changed to &quot;Age Against the Machine.&quot;

After &quot;Survival Kit&quot; was released on November 13, 2020, the group planned to start touring in December 2020.

<text>Tad Morose is a Swedish power metal band. Formed in Bollnäs in 1991, they are led by guitarist Christer &quot;Krunt&quot; Andersson. Their style has been described as &quot;a power/classic heavy metal hybrid with slight progressive tendencies&quot;.

== History ==
Tad Morose&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Christer Andersson, Per-Ola Olsson, and Dan-Erik Eriksson. Their full-length debut was &quot;Leaving the Past Behind&quot;, released in 1993. In the subsequent decade the band went through numerous lineup changes, with Andersson as the only consistent member, and released a total of seven albums. A relative success came to the band with the arrival of lead singer Urban Breed, who appears on four albums, including highlights &quot;Undead&quot; (2000) and &quot;Matters of the Dark&quot; (2002). The band released &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot; in 2004, signaling a shift away from symphonic and progressive metal toward a more traditional metal sound. In late 2004 Urban Breed departed. The band toured for several years after the release of &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot;, with several more lineup changes including a stint by singer Joe Comeau, but they were unable to return to the recording studio.

Tad Morose reformed in 2013 with a new lineup featuring singer Ronny Hemlin, formerly of Steel Attack. The reformed band released the albums &quot;Revenant&quot; in 2013 and &quot;St. Demonius&quot; in 2015, which renewed the band&#x27;s European power metal sound. Tad Morose then signed with GMR Music. Their ninth album, &quot;Chapter X&quot;, was released in June 2018. Their tenth album, &quot;March of the Obsequious&quot;, was released on August 26, 2022.

<doc id="171267" wikidata="Q139732" url="?curid=171267" title="Psilotum">
<text>Psilotum is a genus of fern-like vascular plants. It is one of two genera in the family Psilotaceae commonly known as whisk ferns, the other being &quot;Tmesipteris&quot;. Plants in these two genera were once thought to be descended from the earliest surviving vascular plants, but more recent phylogenies place them as basal ferns, as a sister group to Ophioglossales. They lack true roots and leaves are very reduced, the stems being the organs containing photosynthetic and conducting tissue. There are only two species in &quot;Psilotum&quot; and a hybrid between the two. They differ from those in &quot;Tmesipteris&quot; in having stems with many branches and a synangium with three lobes rather than two.

==Description and life cycle==
Whisk ferns in the genus &quot;Psilotum&quot; lack true roots but are anchored by creeping rhizomes. The stems have many branches with paired enations, which look like small leaves but have no vascular tissue. Above these enations there are synangia formed by the fusion of three sporangia and which produce the spores. When mature, the synangia release yellow to whitish spores which develop into a gametophyte less than long. The gametophyte lives underground as a mycoheterotroph, tapping into mycorrhizal networks to access carbon and other nutrients. When the gametophyte is mature, it is monoicous, producing both egg and sperm cells. The sperm cells swim using several flagella and when they reach an egg cell, unite with it to form the young sporophyte. A mature sporophyte may grow to a height of or more but has no apparent leaves. The stem has a core of thick-walled protostele in its centre surrounded by an endodermis which regulates the flow of water and nutrients. The surface of the stem is covered with stomata which allow gas exchange with the surroundings.

The gametophyte of &quot;Psilotum&quot; is unusual in that it branches dichotomously, lives underground and possesses vascular tissue. The nutrition of the gametophyte appears to be myco-heterotrophic, assisted by endophytic fungi.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Psilotum&quot; was first formally described in 1801 by Olof Swartz and the description was published in &quot;Journal für die Botanik (Schrader)&quot;. The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek word &quot;psilos&quot; meaning &quot;bare&quot;, &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;bald&quot; referring to the lack of the usual plant organs, and the seeming lack of leaves.

==Species and distribution==
There are two species, &quot;Psilotum nudum&quot; and &quot;Psilotum complanatum&quot;, with a hybrid between them known, &quot;Psilotum&quot; × &quot;intermedium&quot; W. H. Wagner.

The distribution of &quot;Psilotum&quot; is tropical and subtropical, in the New World, Asia, and the Pacific, with a few isolated populations in south-west Europe. The highest latitudes known are in South Carolina, Cádiz province in Spain, and southern Japan for &quot;P. nudum&quot;. In the U.S., &quot;P. nudum&quot; is found from Florida to Texas, and &quot;P. complanatum&quot; in Hawaii.

==Relation to ferns==
&quot;Psilotum&quot; superficially resembles certain extinct early vascular plants, such as the rhyniophytes and the trimerophyte genus &quot;Psilophyton&quot;. The unusual features of &quot;Psilotum&quot; that suggest an affinity with early vascular plants include dichotomously branching sporophytes, aerial stems arising from horizontal rhizomes, a simple vascular cylinder, homosporous and terminal eusporangia and a lack of roots. Unfortunately, no fossils of psilophytes are known to exist. A careful study of the morphology and anatomy suggests that whisk ferns are not closely related to rhyniophytes, and that the ancestral features present in living psilophytes represent a reduction from a more typical modern fern plant. Significant differences between &quot;Psilotum&quot; and the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes are that the development of its vascular strand is exarch, while it is centrarch in rhyniophytes and trimerophytes. The sporangia of &quot;Psilotum&quot; are trilocular synangia resulting from the fusion of three adjacent sporangia, and these are borne laterally on the axes. In the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes the sporangia were single and in a terminal position on branches.

Molecular evidence strongly confirms that &quot;Psilotum&quot; is a fern (in the broad sense that includes horsetails) and that psilophytes are sister to ophioglossoid ferns.

<text>Christopher Julius Rock (born February 7, 1965) is an American comedian, actor, and filmmaker. He first gained prominence for his stand-up routines in the 1980s in which he tackled subjects including race relations, human sexuality, and observational comedy. His success branched off into productions in film, television, and on-stage, having received multiple accolades including three Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album, four Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Rock was ranked No. 5 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. He also ranked No. 5 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 50 Best Stand-Up Comics of All Time.

After years working as a stand-up comedian and appearing in minor film roles including &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), Rock gained prominence as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1990 to 1993. While at &quot;SNL&quot;, he appeared in the films &quot;New Jack City&quot; (1991) and &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992). In 1993, he appeared in &quot;CB4&quot;, which he also wrote and produced. He reached mainstream stardom with &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; in 1996. Rock continued making specials which include &quot;Bigger &amp; Blacker&quot; (1999), &quot;Never Scared&quot; (2004), &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; (2008), &quot;Tamborine&quot; (2018), and &quot;Selective Outrage&quot; (2023). He developed, wrote, produced and narrated the sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; (2005–2009), which was based on his early life. From 1997 to 2000 HBO aired his talk show &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;.

Rock was cast in starring film roles in &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; (1998), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (2005), the &quot;Madagascar&quot; franchise (2005–2012), &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot; (2007), &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (2010), &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2010), &quot;Top Five&quot; (2014), &quot;The Week Of&quot; (2018), &quot;Spiral&quot; (2021), &quot;Amsterdam&quot; (2022), and &quot;Rustin&quot; (2023). He has taken roles on television including &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot;, and &quot;Fargo&quot;. He made his Broadway theater debut in the 2011 Stephen Adly Guirgis play &quot;The Motherfucker with the Hat&quot;. He has hosted the Academy Awards twice; in 2005 and 2016, and was involved in a highly controversial incident in which he was slapped on stage by Will Smith at the 2022 Awards.

==Early life==
Rock was born in Andrews, South Carolina, on February 7, 1965. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. A few years later, they relocated and settled in the working class area of Bedford–Stuyvesant. His mother, Rosalie (&quot;née&quot; Tingman), was a teacher and social worker for people with developmental disabilities; his father, Julius Rock, was a truck driver and newspaper deliveryman. Julius died in 1988 after ulcer surgery.

Rock is the eldest of his parents&#x27; seven children (six boys and one girl), and he had an older paternal half-brother, Charles Ledell Rock, who died in 2006 after suffering from alcoholism. Rock&#x27;s younger brothers Tony, Kenny, and Jordan are also in the entertainment business.

Rock&#x27;s family history was profiled on the PBS series &quot;African American Lives 2&quot; in 2008. A DNA test showed that he is of Cameroonian descent, specifically from the people of northern Cameroon. Rock&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Julius Caesar Tingman, was enslaved for 21 years before serving in the American Civil War as part of the United States Colored Troops, then later was elected to two terms in the South Carolina House of Representatives. During the 1940s, Rock&#x27;s paternal grandfather moved from South Carolina to New York City to become a taxicab driver and preacher.

Rock was bused to schools in predominantly white neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he endured bullying and beatings from white students. As he grew older, the bullying worsened and Rock&#x27;s parents pulled him out of James Madison High School. He dropped out of high school altogether, but he later earned a General Educational Development (GED). Rock then worked various jobs at fast-food restaurants including Red Lobster.

==Career==
===1984–1999: &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and standup ===

Rock began working as a stand-up comic during 1984 in New York City&#x27;s Catch a Rising Star. Upon seeing his act at a nightclub, Eddie Murphy befriended and mentored the aspiring comic. Murphy gave Rock his first film role and big break in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987). Rock rose up the ranks of the comedy circuit in addition to earning bit roles in the film &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1988) and the TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

Rock was a cast member of the sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1990 to 1993. He and other new cast members Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and David Spade became known as the Bad Boys of SNL. In 1991, he released his first comedy album, &quot;Born Suspect&quot; and won acclaim for his role as a crack addict in the film &quot;New Jack City&quot;. His tenure on &quot;SNL&quot; gave Rock national exposure. (Rock has hosted &quot;SNL&quot; four times; in 1996, 2014, 2020 and 2024.)
With plans to leave &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after the 1992–93 season, Rock was effectively &quot;fired&quot; from the show. Beginning that fall, he appeared in six episodes of the predominantly African American sketch show &quot;In Living Color&quot; as a special guest star. The show was canceled a month after he arrived. Rock then wrote and starred in the low-budget comedy &quot;CB4&quot;, which made $18 million against its budget of $6 million. He signed on as client of 3 Arts Entertainment.

Rock headlined his first HBO comedy special in 1994, titled &quot;Big Ass Jokes&quot;, as part of &quot;HBO Comedy Half-Hour&quot;. His second special, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Pain&quot;, made Rock one of the most acclaimed and commercially successful comedians in the industry. Rock won two Emmy Awards for the special and gained large critical acclaim. A controversial part of the special was &quot;Niggas vs. Black People&quot;.
For his much-publicized role as a commentator for Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; during the 1996 Presidential elections, he earned another Emmy nomination. Rock also was the voice for the &quot;Lil Penny&quot; puppet who was the alter ego to basketball star Penny Hardaway in a series of Nike shoe commercials from 1994 to 1998, and hosted the &#x27;97 MTV Video Music Awards.Rock&#x27;s first music video was for his song &quot;Your Mother&#x27;s Got a Big Head&quot; from his album &quot;Born Suspect.&quot; Rock also made videos for his songs &quot;Champagne&quot; from &quot;Roll With the New&quot; and &quot;No Sex (In the Champagne Room)&quot; from &quot;Bigger &amp; Blacker&quot;.

Rock later had two more HBO comedy specials: &quot;Bigger &amp; Blacker&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Never Scared&quot; in 2004. Articles relating to both specials called Rock &quot;the funniest man in America&quot; in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. HBO also aired his talk show, &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;, which gained critical acclaim for Rock&#x27;s interviews with celebrities and politicians. The show won an Emmy for writing. His television work has won him a total of three Emmy Awards and 15 nominations. By the end of the decade, Rock was established as one of the preeminent stand-up comedians and comic minds of his generation. During this time, Rock also translated his comedy into print form in the book &quot;Rock This!&quot; and released the Grammy Award-winning comedy albums, &quot;Roll with the New&quot;, &quot;Bigger &amp; Blacker&quot; and &quot;Never Scared&quot;. Rock&#x27;s fifth HBO special, &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;, premiered on September 27, 2008, and won him another Emmy for outstanding writing for a variety or music program.

It was not until the success of his stand-up act in the late 1990s that Rock began receiving leading man status in films. He began the decade with supporting roles in such films as &quot;New Jack City&quot; (1991) as crack addict Pookie, in the Eddie Murphy comedy &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992), the Steve Martin comedy &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot; (1996) as well as &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot; (1997), and &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; (1998). He also appeared in the Kevin Smith fantasy comedy film &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999). The film received positive reviews and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The film starred an ensemble cast with actors such as Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alan Rickman, Salma Hayek, and George Carlin.
=== 2000–2009: Sitcom and stardom ===

He then starred in the dark comedy &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; (2000) starring Renée Zellweger, Greg Kinnear and Morgan Freeman which also debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on May 11, 2000. The film was a critical success. In the later 2000s, Rock started to work increasingly behind the camera. He wrote the film &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (2001) along with friend and comedian Louis C.K. The film was based on the Warren Beatty film, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978). That same year Rock also produced and starred in the C.K. directed film &quot;Pootie Tang&quot; (2001). Rock also would work as a writer and director of the political comedy &quot;Head of State&quot; (2003) and marital comedy &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot; (2007). He also played the lead in both films. He also went on to star in films like &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (2005) opposite Adam Sandler, and the action comedy film &quot;Bad Company&quot; (2002) opposite Anthony Hopkins.

 &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; (2005–2009)

In September 2005, the UPN television network premiered a comedy series called &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, loosely based on Rock&#x27;s school days, for which he was the executive producer and narrator. The show garnered both critical and ratings success. The series was nominated for a 2006 Golden Globe for Best TV Series (Musical or Comedy), a 2006 People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New Television Comedy, and two 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards for costuming and cinematography.

Starting in 2005, Rock has also voiced the eccentric zebra Marty in DreamWorks&#x27; animated film franchise &quot;Madagascar&quot;. He starred in two of the film&#x27;s sequels, &quot;&quot; (2008), and &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2013). In 2007 Rock voiced Mooseblood the Mosquito in the Jerry Seinfeld animated film, &quot;Bee Movie&quot;.

In 2009, Rock released his first documentary, 2009&#x27;s &quot;Good Hair&quot;. The film focuses on the issue of how African-American women have perceived their hair and historically styled it. The film explores the current styling industry for black women, images of what is considered acceptable and desirable for African American women&#x27;s hair in the United States, and their relation to African American culture. The film premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival where it earned critical acclaim and received a Special Jury Prize. The National Board of Review named it one of the five best documentaries of the year. Rock was also nominated for the Gotham Award for Best Documentary and for the Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. Rock has since stated working on a documentary about debt called &quot;Credit Is the Devil&quot;.

=== 2010–2019: Career expansion ===
Some of his 2010s film appearances include the black comedy &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2010) a remake of the British comedy of the same name. The film starred Peter Dinklage, Martin Lawrence, Tracy Morgan, Kevin Hart, Zoe Saldana, and Luke Wilson. The film received mixed reviews, although Roger Ebert, critic of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, praised the film writing: &quot;I laughed all the way through, in fact. This is the best comedy since &quot;The Hangover&quot;, and although it&#x27;s almost a scene-by-scene remake of a 2007 British movie with the same title, it&#x27;s funnier than the original.&quot; Rock also starred in the summer comedy &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (2010) alongside Adam Sandler, Kevin James, David Spade and Maya Rudolph, and reunited with them for a sequel in 2013.

In 2011, Rock appeared on Broadway in Stephen Adly Guirgis&#x27; play &quot;The Motherfucker with the Hat&quot; with Bobby Cannavale and Annabella Sciorra. Rock was nominated for a Drama League Award. In an interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, Rock stated that he chose to do Broadway because he wanted more people to see him &quot;really act. Sometimes when you do comedy, that can be a little formulaic, and it&#x27;s hard for really good directors to see that you can act.&quot;

He produced the series &quot;Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell&quot;, which premiered in August 2012. While serving as producer, he had a production company, Chris Rock Enterprises (or CR Enterprises) for short. In 2012, he starred in the ensemble romantic comedy film &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot; alongside Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Kendrick, and Elizabeth Banks. Despite earning negative reviews, the film was a financial success. Rock earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor – Comedy nomination for his performance. That same year he starred in the romantic comedy &quot;2 Days in New York&quot; (2012) opposite Julie Delpy. The film served as the sequel to Delpy&#x27;s previous film, &quot;2 Days in Paris&quot; (2007). The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival where it received positive reviews, with critics praising the chemistry between the two with Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing: &quot;The best of the humor is verbal and attitudinal, all delivered at a rapid clip in overlapping languages that Preston Sturges or Howard Hawks would have admired.&quot;

In 2014, Rock scripted, directed and starred in the film &quot;Top Five&quot;, which critics have drawn comparison to Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980). The film is a social commentary on fame and society. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Scott Foundas, critic for &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film writing: &quot;Rock has finally found a big-screen vehicle for himself that comes close to capturing the electric wit, shrewd social observations and deeply autobiographical vein of his standup comedy.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Peter Travers wrote in his review: &quot;Rock delivers the laughs, big ones, laced with razor-sharp observations on everything from pop culture to racial politics... His confident, prowling wit as a stand-up has finally found its way to the screen, enhanced by a bracing vulnerability. &quot;Top Five&quot; is Rock&#x27;s best movie by a mile.&quot;

In 2015 Rock attended the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot; on NBC where he introduced and paid tribute to fellow comedian and former SNL cast member Eddie Murphy. Also in 2015, Rock appeared as himself in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s Christmas musical special, &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot; starring Bill Murray. In the film, Rock sings &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot; with Murray. The film debuted on Netflix and received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. He also appeared as himself in another Netflix film, &quot;Sandy Wexler&quot; (2017) starring Adam Sandler. In 2018, he starred in the Netflix comedy &quot;The Week Of&quot; directed by Robert Smigel starring Sandler. The film follows two fathers during the week of the wedding of their children.

The following year, he briefly appeared in the comedy film &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot; (2019) starring Eddie Murphy. In the film, Murphy portrayed Rudy Ray Moore and centers around his career as a standup, and director of blaxploitation starting with &quot;Dolemite&quot; (1975). The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He directed and appeared in the music video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers song &quot;Hump de Bump&quot;, and has simply appeared in several videos, including the Big Daddy Kane music video &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; as a guy getting his hair cut, one of the many celebrities seen lip-synching in Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot;, a cameo in Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bitch I&#x27;m Madonna&quot;, and as a Wild West sheriff chasing down an 1889 cowboy version of Lil Nas X in &quot;Old Town Road&quot;.

On October 30, 2016, Netflix announced that they would be releasing two new stand-up comedy specials from Rock, with Rock being paid $40 million per special. The first special, &quot;Chris Rock: Tamborine&quot;, was released on Netflix on February 14, 2018. It was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and was directed by comedian Bo Burnham. The specials marked the comedian&#x27;s first concert specials released in 10 years. The special earned a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nomination.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, Rock portrayed central character Loy Cannon in the fourth season of the FX crime anthology series &quot;Fargo&quot;. In 2021, he starred in a reboot of the &quot;Saw franchise&quot;, &quot;Spiral&quot; (2021), which dabbled into the territory of the horror film genre. Rock responded to the Will Smith slap in his March 4, 2023, Netflix special &quot;Chris Rock: Selective Outrage&quot;; it was Netflix&#x27;s first-ever live event. The show streamed live from the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland. The special received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations including two for Rock for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special.

In 2023, it was announced that Rock would direct a biopic on civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with Steven Spielberg producing. The film will be based on the biography &quot;&quot; by Jonathan Eig.

In 2024, it was announced that Rock would direct an English language adaptation of Thomas Vinterberg&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film &quot;Another Round&quot; (2020). Rock also wrote and is set to direct the upcoming film &quot;Misty Green&quot;, which debuts in November 2024 at the American Film Market. Neon International is handling foreign rights, while CAA Media Finance is responsible for domestic rights.

==Academy Awards==
=== 2005 ceremony ===
In February 2005, Rock hosted the 77th Academy Awards ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an &quot;edge&quot; to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying &quot;Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!&quot; During one segment Rock asked, &quot;Who is this guy?&quot; in reference to actor Jude Law seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent Tom Cruise (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: &quot;If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!&quot;). Subsequently, an angry Sean Penn took the stage to present and said, &quot;In answer to our host&#x27;s question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.&quot; (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;.) Law was not the only actor that Rock roasted that evening, however—he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, &quot;If you want Denzel [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!&quot; Older Academy officials were reportedly displeased with Rock&#x27;s performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony. Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as &quot;idiotic&quot;, and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.

=== 2016 ceremony ===
On October 21, 2015, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Rock would host the 88th Academy Awards the following February. When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony. Rock declined, stating at the ceremony that it would have accomplished little since the show would have proceeded anyway, with him simply replaced. Instead, Rock spoke of his concerns about the lack of diversity in AMPAS at various times during the show, closing by saying &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;.

Rock&#x27;s performance was largely praised by critics. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Mary McNamara wrote: &quot;Rock&#x27;s Oscars had some of the most powerful moments seen in the telecast&#x27;s history. His decision to honestly answer the question &#x27;Is Hollywood racist?&#x27; was brave and effective,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; television critic James Poniewozik, praised Rock&#x27;s performance for being &quot;evenhanded without being wishy-washy&quot; and that he represented &quot;an example of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right opportunity.&quot;

=== 2022 ceremony ===

Rock presented the award for Best Documentary Feature at the 94th Academy Awards in March 2022. During the ceremony, Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith&#x27;s shaved head, which he compared to Demi Moore&#x27;s shaved head in &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;, saying, &quot;Jada, I love ya. &quot;G.I. Jane 2,&quot; can&#x27;t wait to see it!&quot;. Pinkett Smith had shaved her head due to alopecia areata. Her husband, Will Smith, responded to Rock&#x27;s joke by walking onstage and slapping Rock, who remarked, &quot;Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.&quot; Smith then returned to his seat and yelled twice at Rock, &quot;Keep my wife&#x27;s name out your fucking mouth!&quot; Rock went on to say that this &quot;was the greatest night in the history of television.&quot; Later in the night, Smith was named Best Actor for &quot;King Richard&quot;. In his acceptance speech, he apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock. Rock declined to file a report with the Los Angeles Police Department regarding the incident.

The next day, amid public backlash, Smith issued a formal apology to Rock via a public Instagram post, adding that &quot;a joke about Jada&#x27;s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.&quot; He also stated that &quot;I was out of line&quot; and that his behavior was &quot;unacceptable and inexcusable.&quot; During a stand-up performance in Boston later that month, Rock stated that Smith had not reached out to him personally and they had not spoken since the ceremony.

==Comedic style and views==
Rock&#x27;s subject matter typically involves family, politics, romance, music, celebrities, and race relations in the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in Bensonhurst. In his memoir &quot;Rock This&quot;, he recalls, &quot;My parents assumed I&#x27;d get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.&quot;

Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 &quot;Roll With The New&quot; show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: &quot;Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It&#x27;s course, this is just for black entertainers. You don&#x27;t see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he&#x27;s a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave you&#x27;ve got to be an entertainer and a leader. It&#x27;s too much.&quot; Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: &quot;You can&#x27;t be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.&quot;

At the London Live Earth concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the BBC, before introducing the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rock called the crowd &quot;motherfuckers&quot; and said &quot;shit&quot;, and after a brief pause said he was joking. Due to the broadcast being at 5:45p.m., Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for his use of the word &quot;motherfucker&quot;.

Chris Rock has been an avid fan of the New York Mets baseball team since childhood. He complained that his team &quot;had no money&quot; during a 2011 interview with David Letterman.

During a 2008 rant on his &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; tour, Rock labeled George W. Bush as &quot;the worst president ever&quot;.

Rock has campaigned against the racial profiling of African-Americans, and often speaks of the everyday racism he experiences “despite being famous”. In a 2013 episode of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; with Jerry Seinfeld, Rock and Seinfeld are pulled over by the police for speeding while Seinfeld was driving. In the episode Rock admits to Seinfeld that &quot;If you weren&#x27;t here, I&#x27;d be scared. Yeah, I&#x27;m famous – still black.&quot; In 2015, Rock was pulled over three times in the first three months of the year. Each time Rock posted a selfie of the incident, without further comment as to the reason for the stops or whether he was issued a citation.

In May 2021, Rock voiced opposition to cancel culture. He said that it has led to &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;unfunny&quot; material from comedians. He also commented that there is an existing built-in mechanism for audiences informing comedians that their content does not work, like the audience not laughing at their jokes. Rock went on to say &quot;Everybody&#x27;s scared to make a move. That&#x27;s not a place to be. You know, we should have the right to fail because failure is a part of art.&quot;

Rock has said that he was influenced by the performing style of his paternal grandfather, Allen Rock, a preacher. Rock&#x27;s comedy influences are Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Flip Wilson, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Pigmeat Markham, Woody Allen, Bill Maher,
Eddie Murphy, Sam Kinison, George Carlin, Mort Sahl, and Rodney Dangerfield.

Comedians who have cited Rock as an influence include Dave Chappelle, Christian Finnegan, George Lopez, Kevin Hart, and Trevor Noah.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships ===
Rock married Malaak Compton-Rock on November 23, 1996. Compton-Rock is the founder and executive director of StyleWorks, a non-profit, full-service hair salon that provides free services for women leaving welfare and entering the workforce. The couple lived in Alpine, New Jersey with their two daughters. In December 2014, Rock filed for divorce from Compton-Rock. Rock admitted to infidelity in the marriage, as well as struggling with a pornography addiction. The divorce was finalized on August 22, 2016.

On July 7, 2022, it was reported that Rock had started dating actress, screenwriter, and director Lake Bell. Rock later self-identified as single in his 2023 Netflix special.

=== Religion ===
According to Dylan Novak, a Protestant preacher known by the online alias &quot;Celebrity Preacher&quot;, he had a interaction with Rock where he learned that Rock&#x27;s faith &quot;did not stick with him as he grew up.&quot; In a 1989 stand-up routine, Rock remarked, &quot;When you’re black there’s like no religion to turn to... It’s like, Christianity? I don’t think so. White people justified slavery and segregation through Christianity so a black Christian is like a black person with no… memory.&quot;

According to &quot;Vibe&quot;, in 2017, Rock stated during his Total Blackout Tour that he was &quot;trying to get a little bit of religion… Not a lot,&quot; and that he wanted to &quot;find God before God finds me.&quot; He also said that he believed in God a little bit but that he practices the religion of comedy.

=== Lawsuit ===
In 2012, Rock settled a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse. Rock was not charged with a crime and has denied that the alleged rape ever occurred.

=== Cannabis ===
On August 20, 2019, Rock, along with several other celebrities, invested in a funding round for Lowell Herb Co, a California cannabis brand. He is known to be &quot;a dedicated cannabis consumer.&quot;

=== Health ===
On September 18, 2020, Rock said that he was diagnosed with a non-verbal learning disorder, a neurological condition that makes it difficult for him to understand non-verbal social cues.

<text>A croupier or dealer is someone appointed at a gambling table to assist in the conduct of the game, especially in the distribution of bets and payouts. Croupiers are typically employed by casinos.

==Origin of the word==
Originally a &quot;croupier&quot; meant one who stood behind a gambler, with extra reserves of cash to back him up during a gambling session. The word derived from &quot;croupe&quot; (the rump of a horse) and was by way of analogy to one who rode behind on horseback. It later came to refer to one who was employed to collect the money from a gaming-table.

Originally a &quot;dealer&quot; meant one who was responsible for distributing cards or the player in the dealer position, regardless of whether or not that player was responsible for distributing the cards.

== Training ==

Training methods to become a casino croupier vary from country to country. In North America, blackjack is almost always the game that dealers learn first, as it is simple and popular, and when the dealer makes errors, they tend not to cost the casino much money. In Europe, croupiers tend to learn roulette first. Complex, busy games such as craps, with complicated payout systems, etc., are usually reserved for the most competent and/or ambitious dealers.
== Licensing ==
American, Australian, Canadian and British croupiers are required to apply for a gambling license. This license includes police background checks and credit rating checks, to help determine if they are eligible to commence employment. Croupiers are not permitted to deal at a casino until being issued this license.

== Tipping ==
As is common with customer service staff in the United States, croupiers there depend on tips to make their wage worthwhile. While a croupier should theoretically have no personal interest in the outcome of the game, a successful player customarily tips the croupier, especially in American casinos. Tips are often pooled and divided amongst all the staff. Fraternising with customers is frowned upon (due to conflict of interest), and most casinos prevent their gambling staff from being seen smoking or even being seen in uniform outside the casino. Some gambling strategies include suggestions to tip the casino dealer in order to create a good atmosphere and improve the dealer&#x27;s mood. According to these strategies, tipping might even make the dealer shuffle the cards less frequently and thereby allow easier tracking of particular cards. Australian casinos forbid dealers from taking tips.

==Secondhand smoke exposure==
Because casinos tend to allow smoking on the gambling floor, American croupiers are exposed to secondhand smoke. A health hazard evaluation of several Las Vegas casinos showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the casinos, and had cotinine and NNAL (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples. Britain banned smoking in all public places, including casinos, in 2007.

<doc id="171272" wikidata="Q876171" url="?curid=171272" title="East Coast hip-hop">
<text>East Coast hip-hop is a regional subgenre of hip-hop music that originated in New York City during the 1970s. Hip-hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in The Bronx, New York City.

In contrast to other styles, East Coast hip-hop music prioritizes complex lyrics for attentive listening rather than beats for dancing. The term &quot;East Coast hip-hop&quot; more specifically denotes hip-hop originating from the Northeastern United States. Southeastern states such as Georgia or Florida instead produce Southern hip-hop rather than East Coast hip-hop, although the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland produce East Coast hip-hop.

== Musical style ==

In contrast to the more simplistic rhyme pattern and scheme used in Old-school hip-hop, hip-hop in the late ‘80s developed a stronger emphasis on lyrical dexterity. It also became characterized by multi-syllabic rhymes, complex wordplay, a continuous free-flowing delivery and intricate metaphors. Although East Coast hip-hop can vary in sound and style, &quot;aggressive&quot; beats and the combining of samples were common to the subgenre in the mid- to late 1980s. The aggressive and hard-hitting beats of the form were emphasized by such acts as EPMD, Beastie Boys and Public Enemy, while artists such as Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., and Slick Rick were noted for their lyrical skill. Lyrical themes throughout the history of East Coast hip-hop have ranged from lyrical consciousness by such artists as Public Enemy and A Tribe Called Quest to Mafioso rap themes by rappers such as Raekwon, MF Grimm and Kool G Rap.

==History==
===1973–1986: Emergence===
East Coast hip-hop is occasionally referred to as New York rap due to its origins and development at block parties thrown in New York City during the 1970s. According to AllMusic, &quot;At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap.&quot; Leading up to hip-hop, there were spoken-word artists such as the Last Poets who released their debut album in 1970, and Gil Scott-Heron, who gained a wide audience with his 1971 track &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;. These artists combined spoken word and music to create a kind of &quot;proto-rap&quot; vibe. Following this, early artists of hip-hop such as DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Jam Master Jay and Run-DMC, pioneered East Coast hip-hop during hip-hop&#x27;s earlier years in the 1970s and 1980s.

===1986–1997: Renaissance===

As the genre developed, lyrical themes evolved through the work of East Coast artists such as the Native Tongues, a collective of hip-hop artists associated with generally positive, Afrocentric themes, and assembled by Afrika Bambaataa. New York–based groups such as De La Soul, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Jungle Brothers also earned recognition for their musical eclecticism. This period from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s has been called the &quot;golden age&quot; of hip-hop. Although East Coast hip-hop was more popular throughout the late 1980s, N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (released in the summer of 1988) presented the toughened sound of West Coast hip-hop, which was accompanied by gritty, street-level subject matter. Later in 1992, Dr. Dre&#x27;s G-funk record &quot;The Chronic&quot; would introduce West Coast hip-hop to the mainstream. Along with a combined ability to keep its primary function as party music, the West Coast form of hip-hop became a dominant force during the early 1990s. Although G-Funk was the most popular variety of hip-hop during the early 1990s, the East Coast hip-hop scene remained an integral part of the music industry. During this period, several New York City rappers rising from the local underground scene, began releasing noteworthy albums in the early and mid-1990s, such as Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. and others. The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show was the launch pad for many East Coast rappers during this era.
Nas&#x27;s 1994 debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot; has also been noted as one of the creative high points of the East Coast hip-hop scene, and featured production from such renowned New York–based producers as Large Professor, Pete Rock and DJ Premier. Meanwhile, The Wu-Tang Clan, Onyx, Black Moon, Smif-N-Wessun, Big L, Lost Boyz and Mobb Deep became pillars in New York&#x27;s hardcore hip-hop scene, achieving widespread critical acclaim for their landmark albums, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; (1993), &quot;Lifestylez ov da Poor &amp; Dangerous&quot; (1995), &quot;Enta da Stage&quot; (1993), &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; (1993), &quot;Dah Shinin&#x27;&quot; (1995), &quot;Legal Drug Money&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Infamous&quot; (1995).

The Notorious B.I.G. became the central figure in East Coast hip-hop during most of the 1990s. Bad Boy Records comprised a team of producers known as the Hitmen Stevie J, Derrick &quot;D Dot&quot; Angelletie and Amen Ra directed by Sean Combs to move the focus on hip-hop to New York with the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s Billboard topping hits. His success on the music charts and rise to the mainstream drew more attention to New York at the time of West Coast hip-hop&#x27;s dominance. According to AllMusic editor Steve Huey, the success of his 1994 debut album &quot;Ready to Die&quot; &quot;reinvented East Coast rap for the gangsta age&quot; and &quot;turned the Notorious B.I.G. into a hip-hop sensation — the first major star the East Coast had produced since the rise of Dr. Dre&#x27;s West Coast G-funk&quot;. Many saw his dominating presence as a catalyzing factor in the East Coast/West Coast hip-hop rivalry that polarized much of the hip-hop community, stirring the issue enough to result in the Brooklyn rapper&#x27;s 1997 death, as well as his West Coast counterpart, Tupac Shakur, months prior. By the late 1990s, East coast rap had returned to mainstream dominance.

===1997–2007: Bling era, mainstream success===
Biggie&#x27;s commercial success helped pave the way for the success of other up-and-coming East Coast rappers such as Jay-Z, DMX, Busta Rhymes, 50 Cent, Ja Rule, the Lox, Fat Joe, and Big Pun. Many East Coast hip-hop producers also rose to prominence during this period such as Timbaland, Pharrell, Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz, Irv Gotti, and 7 Aurelius.

===2007–2013: Blog era and revitalization===

A mainstream revitalization of East Coast rap occurred in the late 2000s and early 2010s, albeit without the same level of ubiquity as in the 1990s. Younger artists at this time used Internet resources such as social media, blogging, and music streaming to build a following among fans, blurring the lines between the underground and the mainstream. Rappers who emerged during this &quot;blog era&quot; include Joey Bada$$, Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, Meek Mill, Pusha T, Vast Aire, Wale, Logic, Azealia Banks, and Mac Miller.

===2014–present: Rise of New York City drill and trap===
Various factors have led to a decline in unique regional scenes across many musical genres, including East Coast rap. In addition, rivalries between different cities and regions have declined significantly and artists across different regions and genres are much more willing to collaborate than in the past. Despite this, the distinctive East Coast sound is still notable in today&#x27;s music, often mixed with modern trap sounds. Lil Uzi Vert, from Philadelphia, began their career representing the East Coast style, but moved to Atlanta to join others such as Lil Yachty and Playboi Carti, all of whom gained popularity by using online social media.

In addition, New York City&#x27;s drill movement, heavily influenced by UK drill (and often using the same London producers), has injected new energy into the New York hip-hop scene, attracting critical acclaim, media controversy and a significant following, despite departing from standard hip-hop song structures. The movement started in Brooklyn, led by artists such as the late Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, and 22Gz.

==Legacy==

East Coast hip-hop was the dominant form of rap music during the Golden Era of hip-hop. Many knowledgeable hip-hop fans and critics are particularly favorable towards East Coast hip-hop of the early-mid 1990s, viewing it as a time of creative growth and influential recordings, and describing it as &quot;The East Coast Renaissance&quot;. Music writer May Blaize of MVRemix Urban comments on the nostalgia felt among hip-hop fans for records released during this time:
David Drake of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; writes of hip-hop during 1994 and its contributions, stating: &quot;The beats were hot, the rhymes were hot – it really was an amazing time for hip-hop and music in general. This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work – Digable Planets, Gang Starr, Pete Rock, Jeru, O.C., Organized Konfusion – I mean, this was a year of serious music.&quot;

East Coast hip-hop has also produced a multitude of acclaimed female rappers, including Salt and Pepa, The Real Roxanne, Monie Love, Queen Latifah, Lil Kim, Lauryn Hill, Ladybug Mecca, Foxy Brown, Charli Baltimore, Eve, Missy Elliott, Angie Martinez, Remy Ma, Lil Mama, Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, and Coi Leray.

<text>Willie Gary &quot;Bunk&quot; Johnson (December 27, 1889 – July 7, 1949) was an American prominent jazz trumpeter from New Orleans.

==Biography==

=== Birth ===
Johnson gave the year of his birth as 1879, although Johnson stated on his 1937 application for Social Security that he was born on December 27, 1889 and there is speculation that he may have been younger by as much as a decade. According to jazz critic Scott Yanow, Johnson was probably born at the 1889 date.

Johnson was the youngest of 14 children. He had been schooled in sight reading and improvisation by the time he began playing professionally with the Superior Orchestra and the Eagle Band in 1910. He claimed to have attended New Orleans University, although no diploma from the college survives.

===Education and early musical career===
Johnson received lessons from Adam Olivier and began playing professionally in Olivier&#x27;s orchestra. Johnson probably played a few adolescent jobs with Buddy Bolden, but was not a regular member of Bolden&#x27;s Band (contrary to Johnson&#x27;s claim). Johnson was regarded as one of the leading trumpeters in New Orleans in the years 1905–1915, in between repeatedly leaving the city to tour with minstrel shows and circus bands.

After he failed to appear for a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade job in 1915, he learned that krewe members intended to do him bodily harm. So he left town, touring with shows and then by the early 1920s settling in New Iberia, Louisiana. While living in New Iberia, Johnson worked in rice mills and the public school system, and continued playing jazz, but with local groups such as the Black Eagle Band from Crowley and the Banner Orchestra.

In 1931, he lost his trumpet and front teeth when a fight broke out at a dance in Rayne, Louisiana, putting an end to his playing. He thereafter worked in manual labor, occasionally giving music lessons.

===Career revival and first recordings===
In 1938 and 1939, the writers of an early jazz history book, &quot;Jazzmen&quot;, interviewed several prominent musicians of the time, including Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Clarence Williams, who spoke highly of Johnson in the old days in New Orleans. The writers tracked down Johnson&#x27;s address, and traded several letters with him, where he recalled (and possibly embellished) his early career. Johnson stated that he could play again if he only had new teeth and a new trumpet. A collection was taken up by writers and musicians, and he was fitted with a set of dentures by Bechet&#x27;s dentist brother, Leonard, and given a new trumpet. He made his first recordings in 1942, for Jazz Man Records.

===Later touring career===
These first recordings propelled Johnson (along with clarinetist George Lewis) into public attention. Johnson and his band played in New Orleans, San Francisco, Boston, and New York City and made many more recordings. Johnson&#x27;s work in the 1940s shows why he was well regarded by his fellow musicians. On his best days he played with great imagination, subtlety, and beauty, as well as suggesting why he had not gained prominence earlier, for he was unpredictable, temperamental, with a passive-aggressive streak and a fondness for drinking alcohol to the point of impairment.

===Death===
Johnson suffered from a stroke in late 1948 and died in New Iberia the following year.

== Legacy ==
Jazz historians have debated Johnson&#x27;s legacy, and the extent to which his colorful reminiscences of his early career were accurate, misremembered, exaggerated, or untrue. Although in recent years, new evidence has appeared in jazz historian Vic Hobson&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Creating Jazz Counterpoint. New Orleans, Barbershop Harmony, and the Blues&quot;, in which is stated that Buddy Bolden&#x27;s band member Willy Cornish — who is seen on the only surviving picture of the Bolden Band — affirmed Bunk Johnson as a member of the early jazz group. This puts Johnson&#x27;s own statements and recordings, in which he actively recreated the Bolden tunes, in a plausible and positive light, making them of great historical and musicological importance to the study of jazz and New Orleans jazz in particular.

His recordings have been reissued on CD.

Johnson was a Catholic, and as of 2019 an annual Jazz Mass and procession was conducted in his hometown of New Iberia, beginning at St Edward Catholic Church and ending at Johnson&#x27;s gravesite.

In about 1996, Bunk Johnson Park was dedicated to his memory in New Iberia, Louisiana. Twenty years later, in 2016, the park was dismantled due to criminal activity in the area.

The Iberia Parish Library hosts an archival collection of Johnson&#x27;s papers and a special exhibit room for Johnson.

<text>Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Homemade Holdings Inc., trading and commonly known as Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, is an American company that manufactures ice cream, frozen yogurt, and sorbet. Founded in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont, the company went from a single ice cream parlor to a multinational brand over the course of a few decades. The company was sold in 2000 to the multinational conglomerate Unilever but operates as an independent subsidiary. Its present-day headquarters is in South Burlington, Vermont, with its factory in Waterbury, Vermont.

Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s is known for their original flavors, many of which incorporate foods and desserts mixed with ice cream. Some of these flavors have been themed after musicians, comedians, and public figures, such as Jerry Garcia, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Colin Kaepernick, and Phish. The company and its two founders have also been noted for their political activism and advocacy for social justice. This includes the way their products have been manufactured, marketed, and distributed.

==History==
===Founding===
The company was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who had been friends since their childhood in Merrick, New York. Although Greenfield finished college, he was unable to get into medical school. Cohen dropped out of school. In 1977, Cohen and Greenfield completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s creamery. Cohen has severe anosmia, a lack of a sense of smell, so he relies on mouthfeel and texture to provide variety in his diet. This led to the company&#x27;s trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream. On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000 investment (), Cohen and Greenfield opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont. In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first &quot;free cone day&quot;, now an annual event at every Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s store, from that year to 2019, and resuming in 2023.

In 1980, Cohen and Greenfield rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. The first Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s franchise opened in 1981, on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s ice cream was used to build &quot;the world&#x27;s largest ice cream sundae&quot; in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed . That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.

In 1984, Häagen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s by its distributors in Boston, prompting Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its &quot;What&#x27;s the Doughboy Afraid Of?&quot; campaign. In 1987, Häagen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s filed a second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company.

In 1985, the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the company&#x27;s annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s launched its &quot;Cowmobile&quot;, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s ice cream in a unique, cross-country &quot;marketing drive&quot;, driven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The &quot;Cowmobile&quot; burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like &quot;the world&#x27;s largest baked Alaska&quot;.
In 1987, as a tribute to guitarist Jerry Garcia, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s presented its first ice cream named for a rock legend and the most famous of fan-suggested flavors, &quot;Cherry Garcia&quot;.

In 1985, Ben and Jerry&#x27;s built and opened their factory in Waterbury, Vermont. The factory opened to public tours in 1986 and continues to offer these tours. This facility produces 350,000 or more pints of ice cream a day. It is the only Ben and Jerry&#x27;s facility open to the public.

In 1988, the two men won the title of U.S. Small Business Persons of the Year, awarded by President Ronald Reagan. Also that year, the first brownies were ordered from Greyston Bakery, which led to the development of the popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor. In 1992, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s joined in a cooperative campaign with the national non-profit Children&#x27;s Defense Fund; the campaign goal was to bring children&#x27;s basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards were sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues. In 1995, they hired Robert Holland Jr. as CEO after holding a &quot;Yo! I&#x27;m your C.E.O.&quot; essay contest as part of the search. Holland left after 20 months following philosophical differences and was replaced by Perry Odak in 1997.

In 1989, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced their opposition to the use of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) in all their products. This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows to boost milk production, but Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s does not support this practice and is in favor of using less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment.

In 1994, &quot;Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s: The Inside Scoop&quot;, written by Fred &quot;Chico&quot; Lager, former CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Ice Cream, was published. The book tracks the history of how Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Ice Cream got started. The book focuses on &quot;How Two Real Guys Built a Business with a Social Conscience and a Sense of Humor.&quot;

===Unilever era===
====Sale of company to Unilever====

In April 2000, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s sold itself to British multinational food giant Unilever. In the acquisition agreement, Unilever agreed to carry on the company&#x27;s tradition of engaging &quot;in these critical, global economic and social missions&quot;. Following the acquisition, both founders remained employed at the company, though not in a position of operational or managerial responsibility, though Cohen remained on the governing board of directors.

In 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, was appointed CEO.

In 2018, Matthew McCarthy, previously a Unilever executive, was appointed CEO, replacing Solheim.

In 2019, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s had production facilities in Saint Albans, Vermont; Waterbury, Vermont; Hellendoorn, Netherlands; and Be&#x27;er Tuvia, Israel. The Israeli facility was sold to its local licensee in June 2022.

On May 15, 2023, the company announced Dave Stever as the new CEO after the preceding CEO, Matthew McCarthy, retired from the company.

====Changes in packaging====
In 2001, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s U.S. completed the transition to &quot;Eco-Pint&quot; packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine.

Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s discontinued the use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available.

====Opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge====
On Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed , and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.

====April Fool&#x27;s Day joke====
In March 2009, &quot;CyClone Dairy&quot; launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows. On April 1, 2009 (April Fool&#x27;s Day), Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned animal products. The hoax was revealed on April Fool&#x27;s Day with the message: &quot;We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat — and not to eat cloned foods if you don&#x27;t want to. And that&#x27;s why Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.&quot;

====GMO-free====
In 2013, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation.

====Sales in Israel and Palestinian Territories====
On July 19, 2021, it was announced that Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s planned to end sales in Occupied Palestinian Territory, within which Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. Due to the refusal of American Quality Products - Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Israel, its local franchisee since 1987, to comply with this policy, the company statement said it did not plan to renew the franchise in 2022. The decision may run foul of anti-BDS laws and policies in a number of US states. The statement, issued by Unilever, was criticized by Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s independent board of directors, which had not wanted to comment on the continuation of sales in other parts of Israel, as this required board approval.

On June 29, 2022, Unilever announced that it had sold its Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s division in Israel to American Quality Products, the company that had the exclusive license to sell Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s products in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Later that day, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s tweeted that it disagreed with its parent company&#x27;s decision and that the &quot;arrangement means Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s in Israel will be owned and operated by AQP. Our company will no longer profit from Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s in Israel. We continue to believe it is inconsistent with Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.&quot;

====Free cones====
Every year, over one million cones are given away, prompting the company&#x27;s ad slogan &quot;Be One In A Million.&quot; Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there. Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote (in those countries where that is necessary).

Due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Free Cone Day was on hiatus through 2023.

====Reduction of farm emissions====
In May 2022, the company announced the launch of its pilot project, &#x27;Mootopia&#x27;, across 15 of its supplier farms (7 in the US and 8 in the Netherlands). The goal of the project is to bring the emissions intensity of the farms to a level that is half of the US industry average by the end of 2024. The farms will be supported to adopt regenerative agriculture practices for growing grass and other feed crops.

====Child labor scandal====
Months after teaming up with Tony&#x27;s Chocolonely to raise awareness for ending modern slavery and child labor in the chocolate industry, Ben and Jerry&#x27;s suppliers were found by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to be employing illegal migrant children in early 2023. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s head of values-led sourcing, Cheryl Pinto, said that &quot;if migrant children needed to work full time, it was preferable for them to have jobs at a well-monitored workplace&quot;.

====&quot;Progress Comes in Many Flavors&quot; campaign====

In July 2024, Ben and Jerry&#x27;s started an ad campaign called &quot;Progress Comes in Many Flavors,&quot; a series of advertisements that strongly encouraged progressive action, such as setting up libraries for banned books and riding bicycles nude.

===Post-Unilever era===

On March 19, 2024, Unilever announced it would divest its ice cream brands and cut 7,500 jobs in order to make &quot;a simpler, more focused and higher performing Unilever.&quot; Included in the spin-off are Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Cornetto, Magnum, Talenti, and Wall&#x27;s. The divestment is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.

==Original flavors and sundaes==
The most popular Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s flavor had been &quot;Cherry Garcia&quot; for more than a decade until 2013, when a survey taken of the general public found Cookie Dough was the winner with 60%. The company website states (as of December 2020) that the most popular flavor is &quot;Half Baked&quot;, with &quot;Cherry Garcia&quot; placing second, and &quot;Chocolate Fudge Brownie&quot; following in third. It is unclear to what degree the popularity of flavors reflects their availability. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Cherry Garcia&quot; ice cream has disappeared from supermarkets, and those who desire it must obtain it from a Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Scoop Shop.

The &quot;Vermonster&quot; is a large ice cream sundae served in a &quot;Vermonster Bucket&quot; in Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s &quot;scoop shops&quot;. Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, four bananas, four ladles of hot fudge, three chocolate chip cookies, one chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, two scoops each of any four toppings, and whipped cream. It contains , and of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year.

&quot;Chubby Hubby&quot; consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed &quot;Chubby Hubby&quot; to &quot;Hubby Hubby,&quot; in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company&#x27;s home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men in tuxedos getting married beneath a rainbow.

On March 13, 2012, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavors in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. &quot;Oh! My! Apple Pie!&quot; would become &quot;Apple-y Ever After&quot; and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows.

&quot;Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough&quot; was temporarily renamed &quot;I Dough, I Dough&quot; in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights).

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on March 5, 2007, to promote the company&#x27;s new ice cream flavor, &quot;Stephen Colbert&#x27;s AmeriCone Dream&quot;, and Cohen&#x27;s progressive advocacy group TrueMajority.

The company renamed a flavor, &quot;Yes Pecan!&quot;, in reference to Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund.

On March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and unveiled the company&#x27;s new flavor of ice cream, &quot;Late Night Snack&quot;, whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it.

On February 24, 2012, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot;, &quot;Blueberry Vanilla Graham&quot;, &quot;Raspberry Fudge Chunk&quot;, &quot;Banana Peanut Butter&quot;, and &quot;Vanilla&quot; (scoop shop exclusive). On April 12, 2013, &quot;Pineapple Passionfruit&quot;, &quot;Vanilla Honey Caramel&quot;, and &quot;Liz Lemon&quot; were added to the Greek Yogurt line. The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

On February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and unveiled the company&#x27;s new flavor of ice cream, &quot;The Tonight Dough&quot;, with all of its proceeds going to the SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network, which supports camps for children with major illnesses.

In 2015, charoset-flavored ice cream became available in Israel for the Passover holiday.

In April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers&#x27; feedback, led by a petition and the organization Farm Animal Rights Movement. In early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with four flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors — &quot;Chunky Monkey&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Fudge Brownie&quot; — and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: &quot;Coffee Caramel Fudge&quot; and &quot;Peanut Butter &amp; Cookies&quot;.

In February 2017, three new non-dairy flavors were added: Caramel Almond Brittle, Cherry Garcia, and Coconut Seven Layer Bar.

In January 2018, the company added two new non-dairy flavors to its growing line of vegan options. Peanut Butter Half Baked features chocolate and peanut butter with fudge brownies and pieces of peanut butter cookie dough, while Cinnamon Buns is made with cinnamon-spiced ice cream and features cinnamon bun dough and a cinnamon streusel swirl. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s non-dairy line also features flavors such as Peanut Butter &amp; Cookies, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, and Caramel Coffee Fudge. Among their newest non-dairy flavors are the following: Chocolate Caramel Cluster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Salted n&#x27; Swirled. In 2019, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s also released new snackable &quot;cookie dough chunks&quot; that have a vegan option. They continue to take new non-dairy flavor suggestions on their website.

In October 2018, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s launched a campaign for a limited-edition ice cream flavor that also held a political message focusing on resisting the presidential administration of Donald Trump. The campaign debuted the new flavor, &quot;Pecan Resist&quot;, and included new packaging that advertised their messages. The company donated $25,000 to four organizations that supported women&#x27;s and immigrant rights, climate justice, and racial justice.

==Social and political issues==
===Commercial===
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s to stop labeling their ice cream as &quot;all natural&quot; due to the company&#x27;s use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients. In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as &quot;all natural&quot;.

In 2011, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) skit of the same name. This received protests from One Million Moms, a project of the conservative Christian group American Family Association, who said that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelves. Spokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: &quot;I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don&#x27;t say something? Maybe they&#x27;ll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.&quot; However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;: &quot;We just think it&#x27;s funny, that&#x27;s all, and honestly we all really want to try it&quot;, adding that she consistently checks for the item&#x27;s availability at her local supermarket. Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the &quot;SNL&quot; skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011, episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called &quot;Go Fudge Yourself&quot; had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that &quot;thanks to Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won&#x27;t go with me to the great beyond,&quot; as he had previously feared that his association with the &quot;SNL&quot; episode would remain permanent until his death.

===Political===
Following rumors that suggested Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal — who was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner — the company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that &quot;the system of American justice be followed fully in the case&quot;.

Between 2005 and 2008, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s collaborated with polar explorer Marc Cornelissen and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to run the Climate Change College, an initiative to train young people in communications and campaigning around climate change.

In 2006, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a flavor of ice cream called &quot;Black and Tan&quot;, which was named after the alcoholic drink of the same name, made by mixing stout with pale ale. After it was made available to Irish consumers, a controversy emerged in Ireland due to the name of the flavor being the nickname of Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, a controversial British paramilitary force with a reputation for brutality in the Irish War of Independence.

In 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP) contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield, and the CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s after learning that ice cream produced by the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s franchise in Israel was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York, and California on &#x27;Free Cone Day&#x27; in April 2013 and April 2014. , 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s to end its commercial ties to such settlements.

In late April 2014, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s signed on to the &quot;Fight for the Reef&quot; campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) to help protect the Great Barrier Reef. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and federal senator Matt Canavan both said in statements that Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the reef, and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said, &quot;The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerry&#x27;s and Unilever. If you understand the facts, you&#x27;d want to be boycotting Ben and Jerry&#x27;s&quot;. Australian Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s brand manager Kalli Swaik responded, &quot;Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australia&#x27;s most iconic treasures.&quot;

In May 2017, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage. They said this would encourage &quot;fans to contact their MP&#x27;s to tell them the time has come — make marriage equality legal!&quot; This stance, they said, would continue for however long it took for same-sex marriage to be legalized.

In June 2018, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced their support for some 9,000 Afghan asylum seekers&#x27; right to stay in Sweden, drawing heavy criticism from some commentators, including politician Sven-Olof Sällström of the Sweden Democrats.

On October 30, 2018, they announced their new limited batch flavor called &quot;Pecan Resist&quot;. It was introduced as a part of the opposition campaign against U.S. President Donald Trump.

In 2020, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced that it plans to join the &quot;#StopHateForProfit&quot; campaign, halting paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the U.S. The company said it was asking Facebook &quot;to take the clear and unequivocal actions called for by the campaign to stop its platform from being used to spread and amplify racism and hate.&quot;

In August 2020, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s supported the English channel crossings of migrants from France, in a series of tweets directed at Home Secretary Priti Patel. The company tweeted that &quot;we think the real crisis is our lack of humanity for people fleeing war, climate change and torture&quot;, &quot;People wouldn&#x27;t make dangerous journeys if they had any other choice&quot;, and &quot;People cannot be illegal&quot;. James Cleverly said the statements from the company were &quot;statistically inaccurate virtue signalling&quot;. &quot;Spiked&quot; said the statements were hypocritical, since Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s had &quot;used suppliers who have exploited migrant labour&quot;. &quot;Spiked&quot; said that the US branch of the company was the target of a campaign aimed at improving working conditions on dairy farms that supplied Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s.

On January 7, 2021, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a Tweet calling for the resignation, impeachment, and invoking of the 25th Amendment against President Donald Trump following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, saying, &quot;Yesterday was not a protest — it was a riot to uphold white supremacy.&quot;

On February 6, 2022, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; labeled Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s an &quot;activist ice cream brand&quot; after they accused US President Joe Biden of &quot;fanning the flames of war&quot; in Ukraine in connection with the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In September 2022, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s rebranded its cold brew coffee flavor to &quot;Change is Brewing&quot;, to highlight the power of Black voters and encourage voter participation by supporting Black Voters Matter activities.

In January 2024, the chair of the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s board called for a &quot;permanent and immediate ceasefire&quot; in the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.

===Sales in West Bank===
On July 19, 2021, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced that it plans to end sales in Occupied Palestinian Territory, within which Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. Due to the refusal of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Israel — the local franchisee since 1987 — to comply with this policy, the company statement said it did not plan to renew the franchise in 2022. The company had previously suffered criticism and boycotts for operating in the region, most notably from Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel. The company statement referenced this, noting that it was responding to &quot;the concerns shared with us by our fans and trusted partners&quot;, while confirming that sales operations would continue in Israel beyond 2022 &quot;through a different arrangement&quot;.

The policy decision was met with mixed reactions. &quot;USA Today&quot; described the decision as &quot;one of the strongest and highest-profile rebukes by a well-known company of Israel&#x27;s policy of settling its citizens on war-won lands&quot;. The news drew some harsh criticism from Israeli public figures, with foreign minister Yair Lapid tweeting: &quot;Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s decision is a disgraceful capitulation to anti-Semitism, to BDS, to all that is evil in the anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish discourse.&quot; Pro-Palestinian and anti-apartheid groups welcomed the move.

It has also been suggested that the decision — while not technically a boycott, given the lack of legal recognition of the Palestinian Territories as a formal part of Israel under Israeli law — may run foul of anti-boycott laws in a number of US states. On August 3, 2021, governor of Florida Ron DeSantis announced that he had placed parent company Unilever on a list of &quot;Scrutinized Companies that Boycott Israel&quot; as a result of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s decision to &quot;engage in the BDS movement&quot;. On September 9, the State of Arizona committed to totally divest from Unilever by September 21. On September 14, the State of New Jersey also gave Unilever 90 days&#x27; notice of divestment action.

In June 2022, Unilever agreed to sell its business interests in Israel to the Israeli branch of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s under an agreement in which the latter will be able to sell in both Israel and the West Bank, provided it uses only Hebrew and Arabic labels in the products. On July 5, 2022, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s sued its parent company to block the sale on the grounds that it threatened to undermine the integrity of the brand and that it was inconsistent with its values to sell its ice cream in the occupied West Bank. When Unilever acquired the company in 2000, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s board kept protection over its brand. On July 15, minutes before that first scheduled hearing in the lawsuit, both Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s and parent company Unilever announced they would pursue dispute resolution via mediation instead.

In November 2024, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s sued Unilever, claiming that its parent company had cracked down on its attempts to support Palestinian refugees and threatened to replace and sue its board members over the issue.

===Social===
In February 2012, a Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s franchise near Harvard University created a limited edition frozen yogurt flavor named &quot;Taste the Lin-Sanity&quot; in honor of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin, a Harvard alumnus. At inception, the product contained vanilla frozen yogurt, lychee honey swirls, and fortune cookie pieces, leading to a widely publicized controversy about racial stereotyping due to the association of the fortune cookie ingredient with Chinese culture. That ingredient was later replaced with waffle cookies, as the fortune cookies became soggy and the franchise received returns from customers. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s general manager for Boston and Cambridge explained to the media: &quot;we obviously weren&#x27;t looking to offend anybody and the majority of the feedback about it has been positive.&quot; Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released an official statement shortly after the launch of the product, apologizing to those who were offended.

In September 2014, anti-hazing activists raised concerns about the ice cream flavor &quot;Hazed &amp; Confused&quot;, which had been released earlier that year. The concern was that the name could be perceived as belittling of hazing and bullying problems. The company has noted that the name was based on the word &quot;hazelnut&quot; and a play on the phrase &quot;dazed and confused&quot;, which is both a song popularized by Led Zeppelin and a 1993 film. The decision was made in October to not rename the flavor.

Attempts by migrant laborers to directly contact Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s company officials in Waterbury, Vermont, during 2018, resulted in arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

During the 2020 protests against racial prejudice following the police murder of George Floyd, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s publicized a statement encouraging Americans to &quot;dismantle white supremacy&quot; and face &quot;the sins of our past&quot;. Later that month, they endorsed the &quot;Defund the Police&quot; movement.

In 2023, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s received criticism for posting a tweet on Independence Day, claiming that the United States was founded on &quot;stolen Indigenous land&quot; and that Mount Rushmore should be returned to the Lakota people. In reply, the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation expressed interest in acquiring the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s headquarters in Vermont, which is located on historical Abenaki territory.

====Wages====
For several years, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s had a policy that no employee&#x27;s rate of pay shall exceed five times that of entry-level employees. In 1995, entry-level employees were paid $12 hourly (), and the highest-paid employee was president and chief operating officer Chuck Lacy, who earned $150,000 annually (). When Ben Cohen resigned as chief executive officer and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s announced the search for a new CEO in 1994, the company ended the five-to-one-ratio policy.

<text>Arcesilaus (; ; 316/5–241/0 BC) was a Greek Hellenistic philosopher. He was the founder of Academic Skepticism and what is variously called the Second or Middle or New Academy – the phase of the Platonic Academy in which it embraced philosophical skepticism.

Arcesilaus succeeded Crates of Athens as the sixth scholarch of the academy around 264 BC. He did not preserve his thoughts in writing, so his opinions can only be gleaned second-hand from what is preserved by later writers.

In Athens Arcesilaus interacted with the Pyrrhonist philosopher, Timon of Phlius, whose philosophy appears to have influenced Arcesilaus to become the first Academic to adopt a position of philosophical skepticism, that is, he doubted the ability of the senses to discover truth about the world, although he may have continued to believe in the existence of truth itself. This brought in the skeptical phase of the academy. His chief opponent was his contemporary, Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, whose dogma of katalepsis (i.e., that reality could be comprehended with certainty) Arcesilaus denied.

==Life==
Arcesilaus was born in Pitane in Aeolis. His early education was provided by Autolycus the mathematician, with whom he migrated to Sardis. Afterwards, he studied rhetoric in Athens. He then studied philosophy, becoming a disciple first of Theophrastus and afterwards of Crantor. He also attended the school of Pyrrho, whose philosophy he maintained, except in name. He subsequently became intimate with Polemo and Crates of Athens, who made Arcesilaus his successor as scholarch (head) of the Platonic Academy. 

Diogenes Laërtius says that, like his successor Lacydes, Arcesilaus died of excessive drinking, but the testimony of others (e.g. Cleanthes, who said that he lived a dutiful life) and his own precepts discredit the story. He is known to have been much respected by the Athenians.

==Philosophy==

Arcesilaus committed nothing to writing. His opinions were imperfectly known to his contemporaries, and can now only be gathered from the statements of later writers. This makes his philosophy difficult to evaluate and partly inconsistent. This led scholars to see his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophy as completely negative or destructive of all philosophical views. Others regard him as taking the position that nothing can be known on the basis of his philosophical arguments. Others claimed he held no positive views on any philosophical topic, including the possibility of knowledge.

Arcesilaus&#x27; contemporary, Aristo of Chios, described Arcesilaus as being: &quot;Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus&quot; meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of Pyrrhonism. Eusebius, probably quoting Aristocles of Messene, reported that Arcesilaus studied in Pyrrho&#x27;s school and adhered, except in name, to Pyrrhonism. Numenius of Apamea said &quot;Arcesilaus accompanied Pyrrho. He remained Pyrrhonist in his rejection of everything, except in name. At least the Pyrrhonists Mnaseas, Philomelos and Timon call him a Pyrrhonist, just as they were themselves, because he too rejected the true, the false, and the persuasive.&quot; Sextus Empiricus said that Arcesilaus&#x27; philosophy appeared essentially the same as Pyrrhonism, but granted that this might have been superficial.

On the one hand, Arcesilaus professed to be no innovator, but a reviver of the dogma-free dialectic that had characterized the academy under Plato. Thus he is said to have restored the doctrines of Plato in an uncorrupted form. On the other hand, according to Cicero, he summed up his opinions in the formula, &quot;that he knew nothing, not even his own ignorance.&quot; There are two ways of reconciling the difficulty: either we may suppose him to have thrown out such aphorisms as an exercise for his pupils, as Sextus Empiricus, who calls him a &quot;skeptic&quot;, would have us believe; or he may have really doubted the esoteric meaning of Plato, and have supposed himself to have been stripping his works of the figments of the Dogmatists, while he was in fact taking from them all certain principles.

Cicero attributes the following argument to Arcesilaus:

(i) it is rash and shameful to assent to something false or unknown, but since
(ii) nothing can be known (and obviously we shouldn&#x27;t do what is rash and shameful),
(iii) we should suspend judgment about everything

Zeno of Citium and the other Stoics were the chief opponents of Arcesilaus. He attacked their dogma of katalêptikê phantasia (i.e., a convincing conception) as understood to be a mean between &quot;episteme&quot; (knowledge) and &quot;doxa&quot; (opinion). He argued that this mean could not exist. It involved a contradiction in terms, as the very idea of &quot;phantasia&quot; implied the possibility of false as well as true conceptions of the same object. As such, it was merely the interpolation of a name.

==Commentary on Arcesilaus==
The Pyrrhonist philosopher and contemporary of Arcesilaus, Timon of Phlius ridiculed Arcesilaus in his &quot;Silloi&quot;, but also praised him in &quot;Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus&quot;. Fragments from Timon about Arcesilaus include:
* &quot;Having the lead of Menedemus at his heart, he will run either to that mass of flesh, Pyrrho, or to Diodorus.&quot;
* &quot;I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked Diodorus.&quot;
* &quot;And mixing sound sense with wily cavils.&quot;

Blaise Pascal wrote of Arcesilaus in his &quot;Pensées&quot; (1669, para. 375):

I have seen changes in all nations and men, and thus after many changes of judgement regarding true justice, I have recognized that our nature was but in continual change, and I have not changed since; and if I changed, I would confirm my opinion. The skeptic Arcesilaus, who became a dogmatist.

<text>Chalcis (; Ancient Greek &amp; Katharevousa: , ), also called Chalkida or Halkida (Modern Greek: , ), is the chief city of the island of Euboea or Evia in Greece, situated on the Euripus Strait at its narrowest point. The name is preserved from antiquity and is derived from the Greek (copper, bronze), though there is no trace of any mines in the area. In the Late Middle Ages, it was known as Negropont(e), an Italian name that has also been applied to the entire island of Euboea.

== History ==

===Ancient Greece===

The earliest recorded mention of Chalcis is in the Iliad, where it is mentioned in the same line as its rival Eretria. It is also documented that the ships set for the Trojan War gathered at Aulis, the south bank of the strait near the city. Chamber tombs at Trypa and Vromousa dated to the Mycenaean period were excavated by Papavasiliou in 1910. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, colonists from Chalcis founded thirty townships on the peninsula of Chalcidice and several important cities in Magna Graecia and Sicily, such as Naxos, Rhegion, Zankle and Cumae. Its mineral produces, metal-work, purple, and pottery not only found markets among these settlements but were distributed over the Mediterranean in the ships of Corinth and Samos. The development of the city led consequently to the increase of the population and finally to the colonization with the establishment of many important cities in the West, but also in the Greek area. The first recorded settlement in the West, which paved the way for the 2nd Greek colonization, is Pithecusae on the island of Ischia, in front of Naples, from Chalcidians and Eretrians around 770 BC. The etymology of the toponym &quot;Pithikousa&quot; comes from the pithos (pitharia) that the first settlers had with them to transport their products. Because of the first Chalcidian settlers, the Romans initially called all Greeks &quot;Chalcidians&quot;, as they were the first Greeks they came into contact with.A few years later, the Chalcidian Antimnestos founds Rigio in 730-720 BC. and Crataimenis&#x27; fellow-citizen Zagli (later Messina) in 730 BC, thus wanting to control the sea strait between Sicily and Italy, just as the Metropolis of Chalkida controlled the Euboean gulfs. In the 8th century BC the increase in trade between the Chalkidian colonies in lower Italy and Sicily with the local populations resulted in the spread of the Chalkidic alphabet among the most ancient inhabitants of the peninsula. The Etruscans took this alphabet and appropriated it so that they too could express themselves in writing. Over the centuries the Romans renamed it &#x27;Latin&#x27;.So today, at least eight letters of all Latin-derived languages are the same as their ancient Euboic counterparts. They are C, D, F, P, R, S and X (pronounced ks). The transmission of the Chalkidic alphabet to the west is the most important cultural contribution of ancient Chalkida to the world culture.

The Lelantine War was a war fought in the late 8th century BC. between the two powerful ancient states of Evia, Chalkida and Eretria, which at that time were at the height of their prosperity. This war was one of the first known major wars between ancient Greek cities and took pan-Hellenic dimensions as the warring Chalcidians and Eretrians allied themselves with other Greek cities.
As Herodotus mentions, the Samians allied with the Chalcidians, while the Milesians allied with the Eretrians. The Thessalians also allied with the Chalcidians, a fact mentioned by Plutarch. The historical sources provide evidence for only one battle of the war, undoubtedly the last, with the reference point being the death of the Thessalian Amphidamandas, who was praised by Hesiod. In this battle the help from the Thessalian cavalry resulted in victory for Chalkida, by which it acquired the best agricultural district of Euboea and became the chief city of the island. Late in the 6th century BC, its prosperity was broken by a disastrous war with the Athenians, who expelled the ruling aristocracy and settled a cleruchy on the site. Chalcis subsequently became a member of both the Delian Leagues.

Chalkis has had a Greco-Jewish presence since antiquity, which is sometimes claimed to have been continuous and to thus form Europe&#x27;s oldest Jewish community, although there is no evidence of it through the early Middle Ages.

In the Hellenistic period, it gained importance as a fortress by which the Macedonian rulers controlled central Greece. It was used by kings Antiochus III of Syria (192 BC) and Mithradates VI of Pontus (88 BC) as a base for invading Greece. Characteristic is the fact that in 323 BC the Stagerite philosopher Aristotle comes to Chalkida to die the following year at his mother&#x27;s house. Then during the Hellenistic era, settlers from Chalkida founded Chalkida in Syria, by order of Seleucus I, from which settlers founded another Chalkida in the Lebanon Valley, as well as another Chalkida in Arabia.

Under Roman rule, Chalcis retained a measure of commercial prosperity within the province of Achaea (southern Greece).

=== Middle Ages and early Modern period ===
 

It is recorded as a city in the 6th-century &quot;Synecdemus&quot; and mentioned by the contemporary historian Procopius of Caesarea, who recorded that a movable bridge linked the two shores of the strait. In Byzantine times, Chalcis was usually called Euripos, a name also applied to the entire island of Euboea, although the ancient name survived in administrative and ecclesiastical usage until the 9th century; alternatively, it is possible that the name was given anew to a settlement that was founded in the 9th century in the location of the ancient city, after the latter had been abandoned in the early Middle Ages. The town survived an Arab naval raid in the 880s and its bishop is attested in the 869–70 Church council held at Constantinople.

By the 12th century, the town featured a Venetian trading station, being attacked by the Venetian fleet in 1171 and eventually seized by Venice in 1209, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade.

For Westerners, its common name was Negropont or Negroponte. This name comes indirectly from the Greek name of the Euripus Strait: the phrase στὸν Εὔριπον &#x27;to Evripos&#x27;, was rebracketed as στὸ Νεὔριπον &#x27;to Nevripos&#x27;, and became Negroponte in Italian by folk etymology, the &quot;ponte&quot; &#x27;bridge&#x27; being interpreted as the bridge of Chalcis to Boeotia.

The town was a condominium between Venice and the Veronese barons of the rest of Euboea, known as the &quot;triarchs&quot;, who resided there. Chalcis or Negroponte became a Latin Church diocese, see below. 
A large hoard of late medieval jewellery dating from Venetian times was found in Chalcis Castle in the nineteenth century and is now in the British Museum. The synagogue dated to around 1400.

Negroponte played a significant role in the history of Frankish Greece, and was attacked by the Principality of Achaea in the War of the Euboeote Succession (1257/8), the Catalan Company in 1317, the Turks in 1350/1, until it was finally captured by the Ottoman Empire after a long siege in 1470. That siege is the subject of the Rossini opera&quot; Maometto II&quot;. The Ottomans made it the seat of the Admiral of the Archipelago (the Aegean Islands). In 1688, it was successfully held by the Ottomans against a strong Venetian attack.

===The modern town===

Chalkida became part of the newborn Greek state after the Greek War of Independence. The modern town received an impetus in its export trade from the establishment of railway connection with Athens and its port Piraeus in 1904. In the early 20th century it was composed of two parts—the old walled town at the bridge over the Euripus, where a number of Turkish families continued to live until the late 19th century, and a sizeable Jewish community lived until World War II, and the more modern suburb that lies outside it, chiefly occupied by Greeks.

The old town, called the Castro (citadel), was surrounded by a full circuit of defense walls until they were completely razed for urban development around the start of the 20th century.

The city is served by a railway station and is the terminus for the Athens Suburban Railway to Athens.

There is a Holocaust memorial honoring the Jewish lives lost during World War II outside of the Chalkis Jewish cemetery.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
=== Greek bishopric ===
The Byzantine diocese of Chalkis was initially a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Corinth, but in the 9th century was transferred to the Metropolitan of Athens, remaining in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It was also known as Euripo, like it is mentioned in the Byzantine imperial Notitia Episcopatuum since emperor Leo VI the Wise (886-912).

Several of its Greek bishops are recorded, but some are disputed :
* Constantinus, signed in 458 a letter by the bishops of Greece to Byzantine emperor Leo I the Thracian after the murder by Coptic mobs of patriarch Proterius of Alexandria.
** Lequien list before him Anatolius (in 363), but he was probably bishop of Beroea in Syria Prima (now Aleppo). 
** next Lequien inserts, by benefit of doubt, Iohannes Damasceno, whom he also lists as bishop of Euroea (in Phoenicia) alias Evaria, in Phoenicia.
* Teodorus and Teofilattus, successive (?) bishops of Euripus, participated in the 869–70 Church council held at Constantinople. viz. the Council of Constantinople of 879–880, both treating the fate of Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople.

=== Latin crusader bishopric ===
At the establishment of the crusader state Lordship of Negroponte, Chalcis or Negroponte (seat of the central one of its three &#x27;triarchies&#x27; constituent baronies) became a Latin Church diocese, the first bishop being Theodorus, the Greek bishop of the see, who entered communion with the see of Rome, installed by papal legate.
On 8 February 1314, the Latin see was united &quot;in commendam&quot; (as an &#x27;additional benefice&#x27;) with the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, so that the exiled Patriarch, excluded from Constantinople itself since the Byzantine reconquest of the city, could have actual jurisdiction on Greek soil and exercise a direct role as head of the Latin clergy in what remained of Latin Greece.

== Main sights ==
The church of Saint Paraskevi (the patron saint of the island) was the church of the Dominican Priory of Negroponte, one of the first two houses authorized for the Order of Preachers&#x27; Province of Greece in 1249. Started about 1250, this is among the oldest examples of early Dominican architecture surviving, and is one of the only early Dominican churches to retain its original form until the present. The central arch over the iconostasis and the ceiling and walls of the south chapel are the best examples of Italian Gothic stone-carving in Greece. Images of the Dominican saints, Dominic and Peter Martyr, stand at the base of the central arch. The north chapel holds the tomb of the founder of the senatorial Lippamano family of Venice. Some of the column capitals are Byzantine.

===The bridges===
The town is now connected to mainland Greece by two bridges, the &quot;Sliding Bridge&quot; in the west at the narrowest point of the Euripus Strait and a suspension bridge.

The Euripus Strait which separates the city and the island from the mainland was bridged in 411 BC with a wooden bridge. In the time of Justinian the fixed bridge was replaced with a movable structure. The Turks replaced this once again with a fixed bridge. In 1856, a wooden swing bridge was built; in 1896, an iron swing bridge, and in 1962, the existing &quot;sliding bridge&quot;; the construction works of the 19th century destroyed the most part of the medieval castle built across the bridge. The Euripus Bridge or Chalcis Bridge, a cable-stayed suspension bridge opened in 1993, joins Chalcis to the mainland to the south.

A special tidal phenomenon takes place in the strait, as strong tidal currents reverse direction once every six hours, creating strong currents and maelstroms.

== Municipality ==
The municipality Chalcis was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of Chalcis city itself with four former municipalities, which also became municipal units:
* Anthidona
* Avlida
* Lilantia
* Nea Artaki

The municipality has an area of 424.766 km2, the municipal unit 30.804 km2.

== Transportation ==
*GR-44
*GR-77
*GR-1/E75 is south and west about from Chalcis in Boeotia.

In 2003, a bypass of Chalcis was opened from the southern part of the bridge to connect with GR-77, also with access to GR-44.

Chalcis station is the northern terminus of the Oinoi–Chalcis railway, and is served by Line 3 of the Athens Suburban Railway.

<doc id="171290" wikidata="Q429264" url="?curid=171290" title="West Coast hip-hop">
<text>West Coast hip-hop is a regional genre of hip-hop music that encompasses any artists or music that originated in the West Coast of the United States. West Coast hip-hop began to dominate from a radio play and sales standpoint during the early to-mid 1990s with the birth of G-funk and the emergence of record labels such as Suge Knight and Dr. Dre&#x27;s Death Row Records, Ice Cube&#x27;s Lench Mob Records, the continued success of Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records, Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment, 50 Cent&#x27;s Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27; and many others.

==History==
African American communities of the Bay Area and southern California emerged as new bases of hip-hop culture in the 1980s. Hispanics in the Los Angeles area have played a significant role in West Coast hip-hop culture.

=== Bay Area hip-hop ===
The Bay Area has vastly contributed to the hip-hop genre seen in today&#x27;s modern music industry. While its significance may be lesser known to the general public, since the establishment of hip-hop, the Bay solidified itself as an instrumental building block in the genre&#x27;s development. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, political and social justice movements put in place a potential blueprint of what local artists could rap about, and showcased how the counter-hegemonic culture of hip-hop was already embedded into the roots of the Bay Area. Coming out of the Bay was a unique style of break dancing that was exhibited at local shows, and a representation of graffiti sprayed along city streets and buildings, similar to what was expressed in The Bronx on subway cars and abandoned structures. From the inspiration of funk music, to the political and social movements that were energized by the Black Panther Party, Hip-Hop in the Bay was a newfound outlet, and proved to be ingrained in the region&#x27;s identity. Founded in Oakland in 1966, the Black Panthers surge for change and alterations of the systemic racism entangled in society resonated with the residents of the blue collar city. Many of the organization&#x27;s ideologies became well represented in the area&#x27;s rap scene, and triggered an explosion of black identity and frustration with the SFPD.

Despite artists like E-40 claiming that the Bay rap scene does not receive the respect it deserves, this has not prevented its artists and style from influencing hip-hop&#x27;s sound and dance. Laid out in the 1960s and 1970s through activism and the hybridity of funk music, the Bay Area was able to gain serious traction from the 1980s to mid-1990s, which saw local artists popularize Pimp rap. Artists across the region began harnessing the sound of the Bay and slowly saw their rhythmic funky beats slowed down and reused in later hits that would intersect genres. Freestyle samples of electro funky beats provided listeners with a sound that they didn&#x27;t know the genre needed. The Bay Area isn&#x27;t often viewed as one of the prominent hip-hop hubs in the U.S., but its rich history and extensive range of diverse artists prove that many of the original characteristics of early hip-hop can be traced back to the major metropolitan areas and cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.

===Early years===
Several events laid the foundations for West Coast hip-hop, long before the emergence of West Coast rappers such as Mellow Man Ace, Too Short, Kid Frost, Ice-T and Eazy-E—or even before the emergence of rap itself. According to Syd Caesar, &quot;a cataclysmic event helped give rise to it out West: the Watts riots of 1965.&quot; In 1967, Budd Schulberg founded a creative space in Los Angeles entitled Watts Writers Workshop, intended to help the people of the Watts neighborhood and provide a place for them to express themselves freely; one group to emerge from the workshop was the proto-rap group Watts Prophets.

In the late 1970s in Los Angeles, Alonzo Williams, a young disc jockey from Compton, California formed a partnership with another DJ named Rodger Clayton from Los Angeles, California who created a promotion company called Unique Dreams that would hire Williams to DJ at local events. The two eventually went their separate ways: Williams started a group called the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru and became the house DJs at a local nightclub called Eve&#x27;s After Dark while Clayton launched what would perhaps be the foremost successful mobile DJ crew in the region by the name of Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army that would host parties by top DJs for thousands of people at large venues. Other smaller DJ and party crews emerged around this time, hoping to establish themselves in the area. Unlike their East Coast counterparts, the Hip-Hop sound emerging from Southern California was more fast-paced and influenced by electronic music. This could be largely credited to the fact that the local West Coast hip-hop scene revolved more around DJing than rapping. A localized dance sub-culture later came out of this party scene, which was highlighted on a national scale on such motion pictures as &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot;. Breakdancing, popping and locking gave the Los Angeles music scene some of its earliest credibility outside the region. Further attention came to the West Coast as Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army began inviting such well-known East Coast Hip-Hop acts such as Whodini and Run-DMC to their functions.

Another early landmark occurred in 1981, when Duffy Hooks launched the first West Coast rap label, Rappers Rapp Records, inspired by Sugar Hill Records in New York. Its first act was the duo of Disco Daddy and Captain Rapp, whose debut single was &quot;The Gigolo Rapp&quot; which was also released in 1981. The song became a minor success but failed to gain much radio play. Many other Hip-Hop songs recorded in California were released during the early 1980s, but many of them received little or no radio play. Captain Rapp created the classic West Coast song released in 1983 called, &quot;Bad Times (I Can&#x27;t Stand It)&quot;, which is a politically conscious response to Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s &quot;The Message&quot; arranged by the legendary production duo of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis and Rich Cason. Clayton&#x27;s group, Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army, released their first single, &quot;Dial-a-Freak&quot;, and in 1984 Egyptian Lover released his &quot;On the Nile&quot; album, which includes the popular 12&quot; single &quot;Egypt Egypt&quot;. Members of Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army and the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, including Dr. Dre, The Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover, Ice-T and Kid Frost would later go on to help define the early West Coast hip-hop sound throughout the 1980s.
During this period, one of the most significant factors in the spread of West Coast hip-hop was the radio station 1580 KDAY AM, which was the first radio station in the world to play rap/hip-hop music 24 hours a day because of Assistant Program Director/Music Director and Radio Personality Greg &quot;Mack Attack&quot; Mack.

===Late 1980s and 1990s===
Ice-T is known as one of the pioneers of West Coast hip-hop and gangsta rap, with songs such as &quot;6 in the Mornin&quot;, released in 1986, demonstrating the unique style of the west coast. In 1988, Ice-T released the R&amp;B hit &quot;I&#x27;m Your Pusher&quot;, and following this was Too Short&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Life is... Too Short&quot;.
Tone Loc&#x27;s debut album &quot;Lōc-ed After Dark&quot; was released on January 23, 1989 and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, with the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Wild Thing&quot; peaking at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two days after the release of &quot;Lōc-ed After Dark&quot;, N.W.A released its debut album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. Focusing on life and adversities in Compton, California, a notoriously rough area which had gained a reputation for gang violence, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was released by group member Eazy-E&#x27;s record label Ruthless Records. As well as establishing a basis for the popularity of gangsta rap, the album drew much attention to West Coast hip-hop, especially the Los Angeles scene. In particular, the controversial &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; and the ensuing censorship attracted substantial media coverage and public attention. Following the dissolution of N.W.A due to in-fighting, the group&#x27;s members Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and MC Ren would later become platinum-selling solo artists in the 1990s. Ice Cube released some of the West Coast&#x27;s most critically acclaimed albums, such as 1990&#x27;s &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Death Certificate&quot;, as well as making film and television appearances such as in John Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; in 1991.

The early 1990s was a period in which Hip-Hop went from strength to strength. Tupac Shakur&#x27;s debut album &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; was released in 1991, demonstrating a social awareness, with attacks on social injustice such as racism, police brutality, poverty, crime, drug and teenage pregnancy. This album featured 3 singles: &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;If My Homie Calls&quot;. &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 19, 1995. Shakur&#x27;s music and philosophy was rooted in various philosophies and approaches, including the Black Panther Party, Black nationalism, egalitarianism and liberty. Tupac sold over 75 million records, being regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time and a pioneer of West Coast rap.
Also in 1991, Suge Knight founded Death Row Records which became a record label powerhouse throughout the 1990s. In 1992, Dr. Dre released his solo debut, &quot;The Chronic&quot;; this marked the birth of the G-funk sound that became a hallmark of the West Coast sound in the 1990s, with the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; peaking at #2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The city of Long Beach arrived to the hip-hop scene in the early 1990s with artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound, both signed to Death Row, with releases such as &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (1993) and &quot;Dogg Food&quot; (1995). Both albums becoming huge sellers and being critically acclaimed and helped make a mark in establishing Long Beach in the hip-hop scene. Another artist who helped establish Long Beach was Warren G with his release &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era&quot; (1994). He founded his record label G-Funk Entertainment in 1995 and helped promote artists also from Long Beach such as the Twinz and The Dove Shack.

As for Death Row, success kept coming throughout the 1990s with 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (1996) also becoming a huge seller and becoming critically acclaimed. 2Pac gained hits California Love&quot; and &quot;Live and Die in LA&quot;. Also in the early-to-mid 1990s, the group Cypress Hill made a big impact on the scene with their albums such as their debut studio album of the same name and Black Sunday. They are considered to be among the main progenitors of West Coast rap and hip-hop. Other popular artists and groups from this period include The Pharcyde (known for their albums &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; and &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot;), Souls of Mischief (known for their album &quot;93 &#x27;til Infinity&quot;), Ahmad (known for his song Back in the Day), Xzibit (known for his album &quot;At the Speed of Life&quot;) and Ras Kass (known for his album &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;).

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
West Coast hip-hop&#x27;s position in the mainstream dwindled greatly in the late 1990s and 2000s, with a few notable exceptions such as Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;2001&quot;, Xzibit&#x27;s &quot;Restless&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;No Limit Top Dogg&quot; and &quot;Tha Last Meal&quot; albums. However, the trend soon changed. Although gangsta rap was still popular on the West Coast in the 2000s, the West Coast sound became more designed for nightclubs with the rise of the Bay Area&#x27;s hyphy scene, featuring flamboyant raps and explicit references to sex and drugs. A key artist in the genre was E-40, who found a substantial audience with his 1995 album &quot;In a Major Way&quot;; he found even greater success with the song &quot;Tell Me When to Go&quot; in 2006, featuring Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak.

Bay area rapper Too Short, already well known for his collaborations with artists such as Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G, found a new lease on life with the hyphy scene, his 16th studio album &quot;Blow the Whistle&quot; in 2006 debuting at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The Game also brought attention back to the West Coast with his double platinum album, &quot;The Documentary&quot;, as did Xzibit&#x27;s platinum certified &quot;Restless&quot; album, and gold certified albums &quot;Man vs. Machine&quot; and &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;. Artists from the 1990s such as Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube and groups such as the Tha Dogg Pound and Westside Connection continued to release albums throughout the 2000s and had success but did not garner the same level of fame as they had experienced in the 1990s. Throughout the 2000s, a number of peripheral West Coast hip-hop artists such as Ya Boy, Glasses Malone, Juice, SKG (Suge Knight Girl) Helecia Choyce, Crooked I, 40 Glocc, Slim the Mobster, Bishop Lamont and Mistah F.A.B. collaborated with big-name artists such as Dr. Dre, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, The Game, E-40 and Snoop Dogg.

In the early to mid-2010s, the West Coast had also seen a resurgence with hyphy as well as a transition to an uptempo and club-oriented type of Pop Rap.

Producer DJ Mustard had pioneered the &quot;ratchet&quot; music movement, a production style that has snowballed into the mainstream. DJ Mustard played a role in bringing West Coast hip-hop back to national attention through the 2010s. He gained huge popularity throughout 2011 to 2014, producing a number of popular artists&#x27; singles, including Tyga&#x27;s &quot;Rack City&quot;, 2 Chainz&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Different&quot;, Young Jeezy&#x27;s &quot;R.I.P.&quot;, B.o.B&#x27;s &quot;HeadBand&quot;, YG&#x27;s &quot;My Nigga&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, Ty Dolla Sign&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;, Kid Ink&#x27;s &quot;Show Me&quot; and Trey Songz&#x27;s &quot;Na Na&quot;. Mustard also released his debut mixtape, &quot;Ketchup&quot;, in 2013, further solidifying his ratchet sound, which follows its G-funk and hyphy predecessors.

Other more peripheral acts that achieved moderate, cult following success in the mainstream include Lil B, who built a strong fan base via social media outlets such as Twitter, YouTube, and MySpace, and has recorded both solo and with The Pack.

That same year, Black Hippy&#x27;s own Kendrick Lamar 2012 release, &quot;Good Kid, M.A.A.D City&quot;, was met with rave reviews and was featured on many critics&#x27; end-of-year lists. The album was nominated Album of the Year at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, marking the first time any West Coast hip-hop was nominated for award. In 2014, &quot;Schoolboy Q&quot; debuted at no.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 139,000 copies sold. YG&#x27;s &quot;My Krazy Life&quot; debuted at #2 on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; with 61,000 copies sold.

=== 2020s ===
On June 19, 2024, Juneteenth, Kendrick Lamar hosted the The Pop Out: Ken &amp; Friends concert following his highly publicized feud with Drake, noted as a celebration of the West Coast.

<text>Crantor of [[Soli (Cilicia)|Soli]] (, &quot;gen&quot;.: Κράντορος; died 276/5 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and member of the Old Academy who was the first philosopher to write commentaries on the works of Plato.

==Life==
Crantor was probably born around the middle of the 4th century BC, at Soli in Cilicia (modern-day Turkey). He moved from Cilicia to Athens in order to study philosophy, where he became a pupil of Xenocrates and a friend of Polemon, and one of the most distinguished supporters of the philosophy of the older Academy. As Xenocrates died 314/3 BC, Crantor must have come to Athens prior to that year, although the date of his birth is not known. He died before both Polemon and Crates, who succeeded Polemon as scholarch. Dropsy was the cause of his death. He left his fortune, which amounted to twelve talents, to Arcesilaus, who had been his pupil and who later succeeded Crates as scholarch of the Academy.

==Writings==
His works were very numerous; but of these, only fragments have been preserved. They appear to have related principally to moral subjects, and, accordingly, Horace classes him with Chrysippus as a moral philosopher, and speaks of him in a manner which proves that the writings of Crantor were much read and generally known in Rome at that time. 

He also made some attempts at poetry; and Diogenes Laërtius relates, that, after sealing up a collection of his poems, he deposited them in the temple of Athena in his native city, Soli. He is accordingly called by the poet Theaetetus, in an epitaph which he composed upon him, the friend of the Muses; and that his chief favorites among the poets were Homer and Euripides.

===&quot;On Grief&quot;===
The most popular of Crantor&#x27;s works in Rome seems to have been that &quot;On Grief&quot; (, ), which was addressed to his friend Hippocles on the death of his son, and from which Cicero seems to have heavily relied upon in his &quot;Tusculan Disputations&quot;. According to Cicero, the Stoic philosopher Panaetius called it a &quot;golden&quot; work, which deserved to be learnt by heart word for word. Cicero also made great use of it while writing his celebrated &quot;Consolatio&quot; on the death of his daughter, Tullia. Several extracts from it are preserved in Pseudo-Plutarch&#x27;s treatise on Consolation addressed to Apollonius, which has come down to us. Crantor paid special attention to ethics, and arranged &quot;good&quot; things in the following order - virtue, health, pleasure, riches.

===&quot;Commentaries on Plato&quot;===
Diogenes Laërtius says that Crantor left behind 30,000 lines of Commentaries (ύπομνήματα), but of these only fragments have been preserved. Crantor seems to have been the first member of the Platonic academy to write commentaries on the works of Plato; Proclus credits Crantor with the first commentary on the Timaeus, and Eudorus of Alexandria makes use of Crantor&#x27;s work in his own commentary, which is in turn preserved by Plutarch.

<text>The following is an overview of events in 1988 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths.

==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 1988 by worldwide gross are as follows:

==Events==
* May 25 – &quot;Rambo III&quot; is released as the most expensive film ever made with a production budget between $58 and $63 million. The film fails to match the box office earnings from &quot;&quot; (1985). 
* June 26 – Michael Keaton is first announced to play comic book superhero Batman in a forthcoming feature film to be directed by Tim Burton and co–starring Jack Nicholson as Batman&#x27;s arch nemesis, The Joker.
* July 15 – &quot;Die Hard&quot; defies low commercial expectations to gross $141.5 million worldwide. Hailed as an influential landmark in the action film genre, it influences a common formula for many action films in the 1990s, featuring a lone everyman against a colorful terrorist character who is usually holding hostages in an isolated setting.
* September 19 – English character actor Roy Kinnear suffers a fall from a horse which will prove fatal while filming &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; in Toledo, Spain.
* October 10 – &quot;Batman&quot; officially commences filming at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.
* October 27 – &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is released on VHS and laserdisc; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes are colored green, and the tape itself is affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales come to $75million.
* December 16 – &quot;Rain Man&quot; is released to critical and commercial success and becomes the highest grossing film of 1988 worldwide with a gross of $355 million. Winning four Academy Awards including Best Picture, it is the last MGM title to be nominated for Best Picture until &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; (2021) 33 years later. Giancarlo Parretti and Max Théret acquire a 52% stake in Pathé.

<text>Cleanthes (; ; c. 330 BC – c. 230 BC), of Assos, was a Greek Stoic philosopher and boxer who was the successor to Zeno of Citium as the second head (&quot;scholarch&quot;) of the Stoic school in Athens. Originally a boxer, he came to Athens where he took up philosophy, listening to Zeno&#x27;s lectures. He supported himself by working as a water-carrier at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno&#x27;s doctrines. He originated new ideas in Stoic physics, and developed Stoicism in accordance with the principles of materialism and pantheism. Among the fragments of Cleanthes&#x27; writings which have come down to us, the largest is a &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;. His pupil was Chrysippus who became one of the most important Stoic thinkers.

==Life==
Cleanthes was born in Assos in the Troad, about 330 BC. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he was the son of Phanias, and early in life he was a successful boxer. With but four drachmae in his possession he came to Athens, where he took up philosophy, listening first to the lectures of Crates the Cynic, and then to those of Zeno, the Stoic. In order to support himself, he worked all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his nickname &quot;the Well-Water-Collector&quot;, ). As he spent the whole day in studying philosophy with no visible means of support, he was summoned before the Areopagus to account for his way of living. The judges were so delighted by the evidence of work which he produced, that they voted him ten minae, though Zeno would not permit him to accept them. His power of patient endurance, or perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of &quot;the Ass&quot; from his fellow students, a name which he was said to have rejoiced in, as it implied that his back was strong enough to bear whatever Zeno put upon it.

Such was the esteem awakened by his high moral qualities that, on the death of Zeno in 262 BC, he became the leader of the school. He continued, however, to support himself by the labour of his own hands. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus, and Antigonus II Gonatas, from whom he accepted 3000 minae. He died at the age of 99, c. 230 BC. We are told that a dangerous ulcer had compelled him to fast for a time. Subsequently he continued his abstinence, saying that, as he was already half-way on the road to death, he would not trouble to retrace his steps.

Simplicius, writing in the 6th century AD, mentions that a statue of Cleanthes was still visible at Assos, which had been erected by the Roman Senate.

==Philosophy==
Cleanthes was an important figure in the development of Stoicism, and stamped his personality on the physical speculations of the school, and by his materialism gave a unity to the Stoic system.
He wrote some fifty works, of which only fragments have survived preserved by writers such as Diogenes Laërtius, Stobaeus, Cicero, Seneca and Plutarch.

===Physics===
Cleanthes revolutionized Stoic physics by the theory of tension (&quot;tonos&quot;) which distinguished Stoic materialism from all conception of matter as dead and inert. He developed Stoic pantheism, and applied his materialistic views to logic and ethics. Thus he argued that the soul was a material substance, and that this was proved (a) by the circumstance that not only bodily qualities, but also mental capacity, are transmitted by ordinary generation from parent to child; and (b) by the sympathy of the soul with the body seen in the fact that, when the body is struck or cut, the soul is pained; and when the soul is torn by anxiety or depressed by care, the body is correspondingly affected. Cleanthes also taught that souls live on after death, but that the intensity of its existence would vary according to the strength or weakness of the particular soul.

Cleanthes regarded the Sun as being divine; because the Sun sustains all living things, it resembled the divine fire which (in Stoic physics) animated all living beings, hence it too must be part of the vivifying fire or aether of the universe. Some maintain that he accused Aristarchus of impiety for daring to put into motion &quot;the hearth of the universe&quot; (i.e. the Earth); this interpretation depends on an emendation of the received text, since in the manuscripts it is Aristarchus that did the accusing. The largest surviving fragment of Cleanthes is the portion of the &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, which has been preserved in Stobaeus, in which he declares praise and honour of Zeus to be the highest privilege of all rational beings.

===Ethics===
Cleanthes maintained that pleasure is not only not a good, but is &quot;contrary to nature&quot; and &quot;worthless.&quot; It was his opinion that the passions (love, fear, grief) are weaknesses: they lack the strain or tension which he persistently emphasized, and on which the strength of the soul, no less than that of the body, depends, and which constitutes in human beings self-control, and moral strength, and also conditions every virtue. He said in a striking passage: &quot;People walk in wickedness all their lives or, at any rate, for the greater part of it. If they ever attain to virtue, it is late and at the very sunset of their days.&quot;

Zeno had said that the goal of life was &quot;to live consistently,&quot; the implication being that no life but the passionless life of reason could ultimately be consistent with itself. Cleanthes is credited with having added the words &quot;with nature,&quot; thus completing the well-known Stoic formula that the goal is &quot;to live consistently with nature.&quot; For Cleanthes, this meant, in the first place, living conformably to the course of the universe; for the universe is under the governance of reason, and everyone has it as their privilege to know or become acquainted with the world-course, to recognize it as rational and cheerfully to conform to it. This, according to him, is true freedom of will not acting without motive, or apart from set purpose, or capriciously, but humbly acquiescing in the universal order, and, therefore, in everything that befalls one. The direction to follow Universal Nature can be traced in his famous prayer:
==Modern influence==
Most notably, a fictionalized version of Cleanthes appears as one of the three main interlocutors in David Hume&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;, where he defends the view that &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge of the existence and nature of God is possible for us.

Cleanthes also appears in José Enrique Rodó&#x27;s essay &quot;Ariel&quot;, in which he is depicted as meditating on the teachings of Zeno as he carried water all through the night.

<doc id="171300" wikidata="Q1253172" url="?curid=171300" title="Southern hip-hop">
<text>Southern hip-hop, also known as Southern rap, South Coast hip-hop, or dirty south, is a blanket term for a regional genre of American hip-hop music that emerged in the Southern United States, especially in Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Florida—often titled &quot;The Big 5,&quot; five states which constitute the &quot;Southern Network&quot; in rap music.

The music was a reaction to the 1980s flow of hip-hop culture from New York City and the Los Angeles area and can be considered the third major American hip-hop scene, alongside East Coast hip-hop and West Coast hip-hop. Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on mixtapes after encountering difficulty securing record-label contracts in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had attained success, and as the decade went on, both mainstream and underground varieties of Southern hip-hop became among the most popular and influential of the entire genre.

==History==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the American hip-hop music market was primarily dominated by artists from the East Coast and West Coast. Los Angeles and New York City were the two main cities where hip-hop was receiving widespread attention. The West Coast was mainly represented by groups like N.W.A, Death Row Records, and the East Coast had people like The Notorious B.I.G., Nas and groups like the Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and Bad Boy Records. In the mid 1980s, cities throughout the Southern United States began to catch on to the hip-hop music movement. The Geto Boys, a hip-hop group from Houston, were among the first hip-hop artists from the Southern United States to gain widespread popularity. Southern hip-hop&#x27;s roots can be traced to the success of the group&#x27;s &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot; in 1989, the Rick Rubin-produced &quot;The Geto Boys&quot; in 1990, and &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot; in 1991.

By the mid-1990s, Atlanta had become a center in Southern hip-hop music. Local production crews such as Organized Noize that represented hip-hop groups such as Outkast and Goodie Mob played a huge part in helping the South become a center for hip-hop music. Murder Dog magazine and Ozone magazine presented information about gangsta rap.

A defining moment for Southern rap was at the 1995 Source Awards. The duo Outkast had just been awarded Best New Artist, and within the tension that was the East Coast–West Coast feud, member André 3000 came up on stage followed by boos and said, &quot;But it&#x27;s like this though, I&#x27;m tired of them closed minded folks, it&#x27;s like we gotta demo tape but don&#x27;t nobody want to hear it. But it&#x27;s like this: the South got something to say, that&#x27;s all I got to say.&quot; As stated by rapper T.I., &quot;Outkast, period. Outkast. That&#x27;s when it changed. That was the first time when people began to take Southern rap seriously.&quot; Former co-owner of the magazine &quot;The Source&quot; Benzino took credit for the incident in an interview from April 2023, saying &quot;they gave Outkast 4.5 mics (out of 5)... and it got back to Outkast... I didn&#x27;t understand the music and I was wrong.&quot; Both scenes borrowed heavily from a production style first introduced by way of the obscure late-1980s New York rap group The Showboys, heavily sampling the beats from their song &quot;Drag Rap (Trigger Man)&quot;. By the early 2000s, these scenes found mainstream success through Disturbing tha Peace in Atlanta, Cash Money Records and No Limit Records out of New Orleans, and Hypnotize Minds out of Memphis, revolutionizing financial structures and strategies for independent Southern rap labels. According to HipHopDX, &quot;Not only is the South on the radar, but now the region that was an underdog is the barometer for rap music and hip-hop culture.&quot;

By the early to mid-2000s, artists from the South had begun to develop mainstream popularity with artists like Slim Thug, Paul Wall, Mike Jones, and Lil Keke from Houston; T.I., Ludacris, Lil Jon, Gucci Mane and Jeezy from Atlanta; Trick Daddy and Rick Ross from Miami; Master P, B.G., Lil Wayne and Juvenile from New Orleans, and Three 6 Mafia and Yo Gotti from Memphis all becoming major label stars during this time.

Southern hip-hop peaked in popularity from 2002 through 2004. In 2002, Southern hip-hop artists accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the singles on hip-hop music charts. On the week of December 13, 2003, Southern urban artists, labels and producers accounted for six of the top 10 slots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: Outkast (with two singles), Ludacris, Kelis (produced by The Neptunes), Beyoncé and Chingy (on Ludacris&#x27; Disturbing Tha Peace label). Additionally, from October 2003 through December 2004, the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart was held by a Southern urban artist for 58 out of 62 weeks. This was capped by the week of December 11, 2004 when seven out of the top ten songs on the chart were held by or featured Southern urban artists. In 2004, &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine reported that Southern artists accounted for 43.6% of the airplay on urban radio stations (compared to 29.7% for the Midwest, 24.1% for the East Coast and 2.5% for the West coast).

== The Dirty Decade ==

&quot;The Dirty Decade&quot;, spanning from 1997 to 2007, marked a period of evolution of southern hip-hop. This era witnessed the genre&#x27;s maturation and widespread recognition, with artists from the Southern United States achieving commercial success. The term &quot;Dirty Decade&quot; is often used to describe the gritty and distinct sound that emerged during this period. Southern hip-hop has its roots in the 1980s, with artists like OutKast and the Geto Boys laying the foundation for the genre. It was during the Dirty Decade that Southern hip-hop gained prominence on a national scale. The genre&#x27;s influences are diverse, drawing from regional cultural elements and blending them with traditional hip-hop elements. Artists who rose to prominence during this era, such as OutKast, Ludacris, and Lil Wayne, continued to shape the contemporary hip-hop landscape. The regional diversity showcased during the Dirty Decade laid the groundwork for the ongoing growth and expansion of Southern hip-hop.

The Dirty Decade in Southern hip-hop was characterized by specific musical elements that set it apart from other regional styles. Heavy basslines, distinctive use of slang, and a fusion of regional influences into the production were notable features. Producers such as Mannie Fresh, Lil Jon, and Organized Noize played key roles in shaping the sound of this era. Artists from the region consistently dominated the charts, with many albums reaching platinum and gold status. Crunk music, in particular, gained widespread popularity, with hits like &quot;Get Low&quot; by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz and &quot;Salt Shaker&quot; by the Ying Yang Twins becoming notable contributions to the genre.

==Louisiana==

In the late 1990s, &quot;bounce&quot; music was born in New Orleans. Master P established No Limit Records. In 1992, Cash Money Records was founded, releasing bounce and gangsta rap music.

It has fast beats, catchy call-and-response lyrics, and background adlibs, all meant to make people dance and express themselves. Since the late 1980s, bounce music has been really popular in New Orleans. One of the most famous bounce artists is Big Freedia. He has worked with Beyoncé, walked the MET Gala Runway with Ciara, and had her own TV show on Fuse.

Bounce music can be heard in many clubs across the city, especially at The Hangover Bar. On Second Line Sundays, brass bands play lively beats for people to dance along the parade route. Interactive twerk classes like Twerk NOLA and Shake Ya Brass at Crescent Park also feature bounce music.

More popular bounce artists are DJ Jubilee, Juvenile, Magnolia Shorty.

==Florida==

Miami Bass music is known for its explicit lyrics about sex, fast dance beats, and a strong bass with a constant kick drum. The genre is all about parties, drugs, sex, and champagne.

The single &quot;Throw The D&quot; by the group 2 Live Crew in January 1986 was the first Miami bass song. Fresh Kid Ice (Christopher Wong Won) said that the song came about when he noticed a new popular dance in Miami, when Herman Kelly and Life&#x27;s song &quot;Dance to the drummer&#x27;s beat&quot; played. 2 Live Crew released their album &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot; in 1989.

2 Live Crew got into trouble for explicit lyrics in their 1989 album &quot;As Nasty as They Wanna Be.&quot; A judge said it was too obscene to sell, but 2 Live Crew won the legal fight. This allowed them and others to keep using slang and explicit content, but they had to put a warning on album covers.

Luke Campbell and David Hobbs from 2 Live Crew were important in making Miami Bass popular through these controversial albums.

==Tennessee==

Three 6 Mafia, DJ Paul, Juicy J, Lord Infamous, Crunchy Black, Gangsta Boo, La Chat, Project Pat, Indo G, Playa Fly, Eightball and MJG, Yo Gotti, Moneybagg Yo, NLE Choppa, Pooh Shiesty, Blac Youngsta and Young Dolph all came from Memphis, Tennessee.

Tennessee hip-hop blends the style of southern rap, and funk. The Tennessee rap scene popularized musical subgenres within the community, such as Memphis Rap, and Memphis horror-core. Arrested Development&#x27;s debut album 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of... had the song Tennessee in 1992, which is thought to have been the first rap song to release from the state.

==Alabama==
The gangsta rap group Dirty is from Montgomery, Alabama. Codie G was the manager to G-side and became a mentor to many Alabamian people in the rap community. His involvement spear-headed the genre into popularity within the state of Alabama. In 1999, The group Dirty Boyz debuted with the album Country Versatile thus solidifying hip-hop&#x27;s place in the state.

==Georgia==

In 2009, the &quot;New York Times&quot; called Atlanta &quot;hip-hop&#x27;s center of gravity&quot;, and the city is home to many famous hip-hop, R&amp;B and neo soul musicians.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Atlanta&#x27;s hip-hop scene was characterized by a local variant of Miami bass, with stars like Kilo Ali and DJ Smurf (later Mr. Collipark).

Notable artists from Georgia include Lil Baby, Young Thug, Playboi Carti, Gunna, Future, and Latto.

By the mid-1990s, the rise of OutKast, Goodie Mob and the production collective Organized Noize, let to the development of the Dirty South style of hip-hop and of Atlanta gaining a reputation for &quot;soul-minded hip-hop eccentrics&quot;, contrasting with other regional styles. On August 3, 1995, Outkast received the award for Best New Artist in New York City at the Source Awards. At the time, the primary hip-hop heard nationally was from artists on the East and West Coasts, due at least partly to high- profile disputes between rappers from each coast. It was groups such as Outkast who were determined to let the world know that the South had something to say.

In 2009, it was noted that after 2000/2001, Atlanta moved &quot;from the margins to becoming hip-hop&#x27;s center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South&quot;, primarily due to the massive popularity of Waka Flocka Flame&#x27;s 2009 debut mixtape. Producer Drumma Boy called Atlanta &quot;the melting pot of the South&quot;. Producer Fatboi called the Roland TR-808 (&quot;808&quot;) synthesizer &quot;central&quot; to the music of Atlanta&#x27;s versatility, used for snap, crunk, trap, and pop rap styles. The same article named Drumma Boy, Fatboi, Shawty Redd, Lex Luger and Zaytoven the five &quot;hottest producers driving the city&quot;.

==Texas==
In the late 1980s, the Geto Boys were Houston&#x27;s first hip-hop group to gain mainstream popularity. In the early 1990s, Texas groups such as Nemesis, PKO, and UGK (from Dallas, San Antonio, and Port Arthur respectively) also gained popularity. Before the early 1990s, most Southern hip-hop was upbeat and fast, like Miami bass and crunk. In Texas, however, the music started to become slower. In the early 1990s, DJ Screw created &quot;chopped and screwed&quot; music. Although people associated with Screw have indicated any time between 1987 and 1991, Screw said he started slowing music down in 1990. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, DJ Dinero and DJ Z-Nasty helped popularize chopped and screwed music in the Mid South.

Between 1991 and 1992, there was increased abuse of purple drank in Southeast Texas. Purple drank was a major influence in chopped and screwed music due to its effect of slowing down perception. DJ Screw, a known user of purple drank, said that it is not required to enjoy chopped and screwed music and that he came up with the style when high on marijuana.

As the spread of Southern hip-hop continued, its mainstream breakthrough occurred in 2000. Duo UGK made a high-profile guest appearance on Jay-Z&#x27;s hit &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot; and also appeared on Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s hit &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot;. Both of these collaborations greatly increased their reputation and helped fuel anticipation for their next project. UGK&#x27;s Pimp C died from a sudden heart attack after overdosing on purple drank on December 4, 2007 at the age of 33. A song that originally appeared on the compilation album &quot;The Day Hell Broke Loose 2&quot;, Mike Jones&#x27; &quot;Still Tippin&#x27;&quot;, achieved mainstream success in 2004 leading to local Houston rap label Swishahouse signing a national distribution deal with Asylum Records. Jones released his major label debut, &quot;Who Is Mike Jones?&quot;, on Swishahouse/Warner Bros. in April 2005 and was certified platinum that June. Paul Wall&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;, on Swishahouse/Atlantic, was released in September 2005, eventually topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Many rappers from Houston began to have mainstream success in the 2000s. In 2005, MTV named Houston the new rap capital of the South.

Notable artists in Houston include Travis Scott, That Mexican OT, Maxo Kream, Sauce Walka, Chamillionaire, Paul Wall, Bun B, Pimp C, Z-Ro, Big Hawk, Big Moe, Big Mello, Big Steve, Chris Ward, C-Note, Devin The Dude, DJ DMD, E.S.G., Fat Pat, J-Dawg, Killa Kyleon, Kirko Bangz, Lil&#x27; Keke, Lil&#x27; Flip, Lil&#x27; O, Lil&#x27; Troy, Mike D, Mike Jones, K-Rino, Al-D, Mr. 3-2, Slim Thug, South Park Mexican, Yungstar, Trae Tha Truth, Scarface and groups such as ABN, Boss Hogg Outlawz, Botany Boyz, Coughee Brothaz, D.E.A., Guerilla Maab, Geto Boys, Herschelwood Hardheadz, M.O.B., Screwed Up Click, South Park Coalition and UGK. The Houston hip-hop scene is known for the chopped and screwed sound invented by Screwed Up Click leader DJ Screw, and remains the location most associated with the style.

Vanilla Ice was born in Dallas, and grew up moving between Dallas and Miami. The D.O.C. is from West Dallas. He worked with Dr. Dre as an artist and writer. Christian hip-hop artist D-Boy Rodriguez received moderate commercial success and was part of the burgeoning Christian hip-hop scene in Dallas and the rest of Texas in the late 80s, until he was murdered in 1990. Other rappers such as Big Lurch, Mr. Pookie, Mr. Lucci, Big Tuck, Dorrough, BigXthaPlug, MO3 and Dondria also hail from Dallas. Rappers such as legends Lil Sin, and P.K.O. as well as Worldwide, Richie Branson, Cadillac Muzik, King Kyle Lee, Mike Dimes, and Megan Thee Stallion all hail from San Antonio. There is also a burgeoning R&amp;B scene that includes alumni such as Destiny&#x27;s Child and Gary Clark, Jr., as well as up-and-comers Leon Bridges, The Suffers, Latasha Lee, Tameca Jones, and Alesia Lani among others.

==North Carolina==
Around the same time, Ski Beatz (of Greensboro) produced &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; on Jay-Z&#x27;s album &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, which was released in 1996. Also, 9th Wonder (of Winston-Salem) joined a group named Little Brother with fellow members Big Pooh and Phonte (of Durham).(9th Wonder left Little Brother in 2007 to solo produce, becoming one of the top 10 most successful hip-hop producers of all time).

North Carolina did not hit the mainstream hip-hop map until 2001 with Petey Pablo&#x27;s &quot;Raise Up&quot;. This song was successful and helped highlight the North Carolina&#x27;s burgeoning rap industry, along with some of its prolific rappers from the state: J. Cole, Rapsody, King Mez, Kooley High, Ignite Mindz, Drique London, SkyBlew, Azon Blaze, Donovan McCray, Lazarus, Thee Tom Hardy, Troop 41, Bryce Snow, Lute, Deniro Farrar, Justus League, Edgar Allen Floe, L.E.G.A.C.Y., Kaze, Banknote Mitch, Khrysis, Keaton, Wells, Tucson, Ghost Dog, &amp; many more.

Another noteworthy rap artist from North Carolina is DaBaby, hailing from Charlotte, though he was born in Cleveland. Although sometimes drawing attention from self-created controversies, his lyrical skills, mixed with his exposure and unique voice, have made him a reckonable force in hip-hop.

== Slang ==
Among the four coasts, Southern hip-hop is one of the more recent genres compared to the other three coasts, meaning that the slang used in southern hip-hop is more recent than the slang in other coasts. A lot of the iconic southern slang that was used in hip-hop and rap came from five specific cities of the south: Houston, Memphis, Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans. Of the many slang used in southern hip-hop, the ones that are still being used today are:

&quot;Lean,&quot; a term used widely in southern hip-hop, is a sprite-codeine-candy mixture that is used like alcohol. The drink originated from Houston in the 1960s; however, back in the 1960s, the word &quot;lean&quot; was not used and the drink had multiple names for it like &quot;sizzurp&quot; or &quot;purple drink&quot;. It was not until the 1980s or 1990s that the drink was referred to as lean. The song that popularized the slang term &quot;lean&quot; was called &quot;Sippin&#x27; Codeine&quot; by DJ Screw and Big Moe, released in 1996 and has the lyric &quot;It makes a southside playa lean&quot; referring to how the sprite-codeine-candy mixture makes you &quot;lean&quot;. The slang is still being used today, some of the most notable examples being &quot;Gucci Gang&quot; by Lil Pump, &quot;Look At Me!&quot; by XXXtentacion, and &quot;I&quot; by Kendrick Lamar, all of these songs being relatively recent.

&quot;Trap House&quot;, another widely used slang term in southern hip-hop, is a house where various illegal drugs are made, bought, sold, or used. The primary drugs that are common in trap houses are heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl. The reason why these drug houses are called trap houses is because the consumer of the drug feel &quot;trapped&quot; in the addiction of the drug, hence the name trap house. The slang term trap house originated in Atlanta from the 1980s when drug addiction was at a rise as an escape from the poor conditions of the neighborhoods and cities. &quot;Trap House&quot; itself is a music genre, though usually just referred to as &quot;trap&quot; in the present day, and the music genre has lyrics that show off the hard life and struggle of being a drug dealer, trying to sell drugs, and living in a poor inner city. One of the most recent example of Trap House being used in a song is by YoungBoy Never Broke Again in his song &quot;Trap House&quot; that released in 2018.

The term &quot;Flossin&quot;&#x27; derives from the word floss, and means to show off expensive articles of clothing, or items. The term was birthed in Houston around 1990, originally meaning to have money, but the term developed over time into what we know it as today. It was popularized through Southern Rap, being used in songs such as Lil&#x27; Flip&#x27;s Texas Boyz (Screwed) 2002, being used in the following lyrics, &quot;What you know about acting bad, flossin&#x27; prowlers? I got seven DVDs, I&#x27;m watchin&#x27; Austin Powers&quot;.

The adjective &quot;Ratchet&quot; means to be crazy, or off the hook. Ever since the late 1990s, rappers from Shreveport, Louisiana have used the term in their songs. It derives off the Louisianan dialect for Wretched, and is used in songs like, Rapper Lil Boosie&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Do Da Ratchet&quot;, Nicki Minaj&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Right By My Side&quot;, and Juicy J&#x27;s &quot;Bandz a Make Her Dance&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Dirty South&quot; was introduced via the 1995 Goodie Mob track &quot;Dirty South&quot; with the chorus repeating the lyrics &quot;What you niggas know about the Dirty South?&quot; 

== Southern Fashion ==

There was an American duo named Kris Kross. Their names are Chris &quot;Daddy Mac&quot; Smith and Chris &quot;Mac Daddy&quot; Kelly. They are from Atlanta Georgia. Kris Kross was the youngest hip-hop pair to ever gain such a following. At the ripe age of 12 and 13 years old, Kris Kross made a fashion choice that was not done before in the hip-hip industry. The duo wore their clothes backwards, while performing on stage. This became a trend in the 1990s, this fashion choice helped the youthful duo rise to fame.

Migos were an American hip-hop trio, stage names are Takeoff, Offset, and Quavo. They are from Atlanta, Georgia. Migos take a lot of pride representing the south. The Migos have walked the MET Gala carpets. Migos hit mainstream hip-hop with their hit song Versace and their signature sound. Drake then cosigned the group with verse on the remix, that became on the Billboard charts. Not only did a song that introduced the Migos to the world, but the tune also popularized the Versace fashion brand in hip-hop in the Black community.

Travis Scott (Jacques Bermon Webster ll) is an American Rapper and record producer. Scott is from Houston, Texas. Travis worked with numerous brands, including Dover Street Market, McDonalds, PlayStation, Epic Games, and Byredo. He started his career working as an artist who made sneakers for Nike. He eventually became &quot;a creative consultant&quot; for they company. Christian Dior announced its partnership with Travis Scott as a musical artist for its Spring/Summer &#x27;22 line at Paris Fashion Week, Scott appeared on stage together to introduce there further plans.

Jermaine Lamarr Cole is an American rapper and record producer, from North Carolina. J Cole opened his 4 Your Eyez Only tour by wading through a sea of fans in a full orange prison jumpsuit, printed on the back was &quot;Property of&quot;. They look would end up being a centerpiece of the tour that added a new layer of storytelling in Cole&#x27;s performance.

== Crunk ==

The term &quot;crunk&quot; is mainly used to denote a musical style that was originated by Three Six Mafia in Memphis, Tennessee, in the mid-to-late 1990s. It was popularized by Atlanta rapper Lil Jon, and gained mainstream popularity in the period 2003–04. A typical crunk track uses a drum machine rhythm, heavy bassline, and shouting vocals, often in call and response manner.

<doc id="171302" wikidata="Q12151852" url="?curid=171302" title="Nostalgia">
<text>Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. The word &quot;nostalgia&quot; is a neoclassical compound derived from Greek, consisting of (&quot;nóstos&quot;), a Homeric word meaning &quot;homecoming&quot;, and (&quot;álgos&quot;), meaning &quot;pain&quot;; the word was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home. Described as a medical condition—a form of melancholy—in the early modern period, it became an important trope in Romanticism.

Nostalgia is associated with a longing for the past, its personalities, possibilities, and events, especially the &quot;good old days&quot; or a &quot;warm childhood&quot;. There is a predisposition, caused by cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection, for people to view the past more positively and the future more negatively. When applied to one&#x27;s beliefs about a society or institution, this is called declinism, which has been described as &quot;a trick of the mind&quot; and as &quot;an emotional strategy, something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak&quot;. 

The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding one&#x27;s personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia as induced during these studies. Emotion is a strong evoker of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These recollections of one&#x27;s past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time. Cultural phenomena such as music, movies, television shows, and video games, as well as natural phenomena such as weather and environment can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.

==Functions==
Nostalgia&#x27;s definition has changed greatly over time. Consistent with its Greek word roots meaning &quot;homecoming&quot; and &quot;pain&quot;, nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition characterized by expressing extreme homesickness. The modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often. Nostalgia has been found to have important psychological functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning. Nostalgia can lead individuals to perceive the past more favorably than the present, a phenomenon known as the &#x27;nostalgia effect,&#x27; which is classified as a cognitive bias. Many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them. Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of &quot;nostalgia proneness.&quot; Nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation.

===Improving mood===
Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one&#x27;s mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one&#x27;s happiness. Batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia-prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times.

===Increasing social connectedness===
Nostalgia sometimes involves memories of people one was close to, such as family members, romantic lovers, or friends, and thus it can increase one&#x27;s sense of social support and connections. Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships. According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness.

===Preserving cultural heritage===
Nostalgia serves as a motivator for the preservation of people&#x27;s cultural heritage. People endeavor to conserve buildings, landscapes, and other artifacts of historical significance out of nostalgia for past times. They are often motivated by a desire to connect to their heritage from past generations. This can manifest in living history events such as historical reenactments, which bring together people with a shared nostalgia for historical periods of past times. These events&#x27; hands-on, improvisational natures often facilitate socialization.

===Enhancing positive self-regard===
Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences. Additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not. The researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes. Vess et al. (2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection.

===Providing existential meaning===
Nostalgia helps increase one&#x27;s self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one&#x27;s sense of meaning in life. The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one&#x27;s perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one&#x27;s nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia, though, one&#x27;s defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one&#x27;s well-being. Follow-up studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat.

===Promoting psychological growth===
Nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented people. Baldwin &amp; Landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like &quot;I am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places.&quot; Nostalgia also increased interest in growth-related behavior such as &quot;I would like to explore someplace that I have never been before.&quot; In the first study, these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced positive affect—the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good. In the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced self-esteem.

===As a deception===
One recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts. This study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in South Africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways, &#x27;restorative nostalgia&#x27; a wish to return to that past, and &#x27;reflective nostalgia&#x27; which is more critically aware.

===As a comfort===
Reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health. One notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past &#x27;good&#x27; memories can have. They found that thinking about the past &#x27;fondly&#x27; actually increased perceptions of physical warmth.

===As a political tool===
In a 2014 study conducted by Routledge, he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives, the more they nostalgically longed for the past. Routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive—and effective—as a tool of political persuasion.

==Trigger factors==

===Cultural===

====Books====
A person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to familiar music, looking at old photos, or visiting comforting environments of the past. With this knowledge widely available, many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of nostalgia. 

====Music====
Hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person. A song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events that occurred then. However, if it is heard throughout life, it may lose its association with any specific period or experience.

====Movies====
Old movies can trigger nostalgia. This is particularly true for generations who grew up as children during specific film eras such as the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Rewatching classic movies can be therapeutic in nature, healing emotional wounds using happy childhood memories.

====TV shows====
Old television shows can trigger nostalgia. People gravitate towards shows they watched as children, as the memories from one&#x27;s youth are often the most significant of their lives.

====Video games====
Old video games can trigger nostalgia. Retrogaming has become a recreational activity among older generations who played them as children.

===Environmental===

====Geography====
Specific locations can trigger nostalgia. Such places are often associated with an individual&#x27;s past, reminding them of their past childhood, relationships, or achievements. They may include the homes where they grew up with their families, the schools they attended with friends, or the venues they went to for dating and marriage.

====Nature====
Nature-based factors such as weather and temperature can trigger nostalgia. Scientific studies have shown that cold weather makes people more nostalgic, while nostalgia causes people to feel warmer. In some societies, elements of nature often trigger a nostalgia for past times when nature played a larger role in culture.
Environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term &#x27;solastalgia&#x27; in his 2003 book &quot;Solastalgia: a new concept in human health and identity&quot;. The word is formed from the Latin sōlācium (comfort) and the Greek root ἄλγος (pain, suffering) to describe a form of emotional or existential distress caused by environmental destruction. Nostalgia differs from solastalgia because nostalgia is typically generated by spatial separation from important places or persons (one&#x27;s home, family, friends, or loved ones) with which it is often possible, in principle, to reconnect. With solastalgia, in contrast, the grief is typically caused by environmental destruction, so the separation between subject and object is ontological rather than spatial: it is permanent and unbridgeable, and can be experienced while continuing to occupy the same irreversibly degraded place.

==Other aspects==

===As a medical condition===

The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his dissertation in Basel. The word nostalgia was compound of the ancient Greek words nostos (return home) and algia (longing). Hofer introduced &quot;nostalgia&quot; or &quot;mal du pays&quot; &quot;homesickness&quot; for the condition also known as &quot;mal du Suisse&quot; &quot;Swiss illness&quot;, because of its frequent occurrence in Swiss mercenaries who in the plains of Switzerland were pining for their landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, and death.

English &quot;homesickness&quot; is a loan translation of &quot;nostalgia&quot;. Sir Joseph Banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of Captain Cook. On 3 September 1770 he stated that the sailors &quot;were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia&quot;, but his journal was not published in his lifetime. Cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home. Receiving a diagnosis was, however, generally regarded as an insult.

In the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia, a nostalgic bone. By the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process. It was considered as a form of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides. Nostalgia was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the American Civil War. By the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished. Nostalgia was still being recognized in both the First and Second World Wars, especially by the American armed forces. Great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves (see the BBC documentary &quot;Century of the Self&quot;).

Nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past. The resulting emotion can vary from happiness to sorrow. The term &quot;feeling nostalgic&quot; is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with, or a longing to return to, a particular period of time.

===Romanticism===
Swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of Kuhreihen, which were forbidden to Swiss mercenaries because they led to &quot;nostalgia&quot; to the point of desertion, illness or death. The 1767 &quot;Dictionnaire de Musique&quot; by Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that Swiss mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their Swiss songs. It became somewhat of a &quot;topos&quot; in Romantic literature, and figures in the poem &quot;Der Schweizer&quot; by Achim von Arnim (1805) and in Clemens Brentano&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (1809), as well as in the opera &quot;Le Chalet&quot;, by Adolphe Charles Adam (1834), which was performed for Queen Victoria under the title &quot;The Swiss Cottage&quot;. The Romantic connection of &quot;nostalgia&quot; was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for Switzerland and the development of early tourism in Switzerland that took hold of the European cultural elite in the 19th century. German Romanticism coined an opposite to &quot;Heimweh&quot;, &quot;Fernweh&quot; &quot;far-sickness&quot;, &quot;longing to be far away&quot;, like &quot;wanderlust&quot; expressing the Romantic desire to travel and explore.

===In rhetoric and communication===
Nostalgia has been frequently studied as a tool of rhetoric and persuasion. Communication scholar Stephen Depoe, for example, writes that in nostalgic messaging: “a speaker highlights a comparison between a more favorable, idealized past and a less favorable present in order to stimulate [nostalgia]. . . . [linking] his/her own policies to qualities of the idealized past in order to induce support” (179). Rhetorician William Kurlinkus taxonomizes nostalgia on this foundation, arguing that nostalgic rhetoric generally contains three parts:
# A loss or threat in the present: the chaotic change that nostalgia responds to. Though some theorists argue that the ideal must truly be lost, other scholars including Kurlinkus argue that the ideal may simply be threatened to trigger nostalgia.
# A nostalgic crux: a person, group, corporation, et al. that is blamed for the loss of the nostalgic ideal. To perform such scapegoating, the nostalgic crux is usually presented as a force of newness and change. Defeating this outsider is positioned as a source of recovering the good memory. Such cruxes have include groups from polluting corporations to immigrants.
# Hope: Finally, Kurlinkus argues that though nostalgia is often performed ironically it almost always has a true hope for recovering the good memory (whether this means some kind of true restoration or a more symbolic recovery of an ethic). Such hope differentiates nostalgia from similar emotions like melancholia, which contains all of nostalgia&#x27;s longing for lost ideals without a desire to move out of that past.

Kurlinkus coined the term &quot;nostalgic other&quot; to describe the ways in which some populations of people become trapped in other people&#x27;s nostalgic stories of them, idealized as natural while simultaneously denied sovereignty or the right to change in the present. &quot;Nostalgic others differ from other scholarly discourse in that their alterity is not primarily based in race or ethnicity.&quot; Kurlinkus wrote. &quot;Rather, in concurrent identifications and divisions, the nostalgic other is distinguished from the rhetor by time. We live in the present; they live in the past. The creation of the nostalgic other allows mainstream populations to commodify the racial purity and stability of the past but refuses the community agency to change in the present by highlighting its negative traits.

=== As an advertising tool ===
In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised products. Modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an advertisement. The feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more reminiscent of life.

Due to efficient advertising schemes, consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as nostalgia. Vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one&#x27;s memory, but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated exposure to it. The constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way consumers use their purchasing power.

Examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include nostalgia-themed websites such as Want Nostalgia?, The Nostalgia Machine, and DoYouRemember?, and revamps of old movies, TV shows, and books. Vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as Coca-Cola and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. use.

Developed within the marketing discipline, forestalgia, defined as an individual&#x27;s yearning for an idealized future, serves as a future-focused counterpart to nostalgia. Like nostalgia, where only the happy memories are retained, forestalgia explains customers’ intentions to escape the present to a romanticized future where current concerns are no longer an issue. Marketing researchers found that when promoting hedonic and utilitarian products, far-past nostalgia and far-future forestalgia advertisements were most effective in the promotion of utilitarian products. In contrast, hedonic products were better suited for advertisements framed in far-past nostalgia or near-future forestalgia.

==Nostalgia cycle==
It has been argued that there is a nostalgia cycle. Various durations of this cycle have been alleged, including epicycles (ie nostalgia for the last nostalgia cycle). It has been said that, if a twenty year nostalgia cycle applied, then 1980s nostalgia would have ended circa 2010. In 2016, it was said that this had not happened, and that a twenty year nostalgia cycle did not appear to apply. It has been said that, if you believe in nostalgia cycles, then the popularity of Mad Men in the 2010s would require 1960s nostalgia to follow a forty year nostalgia cycle. It has been argued that the nostalgia cycle has been disrupted, and thus has ceased to exist, or changed its duration to become longer or shorter; and it has been argued that the internet is what disrupted it. It has also been argued that the nostalgia cycle never existed, and that belief in its existence is based on cherry picked evidence.

<text>John Charles Walsham Reith, 1st Baron Reith (; 20 July 1889 – 16 June 1971) was a Scottish broadcasting executive who established the tradition of independent public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom. In 1922, he was employed by the BBC, then the British Broadcasting Company Ltd., as its general manager; in 1923 he became its managing director, and in 1927 he was employed as the Director-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation created under a royal charter. His concept of broadcasting as a way of educating the masses marked for a long time the BBC and similar organisations around the world. An engineer by profession, and standing at tall, he was a larger-than-life figure who was a pioneer in his field.

The BBC&#x27;s Reith Lectures were instituted in his honour.

==Early life==

Born at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, Reith was the fifth son and the youngest, by ten years, of the seven children of the Rev. George Reith, a Scottish Presbyterian minister of the College Church at Glasgow and later Moderator of the United Free Church of Scotland. He was to carry strict Presbyterian religious convictions forward into his adult life. Reith was educated at the Glasgow Academy then at Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, Norfolk. He spent two years at the Royal Technical College at Glasgow (later the University of Strathclyde) followed by an apprenticeship as an engineer at the North British Locomotive Company. During this time, he joined the Territorials and in February 1911 was commissioned as an officer in the Scottish Rifles’ 5th Territorial Battalion. In 1913, he moved to London after obtaining a post at S. Pearson and Son through Ernest William Moir, and worked on their construction of the Royal Albert Dock.

Reith, who was tall, joined up with the 5th Scottish Rifles early in the First World War and was quickly transferred to the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant. In October 1915, while fighting in France, he was severely wounded by a sniper&#x27;s bullet through his left cheek, which nearly cost him his life and left him with a noticeable scar. While lying wounded on a stretcher after the shot, he is reported to have muttered &quot;I&#x27;m very angry and I&#x27;ve spoilt a new tunic.&quot;

During Reith&#x27;s convalescence, E W Moir referred him to a post at Pearson&#x27;s project constructing the cordite factory HM Factory Gretna, comprising the fixing of contracts, estimating of costs, taking out quantities, and inspection of materials. In February 1916, he went to work at Remington Arms, Eddystone, Delaware County, Pennsylvania who were manufacturing the Pattern 1914 Enfield Mk 1 rifle for the British government. He spent the next two years in the United States, supervising armament contracts, and became attracted to the country. He was promoted to captain in 1917, before being transferred to the Royal Marine Engineers in 1918 as a major. He returned to the Royal Engineers as a captain in 1919.

Reith resigned his Territorial Army commission in 1921. He returned to Glasgow as general manager of an engineering firm. In 1922, he returned to London, where he started working as secretary to the London Conservative group of MPs in the 1922 general election. That election&#x27;s results were the first to be broadcast on the radio.

==British Broadcasting Company==

Reith had no broadcasting experience when he replied to an advertisement in &quot;The Morning Post&quot; for a general manager for an as-yet unformed British Broadcasting Company in 1922. He later admitted that he felt he possessed the credentials necessary to &quot;manage any company&quot;. He managed to retrieve his original application from a post box after re-thinking his approach, guessing that his Aberdonian background would carry more favour with Sir William Noble, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Committee.

In his new role, he was, in his own words, &quot;confronted with problems of which I had no experience: Copyright and performing rights; Marconi patents; associations of concert artists, authors, playwrights, composers, music publishers, theatre managers, wireless manufacturers.&quot;

===The general strike===
In 1926, Reith came into conflict with the government during the 1926 general strike. The BBC bulletins reported, without comment, all sides in the dispute, including the Trades Union Congress&#x27;s and of union leaders. Reith attempted to arrange a broadcast by the opposition Labour Party but it was vetoed by the government, and he had to refuse a request to allow a representative Labour or Trade Union leader to put the case for the miners and other workers.

Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin made a national broadcast about the strike from Reith&#x27;s house and was coached by Reith. When Ramsay MacDonald, the leader of the Labour Party, asked to make a broadcast in reply, Reith supported the request. However, Baldwin was &quot;quite against MacDonald broadcasting&quot; and Reith unhappily refused the request. MacDonald complained that the BBC was &quot;biased&quot; and was &quot;misleading the public&quot; while other Labour Party figures were just as critical. Philip Snowden, the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, was one of those who wrote to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; to complain.

Reith&#x27;s reply also appeared in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, admitting the BBC had not had complete liberty to do as it wanted. He recognised that at a time of emergency the government was never going to give the company complete independence, and he appealed to Snowden to understand the constraints he had been under.

:&quot;We do not believe that any other Government, even one of which Mr Snowden was a member, would have allowed the broadcasting authority under its control greater freedom than was enjoyed by the BBC during the crisis.&quot;

The Labour leadership was not the only high-profile body denied a chance to comment on the strike. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, wanted to broadcast a &quot;peace appeal&quot; drawn up by church leaders which called for an immediate end to the strike, renewal of government subsidies to the coal industry and no cuts in miners&#x27; wages.

Davidson telephoned Reith about his idea on 7 May, saying he had spoken to Baldwin, who had said he would not stop the broadcast, but would prefer it not to happen. Reith later wrote: &quot;A nice position for me to be in between Premier and Primate, bound mightily to vex one or other.&quot;

Reith asked for the government view and was advised not to allow the broadcast because, it was suspected, that would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, an excuse to commandeer the BBC. Churchill had already lobbied Baldwin to that effect. Reith contacted the Archbishop to turn him down and explain that he feared if the talk went ahead, the government might take the company over.

Although Churchill wanted to commandeer the BBC to use it &quot;to the best possible advantage&quot;, Reith wrote that Baldwin&#x27;s government wanted to be able to say &quot;that they did not commandeer [the BBC], but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial&quot;.

Reith admitted to his staff that he regretted the lack of TUC and Labour voices on the airwaves. Many commentators have seen Reith&#x27;s stance during that period as pivotal in establishing the state broadcaster&#x27;s enduring reputation for impartiality.

After the strike ended, the BBC&#x27;s Programme Correspondence Department analysed the reaction to the coverage, and reported that 3,696 people complimented the BBC and 176 were critical.

===British Broadcasting Corporation===
The British Broadcasting Company was part-share owned by a committee of members of the wireless industry, including British Thomson-Houston, The General Electric Company, Marconi and Metropolitan-Vickers. However, Reith had been in favour of the company being taken into public ownership, as he felt that despite the boards under which he had served so far, allowing him a high degree of latitude on all matters, not all future members might do so. Although opposed by some, including members of the Government, the BBC became a corporation in 1927. Reith was knighted the same year.

Reith&#x27;s autocratic approach became the stuff of BBC legend. His preferred approach was one of benevolent dictator, but with built-in checks to his power. Throughout his life, Reith remained convinced that that approach was the best way to run an organisation. Later Director-General Greg Dyke, profiling Reith in 2007, noted that the term &quot;Reithian&quot; has entered the dictionary to denote a style of management, particularly with relation to broadcasting. Reith summarised the BBC&#x27;s purpose in three words: &quot;inform, educate, entertain&quot;; this remains part of the organisation&#x27;s mission statement to this day. It has also been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world, notably the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.

Reith earned a reputation for prudishness in sexual matters. There is an old BBC legend that he once caught an announcer kissing a secretary and decreed that in future the announcer must not read the late-night religious programme &quot;The Epilogue&quot;. In fact, this may have been inspired by his catching the Chief Engineer, Peter Eckersley, not just kissing but being &quot;in flagrante&quot; with an actress on a studio table.

He was to be somewhat embarrassed when one of his staff ran off with the quite new wife of the then rising young writer Evelyn Waugh. Reith also had to deal with Eckersley after the BBC Chief Engineer had a rather public affair with a married woman on the staff. Up to the Second World War any member of BBC staff involved in a divorce could lose their job.

Under Reith, the BBC did not broadcast on Sunday before 12:30 PM, to give listeners time to attend church, and for the rest of the day broadcast only religious services, classical music and other non-frivolous programming. European commercial stations Radio Normandie and Radio Luxembourg competed with the BBC on &quot;Reith Sunday&quot; and other days of the week by broadcasting more popular music.

===Abdication broadcast===
In 1936, Reith directly oversaw the abdication broadcast of Edward VIII. By then his style had become well-established in the public eye. He personally introduced the ex-King (as &#x27;Prince Edward&#x27;), before standing aside to allow Edward to take the chair. Doing so, Edward accidentally knocked the table leg with his foot, which was picked up by the microphone. Reith later noted in an interview with Malcolm Muggeridge that some headlines interpreted that as Reith &quot;slamming the door&quot; in disgust before Edward began broadcasting.

===Departure===
By 1938, Reith had become discontented with his role as Director-General, asserting in his autobiography that the organisational structure of the BBC, which he had created, had left him with insufficient work to do. He was invited by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to become chairman of Imperial Airways, the country&#x27;s most important airline and one which had fallen into public disfavour because of its inefficiency. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy amongst the Board of Governors to remove Reith, but that has never been proved, and there is no record of such a thing in Reith&#x27;s own memoir.

He left Broadcasting House with no ceremony (at his request) but in tears. That evening, he attended a dinner party before driving out to Droitwich to close down a transmitter personally. He signed the visitor&#x27;s book &quot;J.C.W. Reith, late BBC.&quot; John Gunther wrote that Reith&#x27;s &quot;modernist citadel on Portland Place was more important in the life of Britain than most government offices [and] rules the B.B.C. with a hand of granite&quot;. He &quot;made the B.B.C. an expression of his nonconformist conscience, and also what is probably the finest broadcasting organization in the world&quot;; Gunther predicted that he &quot;is almost certain to have a big political job some day&quot;.

===&quot;Reithianism&quot;===
The term &quot;Reithianism&quot; describes certain principles of broadcasting associated with Lord Reith. These include an equal consideration of all viewpoints, probity, universality and a commitment to public service. Audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC, a government agency which had a monopoly on broadcasting. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, &quot;All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.&quot;

Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences greatly enjoyed it. At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket matches, regardless of their popularity.

==Second World War==
In 1940, Reith was appointed Minister of Information in Chamberlain&#x27;s government. So as to perform his full duties, he became a member of parliament (MP) for Southampton. When Chamberlain fell, Churchill became Prime Minister and moved Reith to the Ministry of Transport. Reith was subsequently moved to become First Commissioner of Works which he held for the next two years, through two restructurings of the job, and was also transferred to the House of Lords by being created Baron Reith.

During that period, the city centres of Coventry, Plymouth and Portsmouth were destroyed by German bombing. Reith urged the local authorities to begin planning postwar reconstruction. He was dismissed from his government post at a very difficult time for Churchill in 1942, following the loss of Singapore. Pressured by Tory backbenchers who wanted a Conservative in the Information role, Reith was replaced by Duff Cooper.

It has been claimed that the sacking was due to Reith being difficult to work with. However, given the absence of direct contact between the two men during Reith&#x27;s period in several ministerial positions, this is unlikely to be the true reason. More plausible, is the explanation given above, and the cleavage between Reithian management methods: energetic, thorough and highly organised, and the established style of the British civil service at that time: at best, calm and deliberative; at worst, ponderously slow.

Reith also frequently references in his autobiography departmental jealousies resulting from his ministerial activities, reported to him by colleagues such as Sir John Anderson, wartime Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Churchill coalition. Complaints to the latter from fellow ministers and MPs would appear to be the more likely cause of his fall. This came at a crucial stage in Reith&#x27;s career. After the outbreak of war, several major figures had told Reith that he would soon join the War Cabinet itself, not least Beaverbrook, one of the Prime Minister&#x27;s closest associates.

Reith&#x27;s animosity towards Churchill continued. When offered the post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (a position he had long coveted), he could not bring himself to accept it, noting in his diary: &quot;Invitation from that bloody shit Churchill to be Lord High Commissioner.&quot;

He took a naval commission as a lieutenant of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) on the staff of the Rear-Admiral Coastal Services. In 1943, he was promoted to captain (RNVR), and appointed Director of the Combined Operations Material Department at the Admiralty, a post he held until early 1945.

==Post-war==
In 1946, he was appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, a post he held until 1950. He was then appointed chairman of the Colonial Development Corporation which he held until 1959. In 1948, he was also appointed the chairman of the National Film Finance Corporation, an office he held until 1951.

The BBC&#x27;s Reith Lectures were instituted in 1948 in his honour. These annual radio talks, with the aim of advancing &quot;public understanding and debate about significant issues of contemporary interest&quot; have been held every year since, with the exception of 1992.

The Independent Television Authority was created on 30 July 1954 ending the BBC&#x27;s broadcasting monopoly. Lord Reith did not approve of its creation. Speaking at the Opposition despatch box in the House of Lords, he stated:
==Later years==
In 1960, Reith returned to the BBC for an interview with John Freeman in the television series &quot;Face to Face&quot;. When he visited the BBC to record the programme, work was being undertaken, and Reith noticed with dismay the &quot;girlie&quot; pin-ups of the workmen. However, one picture was of a Henry Moore sculpture. &quot;A Third Programme carpenter, forsooth,&quot; he growled.

In the interview, he expressed his disappointment at not being &quot;fully stretched&quot; in his life, especially after leaving the BBC. He claimed that he could have done more than Churchill gave him to do during the war. He also disclosed an abiding dissatisfaction with his life in general. He admitted not realising soon enough that &quot;life is for living,&quot; and suggested he perhaps still did not acknowledge that fact. He also stated that since his departure as Director-General, he had watched almost no television and listened to virtually no radio. &quot;When I leave a thing, I leave it,&quot; he said.

In his later years, he also held directorships at the Phoenix Assurance Company, Tube Investments Ltd, the State Building Society (1960–1964) and was the vice-chairman of the British Oxygen Company (1964–1966).

He took a personal interest in the preservation of the early 19th-century frigate HMS &quot;Unicorn&quot; in 1962.

Reith was appointed Lord Rector of Glasgow University from 1965 to 1968.

In 1967, he accepted the much-cherished post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. His final television appearance was in a three-part documentary series entitled &quot;Lord Reith Looks Back&quot; in 1967, filmed at Glasgow University.

He died in Stockbridge Edinburgh, Midlothian after a fall, at the age of 81. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were buried at the ancient, ruined chapel of Rothiemurchus in Aviemore, Inverness-shire.

===Biographical works===
Reith wrote two volumes of autobiography: &quot;Into The Wind&quot; in 1956 and &quot;Wearing Spurs&quot; in 1966. Two biographical volumes appeared shortly after his death: &quot;Only the Wind Will Listen&quot; by Andrew Boyle (1972), and a volume of his diaries edited by the Oxford academic Charles Stuart (1975). It was not until &quot;The Expense of Glory&quot; (1993) by Ian McIntyre that Reith&#x27;s unexpurgated diaries and letters were published.

===Attitude to fascism===
In 1975, excerpts from Reith&#x27;s diary were published which showed he had, during the 1930s, harboured pro-fascist views. On 9 March 1933, he wrote: &quot;I am pretty certain ... that the Nazis will clean things up and put Germany on the way to being a real power in Europe again. They are being ruthless and most determined.&quot; Following the July 1934 Night of the Long Knives, in which the Nazis ruthlessly exterminated their internal dissidents, Reith wrote: &quot;I really admire the way Hitler has cleaned up what looked like an incipient revolt. I really admire the drastic actions taken, which were obviously badly needed.&quot; After Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Nazis in 1939 he wrote: &quot;Hitler continues his magnificent efficiency.&quot;

Reith also expressed admiration for Benito Mussolini. Reith&#x27;s daughter, Marista Leishman, wrote that in the 1930s her father did everything possible to keep Winston Churchill and other anti-appeasement Conservatives off the airwaves.

==Personal life==
Aged 22, Reith met 15-year-old male Charlie Bowser. Reith had what has been variously described as &quot;a deep affection&quot; and &quot;love&quot; for Bowser. Opinions have varied on the nature of Reith&#x27;s relationship; in the view of both his biographer, and his daughter, it was homosexual. Reith all but severed it, burning the correspondence from Bowser, after he married his wife Muriel in 1921. They remained married until his death in 1971; and Reith recorded Bowser&#x27;s birthday in his diary for the rest of his life. He and Muriel had two children, Christopher (1926–2017) and Marista (1932–2019).

==In popular culture==
Reith was the protagonist of Jack Thorne&#x27;s 2023 play &quot;When Winston Went to War with the Wireless&quot;, played by Stephen Campbell Moore; Charlie Bowser was played by Luke Newberry and Muriel Reith by Mariam Haque.

He was commemorated in the Public Service Broadcasting album This New Noise, about the foundation of the BBC, with the song &quot;An Unusual Man&quot;.

<text>Yuppie, short for &quot;young urban professional&quot; or &quot;young upwardly-mobile professional&quot;, is a term coined in the early 1980s for a young professional person working in a city. The term is first attested in 1980, when it was used as a fairly neutral demographic label, but by the mid-to-late 1980s, when a &quot;yuppie backlash&quot; developed due to concerns over issues such as gentrification, some writers began using the term pejoratively.

==History==

The first printed appearance of the word was in a May 1980 &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine article by Dan Rottenberg. Rottenberg reported in 2015 that he did not invent the term, he had heard other people using it, and at the time he understood it as a rather neutral demographic term. Nonetheless, his article did note the issues of socioeconomic displacement which might occur as a result of the rise of this inner-city population cohort. 

The term gained currency in the United States in March 1983 when syndicated newspaper columnist Bob Greene published a story about a business networking group founded in 1982 by the former radical leader Jerry Rubin, formerly of the Youth International Party (whose members were called &quot;yippies&quot;); Greene said he had heard people at the networking group (which met at Studio 54 to soft classical music) joke that Rubin had &quot;gone from being a yippie to being a yuppie&quot;. The headline of Greene&#x27;s story was &quot;From Yippie to Yuppie&quot;. &quot;East Bay Express&quot; humorist Alice Kahn elaborated on the concept in a satirical piece published in June 1983, further popularizing the term.

The proliferation of the word was affected by the publication of &quot;The Yuppie Handbook&quot; in January 1983 (a tongue-in-cheek take on &quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot;), followed by Senator Gary Hart&#x27;s 1984 candidacy as a &quot;yuppie candidate&quot; for President of the United States. The term was then used to describe a political demographic group of socially liberal but fiscally conservative voters favoring his candidacy. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine declared 1984 &quot;The Year of the Yuppie&quot;, characterizing the salary range, occupations, and politics of &quot;yuppies&quot; as &quot;demographically hazy&quot;. The alternative acronym &quot;yumpie&quot;, for &quot;young upwardly mobile professional&quot;, was also current in the 1980s but failed to catch on.

In a 1985 issue of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Theressa Kersten at SRI International described a &quot;yuppie backlash&quot; by people who fit the demographic profile yet express resentment of the label: &quot;You&#x27;re talking about a class of people who put off having families so they can make payments on the SAABs ... To be a Yuppie is to be a loathsome undesirable creature&quot;. Leo Shapiro, a market researcher in Chicago, responded, &quot;Stereotyping always winds up being derogatory. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are trying to advertise to farmers, Hispanics or Yuppies, no one likes to be neatly lumped into some group.&quot;

In 1990, rock artist Tom Petty used the term in the song &quot;Yer So Bad&quot;, in the line &quot;My sister got lucky, married a yuppie&quot;.

The word lost most of its political connotations and, particularly after the 1987 stock market crash, gained the negative socio-economic connotations that it sports today. On April 8, 1991, &quot;Time&quot; magazine proclaimed the death of the &quot;yuppie&quot; in a mock obituary.
In 1989, MTV hosted the &quot;Foreclosure on a Yuppie&quot; contest to celebrate the end of the 1980s.

The term experienced a resurgence in usage during the 2000s and 2010s. In October 2000, David Brooks remarked in a &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; article that Benjamin Franklin – due to his extreme wealth, cosmopolitanism, and adventurous social life – is &quot;Our Founding Yuppie&quot;. A recent article in &quot;Details&quot; proclaimed &quot;The Return of the Yuppie&quot;, stating that &quot;the yuppie of 1986 and the yuppie of 2006 are so similar as to be indistinguishable&quot; and that &quot;the yup&quot; is &quot;a shape-shifter... he finds ways to reenter the American psyche.&quot; Despite the global financial crisis of the late 2000s, in 2010, political commentator Victor Davis Hanson wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; very critically of &quot;yuppies&quot;. However, following the Crash of 20 and the ongoing COVID recession they are believed to be gone once more.

Following the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2025, UnHerd explored the rise of Yuppiefuturism, an ideology that fused Yuppie aesthetics with MAGA politics and Silicon Valley techno-utopianism.

==Usage outside the United States==
&quot;Yuppie&quot; was in common use in Britain from the early 1980s onward (the premiership of Margaret Thatcher) and by 1987 had spawned subsidiary terms used in newspapers such as &quot;yuppiedom&quot;, &quot;yuppification&quot;, &quot;yuppify&quot; and &quot;yuppie-bashing&quot;.

A September 2010 article in &quot;The Standard&quot; described the items on a typical Hong Kong resident&#x27;s &quot;yuppie wish list&quot; based on a survey of 28- to 35-year-olds. About 58% wanted to own their own home, 40% wanted to professionally invest, and 28% wanted to become a boss. A September 2010 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; defined as a hallmark of Russian &quot;yuppie life&quot; the adoption of yoga and other elements of Indian culture such as their clothes, food, and furniture.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2000 American horror film &quot;American Psycho&quot;, the protagonist Patrick Bateman along with his work colleagues are all depicted as yuppies.

<text>Johan Anthoniszoon &quot;Jan&quot; van Riebeeck (21 April 1619 – 18 January 1677) was a Dutch navigator, ambassador and colonial administrator of the Dutch East India Company.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Jan van Riebeeck was born in Culemborg on 21 April 1619, as the son of a surgeon. He grew up in Schiedam, where he married a 19-year-old Maria de la Queillerie on 28 March 1649. She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35. The couple had eight or nine children, most of whom did not survive infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.

=== Employment in the VOC ===
Joining the &quot;Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie&quot; (VOC) (Dutch East India Company) in 1639, he served in a number of posts, including that of an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies.

He was head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Indochina. After being dismissed from that position in 1645 due to conducting trade for his own personal account, he began to advocate a refreshment station in the Cape of Good Hope after staying 18 days there during his return voyage. Two years later, support increased after a marooned VOC ship was able to survive in a temporary fortress. The Heeren XVII requested a report from Leendert Jansz and Mathys Proot, which recommended a Dutch presence.

In 1643, van Riebeeck travelled with Jan van Elseracq to the VOC outpost at Dejima in Japan. Seven years later in 1650, he proposed selling hides of South African wild animals to Japan.

Van Riebeeck was requested by the Dutch East India Company to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa and departed from Texel on 24 December 1651. He landed two ships (The &quot;Drommedaris&quot; and &quot;Goede Hoope&quot;) in Table Bay, at the future Cape Town site on 6 April 1652, and a third ship, the &quot;Reijger&quot;, on 7 April 1652. He was accompanied by 82 men and 8 women, including his wife Maria. The fleet originally included five ships, but the &quot;Walvis&quot; and the &quot;Oliphant&quot; arrived late, having had 130 burials at sea.

Van Riebeeck commenced immediately to fortify the settlement as a way station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The primary purpose of this way station was to provide fresh provisions for the VOC fleets sailing between the Dutch Republic and Batavia, as deaths en route were very high.

=== Commander of the Cape Colony ===
Van Riebeeck was Commander of the Cape from 1652 to 1662; he was charged with building a fort, with improving the natural anchorage at Table Bay, planting cereals, fruit, and vegetables, and obtaining livestock from the indigenous Khoi people. In the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town, a few wild almond trees still survive. The initial fort, named Fort de Goede Hoop (&#x27;Fort of Good Hope&#x27;) was made of mud, clay, and timber, and had four corners or bastions. This fort was replaced by the Castle of Good Hope, built between 1666 and 1679 after van Riebeeck had left the Cape.

Van Riebeeck was joined at the Cape by a fellow Culemborger Roelof de Man (1634–1663), who arrived in January 1654 on board the ship &quot;Naerden&quot;. Roelof came as the colony bookkeeper and was later promoted to second-in-charge.

Van Riebeeck reported the first comet discovered from South Africa, C/1652 Y1, which was spotted on 17 December 1652.

In his time at the Cape, van Riebeeck oversaw a sustained, systematic effort to establish an impressive range of useful plants in the novel conditions on the Cape Peninsula – in the process changing the natural environment forever. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples, and citrus, had an important and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region. For instance, in 1659, he established a vineyard in the Colony to produce red wine in order to combat scurvy. Van Riebeeck owned the farm, Boschheuwel, which he advised the Company to buy on his departure in 1662 to grow fruit and vegetables while Rondebosch could be used as a nursery for young plants. The daily diary entries kept throughout his time at the Cape (VOC policy) provided the basis for future exploration of the natural environment and its natural resources. Careful reading of his diaries indicates that some of his knowledge was learned from the indigenous peoples inhabiting the region.

He died in Batavia (now renamed to Jakarta) on Java on 18 January 1677.

== Legacy in South Africa ==
Jan van Riebeeck is of immense cultural and historical significance to South Africa, as he was in particular during the Apartheid era. Many Afrikaners view him as the founding father of their nation. Consequently, his image appeared ubiquitously on postage stamps and banknotes issued until 1994. An image used on currency notes after South Africa became a republic in 1961 was thought to be that of van Riebeeck, but was instead of Bartholomew Vermuyden.

Van Riebeeck&#x27;s Day, also known as Founders&#x27; Day, used to be celebrated on 6 April; but the holiday was cancelled by the African National Congress after the 1994 election. However, it is still celebrated in the community of Orania in South Africa (an Afrikaner-only enclave). His image no longer features on any official currency or stamps today, but statues of him and his wife remain in Adderley Street, Cape Town. The coat of arms of the city of Cape Town is based on the van Riebeeck family coat of arms.

Many South African towns and villages have streets named after him. Riebeek-Kasteel is one of the oldest towns in South Africa, situated 75 km from Cape Town in the Riebeek Valley together with its sister town Riebeek West.

Hoërskool Jan van Riebeeck is an Afrikaans high school in Cape Town.

<text>Frank Helmut Auerbach (29 April 1931 – 11 November 2024) was a German-born British painter. Born in Germany to Jewish parents, he became a naturalised British subject in 1947. He is considered one of the leading names in the School of London, with fellow artists Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, both of whom were early supporters of his work.

==Early life and education==
Auerbach was born on 29 April 1931 in Berlin, Germany, the son of Max Auerbach, a patent lawyer, and Charlotte Nora Borchardt, who had trained as an artist. With rising Nazi persecution of Jews such as themselves, his parents sent him to Britain in 1939, one of six such children sponsored by British writer Iris Origo. His parents stayed behind in Germany, and were murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942.

In Britain, Auerbach became a pupil at Bunce Court School, near Faversham in Kent, where he excelled in not only art but also drama classes. Indeed, he almost became an actor, even taking a small role in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s play &quot;House of Regrets&quot; at the Unity Theatre in St. Pancras, at the age of 17. But his interest in art proved a stronger draw and he began studying in London, first at St Martin&#x27;s School of Art from 1948 to 1952, and at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1955. Yet, perhaps the clearest influence on his art training came from a series of additional art classes he took at London&#x27;s Borough Polytechnic, where he and fellow St Martin&#x27;s student Leon Kossoff were taught by David Bomberg from 1947 until 1953.

==Career==
In 1955, he began teaching in secondary schools, but he quickly moved into the visiting tutor circuit at numerous art schools, including Bromley, Sidcup and the Slade School. In particular, he taught one day a week from 1958 to 1965 at Camberwell School of Art. He was the teacher, influence and sponsor of many artists, including Tom Philips, Jenny Saville, Cecily Brown, Peter Saunders and Ray Atkins. For instance, he wrote to Andrew Forge, senior lecturer at the Slade to say that there were some remarkable students that he might consider, particularly Ray Atkins and Jo Keys, obtaining a place for them there.

Auerbach&#x27;s first solo exhibition was at the Beaux Arts Gallery in London in 1956, followed by further solo shows there between 1959 and 1963. His work was featured at Marlborough Fine Art in London at regular intervals after 1965 as well as at the Marlborough Gallery in New York in 1969, 1982, 1994, 1998 and 2006. In 1978, he was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Hayward Gallery and was included in the exhibition &quot;A New Spirit in Painting&quot; at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1981. In 1986, he represented Britain in the Venice Biennale, sharing the Golden Lion with Sigmar Polke. Further exhibitions were featured at: the Yale Center for British Art in 1981, alongside Michael Andrews, Francis Bacon, William Coldstream, Lucian Freud, Patrick George, Leon Kossoff and Euan Uglow; the Kunstverein in 1986; the Van Gogh Museum in 1989; Marlborough Graphics in 1990; the Yale Center for British Art in 1991; the National Gallery in 1995; the Royal Academy of Arts in 2001.

From 2007 to 2008, Auerbach held a solo show entitled &quot;Frank Auerbach Etchings and Drypoints 1954–2006&quot; at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which toured to the Abbot Hall Art Gallery. In 2009, he had another solo show at the Courtauld Institute of Art. Auerbach was the subject of a television film entitled &quot;Frank Auerbach: To the Studio&quot;, directed by Hannah Rothschild and produced by Jake Auerbach (Jake Auerbach Films Ltd). This was first broadcast on the arts programme Omnibus on 10 November 2001.

London&#x27;s Tate Britain, in association with the Kunstmuseum Bonn, organised a major retrospective of Auerbach&#x27;s work in 2015 and 2016. The exhibit was curated by Catherine Lampert together with the artist. David Bowie owned Auerbach&#x27;s &quot;Head of Gerda Boehm&quot; as part of his private collection. After Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, this piece was among many put up for auction in November 2016, where it was sold for £3.8 million (US$4.7 million). In 2024, the exhibition &quot;Frank Auerbach. The Charcoal Heads&quot; at The Courtauld Gallery showcased a series of large-scale charcoal drawings by Auerbach, created in post-war London during the 1950s and early 1960s.

==Style and influences==

Auerbach was a figurative painter, who focused on portraits and city scenes in and around the area of London in which he lived, Camden Town. Although sometimes described as expressionistic, Auerbach was not an expressionist painter. His work is not concerned with finding a visual equivalent to an emotional or spiritual state that characterised the expressionist movement; rather, it deals with the attempt to resolve the experience of being in the world in paint. In this, the experience of the world is seen as essentially chaotic with the role of the artist being to impose an order upon that chaos and record that order in the painting. This ambition with the paintings resulted in Auerbach developing intense relationships with particular subjects, particularly the people he paints, but also the location of his cityscape subjects.

Speaking on this in 2001 he stated: &quot;If you pass something every day and it has a little character, it begins to intrigue you.&quot; This simple statement belies the intensity of the relationship that developed between Auerbach and his subjects, which resulted in an astonishing desire to produce an image the artist considered &#x27;right&#x27;. This led Auerbach to paint an image and then scrape it off the canvas at the end of each day, repeating this process time and again, not primarily to create a layering of images but because of a sense of dissatisfaction with the image leading him to try to paint it again.

This also indicates that the thick paint in Auerbach&#x27;s work, which led to some of his 1950s paintings being considered difficult to hang, partly due to their weight and according to some newspaper reports in case the paint fell off, is not primarily the result of building up a lot of paint over time. It was in fact applied in a very short space of time, and may well have been scraped off very soon after application. This technique was not always considered positively, with the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper commenting in 1956 that: &quot;The technique is so fantastically obtrusive that it is some time before one penetrates to the intentions that should justify this grotesque method.&quot; This intensity of approach and handling also did not always sit well with the art world that developed in Britain from the late 1980s onwards, with one critic at that time, Stuart Morgan, denouncing Auerbach for espousing &quot;conservatism as if it were a religion&quot; on the basis that he applied paint without a sense of irony.

As well as painting street scenes close to his London home, Auerbach tended to paint a small number of people repeatedly, including Estella Olive West (indicated in painting titles as EOW), Juliet Yardley Mills (or JYM) and Auerbach&#x27;s wife Julia Auerbach (née Wolstenholme). He painted art historian and curator Catherine Lampert regularly from 1978 – when she organised his retrospective at the Hayward Gallery – until his death.

A strong emphasis in Auerbach&#x27;s work is its relationship to the history of art. Showing at the National Gallery in London in 1994, he made direct reference to the gallery&#x27;s collection of paintings by Rembrandt, Titian and Rubens. Unlike the National Gallery&#x27;s Associate Artist Scheme, however, Auerbach&#x27;s work after historic artists was not the result of a short residency at the National Gallery; it has a long history, and in this exhibition he showed paintings made after Titian&#x27;s &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;, from the 1970s, to Rubens&#x27; &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, made in 1993. Auerbach&#x27;s personal history, and his painting style, mixed with another person and not with Auerbach&#x27;s consent, are part of the basis for the character &quot;Max Ferber&quot; in W. G. Sebald&#x27;s award-winning collection of narratives &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (1992 in Germany, 1996 in Britain). He is celebrated in his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; as a &quot;reclusive giant of modern art&quot;, though his son Jake sees his father&#x27;s reputation as a hermit as overstated, noting that he &quot;was, in fact, fun to be with&quot;, enjoyed theatre and cinema, &quot;loved pub quizzes and ... would join me and friends as a team member.&quot;

==Personal life ==
He met Julia Wolstenholme at the Royal College of Art; they were married from 1958 until her death in January 2024, though they separated for a dozen years in the 1960s and 1970s, later reconciling to form what their son called &quot;an unorthodox but reasonably functional family&quot;. In 1958, their only child, Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Auerbach, was born. A film director, he produced a documentary film, &quot;Frank: by Jake&quot;, in which Auerbach comments on his 60-year career and a video walkthrough of one of his shows.

His cousin is the German literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki.

Auerbach died in London on 11 November 2024, at the age of 93.

==Art market==
The highest price to date for one of Auerbach&#x27;s paintings was £5,565,200 ($7,079,855) for &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot; (1969) at Sotheby&#x27;s, London, on 27 June 2023.

<doc id="171317" wikidata="Q937912" url="?curid=171317" title="Countercurrent exchange">
<text>Countercurrent exchange is a mechanism between two flowing bodies flowing in opposite directions to each other, in which there is a transfer of some property, usually heat or some chemical. The flowing bodies can be liquids, gases, or even solid powders, or any combination of those. For example, in a distillation column, the vapors bubble up through the downward flowing liquid while exchanging both heat and mass. It occurs in nature and is mimicked in industry and engineering. It is a kind of exchange using counter flow arrangement.

The maximum amount of heat or mass transfer that can be obtained is higher with countercurrent than co-current (parallel) exchange because countercurrent maintains a slowly declining difference or gradient (usually temperature or concentration difference). In cocurrent exchange the initial gradient is higher but falls off quickly, leading to wasted potential. For example, in the adjacent diagram, the fluid being heated (exiting top) has a higher exiting temperature than the cooled fluid (exiting bottom) that was used for heating. With cocurrent or parallel exchange the heated and cooled fluids can only approach one another. The result is that countercurrent exchange can achieve a greater amount of heat or mass transfer than parallel under otherwise similar conditions.

Countercurrent exchange when set up in a circuit or loop can be used for building up concentrations, heat, or other properties of flowing liquids. Specifically when set up in a loop with a buffering liquid between the incoming and outgoing fluid running in a circuit, and with active transport pumps on the outgoing fluid&#x27;s tubes, the system is called a countercurrent multiplier, enabling a multiplied effect of many small pumps to gradually build up a large concentration in the buffer liquid.

Other countercurrent exchange circuits where the incoming and outgoing fluids touch each other are used for retaining a high concentration of a dissolved substance or for retaining heat, or for allowing the external buildup of the heat or concentration at one point in the system.

Countercurrent exchange circuits or loops are found extensively in nature, specifically in biologic systems. In vertebrates, they are called a rete mirabile, originally the name of an organ in fish gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. It is mimicked in industrial systems. Countercurrent exchange is a key concept in chemical engineering thermodynamics and manufacturing processes, for example in extracting sucrose from sugar beet roots.

Countercurrent multiplication is a similar but different concept where liquid moves in a loop followed by a long length of movement in opposite directions with an intermediate zone. The tube leading to the loop passively building up a gradient of heat (or cooling) or solvent concentration while the returning tube has a constant small pumping action all along it, so that a gradual intensification of the heat or concentration is created towards the loop. Countercurrent multiplication has been found in the kidneys as well as in many other biological organs.

== Three current exchange systems ==

Countercurrent exchange and cocurrent exchange are two mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them. The property transferred could be heat, concentration of a chemical substance, or other properties of the flow.

When heat is transferred, a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes, and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used.

=== Cocurrent flow—half transfer ===

In the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism, the two fluids flow in the same direction.

As the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed, a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger. With equal flows in the two tubes, this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other, no matter how long the exchanger is.

If each stream changes its property to be 50% closer to that of the opposite stream&#x27;s inlet condition, exchange will stop when the point of equilibrium is reached, and the gradient has declined to zero. In the case of unequal flows, the equilibrium condition will occur somewhat closer to the conditions of the stream with the higher flow.

====Cocurrent flow examples====

A cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism. Two tubes have a liquid flowing in the same direction. One starts off hot at , the second cold at . A thermoconductive membrane or an open section allows heat transfer between the two flows.

The hot fluid heats the cold one, and the cold fluid cools down the warm one. The result is thermal equilibrium: Both fluids end up at around the same temperature: , almost exactly between the two original temperatures ( and ). At the input end, there is a large temperature difference of and much heat transfer; at the output end, there is a very small temperature difference (both are at the same temperature of or close to it), and very little heat transfer if any at all. If the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes, no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes.

A similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange. The system consists of two tubes, one with brine (concentrated saltwater), the other with freshwater (which has a low concentration of salt in it), and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two, in an osmotic process. Many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine, while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows (since the salt is not leaving this flow, while water is). This will continue, until both flows reach a similar dilution, with a concentration somewhere close to midway between the two original dilutions. Once that happens, there will be no more flow between the two tubes, since both are at a similar dilution and there is no more osmotic pressure.

=== Countercurrent flow—almost full transfer ===

In countercurrent flow, the two flows move in opposite directions.

Two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions, transferring a property from one tube to the other. For example, this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one, or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow.

The counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact. With a sufficiently long length and a sufficiently low flow rate this can result in almost all of the property transferred. So, for example, in the case of heat exchange, the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid&#x27;s heat.

==== Countercurrent flow examples ====

In a countercurrent heat exchanger, the hot fluid becomes cold, and the cold fluid becomes hot.

In this example, hot water at enters the top pipe. It warms water in the bottom pipe which has been warmed up along the way, to almost . A minute but existing heat difference still exists, and a small amount of heat is transferred, so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to . Because the hot input is at its maximum temperature of , and the exiting water at the bottom pipe is nearly at that temperature but not quite, the water in the top pipe can warm the one in the bottom pipe to nearly its own temperature. At the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe, because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe, bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ().

The result is that the top pipe which received hot water, now has cold water leaving it at , while the bottom pipe which received cold water, is now emitting hot water at close to . In effect, most of the heat was transferred.

==== Conditions for higher transfer results ====
Nearly complete transfer in systems implementing countercurrent exchange, is only possible if the two flows are, in some sense, &quot;equal&quot;.

For a maximum transfer of substance concentration, an equal flowrate of solvents and solutions is required. For maximum heat transfer, the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream. If the two flows are not equal, for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa, then, similar to cocurrent exchange systems, a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly.

==Countercurrent exchange in biological systems==
Countercurrent exchange is used extensively in biological systems for a wide variety of purposes. For example, fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood, and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies. In vertebrates, this type of organ is referred to as a rete mirabile (originally the name of the organ in the fish gills). Mammalian kidneys use countercurrent exchange to remove water from urine so the body can retain water used to move the nitrogenous waste products (see countercurrent multiplier).

=== Countercurrent multiplication loop ===

A countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance. A buffer liquid between the incoming and outgoing tubes receives the concentrated substance. The incoming and outgoing tubes do not touch each other.

The system allows the buildup of a high concentration gradually, by allowing a natural buildup of concentration towards the tip inside the in-going tube, (for example using osmosis of water out of the input pipe and into the buffer fluid), and the use of many active transport pumps each pumping only against a very small gradient, during the exit from the loop, returning the concentration inside the output pipe to its original concentration.

The incoming flow starting at a low concentration has a semipermeable membrane with water passing to the buffer liquid via osmosis at a small gradient. There is a gradual buildup of concentration inside the loop until the loop tip where it reaches its maximum.

Theoretically a similar system could exist or be constructed for heat exchange.

In the example shown in the image, water enters at 299 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Water passes because of a small osmotic pressure to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 mg/L (NaCl / H2O). Further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer, gradually raising the concentration of NaCl in the tube until it reaches 1199 mg/L at the tip. The buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration, always a bit over the incoming fluid, in this example reaching 1200 mg/L. This is regulated by the pumping action on the returning tube as will be explained immediately.

The tip of the loop has the highest concentration of salt (NaCl) in the incoming tube—in the example 1199 mg/L, and in the buffer 1200 mg/L. The returning tube has active transport pumps, pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 mg/L more than in the tube. Thus when opposite the 1000 mg/L in the buffer liquid, the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 mg/L are needed to be pumped out. But the same is true anywhere along the line, so that at exit of the loop also only 200 mg/L need to be pumped.

In effect, this can be seen as a gradually multiplying effect—hence the name of the phenomena: a &#x27;countercurrent multiplier&#x27; or the mechanism: Countercurrent multiplication, but in current engineering terms, countercurrent multiplication is any process where only slight pumping is needed, due to the constant small difference of concentration or heat along the process, gradually raising to its maximum. There is no need for a buffer liquid, if the desired effect is receiving a high concentration at the output pipe.

==== In the kidney ====
A circuit of fluid in the loop of Henle—an important part of the kidneys—allows for gradual buildup of the concentration of urine in the kidneys, by using active transport on the exiting nephrons (tubules carrying liquid in the process of gradually concentrating the urea). The active transport pumps need only to overcome a constant and low gradient of concentration, because of the countercurrent multiplier mechanism.

Various substances are passed from the liquid entering the nephrons until exiting the loop (See the nephron flow diagram). The sequence of flow is as follows:
* Renal corpuscle: Liquid enters the nephron system at the Bowman&#x27;s capsule.
* Proximal convoluted tubule: It then may reabsorb urea in the thick descending limb. Water is removed from the nephrons by osmosis (and glucose and other ions are pumped out with active transport), gradually raising the concentration in the nephrons.
* Loop of Henle Descending: The liquid passes from the thin descending limb to the thick ascending limb. Water is constantly released via osmosis. Gradually there is a buildup of osmotic concentration, until 1200 mOsm is reached at the loop tip, but the difference across the membrane is kept small and constant.
:For example, the liquid at one section inside the thin descending limb is at 400 mOsm while outside it is 401. Further down the descending limb, the inside concentration is 500 while outside it is 501, so a constant difference of 1 mOsm is kept all across the membrane, although the concentration inside and outside are gradually increasing.
* Loop of Henle Ascending: after the tip (or &#x27;bend&#x27;) of the loop, the liquid flows in the &quot;thin&quot; ascending limb. Salt–sodium Na+ and chloride Cl− ions are pumped out of the liquid gradually lowering the concentration in the exiting liquid, but, using the countercurrent multiplier mechanism, always pumping against a constant and small osmotic difference.
:For example, the pumps at a section close to the bend, pump out from 1000 mOsm inside the ascending limb to 1200 mOsm outside it, with a 200 mOsm across. Pumps further up the thin ascending limb, pump out from 400 mOsm into liquid at 600 mOsm, so again the difference is retained at 200 mOsm from the inside to the outside, while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances.

:The liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mOsm when leaving the &quot;thin&quot; ascending limb and passing through the &quot;thick&quot; one
* Distal convoluted tubule: Once leaving the loop of Henle the thick ascending limb can optionally reabsorb and re increase the concentration in the nephrons.
* Collecting duct: The collecting duct receives liquid between 100 mOsm if no re-absorption is done, to 300 or above if re-absorption was used. The collecting duct may continue raising the concentration if required, by gradually pumping out the same ions as the Distal convoluted tubule, using the same gradient as the ascending limbs in the loop of Henle, and reaching the same concentration.
* Ureter: The liquid urine leaves to the ureter.

Initially the countercurrent exchange mechanism and its properties were proposed in 1951 by professor Werner Kuhn and two of his former students who called the mechanism found in the loop of Henle in mammalian kidneys a Countercurrent multiplier and confirmed by laboratory findings in 1958 by Professor Carl W. Gottschalk. The theory was acknowledged a year later after a meticulous study showed that there is almost no osmotic difference between liquids on both sides of nephrons. Homer Smith, a considerable contemporary authority on renal physiology, opposed the model countercurrent concentration for 8 years, until conceding ground in 1959. Ever since, many similar mechanisms have been found in biologic systems, the most notable of these: the rete mirabile in fish.

=== Countercurrent exchange of heat in organisms ===

In cold weather the blood flow to the limbs of birds and mammals is reduced on exposure to cold environmental conditions, and returned to the trunk via the deep veins which lie alongside the arteries (forming venae comitantes). This acts as a counter-current exchange system which short-circuits the warmth from the arterial blood directly into the venous blood returning into the trunk, causing minimal heat loss from the extremities in cold weather. The subcutaneous limb veins are tightly constricted, thereby reducing heat loss via this route, and forcing the blood returning from the extremities into the counter-current blood flow systems in the centers of the limbs. Birds and mammals that regularly immerse their limbs in cold or icy water have particularly well developed counter-current blood flow systems to their limbs, allowing prolonged exposure of the extremities to the cold without significant loss of body heat, even when the limbs are as thin as the lower legs, or tarsi, of a bird, for instance.

When animals like the leatherback turtle and dolphins are in colder water to which they are not acclimatized, they use this CCHE mechanism to prevent heat loss from their flippers, tail flukes, and dorsal fins. Such CCHE systems are made up of a complex network of peri-arterial venous plexuses, or venae comitantes, that run through the blubber from their minimally insulated limbs and thin streamlined protuberances. Each plexus consists of a central artery containing warm blood from the heart surrounded by a bundle of veins containing cool blood from the body surface. As these fluids flow past each other, they create a heat gradient in which heat is transferred and retained inside the body. The warm arterial blood transfers most of its heat to the cool venous blood now coming in from the outside. This conserves heat by recirculating it back to the body core. Since the arteries give up a good deal of their heat in this exchange, there is less heat lost through convection at the periphery surface.

Another example is found in the legs of an Arctic fox treading on snow. The paws are necessarily cold, but blood can circulate to bring nutrients to the paws without losing much heat from the body. Proximity of arteries and veins in the leg results in heat exchange, so that as the blood flows down it becomes cooler, and does not lose much heat to the snow. As the (cold) blood flows back up from the paws through the veins, it picks up heat from the blood flowing in the opposite direction, so that it returns to the torso in a warm state, allowing the fox to maintain a comfortable temperature, without losing it to the snow. This system is so efficient that the Arctic fox does not begin to shiver until the temperature drops to .

=== Countercurrent exchange in sea and desert birds to conserve water ===
Sea and desert birds have been found to have a salt gland near the nostrils which concentrates brine, later to be &quot;sneezed&quot; out to the sea, in effect allowing these birds to drink seawater without the need to find freshwater resources. It also enables the seabirds to remove the excess salt entering the body when eating, swimming or diving in the sea for food. The kidney cannot remove these quantities and concentrations of salt.

The salt secreting gland has been found in seabirds like pelicans, petrels, albatrosses, gulls, and terns. It has also been found in Namibian ostriches and other desert birds, where a buildup of salt concentration is due to dehydration and scarcity of drinking water.

In seabirds the salt gland is above the beak, leading to a main canal above the beak, and water is blown from two small nostrils on the beak, to empty it. The salt gland has two countercurrent mechanisms working in it:

a. A salt extraction system with a countercurrent multiplication mechanism, where salt is actively pumped from the blood &#x27;venules&#x27; (small veins) into the gland tubules. Although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood, the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange, so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal. Thus, all along the gland, there is only a small gradient to climb, in order to push the salt from the blood to the salty fluid with active transport powered by ATP.

b. The blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland&#x27;s blood, so that it does not leave back to the blood system.

The glands remove the salt efficiently and thus allow the birds to drink the salty water from their environment while they are hundreds of miles away from land.

== Countercurrent exchange in industry and scientific research ==

Countercurrent Chromatography is a method of separation, that is based on the differential partitioning of analytes between two immiscible liquids using countercurrent or cocurrent flow. Evolving from Craig&#x27;s Countercurrent Distribution (CCD), the most widely used term and abbreviation is CounterCurrent Chromatography (CCC), in particular when using hydrodynamic CCC instruments. The term partition chromatography is largely a synonymous and predominantly used for hydrostatic CCC instruments.
* Distillation of chemicals such as in petroleum refining is done in towers or columns with perforated trays. Vapor from the low boiling fractions bubbles upward through the holes in the trays in contact with the down flowing high boiling fractions. The concentration of low boiling fraction increases in each tray up the tower as it is &quot;stripped&quot;. The low boiling fraction is drawn off the top of the tower and the high boiling fraction drawn from the bottom. The process in the trays is a combination of heat transfer and mass transfer. Heat is supplied at the bottom, known as a &quot;reboiler&quot; and cooling is done with a condenser at the top.

* Liquid–liquid extraction (also called &#x27;solvent extraction&#x27; or &#x27;partitioning&#x27;) is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different &#x27;phase&#x27; (such as &quot;slurry&quot;). This method, which implements a countercurrent mechanism, is used in nuclear reprocessing, ore processing, the production of fine organic compounds, the processing of perfumes, the production of vegetable oils and biodiesel, and other industries.
* Gold can be separated from a cyanide solution with the Merrill–Crowe process using Counter Current Decantation (CCD). In some mines, nickel and cobalt are treated with CCD, after the original ore was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and steam in titanium covered autoclaves, producing nickel cobalt slurry. The nickel and cobalt in the slurry are removed from it almost completely using a CCD system exchanging the cobalt and nickel with flash steam heated water.
* Lime can be manufactured in countercurrent furnaces allowing the heat to reach high temperatures using low cost, low temperature burning fuel. Historically this was developed by the Japanese in certain types of the Anagama kiln. The kiln is built in stages, where fresh air coming to the fuel is passed downwards while the smoke and heat is pushed up and out. The heat does not leave the kiln, but is transferred back to the incoming air, and thus slowly builds up to and more.
* Cement may be created using a countercurrent kiln where the heat is passed in the cement and the exhaust combined, while the incoming air draft is passed along the two, absorbing the heat and retaining it inside the furnace, finally reaching high temperatures.
* Gasification: the process of creating methane and carbon monoxide from organic or fossil matter, can be done using a counter-current fixed bed (&quot;up draft&quot;) gasifier which is built in a similar way to the Anagama kiln, and must therefore withstand more harsh conditions, but reaches better efficiency.
* In nuclear power plants, water leaving the plant must not contain even trace particles of Uranium. Counter Current Decantation (CCD) is used in some facilities to extract water, totally clear of Uranium.

* Zippe-type centrifuges use countercurrent multiplication between rising and falling convection currents to reduce the number of stages needed in a cascade.
* Some Centrifugal extractors use counter current exchange mechanisms for extracting high rates of the desired material.
* Some protein skimmers (devices used to clean saltwater pools and fish ponds of organic matter) use counter current technologies.
* Countercurrent processes have also been used to study the behavior of small animals and isolate individuals with altered behaviors due to genetic mutations.

<doc id="171318" wikidata="Q1418635" url="?curid=171318" title="Warren Abstract Machine">
<text>In 1983, David H. D. Warren designed an abstract machine for the execution of Prolog consisting of a memory architecture and an instruction set. This design became known as the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) and has become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard target for Prolog compilers.

==Purpose==
The purpose of compiling Prolog code to the more low-level WAM code is to make subsequent interpretation of the Prolog program more efficient. Prolog code is reasonably easy to translate to WAM instructions, which can be more efficiently interpreted. Also, subsequent code improvements and compilations to native code are often easier to perform on the more low-level representation.

In order to write efficient Prolog programs, a basic understanding of how the WAM works can be advantageous. Some of the most important WAM concepts are first argument indexing and its relation to choice-points, tail call optimization, and memory reclamation on failure.

==Memory areas==
The WAM has the following memory areas:

* The &quot;global stack&quot; or &quot;heap&quot;, used to store compound terms
* The &quot;local stack&quot; for environment frames and choice-points
* The &quot;trail&quot; to record which variables bindings ought to be undone on backtracking

==Example==
Here is a piece of Prolog code:

 girl(sally).
 girl(jane).
 boy(B) :- \+ girl(B).

A WAM-based Prolog compiler will compile this into WAM instructions similar to the following:

 predicate(girl/1):
 switch_on_term(2,1,fail,fail,fail),
 label(1): switch_on_atom([(sally,3),(jane,5)])
 label(2): try_me_else(4)
 label(3): get_atom(sally,0)
 proceed
 label(4): trust_me_else_fail
 label(5): get_atom(jane,0)
 proceed
 predicate(boy/1):
 get_variable(x(1),0)
 put_structure(girl/1,0)
 unify_local_value(x(1))
 execute((\+)/1)])

An important characteristic of this code is its ability to cope with the various modes in which the predicates can be evoked: any argument might be a variable, a ground term, or a partly instantiated term. The &quot;switch&quot; instructions handle the different cases.

<text>Melrose Place is an American prime-time television soap opera that aired on Fox from July 8, 1992, to May 24, 1999, for seven seasons. The show follows the lives of a group of young adults living in an apartment complex in West Hollywood, California. The show was created by Darren Star for Fox and executive produced by Aaron Spelling for his company, Spelling Television. It was the second series in the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; franchise. Season one and season two were broadcast on Wednesday at 9 pm, after &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In 1994, for its third season and for the rest of its run, the show moved to Monday at 8 p.m.

The show had many cast changes during the run. Thomas Calabro and Heather Locklear were the only cast members to remain on the series for all seven seasons, with Calabro being the only cast member to remain on the series throughout its entire run from the pilot episode to the series finale.

The show earned several Golden Globe nominations and placed No. 51 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list.

&quot;Melrose Place&quot; premiered on Fox on July 8, 1992. The series follows the lives of a group of young adults living in an apartment complex at 4616 Melrose Place in West Hollywood, California.

&quot;Melrose Place&quot; ran for seven seasons, and its final episode aired on May 24, 1999.

== Episodes ==


== Cast and characters ==

The first season featured eight main characters: Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro), a physician who works at Wilshire Memorial Hospital and changes from a kind, devoted husband in season 1 to a mean, adulterous villain from season 2 on; Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett), his budding fashion designer wife; Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue), a struggling writer adapting to life out of his parents&#x27; control; Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith), a receptionist at D&amp;D Advertising; Jake Hanson (Grant Show), a struggling manual laborer and motorcycle enthusiast; Matt Fielding (Doug Savant), a gay social worker; Rhonda Blair (Vanessa A. Williams), an aerobics instructor; and Sandy Harling (Amy Locane), a Southern belle and struggling actress who moonlights as a waitress at a local bar called Shooters, the group&#x27;s main hangout. Locane was written off after 13 episodes and replaced by Daphne Zuniga as Jo Reynolds, a photographer running away from her abusive husband. Williams was not brought back for the second season, her character having become engaged to a wealthy restaurant entrepreneur.

Actress Heather Locklear, who in season one had guest starred as Alison&#x27;s ambitious and merciless boss Amanda Woodward, was promoted to series regular status in the second season after her character bought and moved into the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; apartment building. Although she was always billed as a &quot;special guest star&quot;, Locklear remained with the show for the rest of its run. Guest Laura Leighton, recurring as Jane&#x27;s trouble-making younger sister Sydney Andrews in the first two seasons, was upgraded to series regular for season three. Marcia Cross, recurring as Dr. Kimberly Shaw in season 1 and early season 2, became a series regular by the end of the second season (though she was not credited in the opening until the start of season four). Janet Carroll appeared in several episodes as Marion Shaw, Kimberly&#x27;s domineering mother. Beata Pozniak was featured in the second season in 7 episodes as Dr. Katya Petrova Fielding, a doctor with a daughter from a previous marriage who befriends and ultimately marries Matt (for a green card), who becomes an endearing father figure for her child.

Season four saw two new regular characters: Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), the ruthless hospital Chief of Staff introduced in season three; and Brooke Armstrong (Kristin Davis), a young, conniving intern at D&amp;D Advertising also recurring the previous season. Davis&#x27;s character was subsequently killed off in the middle of the fourth season, while Zuniga left the series at the end of the season. Patrick Muldoon also arrived in the third season as the villainous Richard Hart. Although Muldoon was not billed with the main cast (though he appeared in numerous promotional photos with them), he appeared in most of the fourth season&#x27;s episodes and is also &quot;Melrose Place&quot;″s longest recurring character (i.e. not in the opening credits) in terms of number of episodes.

The fifth season saw the addition of Rob Estes as restaurateur Kyle McBride, Lisa Rinna as his opportunistic wife Taylor, and Brooke Langton as Samantha Reilly, an artist and a new tenant in the apartment complex. Bissett and Cross left the series towards the end of the fifth season; Kelly Rutherford was brought in as Megan Lewis, a prostitute hired by Kimberly Shaw to have an affair with Michael Mancini, and David Charvet played Craig Field, Amanda&#x27;s new co-worker and later Sydney&#x27;s boyfriend. The season finale featured the exits of series regulars Thorne-Smith, Show, and Leighton.

The season premiere of season six featured the departure of original cast member Doug Savant while Alyssa Milano (recurring as Michael&#x27;s sister Jennifer Mancini since season five) was bumped to series regular, with Linden Ashby joining the cast as Dr. Brett Cooper and Jamie Luner as his seductive and rich ex-wife, Lexi Sterling.

Charvet was written out in the middle of season 6, and the beginning of season seven saw the departure of Shue, Langton, Rinna, Milano, and Ashby. The show&#x27;s seventh season introduced John Haymes Newton as Ryan McBride, Kyle&#x27;s younger brother, and Rena Sofer as Eve Cleary, a woman from Amanda&#x27;s past who marries Peter. Sofer was not billed with the main cast. Bissett reprised her role as Jane for the seventh season.

==Production==
Filming for the series took place at a studio in Santa Clarita, California. Stages were located 30 miles outside of Los Angeles. The scenes filmed outside reveal the original facade of the building at 4616 Greenwood Place in Los Angeles serving as the main backdrop for Melrose Place. The D&amp;D Advertising building is the same complex where the offices of Spelling Entertainment are located on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The production filmed episodes back-to-back, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1994. A dozen directors were employed during each season to direct the thirty episodes. Charles Correll is by far the main director of the series with 47 episodes to his credit over the entire production period, far ahead of the 27 episodes directed by Chip Chalmers.

In 1997, the filming of the sixth season was brought forward by two weeks because of Heather Locklear&#x27;s pregnancy, which was not included in the story. A body liner was used for around ten shots. The actress also doubled her filming time and her screen time was reduced to finish filming in mid-September 1997.
Lisa Rinna (Taylor) was also pregnant during filming at the end of the sixth season. However, her pregnancy was integrated into the plot. This was also the case for the pregnancy of Josie Bissett (Jane) during the seventh season. Estes and Bissett welcomed their first child, son Mason True, on July 21, 1999.

==Nielsen ratings==
&quot;Melrose Place&quot; debuted on July 8, 1992, at No. 19 on the Nielsen ratings with a 10.3/19 share and 16 million viewers. In December 1993, Meredith Berkman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the show &quot;arguably the hottest one-hour drama on television.&quot; Though ratings dropped slightly over the first season, the addition of Heather Locklear as Amanda is credited for improving ratings and bringing the show from No. 94 to No. 50 in the second season.

The series finale was watched by 10.38 million viewers.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Melrose Place&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. As of September 2014, season 1 has a critics&#x27; rating of 4.7/10 at Metacritic. One of the critics, &quot;Time&quot; Richard Zoglin, who gave the season a 2.0/10 score, wrote that the soap is &quot;tapping into nothing more than worn plot lines from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;&quot;. Conversely, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the first season a B− rating, writing: &quot;Hey, I make fun of Melrose Place — but I&#x27;m hypnotized by it. As warm-weather escapism, it takes all the issues facing this country, from unemployment to sexual harassment, and turns them into crises that can be solved in an hour.&quot; During the second season, David Wild of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;After debuting in 1992 with a troubled first season that at times rivaled that of the 1962 New York Mets, &quot;Melrose Place&quot; made a few key trades. The show acquired a journeywoman heavy hitter in the lovely form of Locklear and wisely swapped bothersome Issues and Morals for infinitely more palatable Sex and Villains, emerging as a big winner, particularly with that attractive twentysomething demographic.&quot; The third season received positive reviews from critics: &quot;After a couple lukewarm yet entertaining seasons, &quot;Melrose Place&quot; exploded in season three with the over-the-top, addictive storylines. Remember the crazy Kimberly-Michael-Sydney drama? And then Kimberly tried to keep Jo&#x27;s baby! Really, this is daytime-soap-drama, heated up for primetime.&quot; In 1997, Mark Harris, who gave the soap&#x27;s sixth season a D rating, stated: &quot;Although the ever-game, deserves-better Heather Locklear still spits out even the worst lines with snappish authority, and the diabolical-doctor duo of Jack Wagner and Thomas Calabro at least try to look interested, they can&#x27;t sustain a show that has lost its best asset — a twisted joy in its own trashiness.&quot;

===Accolades===
The series won the People&#x27;s Choice Award in 1993 for &#x27;Favorite New TV Dramatic Series&#x27;.

Heather Locklear was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama for her role as Amanda Woodward on Melrose Place, in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996. Laura Leighton was nominated in 1995 for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series for her role as Sydney Andrews.

In May 1994, at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, the female stars, Heather Locklear, Laura Leighton, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Daphne Zuniga and Josie Bissett, were featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

TV Guide ranked Amanda Woodward at No. 2 in the short list of &quot;The Biggest TV Bitches&quot;, only behind Joan Collins&#x27; iconic Alexis Carrington Colby, with whom Locklear co-starred on &quot;Dynasty&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Heather Locklear said about playing her: &quot;Not trying to be a bitch. Just trying to be strong and do what you are supposed to do&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reunited &quot;Melrose&quot; favorites Heather Locklear, Marcia Cross, Laura Leighton, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Josie Bissett, Daphne Zuniga, Andrew Shue, Grant Show and Doug Savant, and they appeared on the cover.

==Spin-offs and other media==

The original series produced a spin-off series, &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, which ran for one season in 1994–95. That series focused on a Los Angeles modeling agency run by Hillary Michaels (played by Linda Gray), the mother of &quot;Melrose&quot;″s Amanda Woodward; the show was cancelled after a single season due to low ratings.

A continuation of the series, also called &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, premiered on September 8, 2009, on The CW Television Network. The new series featured primarily a new cast, although five actors from the original series made appearances: Thomas Calabro, Laura Leighton, Josie Bissett, Daphne Zuniga and Heather Locklear. The revival series suffered from low ratings and negative reviews, and was cancelled in 2010 after one season.

In April 2024, another revival of the series was announced to be in development at CBS Studios, to be written by Lauren Gussis and with Locklear, Leighton and Zuniga attached to reprise their roles from the original series.

=== Unauthorized story ===
On October 10, 2015, a television movie called &quot;The Unauthorized Melrose Place Story&quot; was released. It tells the behind-the-scenes making-of story of the show, finishing with the filming of the season three finale.

==Lawsuit==
In 1996, actress Hunter Tylo was cast in &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and opted to leave daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; to take the role. However, she was fired by &quot;Melrose Place&quot; producer Aaron Spelling prior to filming any episodes for the series, when she announced she was pregnant. The character she was to play, Taylor McBride, was recast, Lisa Rinna taking the role. Tylo quickly returned to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Tylo sued Spelling on grounds of discrimination for being pregnant and won $4.8 million from a Los Angeles jury. Spelling argued that Tylo&#x27;s pregnancy rendered her unable to play the character, who was supposed to be a sexy seductress. During the trial, Tylo published pictures of herself while pregnant which showed that she retained a slim figure. Prior to trial, during the discovery phase of the litigation, Tylo&#x27;s lawyers won a partial victory in an interlocutory appeal challenging a lower court&#x27;s order compelling her to answer a broad range of personal questions. The Court of Appeal established Tylo&#x27;s right to refuse to answer questions in her deposition about marital problems and psychological treatment, although the Court sustained the portion of the order which compelled her to answer questions about her efforts to become pregnant, her husband&#x27;s ability or inability to impregnate her, and communications with her agent with respect to her efforts and ability to become pregnant. The case is widely recognized as an important one in establishing the right of privacy in deposition and the right of female actors to continue to work while pregnant.

==Home media==
CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) have released all seasons of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

The series has also been released on DVD in Region 2 and 4 by Paramount Home Entertainment.

Due to music licensing issues, most of the original music has been replaced on these DVD releases, and some episodes are edited from their original broadcast versions.

The soundtrack &quot;Melrose Place&quot; containing 11 tracks was released in 1994 on Giant records; in 1998 &quot;Melrose Place Jazz&quot; containing 16 tracks was released by Windham Hill Jazz.

The series is rated in Australia and in New Zealand for its sex scenes and offensive language.

==GALA Committee==
A group of artists and &quot;Melrose Place&quot; producers formed the GALA Committee, headed by artist Mel Chin, to bring artworks out of galleries and into primetime television. GALA artists designed artworks that were used as props by &quot;Melrose Place&quot; characters in the fourth and fifth seasons, often with hidden political messages:
*When Alison is pregnant, her quilt is decorated with the molecular structure of RU-486.
*A bag of Chinese take-out food is emblazoned with two opposing ideograms translated from Chinese as &quot;Human Rights&quot; and &quot;Turmoil&quot;; both terms were used by the Chinese government to justify a restriction on student protesters of June 4, 1989.
*Bottles behind the counter at Shooters bar are decorated with ads and documents chronicling the history of alcohol.
*As Alison quits D&amp;D Advertising, a framed ad in the background features a bombed-out building (the result of the Oklahoma City bombing). The damage to the structure is in the shape of a liquor bottle, and the words &quot;Total Proof&quot; appear on the poster.

Chin compared the works to viruses, symbiotic and invisible. The project was called &quot;In the Name of the Place&quot;, as part of the &quot;Uncommon Sense&quot; art show at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles, California in 1997. A portion of the fifth season was filmed at the Geffen Contemporary where the project was displayed. The artwork was also shown at the 1997 Kwangju Biennale in Kwangju, Korea and at Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri in 1998. Sotheby&#x27;s Auction house auctioned almost fifty of these artworks for charity.

<text>The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon where people adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes simply because others are doing so. More specifically, it is a cognitive bias by which public opinion or behaviours can alter due to particular actions and beliefs rallying amongst the public. It is a psychological phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion of others who have already done so. As more people come to believe in something, others also &quot;hop on the bandwagon&quot; regardless of the underlying evidence.

Following others&#x27; actions or beliefs can occur because of conformism or deriving information from others. Much of the influence of the bandwagon effect comes from the desire to &#x27;fit in&#x27; with peers; by making similar selections as other people, this is seen as a way to gain access to a particular social group. An example of this is fashion trends wherein the increasing popularity of a certain garment or style encourages more acceptance. When individuals make rational choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that information cascades can quickly form in which people ignore their personal information signals and follow the behaviour of others. Cascades explain why behaviour is fragile as people understand that their behaviour is based on a very limited amount of information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. The phenomenon is observed in various fields, such as economics, political science, medicine, and psychology. In social psychology, people&#x27;s tendency to align their beliefs and behaviors with a group is known as &#x27;herd mentality&#x27; or &#x27;groupthink&#x27;. The reverse bandwagon effect (also known as the snob effect in certain contexts) is a cognitive bias that causes people to avoid doing something, because they believe that other people are doing it.

==Origin==

The phenomenon where ideas become adopted as a result of their popularity has been apparent for some time. However, the metaphorical use of the term &quot;bandwagon&quot; in reference to this phenomenon began in 1848. A literal &quot;bandwagon&quot; is a wagon that carries a musical ensemble, or band, during a parade, circus, or other entertainment event.

The phrase &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot; first appeared in American politics in 1848 during the presidential campaign of Zachary Taylor. Dan Rice, a famous and popular circus clown of the time, invited Taylor to join his circus bandwagon. As Taylor gained more recognition and his campaign became more successful, people began saying that Taylor&#x27;s political opponents ought to &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot; themselves if they wanted to be associated with such success.

Later, during the time of William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s 1900 presidential campaign, bandwagons had become standard in campaigns, and the phrase &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot; was used as a derogatory term, implying that people were associating themselves with success without considering that with which they associated themselves.

Despite its emergence in the late 19th century, it was only rather recently that the theoretical background of bandwagon effects has been understood. One of the best-known experiments on the topic is the 1950s&#x27; Asch conformity experiment, which illustrates the individual variation in the bandwagon effect. Academic study of the bandwagon effect especially gained interest in the 1980s, as scholars studied the effect of public opinion polls on voter opinions.

== Causes and factors ==
Individuals are highly influenced by the pressure and norms exerted by groups. As an idea or belief increases in popularity, people are more likely to adopt it; when seemingly everyone is doing something, there is an incredible pressure to conform. Individuals&#x27; impressions of public opinion or preference can originate from several sources.

Some individual reasons behind the bandwagon effect include:

* Efficiency — Bandwagoning serves as a mental shortcut, or heuristic, allowing for decisions to be made quickly. It takes time for an individual to evaluate a behaviour or thought and decide upon it.
* Normative social influence (belonging) — People have the tendency to conform with others out of a desire to fit in with the crowd and gain approval from others. As conformity ensures some level of social inclusion and acceptance, many people go along with the behaviours and/or ideas of their group in order to avoid being the odd one out. The &#x27;spiral of silence&#x27; exemplifies this factor.
* Informational social influence — People tend to conform with others out of a desire to be right, under the assumption that others may know something or may understand the situation better. In other words, people will support popular beliefs because they are seen as correct by the larger social group (the &#x27;majority&#x27;). Moreover, when it seems as though the majority is doing a certain thing, &quot;not&quot; doing that thing becomes increasingly difficult. When individuals make rational choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that information cascades can quickly form in which people decide to ignore their personal information signals and follow the behaviour of others.
* Fear of missing out — People who are anxious about &#x27;missing out&#x27; on things that others are doing may be susceptible to the bandwagon effect.
* Being on the &#x27;winning side&#x27; — The desire to support a &quot;winner&quot; (or avoid supporting a &quot;loser&quot;) can be what makes some susceptible to the bandwagon effect, such as in the case of voting for a candidate because they&#x27;re in the lead.

 In politics, bandwagon effects can also come as result of indirect processes that are mediated by political actors. Perceptions of popular support may affect the choice of activists about which parties or candidates to support by donations or voluntary work in campaigns.

=== Spread ===
The bandwagon effect works through a self-reinforcing mechanism, and can spread quickly and on a large-scale through a positive feedback loop, whereby the more who are affected by it, the more likely other people are to be affected by it too.

A new concept that is originally promoted by only a single advocate or a minimal group of advocates can quickly grow and become widely popular, even when sufficient supporting evidence is lacking. What happens is that a new concept gains a small following, which grows until it reaches a critical mass, until for example it begins being covered by mainstream media, at which point a large-scale bandwagon effect begins, which causes more people to support this concept, in increasingly large numbers. This can be seen as a result of the availability cascade, a self-reinforcing process through which a certain belief gains increasing prominence in public discourse.

== Real-world examples ==

===In politics===
The bandwagon effect can take place in voting: it occurs on an individual scale where a voters opinion on vote preference can be altered due to the rising popularity of a candidate or a policy position. The aim for the change in preference is for the voter to end up picking the &quot;winner&#x27;s side&quot; in the end. Voters are more so persuaded to do so in elections that are non-private or when the vote is highly publicised.

The bandwagon effect has been applied to situations involving majority opinion, such as political outcomes, where people alter their opinions to the majority view. Such a shift in opinion can occur because individuals from the decisions of others, as in an informational cascade.

Perceptions of popular support may affect the choice of activists about which parties or candidates to support by donations or voluntary work in campaigns. They may strategically funnel these resources to contenders perceived as well supported and thus electorally viable, thereby enabling them to run more powerful, and thus more influential campaigns.

===In economics===
American economist Gary Becker has argued that the bandwagon effect is powerful enough to flip the demand curve to be upward sloping. A typical demand curve is downward sloping—as prices rise, demand falls. However, according to Becker, an upward sloping would imply that even as prices rise, the demand rises.

====Financial markets====
The bandwagon effect comes about in two ways in financial markets.

First, through price bubbles: these bubbles often happen in financial markets in which the price for a particularly popular security keeps on rising. This occurs when many investors line up to buy a security bidding up the price, which in return attracts more investors. The price can rise beyond a certain point, causing the security to be highly overvalued.

Second is liquidity holes: when unexpected news or events occur, market participants will typically stop trading activity until the situation becomes clear. This reduces the number of buyers and sellers in the market, causing liquidity to decrease significantly. The lack of liquidity leaves price discovery distorted and causes massive shifts in asset prices, which can lead to increased panic, which further increases uncertainty, and the cycle continues.

====Microeconomics====

In microeconomics, bandwagon effects may play out in interactions of demand and preference. The bandwagon effect arises when people&#x27;s preference for a commodity increases as the number of people buying it increases. Consumers may choose their product based on others&#x27; preferences believing that it is the superior product. This selection choice can be a result of directly observing the purchase choice of others or by observing the scarcity of a product compared to its competition as a result of the choice previous consumers have made. This scenario can also be seen in restaurants where the number of customers in a restaurant can persuade potential diners to eat there based on the perception that the food must be better than the competition due to its popularity. This interaction potentially disturbs the normal results of the theory of supply and demand, which assumes that consumers make buying decisions exclusively based on price and their own personal preference.

=== In medicine ===
Decisions made by medical professionals can also be influenced by the bandwagon effect. Particularly, the widespread use and support of now-disproven medical procedures throughout history can be attributed to their popularity at the time. Layton F. Rikkers (2002), professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, calls these prevailing practices medical bandwagons, which he defines as &quot;the overwhelming acceptance of unproved but popular [medical] ideas.&quot;

Medical bandwagons have led to inappropriate therapies for numerous patients, and have impeded the development of more appropriate treatment.

One paper from 1979 on the topic of bandwagons of medicine describes how a new medical concept or treatment can gain momentum and become mainstream, as a result of a large-scale bandwagon effect:

* The news media finds out about a new treatment and publicizes it, often by publishing pieces.
* Various organizations, such as government agencies, research foundations, and private companies also promote the new treatment, typically because they have some vested interest in seeing it succeed.
* The public picks up on the now-publicized treatment, and pressures medical practitioners to adopt it, especially when that treatment is perceived as being novel.
* Doctors often want to accept the new treatment, because it offers a compelling solution to a difficult issue.
* Since doctors have to consume large amounts of medical information in order to stay aware of the latest trends in their field, it is sometimes difficult for them to read new material in a sufficiently critical manner.

=== In sports ===

One who supports a particular sports team, despite having shown no interest in that team until it started gaining success, can be considered a &quot;bandwagon fan&quot;.

=== In social networking ===

As an increasing number of people begin to use a specific social networking site or application, people are more likely to begin using those sites or applications. The bandwagon effect also 

This research used bandwagon effects to examine the comparative impact of two separate bandwagon heuristic indicators (quantitative vs. qualitative) on changes in news readers&#x27; attitudes in an online comments section. Furthermore, Study 1 demonstrated that qualitative signals had a higher influence on news readers&#x27; judgments than quantitative clues. Additionally, Study 2 confirmed the results of Study 1 and showed that people&#x27;s attitudes are influenced by apparent public opinion, offering concrete proof of the influence that digital bandwagons.

=== In fashion ===
The bandwagon effect can also affect the way the masses dress and can be responsible for clothing trends. People tend to want to dress in a manner that suits the current trend and will be influenced by those who they see often – normally celebrities. Such publicised figures will normally act as the catalyst for the style of the current period. Once a small group of consumers attempt to emulate a particular celebrity&#x27;s dress choice more people tend to copy the style due to the pressure or want to fit in and be liked by their peers.
