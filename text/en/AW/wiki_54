==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 1993 by worldwide gross are as follows:
==Events==
* January 1 – China Film Import &amp; Export Corporation ends its 40-year monopoly distributing all films in China, with 16 other Chinese film studios now responsible for distributing their own films.
* January 29 – &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; opens in the United Kingdom setting an opening weekend record of £2,633,635 million.
* March 31 – actor Brandon Lee is accidentally killed during the filming of &quot;The Crow&quot;.
* May 27 – actress Kim Basinger files for bankruptcy after a California judge initially orders her to pay $8.9 million for refusing to honor a verbal contract to star in the film &quot;Boxing Helena&quot;. As a result, Basinger loses the town that she purchased in 1989, Braselton, Georgia, to her partner in the deal, the pension fund of Chicago-based Ameritech.
* May 28 – Produced by Hollywood Pictures, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; opens, marking the first video game film released, starring Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi. The film would unfortunately end up grossing only $20.9 million domestically and receive negative reviews from critics.
* June 11 – The filmed version of Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, a dinosaur epic with groundbreaking special effects directed by Steven Spielberg, breaks box-office records with a record $50 million opening weekend and goes on to become the highest-grossing film ever made with a worldwide gross of over $900 million.

** &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; is released by Walt Disney Pictures. While the film upon its original release, received mixed reviews from critics and is initially a box-office bomb, the film would eventually be rediscovered by audiences through frequent television airings on Disney Channel and Freeform and home video sales during the Halloween season and is now considered a cult classic.
* October 31 – actor River Phoenix accidentally dies of an overdose during the filming of &quot;Dark Blood&quot;. The film was later completed and released in 2012.

<text>Yosef Yitzchak (Joseph Isaac) Schneersohn (; 21 June 1880 – 28 January 1950) was an Orthodox rabbi and the sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement. He is also known as the Frierdiker Rebbe (Yiddish for &quot;Previous Rebbe&quot;), the Rebbe RaYYaTz, or the Rebbe Rayatz (an acronym for Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak). After many years of fighting to keep Orthodox Judaism alive from within the Soviet Union, he was forced to leave; he continued to conduct the struggle from Latvia, and then Poland, and eventually the United States, where he spent the last ten years of his life.

== Early life ==
Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn was born in Lyubavichi, Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day Smolensk Oblast, Russia), the only son of Sholom Dovber Schneersohn (the &quot;Rebbe Rashab&quot;), the fifth Rebbe of Chabad. He was appointed as his father&#x27;s personal secretary at the age of 15; in that year, he represented his father in the conference of communal leaders in Kovno. The following year (1896), he participated in the Vilna Conference, where rabbis and community leaders discussed issues such as: genuine Jewish education; permission for Jewish children not to attend public school on Shabbat; and the creation of a united Jewish organization for the purpose of strengthening Judaism. He participated in this conference again in 1908.

On 13 Elul 5657 (1897), at the age of 17, he married his second cousin, Nechama Dina Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Chișinău, son of Rabbi Yisroel Noach of Nizhyn, son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the Tzemach Tzedek.

In 1898, he was appointed head of the Tomchei Temimim yeshiva network.

In 1901, with financial support from Yaakov and Eliezer Poliakoff he opened spinning and weaving mills in Dubrovno and Mahilyow and established a yeshiva in Bukhara.

As he matured, he campaigned for the rights of Jews by appearing before the Czarist authorities in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 he sought relief for Jewish conscripts in the Russian army by sending them kosher food and supplies in the Russian Far East. In 1905, he participated in organizing a fund to provide Passover needs for troops in the Far East.

With rising antisemitism and pogroms against Jews, in 1906 he traveled with other prominent rabbis to seek help from Western European governments, especially Germany and the Netherlands, and persuaded bankers there to use their influence to stop pogroms.

He was arrested four times between 1902 and 1911 by the Czarist police because of his activism, but was released each time.

Upon the death of his father, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn (&quot;Rashab&quot;), in 1920, Schneerson became the sixth Rebbe of Chabad.

== Battling the Bolsheviks ==
Following the takeover of Russia by the Communists they created a special &quot;Jewish affairs section&quot; run by Jews, known as the &quot;Yevsektsiya&quot;, which instigated anti-religious activities meant to strip Orthodox Jews of their religious way of life. As rebbe of a Russia-based Jewish movement, Schneersohn was vehemently outspoken against the state atheism of the Communist regime and its goal of forcibly eradicating religion throughout the land. He purposely directed his followers to set up religious schools, going against the dictates of the Marxist-Leninist &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.

In 1921, he established a branch of Tomchei Temimim in Warsaw.

In 1924, he was forced by the Cheka (Russian secret police) to leave Rostov due to the Yevsektsiya&#x27;s slander, and settled in Leningrad. In this time he labored to strengthen Torah observance through activities involving rabbis, Torah schools for children, yeshivot, shochtim, senior Torah-instructors and the opening of mikva&#x27;ot; he established a special committee to help manual workers be able to observe Shabbat. He established Agudas Chasidei Chabad in USA and Canada.

In 1927, he established a number of yeshivot in Bukhara.

He was primarily responsible for the maintenance of the now-clandestine Chabad yeshiva system, which had ten branches throughout Russia by this time. He was under continual surveillance by agents of the NKVD.

=== Imprisonment and release ===

In 1927, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Shpalerna or Shpalerka Prison (latter known as Bolshoy Dom) in Leningrad. He was accused of counter-revolutionary activities, and sentenced to death. A worldwide storm of outrage and pressure from Western governments and the International Red Cross forced the communist regime to commute the death sentence and instead on 3 Tammuz it banished him to Kostroma for an original sentence of three years. Yekaterina Peshkova, a prominent Russian human rights activist, helped from inside as well. This was also commuted following political pressure from the outside, and in July 1927, he was finally allowed to leave Russia for Riga in Latvia, where he lived until 1929 before traveling to Mandatory Palestine (now Israel).

Yosef Yitzchak&#x27;s release from Soviet imprisonment is celebrated each year by the Chabad community.

After his release, Yosef Yitzchak went to Mandatory Palestine where he saw holy gravesites, local yeshivas and Torah centers, and met with rabbis and community leaders from 7–22 August 1929. He visited Hebron ten days before the massacre and, according to Chabad accounts, was the first Jew for many years to be allowed into the Cave of the Patriarchs. Little information is available about the effect his visit had on the attitude of the local Arabs.

== 1929: First visit to the United States ==

Following his trip to the Holy Land, he turned his attention to the United States, arriving in Manhattan on 17 September 1929 (12 Elul 5689) on the French passenger liner France. Schneersohn was greeted by some 600 people, with security provided by over 100 New York City police officers. &quot;May the Almighty bless this great country that has been a refuge for our Jewish people,&quot; he said at his arrival. The purpose of his visit was to assess the educational and religious state of American Jewry, and raise awareness of the plight of Soviet Jews. Hailed as &quot;one of the greatest Jews of our age,&quot; he was honored at a 28 October banquet in Manhattan by Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders.

While in the United States, Schneersohn also traveled (among places other than New York) to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Detroit, Boston, and Chicago. On 10 July, he met President Herbert Hoover at the White House. As the Republican presidential candidate, Hoover had lobbied for his release. Lubavitch followers in America begged their Rebbe to leave Russia and stay in America, but Schneersohn declined, saying that America was an irreligious place where even rabbis shaved off their beards. He left the United States to return to Riga, Latvia, on 17 July 1930.

From 1934 until the early part of World War II, he lived in Warsaw, Poland.

== 1940: Settling in the United States ==
Following Nazi Germany&#x27;s attack against Poland in 1939, Schneersohn refused to leave Warsaw. The government of the United States of America, which was still neutral, used its diplomatic relations to convince Nazi Germany to rescue Schneersohn from the war zone in German-occupied Poland. He remained in the city during the bombardments and its capitulation to Nazi Germany. He gave the full support of his organizations to assist as many Jews as possible to flee the invading armies. With the intercession of the United States Department of State in Washington, DC and with the lobbying of many Jewish leaders, such as Jacob Rutstein, on behalf of the Rebbe (and, reputedly, also with the help of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr), he was finally granted diplomatic immunity and given safe passage to go via Berlin to Riga, Latvia, where the Rebbe was a citizen and which was still free. From Riga, the Rebbe left for America by way of Sweden with his wife, his mother Shterna Sarah, Shemaryahu Gurary, his wife Chana and son Berka, Chaim Mordechai Aizik Hodakov and his wife, and Nissan Mindel. They traveled in a small plane to Sweden since boats were no longer permitted out of Riga, landing in Stockholm, and then took a boat to Gothenburg. There, they boarded the &quot;Drottningholm&quot; which sailed to America, arriving in New York City on 19 March 1940, and where they stayed at Manhattan’s Greystone Hotel. Major , a decorated German army officer of Jewish descent, was put in command of a group which included Sgt. Klaus Schenk, a half-Jew and Pvt. Johannes Hamburger, a quarter-Jew assigned to locate the Rebbe in Poland and escort him safely to freedom. They wound up saving not only the Rebbe, but also over a dozen Hasidic Jews in the Rebbe&#x27;s family or associated with him.

Working with the government and the contacts Schneersohn had with the US State Department, Chabad was able to save his son-in-law (and future successor) Menachem Mendel Schneerson from Vichy France in 1941 before the borders were closed down.
When Schneersohn came to America (he was the first major Chasidic leader to move permanently to the United States) two of his chassidim came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because &quot;America is different.&quot; To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, &quot;Out of my eyes came boiling tears&quot;, and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that &quot;America is no different.&quot; In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen.

Following Schneerson&#x27;s escape from Nazi occupied Poland and his settlement in New York City, he issued a call for repentance, stating &quot;L&#x27;alter l&#x27;tshuva, l&#x27;alter l&#x27;geula&quot; (&quot;speedy repentance brings a speedy redemption&quot;). This campaign was opposed by rabbis Avraham Kalmanowitz and Aaron Kotler of the &quot;Vaad Hatzalah&quot;. In return, Schneersohn was critical of the efforts of rabbis Kalmanowitz and Kotler based on the suspicion that Kalmanowitz and Kotler were discriminating in their use of funds, placing their yeshivas before all else, and that the Mizrachi and Agudas Harabonim withdrew their support of the Vaad after they discovered this fact.

== Launch of Lubavitch activities in the United States ==
During the last decade of Rabbi Schneersohn&#x27;s life, from 1940 to 1950, he settled in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York City. Rabbi Schneersohn was already physically weak and ill from his suffering at the hands of the Communists and the Nazis and from multiple health issues including multiple sclerosis, but he had a strong vision of rebuilding Orthodox Judaism in America, and he wanted his movement to spearhead it. To do so, he went on a building campaign to establish religious Jewish day schools and yeshivas for boys and girls, women and men. He established printing houses for the voluminous writings and publications of his movement, and started the process of spreading Jewish observance to the Jewish masses worldwide.

He began to teach publicly, and many came to seek out his teachings. He began gathering and sending out a small number of his newly trained rabbis to other cities - a trend later emulated and amplified by his son-in-law and successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

In 1948, he established a Lubavitch village in the Land of Israel known as Kfar Chabad near Tel Aviv, on the site of the de-populated Arab village of Al-Safiriyya.

He died in 1950, and was buried at Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York City. He had no sons, and his younger son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (&quot;The Rebbe&quot;) succeeded him as Lubavitcher Rebbe, while the older son-in-law, Rabbi Shemaryahu Gurary continued to run the Chabad Yeshiva network Tomchei Temimim.

After Rabbi Schneersohn&#x27;s passing, his gravesite, known as &quot;the &quot;Ohel&quot;&quot;, became a central point of focus for his successor Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who would visit it regularly for many hours of prayer, meditation, and supplication for Jews all over the world.

After his successor&#x27;s passing and burial next to his father-in-law, philanthropist Joseph Gutnick of Melbourne, Australia, established the Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch Center on Francis Lewis Boulevard in Queens, which is located adjacent to the joint grave site.

== Book collection ==
During his life in Smolensk, Rabbi Schneersohn set up a collection of his family&#x27;s religious books and writings. It includes texts dating back to the 16th century. After World War I, the Bolsheviks found part of the collection and moved it to the Russian State Library. Another part of the collection was confiscated by Soviet troops in Nazi Germany during World War II and moved to Russia&#x27;s military archive. In 1994, seven books were loaned to the U.S. Library of Congress for 60 days through an inter-library exchange program.

The books were given to the Chabad-Lubavitch library which helped to prolong the use of the books twice, in 1995 and 1996, before they finally refused to return them to Russia in 2000. They proposed an exchange for the opportunity to keep the books indefinitely, but Russia refused. In 2004, the Chabad-Lubavitch filed a lawsuit against Russia, claiming the remaining books. In 2010, an American court granted their claim, which Russia ignored as invalid. In retaliation, in 2011 Russia put a ban on lending works to American museums. In 2014, Senior United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth imposed fines of $50,000 a day for Russia refusing to return the Schneersohn collection of more than 12,000 books and 50,000 religious papers. Since Rabbi Schneersohn had no heirs, Russia claims the collection is a national treasure of the Russian people. This dispute is related to the deteriorating ties between Moscow and the U.S. over the ongoing 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. A Russian court ruled that the Library of Congress should pay fines of $50,000 a day for refusing to return the books.

<text>Richard William Farnsworth (September 1, 1920 – October 6, 2000) was an American actor and stuntman. He was twice nominated for an Academy Award: in 1978 for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Comes a Horseman,&quot; and in 2000 for Best Actor in &quot;The Straight Story&quot;, making him the second–oldest nominee for the award for the latter. Farnsworth was also known for his performances in &quot;The Grey Fox&quot; (1982), for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, as well as &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1985), &quot;Sylvester&quot; (1985), and &quot;Misery&quot; (1990).

==Early life==
Farnsworth was born on September 1, 1920, in Los Angeles, California. His mother was a homemaker and his father was an engineer.

==Career==

Farnsworth gradually moved into acting in Western movies. He made uncredited appearances in numerous films, including &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). In 1960, credited as Dick Farnsworth, he appeared as a Gault ranch hand in the &quot;Street of Hate&quot; episode of the TV Western &quot;Laramie&quot;.

He received his first acting credit in a film in 1963 and went on to act in many Western films and television shows. He had a role in &quot;Roots&quot; (1977) and co-starred with Wilford Brimley in &quot;The Boys of Twilight&quot; (1992). He received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for the Alan J. Pakula film &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; (1978). A breakthrough came when he played stagecoach robber Bill Miner in the 1982 Canadian film &quot;The Grey Fox&quot;. He appeared as a baseball coach in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984). In 1985, he played the brother to Marilla and father figure to Anne in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and starred as a soft-spoken, sage cowboy with horse training wisdom for Melissa Gilbert in &quot;Sylvester&quot;. His other prominent roles included a wealthy and ruthless oil man in &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990) and the suspicious sheriff in the film version of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot; (1990). His final role was playing Alvin Straight in the David Lynch film &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.

==Personal life and death==
Farnsworth had a long marriage and had two children. After becoming a widower, he lived on a ranch in Lincoln, New Mexico.

On the night of October 6, 2000, suffering from terminal cancer that left him partially paralyzed and in great pain, Farnsworth died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his ranch in Lincoln.

<text>Sweet and Lowdown is a 1999 American comedy-drama mockumentary written and directed by Woody Allen. Loosely based on Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;La Strada&quot;, the film tells the story of jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn) who falls in love with mute laundress Hattie (Samantha Morton). Like several of Allen&#x27;s other films (e.g., &quot;Zelig&quot;), the film is occasionally interrupted by interviews with critics and biographers like Allen, Nat Hentoff, Daniel Okrent, and Douglas McGrath, who comment on the film&#x27;s plot as if the characters were real-life people.

The film received generally positive reviews upon release, with Penn and Morton receiving Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.

==Plot==
Emmet Ray is a jazz guitarist who achieved some acclaim in the 1930s with a handful of recordings for RCA Victor, but faded from public view under mysterious circumstances. Although he is a talented musician, Ray&#x27;s personal life fell into shambles after his disappearance from public view. He&#x27;s often late in or even absent from performances with his quintet due to heavy drinking. He spends extravagantly, and is a womanizer and a pimp. When he&#x27;s not playing music or pursuing women, he shoots rats at garbage dumps and watches passing trains.

Ray idolizes famed guitarist Django Reinhardt, so much that he&#x27;s said to have fled a nightclub performance with severe stage fright upon hearing a false rumor that Reinhardt was in the audience.

On a double date with his drummer, Ray meets Hattie, a shy, mute laundress. After overcoming initial frustration due to communication difficulties, Ray and Hattie form an affectionate and close relationship. However, Ray is convinced that a musician of his stature should never settle down with one woman. Because of this, Ray marries socialite Blanche Williams. But Williams sees Ray as a colorful example of lower-class life and a source of inspiration for her literary writing. During their marriage, Ray is tormented by nightmares and shouts out Hattie&#x27;s name in his sleep.

When Williams cheats on Ray with mobster Al Torrio, Ray leaves her and finds Hattie. He assumes that she will take him back, but discovers that she is happily married and raising a family. Ray is despondent, and laments that leaving Hattie was a mistake. Woody Allen and the rest of the documentary experts remark that Ray&#x27;s final compositions were legendary, finally reaching the quality of Reinhardt&#x27;s.

==Production==

=== Development ===
After his 1969 directing debut &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, Allen signed a contract to direct a series of films with United Artists. Told to &quot;write what you want to write,&quot; Allen, a clarinetist and avid jazz enthusiast, wrote &quot;The Jazz Baby&quot;, a drama screenplay about a jazz musician set in the 1930s. Allen said later that the United Artists executives were &quot;stunned ... because they had expected a comedy. [They] were very worried and told me, &#x27;We realize that we signed a contract with you and you can do anything you want. But we want to tell you that we really don&#x27;t like this.&#x27;&quot; Allen went along with United Artists, writing and directing &quot;Bananas&quot; instead. In 1995, he dismissed &quot;The Jazz Baby&quot; as having been &quot;probably too ambitious.&quot;

In 1998, Allen returned to the project, rewriting the script and changing its name to &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;. Allen had originally planned to play Ray himself, but eventually cast Sean Penn. Allen also considered Johnny Depp, but Depp was busy at the time. Penn had a reputation for being difficult to work with, but Allen later said, &quot;I had no problem with him whatsoever ... He gave it his all and took direction and made contributions himself ... a tremendous actor.&quot;

Allen, in a retrospective, said that he told Samantha Morton to &quot;play [her] part like Harpo Marx. And she said, &#x27;Who is Harpo Marx?&#x27; and I realized how young she was. Then I told her about him [and] she went back and saw the films.&quot;

=== Filming ===

&quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; was filmed entirely in New York and New Jersey but is set in the Chicago area and California. 

The film was the first of Allen&#x27;s that was edited by Alisa Lepselter, who has edited all of Allen&#x27;s films since. Lepselter succeeded Susan E. Morse, who edited Allen&#x27;s films for the previous twenty years.

It was also the first of three films where Allen collaborated with Chinese cinematographer Zhao Fei. Allen had first noticed Zhao with his award-winning work on &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, some years earlier.

==Music==
The music for the film was arranged and conducted by Dick Hyman. All of the guitar solos are played by guitarist Howard Alden.

Additional rhythm guitarists were Bucky Pizzarelli and James Chirillo. Chirillo played rhythm guitar on the track &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown.&quot; Pizzarelli created all other rhythm tracks.

<text>In mathematics and signal processing, the Z-transform converts a discrete-time signal, which is a sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex valued frequency-domain (the z-domain or z-plane) representation.

It can be considered a discrete-time equivalent of the Laplace transform (the &quot;s-domain&quot; or &quot;s-plane&quot;). This similarity is explored in the theory of time-scale calculus.

While the continuous-time Fourier transform is evaluated on the s-domain&#x27;s vertical axis (the imaginary axis), the discrete-time Fourier transform is evaluated along the z-domain&#x27;s unit circle. The s-domain&#x27;s left half-plane maps to the area inside the z-domain&#x27;s unit circle, while the s-domain&#x27;s right half-plane maps to the area outside of the z-domain&#x27;s unit circle.

In signal processing, one of the means of designing digital filters is to take analog designs, subject them to a bilinear transform which maps them from the s-domain to the z-domain, and then produce the digital filter by inspection, manipulation, or numerical approximation. Such methods tend not to be accurate except in the vicinity of the complex unity, i.e. at low frequencies.

== History ==
The foundational concept now recognized as the Z-transform, which is a cornerstone in the analysis and design of digital control systems, was not entirely novel when it emerged in the mid-20th century. Its embryonic principles can be traced back to the work of the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, who is better known for the Laplace transform, a closely related mathematical technique. However, the explicit formulation and application of what we now understand as the Z-transform were significantly advanced in 1947 by Witold Hurewicz and colleagues. Their work was motivated by the challenges presented by sampled-data control systems, which were becoming increasingly relevant in the context of radar technology during that period. The Z-transform provided a systematic and effective method for solving linear difference equations with constant coefficients, which are ubiquitous in the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.

The method was further refined and gained its official nomenclature, &quot;the Z-transform,&quot; in 1952, thanks to the efforts of John R. Ragazzini and Lotfi A. Zadeh, who were part of the sampled-data control group at Columbia University. Their work not only solidified the mathematical framework of the Z-transform but also expanded its application scope, particularly in the field of electrical engineering and control systems.

A notable extension, known as the modified or advanced Z-transform, was later introduced by Eliahu I. Jury. Jury&#x27;s work extended the applicability and robustness of the Z-transform, especially in handling initial conditions and providing a more comprehensive framework for the analysis of digital control systems. This advanced formulation has played a pivotal role in the design and stability analysis of discrete-time control systems, contributing significantly to the field of digital signal processing.

Interestingly, the conceptual underpinnings of the Z-transform intersect with a broader mathematical concept known as the method of generating functions, a powerful tool in combinatorics and probability theory. This connection was hinted at as early as 1730 by Abraham de Moivre, a pioneering figure in the development of probability theory. De Moivre utilized generating functions to solve problems in probability, laying the groundwork for what would eventually evolve into the Z-transform. From a mathematical perspective, the Z-transform can be viewed as a specific instance of a Laurent series, where the sequence of numbers under investigation is interpreted as the coefficients in the (Laurent) expansion of an analytic function. This perspective not only highlights the deep mathematical roots of the Z-transform but also illustrates its versatility and broad applicability across different branches of mathematics and engineering.

==Definition==
The Z-transform can be defined as either a &quot;one-sided&quot; or &quot;two-sided&quot; transform. (Just like we have the one-sided Laplace transform and the two-sided Laplace transform.)

=== Bilateral Z-transform ===
The &quot;bilateral&quot; or &quot;two-sided&quot; Z-transform of a discrete-time signal formula_1 is the formal power series formula_2 defined as:

where formula_3 is an integer and formula_4 is, in general, a complex number. In polar form, formula_4 may be written as:
:formula_6
where formula_7 is the magnitude of formula_4, formula_9 is the imaginary unit, and formula_10 is the &quot;complex argument&quot; (also referred to as &quot;angle&quot; or &quot;phase&quot;) in radians.

=== Unilateral Z-transform ===
Alternatively, in cases where formula_1 is defined only for formula_12, the &quot;single-sided&quot; or &quot;unilateral&quot; Z-transform is defined as:

In signal processing, this definition can be used to evaluate the Z-transform of the unit impulse response of a discrete-time causal system.

An important example of the unilateral Z-transform is the probability-generating function, where the component formula_1 is the probability that a discrete random variable takes the value. The properties of Z-transforms (listed in ) have useful interpretations in the context of probability theory.

==Inverse Z-transform==
The &quot;inverse&quot; Z-transform is:

where formula_14 is a counterclockwise closed path encircling the origin and entirely in the region of convergence (ROC). In the case where the ROC is causal (see Example 2), this means the path formula_14 must encircle all of the poles of formula_2.

A special case of this contour integral occurs when formula_14 is the unit circle. This contour can be used when the ROC includes the unit circle, which is always guaranteed when formula_2 is stable, that is, when all the poles are inside the unit circle. With this contour, the inverse Z-transform simplifies to the inverse discrete-time Fourier transform, or Fourier series, of the periodic values of the Z-transform around the unit circle:

The Z-transform with a finite range of formula_3 and a finite number of uniformly spaced formula_4 values can be computed efficiently via Bluestein&#x27;s FFT algorithm. The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)—not to be confused with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)—is a special case of such a Z-transform obtained by restricting formula_4 to lie on the unit circle.

The following three methods are often used for the evaluation of the inverse -transform,

=== Direct Evaluation by Contour Integration ===
This method involves applying the Cauchy Residue Theorem to evaluate the inverse Z-transform. By integrating around a closed contour in the complex plane, the residues at the poles of the Z-transform function inside the ROC are summed. This technique is particularly useful when working with functions expressed in terms of complex variables.

=== Expansion into a Series of Terms in the Variables &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; ===
In this method, the Z-transform is expanded into a power series. This approach is useful when the Z-transform function is rational, allowing for the approximation of the inverse by expanding into a series and determining the signal coefficients term by term.

=== Partial-Fraction Expansion and Table Lookup ===
This technique decomposes the Z-transform into a sum of simpler fractions, each corresponding to known Z-transform pairs. The inverse Z-transform is then determined by looking up each term in a standard table of Z-transform pairs. This method is widely used for its efficiency and simplicity, especially when the original function can be easily broken down into recognizable components.

==== Example: ====
A) Determine the inverse Z-transform of the following by series expansion method,

formula_22

Solution:

Case 1:

ROC: formula_23

Since the ROC is the exterior of a circle, formula_24 is causal (signal existing for n≥0).

formula_25

thus,

formula_26 (arrow indicates term at x(0)=1)

Note that in each step of long division process we eliminate lowest power term of formula_27.

Case 2:

ROC: formula_28

Since the ROC is the interior of a circle, formula_24 is anticausal (signal existing for n&lt;0).

By performing long division we get,

formula_30

formula_31 (arrow indicates term at x(0)=0)

Note that in each step of long division process we eliminate lowest power term of formula_4.

&quot;Note:&quot;

# &quot;When the signal is causal, we get positive powers of formula_4 and when the signal is anticausal, we get negative powers of formula_4.&quot;
# &quot;formula_35 indicates term at formula_36 and formula_37 indicates term at formula_38.&quot;

B) Determine the inverse Z-transform of the following by series expansion method,

Eliminating negative powers if formula_4 and dividing by formula_4,

formula_41

By Partial Fraction Expansion,

formula_42

Case 1:

ROC:formula_43

Both the terms are causal, hence formula_24 is causal.

formula_45

Case 2:

ROC:formula_46

Both the terms are anticausal, hence formula_24 is anticausal.

formula_48

Case 3:

ROC:formula_49

One of the terms is causal (p=0.5 provides the causal part) and other is anticausal (p=1 provides the anticausal part), hence formula_24 is both sided.

formula_51

==Region of convergence==

The region of convergence (ROC) is the set of points in the complex plane for which the Z-transform summation converges (i.e. doesn&#x27;t blow up in magnitude to infinity):

:formula_52

===Example 1 (no ROC)===
Let formula_53 Expanding formula_1 on the interval formula_55 it becomes

:formula_56

Looking at the sum

:formula_57

Therefore, there are no values of formula_4 that satisfy this condition.

===Example 2 (causal ROC)===
Let formula_59 (where formula_60 is the Heaviside step function). Expanding formula_1 on the interval formula_55 it becomes

:formula_63

Looking at the sum

:formula_64

The last equality arises from the infinite geometric series and the equality only holds if formula_65 which can be rewritten in terms of formula_4 as formula_67 Thus, the ROC is formula_67 In this case the ROC is the complex plane with a disc of radius 0.5 at the origin &quot;punched out&quot;.

===Example 3 (anti causal ROC)===
Let formula_69 (where formula_60 is the Heaviside step function). Expanding formula_1 on the interval formula_55 it becomes

:formula_73

Looking at the sum

:formula_74

and using the infinite geometric series again, the equality only holds if formula_75 which can be rewritten in terms of formula_4 as formula_77 Thus, the ROC is formula_77 In this case the ROC is a disc centered at the origin and of radius 0.5.

What differentiates this example from the previous example is &quot;only&quot; the ROC. This is intentional to demonstrate that the transform result alone is insufficient.
===Examples conclusion===
Examples 2 &amp; 3 clearly show that the Z-transform formula_2 of formula_1 is unique when and only when specifying the ROC. Creating the pole–zero plot for the causal and anticausal case show that the ROC for either case does not include the pole that is at 0.5. This extends to cases with multiple poles: the ROC will &quot;never&quot; contain poles.

In example 2, the causal system yields a ROC that includes formula_81 while the anticausal system in example 3 yields an ROC that includes formula_82
In systems with multiple poles it is possible to have a ROC that includes neither formula_81 nor formula_82 The ROC creates a circular band. For example,

:formula_85

has poles at 0.5 and 0.75. The ROC will be 0.5 &lt; &lt; 0.75, which includes neither the origin nor infinity. Such a system is called a mixed-causality system as it contains a causal term formula_86 and an anticausal term formula_87

The stability of a system can also be determined by knowing the ROC alone. If the ROC contains the unit circle (i.e., = 1) then the system is stable. In the above systems the causal system (Example 2) is stable because &gt; 0.5 contains the unit circle.

Let us assume we are provided a Z-transform of a system without a ROC (i.e., an ambiguous formula_1). We can determine a unique formula_1 provided we desire the following:
* Stability
* Causality

For stability the ROC must contain the unit circle. If we need a causal system then the ROC must contain infinity and the system function will be a right-sided sequence. If we need an anticausal system then the ROC must contain the origin and the system function will be a left-sided sequence. If we need both stability and causality, all the poles of the system function must be inside the unit circle.

The unique formula_1 can then be found.

==Properties==
Parseval&#x27;s theorem
:formula_91

Initial value theorem: If formula_1 is causal, then
:formula_93

Final value theorem: If the poles of formula_94 are inside the unit circle, then
:formula_95

==Table of common Z-transform pairs==
Here:
:formula_96
is the unit (or Heaviside) step function and
:formula_97
is the discrete-time unit impulse function (cf Dirac delta function which is a continuous-time version). The two functions are chosen together so that the unit step function is the accumulation (running total) of the unit impulse function.

==Relationship to Fourier series and Fourier transform==
For values of formula_4 in the region formula_99, known as the unit circle, we can express the transform as a function of a single real variable formula_100 by defining formula_101 And the bi-lateral transform reduces to a Fourier series:

which is also known as the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the formula_1 sequence. This formula_103-periodic function is the periodic summation of a Fourier transform, which makes it a widely used analysis tool. To understand this, let formula_104 be the Fourier transform of any function, formula_105, whose samples at some interval formula_106 equal the formula_1 sequence. Then the DTFT of the formula_1 sequence can be written as follows.

where formula_106 has units of seconds, formula_110 has units of hertz. Comparison of the two series reveals that formula_111 is a normalized frequency with unit of &quot;radian per sample&quot;. The value formula_112 corresponds to formula_113. And now, with the substitution formula_114 can be expressed in terms of formula_115 (a Fourier transform):

As parameter &quot;T&quot; changes, the individual terms of move farther apart or closer together along the &quot;f&quot;-axis. In however, the centers remain 2 apart, while their widths expand or contract. When sequence formula_116 represents the impulse response of an LTI system, these functions are also known as its frequency response. When the formula_116 sequence is periodic, its DTFT is divergent at one or more harmonic frequencies, and zero at all other frequencies. This is often represented by the use of amplitude-variant Dirac delta functions at the harmonic frequencies. Due to periodicity, there are only a finite number of unique amplitudes, which are readily computed by the much simpler discrete Fourier transform (DFT). (See &quot;&quot;.)

==Relationship to Laplace transform==
===Bilinear transform===

The bilinear transform can be used to convert continuous-time filters (represented in the Laplace domain) into discrete-time filters (represented in the Z-domain), and vice versa. The following substitution is used:
:formula_118
to convert some function formula_119 in the Laplace domain to a function formula_120 in the Z-domain (Tustin transformation), or
:formula_121
from the Z-domain to the Laplace domain. Through the bilinear transformation, the complex &quot;s&quot;-plane (of the Laplace transform) is mapped to the complex z-plane (of the z-transform). While this mapping is (necessarily) nonlinear, it is useful in that it maps the entire formula_122 axis of the &quot;s&quot;-plane onto the unit circle in the z-plane. As such, the Fourier transform (which is the Laplace transform evaluated on the formula_122 axis) becomes the discrete-time Fourier transform. This assumes that the Fourier transform exists; i.e., that the formula_122 axis is in the region of convergence of the Laplace transform.

=== Starred transform ===

Given a one-sided Z-transform formula_2 of a time-sampled function, the corresponding starred transform produces a Laplace transform and restores the dependence on formula_106 (the sampling parameter):
:formula_127

The inverse Laplace transform is a mathematical abstraction known as an &quot;impulse-sampled&quot; function.

==Linear constant-coefficient difference equation==
The linear constant-coefficient difference (LCCD) equation is a representation for a linear system based on the autoregressive moving-average equation:

:formula_128

Both sides of the above equation can be divided by formula_129 if it is not zero. By normalizing with formula_130 the LCCD equation can be written

:formula_131

This form of the LCCD equation is favorable to make it more explicit that the &quot;current&quot; output formula_132 is a function of past outputs formula_133 current input formula_134 and previous inputs formula_135

===Transfer function===
Taking the Z-transform of the above equation (using linearity and time-shifting laws) yields:

:formula_136

where formula_2 and formula_138 are the z-transform of formula_1 and formula_140 respectively. (Notation conventions typically use capitalized letters to refer to the z-transform of a signal denoted by a corresponding lower case letter, similar to the convention used for notating Laplace transforms.)

Rearranging results in the system&#x27;s transfer function:

:formula_141

===Zeros and poles===
From the fundamental theorem of algebra the numerator has formula_142 roots (corresponding to zeros of &quot;formula_143&quot;) and the denominator has formula_144 roots (corresponding to poles). Rewriting the transfer function in terms of zeros and poles
:formula_145
where formula_146 is the formula_147 zero and formula_148 is the formula_147 pole. The zeros and poles are commonly complex and when plotted on the complex plane (z-plane) it is called the pole–zero plot.

In addition, there may also exist zeros and poles at formula_150 and formula_151 If we take these poles and zeros as well as multiple-order zeros and poles into consideration, the number of zeros and poles are always equal.

By factoring the denominator, partial fraction decomposition can be used, which can then be transformed back to the time domain. Doing so would result in the impulse response and the linear constant coefficient difference equation of the system.

===Output response===
If such a system formula_120 is driven by a signal formula_2 then the output is formula_154 By performing partial fraction decomposition on formula_138 and then taking the inverse Z-transform the output formula_132 can be found. In practice, it is often useful to fractionally decompose formula_157 before multiplying that quantity by formula_4 to generate a form of formula_138 which has terms with easily computable inverse Z-transforms.

<text>Javier Ángel Encinas Bardem (born 1 March 1969) is a Spanish actor. In a career spanning over three decades, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, seven Goya Awards, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award.

A son of actress Pilar Bardem, he first became known for such Spanish films as &quot;Jamón jamón&quot; (1992), &quot;Boca a boca&quot; (1995), &quot;Carne trémula&quot; (1997), &quot;Los lunes al sol&quot; (2002), and &quot;Mar adentro&quot; (2004). He received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Reinaldo Arenas in &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (2000), a criminal with cancer in &quot;Biutiful&quot; (2010), and Desi Arnaz in &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; (2021). His portrayal of assassin Anton Chigurh in the Coen brothers&#x27; western film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007) won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Bardem has also starred in auteur driven films such as Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; (2008), Terrence Malick&#x27;s drama &quot;To the Wonder&quot; (2013), Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s horror film &quot;mother!&quot; (2017), and Asghar Farhadi&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; (2018). He also acted in blockbuster films such as the James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), the swashbuckler film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017), the science fiction epic films &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024), and Disney&#x27;s live-action remake &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (2023). On television, he portrayed José Menendez in the Netflix crime anthology series &quot;&quot; (2024).

Bardem married actress Penélope Cruz in 2010 and together they have two children. In January 2018, Bardem became the ambassador of Greenpeace for the protection of Antarctica.

== Early life ==
Bardem was born on 1 March 1969 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, Spain. His mother, Pilar Bardem (1939–2021), was an actress, and his father, José Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931–1995), was the son of a cattle rancher from the province of Salamanca. According to Pilar&#x27;s memoirs, José had a &quot;capricious and violent will,&quot; and shot up the front door. He changed jobs more than 10 times, leading to evictions and the children going hungry. The two separated shortly after Javier&#x27;s birth. His mother raised him and his elder siblings, Carlos and Mónica, alone (another sibling died shortly after birth), both of whom have also pursued an acting career. His father died of leukemia in 1995.

On his mother’s side, Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema. He is a grandson of actors Rafael Bardem and Matilde Muñoz Sampedro (sister of actresses Mercedes and Guadalupe), and a nephew of screenwriter and director Juan Antonio Bardem. On the latter&#x27;s side, he is a cousin of filmmaker Miguel Bardem. His uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by the Franco regime for his anti-fascist films. Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother.

As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets. In 1974, he made his first television appearance, in Fernando Fernán Gómez&#x27;s television series &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Scoundrel&quot;). He also played rugby for the junior Spanish National Team. Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business, and painting was his preferred medium. He went on to study painting for four years at Madrid&#x27;s Escuela de Artes y oficios. In need of money, he took acting jobs to support his painting but felt he was a bad painter and eventually abandoned it as a career.

In 1989, for the Spanish comedy show &quot;El Día Por Delante&quot; (&quot;The Day Ahead&quot;), he had to wear a Superman costume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all. Bardem also worked as a stripper (for one day) during his struggling acting career.

== Career ==
=== 1990–1999: Early roles ===
Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture, &quot;The Ages of Lulu&quot;, when he was 21, in which he appeared along with his mother, Pilar Bardem. He also appeared in minor roles in &quot;Amo tu cama rica&quot; and &quot;High Heels&quot;. Bigas Luna, the director of &quot;Lulu&quot;, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film, &quot;Jamón Jamón&quot; in 1992, in which Bardem played a would-be underwear model and bullfighter. The film, which also starred his eventual wife Penélope Cruz, was a major international success. Bardem featured in Sancho Gracia&#x27;s &quot;Huidos&quot;, and starred in Bigas Luna&#x27;s next film &quot;Golden Balls&quot; (1993).

Bardem&#x27;s talent did not go unnoticed in the English-speaking world. In 1997, John Malkovich was the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor. His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with director Álex de la Iglesia&#x27;s &quot;Perdita Durango&quot;, playing a santería-practicing bank robber.

=== 2000–2011: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; in 2000, portraying Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. He received praise from his idol Al Pacino; the message Pacino left on Bardem&#x27;s answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received. For that role, he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of Danny Witwer in &quot;Minority Report&quot; which eventually went to Colin Farrell. Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in Malkovich&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot;. Malkovich originally had Bardem in mind for the role of the detective&#x27;s assistant, but the movie&#x27;s time trying to find financing gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. &quot;I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English&quot;, Bardem has said of Malkovich.

Bardem won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in &quot;Mar Adentro&quot; (2004), released in the United States as &quot;The Sea Inside&quot;, in which he portrayed the quadriplegic turned assisted suicide activist Ramón Sampedro. He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summons Tom Cruise&#x27;s hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime drama &quot;Collateral&quot;. He stars in Miloš Forman&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Goya&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; opposite Natalie Portman, where he plays a twisted monk during the Spanish Inquisition.

In 2007, Bardem acted in two film adaptations: the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, and the adaptation of the Colombian novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; with Giovanna Mezzogiorno by Gabriel García Márquez. In &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, he played a sociopathic assassin, Anton Chigurh. For that role, he became the first Spaniard to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He won a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the 2008 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Bardem&#x27;s rendition of Chigurh&#x27;s trademark word, &quot;What business is it of yours where I&#x27;m from, friendo?&quot; (in response to the convenience store owner&#x27;s query, &quot;Y&#x27;all gettin&#x27; any rain up your way?&quot;), was named Top HollyWORDIE of 2007 in the annual survey by the Global Language Monitor. Chigurh was named No. 26 in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 &quot;50 Most Vile Villains in Movie History&quot; list. Bardem&#x27;s life&#x27;s work was honored at the 2007 Gotham Awards, produced by Independent Feature Project. In 2014, Belgian psychiatry professor Samuel Leistedt and 10 associates watched 400 movies over the course of three years and identified 126 psychopathic characters: Bardem&#x27;s rendition of Chigurh was voted the most realistic psychopath.

Francis Ford Coppola singled out Bardem as an heir to, and even improvement on, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro, referring to Bardem as ambitious, hungry, unwilling to rest on his laurels and always &quot;excited to do something good.&quot; Bardem was attached to play the role of Tetro&#x27;s mentor in Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Tetro&quot;, but the director felt the character should be female, so he was replaced by fellow Spaniard Carmen Maura. Bardem was originally cast to play fictional filmmaker Guido Contini in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Nine&quot; but dropped out due to exhaustion. The part eventually went to Daniel Day-Lewis. He went on to star alongside Penélope Cruz and Scarlett Johansson in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; (2008) where he earned his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination.

=== 2012–present: Established career ===
In 2010, he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in &quot;Biutiful&quot; directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, who specifically wrote the film with Bardem in mind. After being overlooked by the Globes and SAG, Bardem was the unexpected Oscar nominee on 25 January 2011, becoming the first all Spanish-language Best Actor nominee ever. He won his 5th Goya Award, this time for Best Actor in &quot;Biutiful&quot;, dedicating the win to his wife, Penélope Cruz, and newborn son. Around this same time, he was offered the lead role of &quot;Gunslinger&quot; Roland Deschain in Ron Howard&#x27;s film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s Dark Tower novels. If he had signed, he would have starred in the TV series as well. Then Eon Productions offered him a role as villain Raoul Silva in the James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;. With Universal deciding not to go forward with the ultra-ambitious adaptation of the 8-novel Stephen King series, and to end months of speculation, Bardem officially confirmed his role in &quot;Skyfall&quot; during an interview with Christiane Amanpour for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;.

Bardem received the 2,484th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 November 2012. The star is located outside the El Capitan Theatre. With his movie &quot;Sons of the Clouds: The Last Colony&quot; (2012), he demonstrated the suffering of the Sahrawi people in refugee camps. He publicly denounced the UN as unwilling to definitively resolve the human crisis there.

Bardem portrayed the main antagonist, Armando Salazar, in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, the fifth film in the series. In September 2017, Bardem starred with Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Ed Harris in the horror film &quot;Mother!&quot; by director Darren Aronofsky, which focuses on a couple whose lives are disrupted by the arrival of unexpected guests. In 2018, Bardem once again appeared on screen alongside his spouse Penélope Cruz in Asghar Farhadi&#x27;s feature film &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;.

In 2021, Bardem portrayed Stilgar in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s science fiction drama &quot;Dune&quot;. That same year, he starred as Julio Blanco in Fernando León de Aranoa&#x27;s workplace satire &quot;The Good Boss&quot;. His leading performance portraying a manipulative factory boss was considered among the finest of his career by critics, and clinched him a Goya Award. Also in 2021, he starred as Desi Arnaz, alongside Nicole Kidman as his on-screen wife Lucille Ball, in Amazon Studios&#x27; and Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;. Despite unfavorable reactions in response to his casting as Arnaz, Bardem&#x27;s portrayal received praise. For his performance, he received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, as well as his third Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, his fourth nomination overall.

Bardem was set to play Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster in the upcoming remake of the &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, directed by Bill Condon. He appeared in the 2022 film &quot;Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile&quot; and played King Triton in Disney&#x27;s 2023 live-action/CGI movie, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall. In 2024, Bardem reprised the role of Stilgar in &quot;&quot; and he will also work once again with Kidman in the upcoming Netflix and Skydance Animation film, &quot;Spellbound&quot;. On 10 July 2023, &quot;Deadline&quot; announced that Bardem will star with Brad Pitt in &quot;F1&quot; for Apple TV+, with Warner Bros. Pictures handling theatrical distribution. 

In September 2024, during the reception of his 2023 Donostia Award for career achievement at the 72nd San Sebastián International Film Festival, answering a question about his availability to Spanish filmmakers other than his friend Fernando León, Bardem announced that he had been cast to star alongside Victoria Luengo in Rodrigo Sorogoyen&#x27;s &quot;The Beloved&quot;, due to begin filming in January 2025 in Fuerteventura. That same month, he starred as Jose Menendez, the father of Lyle and Erik Menendez, in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, to critical praise.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriage and family ===
In 2007, Bardem began dating Penélope Cruz, his co-star in &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot;. Bardem and Cruz have maintained a low public profile, refusing to discuss their personal lives. The couple married in July 2010 in The Bahamas. They have two children: a son, named Leo Encinas Cruz, born on 23 January 2011, in Los Angeles; and a daughter, named Luna Encinas Cruz, born on 22 July 2013, in Madrid.

In September 2018, at the Toronto Film Festival premiere of &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; Bardem told &quot;Ikon London Magazine&quot; about acting together with his spouse: &quot;I find it very easy. In a sense that we play what we are supposed to play and then we go back to our daily life which is way more interesting than any fiction. And it is real.&quot;

=== Interests === 
Bardem&#x27;s native language is Spanish, and he is also fluent in English. He is a fan of heavy metal music, and credits the band AC/DC for helping him learn to speak English, in some respects. He is also a fan of Pearl Jam. Bardem does not drive, only getting behind the wheel for film roles, and he refers to himself as a &quot;worker&quot; or &quot;entertainer&quot;, not an actor. In 2024, he stated that he still saw himself as &quot;the son of Pilar&quot;, adding that he did not want &quot;to be anything else&quot;.

Although Bardem was raised as a Catholic, he is now agnostic. He expressed his support of gay marriage in Spain. Bardem emphasized that while ego drives acting, it should not interfere with filmmaking. He has later said that while he does not believe strongly in the supernatural, he does not deny it. &quot;We are just this little tiny spot in the whole universe, so of course there must be other things, other people, other creatures, other lives and other dimensions. Sure, I believe in it&quot;. In the same interview, Bardem stated that he thinks science and belief &quot;should go together&quot;.

Despite the villainous characters he has played throughout his acting career, Bardem has a self-confessed &quot;hatred&quot; of violence which stems from a fight in a nightclub in his early twenties which left him with a broken nose.

=== Activism === 
Long committed to the plight of the Sahrawi people, Bardem served as spokesperson of the platform &#x27;All with the Sahara&#x27;, that collected signatures to ask the Spanish government to &quot;lead the search for a peaceful and just solution to a conflict that affects us directly&quot;. Bardem produced and narrated the documentary film &quot;Sons of the Clouds&quot; about life in the Sahrawi refugee camps. In May 2011 Bardem teamed up with The Enough Project&#x27;s co-founder John Prendergast to raise awareness about conflict minerals in eastern Congo. In July 2019, Bardem signed a manifesto urging PSOE and Podemos parties to reach an agreement to form a ministry after the April 2019 elections in Spain. 

In November 2019, during the March for Climate in Madrid, Bardem gave a speech on stage where he called both the mayor of Madrid José Luis Martínez-Almeida and the US president Donald Trump &quot;stupid&quot;. He later apologized, declaring that &quot;the insult illegitimizes any speech and conversation.&quot;

During the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Bardem and Cruz signed an open letter denouncing Israel&#x27;s actions as genocide. In September 2024, Bardem criticized Israel&#x27;s military operations in the Gaza Strip and the &quot;unconditional support&quot; of Israel by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, saying that &quot;Israel&#x27;s extreme right-wing nationalist government is not at all representative of the Jewish community or Israeli society.&quot;

<text>BASF SE (), an initialism of its original name , is a European multinational company and the largest chemical producer in the world. Its headquarters are located in Ludwigshafen, Germany.

BASF comprises subsidiaries and joint ventures in more than 80 countries, operating six integrated production sites and 390 other production sites across Europe, Asia, Australia, the Americas and Africa. BASF has customers in over 190 countries and supplies products to a wide variety of industries. Despite its size and global presence, BASF has received relatively little public attention since it abandoned the manufacture and sale of BASF-branded consumer electronics products in the 1990s.

The company began as a dye manufacturer in 1865. Fritz Haber worked with Carl Bosch, one of its employees, to invent the Haber-Bosch process by 1912, after which the company grew rapidly. In 1925, the company merged with several other German chemical companies to become the chemicals conglomerate IG Farben. IG Farben would go on to play a major role in the economy of Nazi Germany. It extensively employed forced and slave labor during the Nazi period, and produced the notorious Zyklon B chemical used in The Holocaust. IG Farben was disestablished by the Allies in 1945. BASF was reconstituted from the remnants of IG Farben in 1952. It was part of the German economic miracle, and has since expanded considerably. It has received modern criticism for its poor environmental record.

At the end of 2019, the company employed 117,628 people, with over 54,000 in Germany. , BASF posted sales of €59.3 billion and income from operations before special items of about €4.5 billion. Between 1990 and 2005, the company invested €5.6 billion in Asia, specifically in sites near Nanjing, Shanghai and Jiangmen in China and Mangalore in India. BASF is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and Zurich Stock Exchange. The company delisted its ADR from the New York Stock Exchange in September 2007. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.

==History==

BASF is an acronym for . It was founded by Friedrich Engelhorn on 6 April 1865 in Mannheim, in the German-speaking state of Baden. Engelhorn had been responsible for setting up a gasworks and street lighting for the town council in 1861. The gasworks produced tar as a by-product from coal, and Engelhorn used this to extract aniline for the production of dyes. BASF was set up in 1865, to produce other chemicals necessary for dye production, notably soda and acids. The plant, however, was erected on the other side of the Rhine river at Ludwigshafen because the town council of Mannheim was afraid that the air pollution from the chemical plant could bother the inhabitants of the town. In 1866, the dye production processes were also moved to the BASF site.

===Aniline dyes (1869)===

The discovery in 1857 by William Henry Perkin that aniline could be used to make intense colouring agents had led to the commercial production of synthetic dyes in England from aniline extracted from coal tar. BASF recruited Heinrich Caro, a German chemist with experience of the dyestuff industry in England, to be the first head of research. Caro developed a synthesis for alizarin (a red dye used for dying textile fabrics) and applied for a British patent on 25 June 1869. Coincidentally, Perkin applied for a virtually identical patent on 26 June 1869, and the two companies came to a mutual commercial agreement about the process.

Further patents were granted for the synthesis of methylene blue and eosin, and in 1880, research began to try to find a synthetic process for indigo dye, though this was not successfully brought to the market until 1897. In 1901, some 80% of the BASF production was dyestuffs.

===Solvay process soda (1880)===

Sodium carbonate (soda) was produced by the Leblanc process until 1880, when the much cheaper Solvay process became available. BASF ceased to make its own and bought it from the Solvay company thereafter.

===Knietsch sulfuric acid (1890)===

Sulfuric acid was initially produced by the lead chamber process, but in 1890, a unit using the contact process was brought on stream, producing the acid at higher concentration (98% instead of 80%) and a lower cost. This development followed extensive research and development by Rudolf Knietsch, for which he received the Liebig Medal in 1904.

===Haber&#x27;s ammonia (1913)===
The development of the Haber process from 1908 to 1912, made it possible to synthesize ammonia (a major industrial chemical as the primary source of nitrogen), and, after acquiring exclusive rights to the process, in 1913, BASF started a new production plant in Oppau, adding fertilizers to its product range. BASF also acquired and began mining anhydrite for gypsum at the Kohnstein in 1917.

===WWI===
In 1916, BASF started operations at a new site in Leuna, where explosives were produced during the First World War. On 21 September 1921, an explosion occurred in Oppau, killing 565 people. The Oppau explosion was the biggest industrial accident in German history.

===IG Farben (1921)===

Under the leadership of Carl Bosch, BASF founded IG Farben with Hoechst, Bayer, and three other companies, thus losing its independence. BASF was the nominal survivor, as all shares were exchanged for BASF shares before the merger. Rubber, fuels, and coatings were added to the range of products.

In 1935, IG Farben and AEG presented the magnetophon – the first tape recorder – at the Radio Exhibition in Berlin.

===World War II===
After the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in 1933, IG Farben cooperated with the National Socialist government, profiting from guaranteed volumes and prices and, in time, from forced (&quot;unfree&quot;) labour provided through governmental concentration camps. BASF (leader of the chemical industry of the IG Farben) built a 24km2 chemical factory in Auschwitz named &quot;IG Auschwitz&quot;, the largest chemical factory in the world at the time. IG Farben became notorious through its production of Zyklon-B, the lethal gas used to kill prisoners in German extermination camps during the Holocaust.

IG Farben made extensive use of forced labor during WWII consisting mostly of drafted &quot;service-duty&quot; Germans, foreign workers from German-occupied territories, and prisoners of war. By 1943, nearly one-half of all IG Farben workers were forced laborers housed in factory-camp facilities. This number did not include the 51,445 concentration camp laborers supplied by the Nazis. Spread out over 23 facilities, it is estimated that 31,50033,500 of those concentration camp inmates were killed by authorities or died from starvation, exhaustion, or disease. 

The Ludwigshafen site was almost completely destroyed during the Second World War but was subsequently rebuilt. The allies dissolved IG Farben in November 1945.

Both the Ludwigshafen and Oppau plants were of strategic importance for the war because the German military needed many of their products (&quot;e.g.&quot;, synthetic rubber and gasoline). As a result, they were major targets for air raids. During the war, Allied bombers attacked the plants a total of 65 times.

Bombing took place from the autumn of 1943 and saturation bombing inflicted extensive damage. Production virtually stopped by the end of 1944.

Due to a shortage of male workers during the war, women were conscripted to work in the factories, joined later by prisoners of war and foreign civilians. Concentration camp inmates did not work at the Ludwigshafen and Oppau plants.

In July 1945, the American military administration confiscated all IG Farben assets. That same year, the Allied Commission decreed that IG Farben should be dissolved. The sites at Ludwigshafen and Oppau were controlled by French authorities.

===BASF refounded (1952)===
On 28 July 1948, an explosion occurred at a BASF site in Ludwigshafen, killing 207 people and injuring 3818. In 1952, BASF was refounded under its name following the efforts of former Nazi Party member Carl Wurster, who served in Nazi Germany as &quot;Wehrwirtschaftsführer&quot; (war economy leader). With the German economic miracle in the 1950s, BASF added synthetics such as nylon to its product range. BASF developed Polystyrene in the 1930s and invented Styropor in 1951.

===Post-WW2 20th century===
In the 1960s, production abroad was expanded and plants were built in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Following a change in corporate strategy in 1965, greater emphasis was placed on higher-value products such as coatings, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and fertilizers. Following German reunification, BASF acquired a site in Schwarzheide, Eastern Germany, on 25 October 1990.

In 1968, BASF (together with Bayer AG) bought the German coatings company Herbol. BASF completely took over the Herbol branches in Cologne and Würzburg in 1970. Under new management, the renewal and expansion of the trademark continued. After an extensive reorganisation and an increasing international orientation of the coatings business, Herbol became part of the new founded Deco GmbH in 1997.

BASF bought the Wyandotte Chemical Company, and its Geismar, Louisiana chemical plant in the early 1970s. The plant produced plastics, herbicides, and antifreeze. BASF soon tried to operate union-free, having already reduced or eliminated union membership in several other US plants. Challenging the Geismar OCAW union resulted in a labor dispute that saw members locked out from 1984 to 1989, and eventually winning their case. A worker solidarity committee at BASF&#x27;s headquarters plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, took donations from German workers to support the American strikers and organized rallies and publicity in support. The dispute was the subject of an academic study. The union also exposed major accidental releases of phosgene, toluene and other toxic gases, these being publicized in the local media and through a video, &quot;Out of Control&quot;. A court threw out a $66,700 fine against BASF for five environmental violations as &quot;too small&quot;.

BASF&#x27;s European coatings business was taken over by AkzoNobel in 1999.

===21st century===
BASF bought the Engelhard Corporation for $4.8 billion in 2006. Other acquisitions in 2006, were the purchase of Johnson Polymer and the construction chemicals business of Degussa.

The acquisition of Johnson Polymer was completed on 1 July 2006. The purchase price was $470 million on a cash and debt-free basis. It provided BASF with a range of water-based resins that complements its portfolio of high solids and UV resins for the coatings and paints industry and strengthened the company&#x27;s market presence, particularly in North America.
The acquisition of Degussa AG&#x27;s construction chemicals business was completed in 2006. The purchase price for equity was about €2.2 billion. In addition, the transaction was associated with a debt of €500 million.

The company agreed to acquire Ciba (formerly part of Ciba-Geigy) in September 2008. The proposed deal was reviewed by the European Commissioner for Competition. On 9 April 2009, the acquisition was officially completed.

On 19 December 2008, BASF acquired U.S.-based Whitmire Micro-Gen together with U.K.-based Sorex Ltd. Sorex is a manufacturer of branded chemical and non-chemical products for professional pest management. In March 2007 Sorex was put up for sale with a price tag of about £100 million.

In December 2010, BASF completed the acquisition of Cognis.

In May 2015, BASF agreed to sell parts of its pharmaceutical ingredients business to Swiss drug manufacturer Siegfried Holding for a fee of €270 million, including assumed debt.

Since 2016, BASF has partnered with a subsidiary of Xinjiang Zhongtai Group, a company sanctioned under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to operate a plant in Korla.

In October 2017, BASF announced it would buy seed and herbicide businesses from Bayer for €5.9 billion ($7 billion), as part of Bayer&#x27;s acquisition of Monsanto.

The company announced the start of a US$10 billion investment project in the south-western Chinese city of Zhanjiang, in November 2019. The project was approved in 2022. This ″Verbund″ site is intended for the production of engineering plastics and TPU. The site would be the third-largest BASF site worldwide, following Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium. The first plant started up in 2022, and the entire site is expected to be completed by 2030.

In August 2019, BASF agreed to sell its global pigments business to Japanese fine chemical company DIC for €1.15 billion ($1.28 billion) on a cash and debt-free basis.

In September 2019, BASF signed an agreement with DuPont Safety &amp; Construction, a subsidiary business unit of DuPont, to sell its ultrafiltration membrane business, Inge GmbH. According to BASF executives, Inge GmbH and its products fit better with DuPont and their business strategy.

In February 2023, BASF announced that the company is planning to close one of its two ammonia factories at its site in Ludwigshafen, this comes as part of the companies plans to cut costs as the organisation has struggled with high energy costs. The result of the organisations plans will lead to increased production in China while resulting in the loss of 2,600 jobs. The Zhanjiang plant extends over 400 hectares and serves mainly the electronic industry and the automotive industry. In September 2023 BASF broke ground on its Zhanjiang syngas plant; the plant was due to be commissioned by 2025. In November 2023 the firm closed a $5bn 15-year investment deal in China, with Chinese banks.

As of April 2023, BASF had 30 production facilities in China. CEO Martin Brudermüller held that Chinese revenue is essential to grow his European business in the face of &quot;Europe’s high energy costs and stringent environmental rules.&quot;

==Past activity==
With the help of then German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, BASF&#x27;s Jürgen Hambrecht signed the Gazprom Nord Stream-Yuzhno-Russkoye deal in 2004 with a 49-51 structure, as opposed to the older 50-50 split of for example BP&#x27;s TNK-BP project. Putin at the time insisted on majority Russian ownership of any joint-venture in Russian territory since that time.

BASF expanded to Podolsk, Russia, in 2012, and to Kazan in 2013.

==Notable lawsuits==
===Dicamba lawsuit===
On 27 January 2020, the first-ever lawsuit concerning Dicamba-related products began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The lawsuit involves a peach farmer who alleged that Dicamba-based herbicides caused significant damage to his crops and trees. It had also been filed in November 2016, when Dicamba was still owned by Monsanto. On 14 February 2020, the jury involved in the lawsuit ruled against BASF its co-defendant Bayer, which had acquired Monsanto and its products, and found in favor of the peach grower, Bader Farms owner Bill Bader. BASF and Bayer were also ordered to pay Bader $15 million in damages. On 15 February 2020, Monsanto and BASF were ordered to pay an additional $250 million in punitive damages.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2017, BASF reported earnings of €6.1 billion, with an annual revenue of €64.5 billion, an increase of 12% over the previous fiscal cycle. BASF&#x27;s shares traded at over €69 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at €63.7 billion in November 2018. In October 2019, BASF reported a drop of operating income for July to September amounting to 24 percent, along with a drop in EBIT earnings of €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion). The US–China trade war as well as uncertainties related to Brexit were identified as contributing factors. However, overall third quarter profit beat expectations as the acquisition of Bayer AG&#x27;s agrochemical and seed business help to offset some of the effects of the trade war.
==Business segments and leadership==
BASF operates in a variety of markets. As of 2020 its business is organized in the segments of Chemicals, Plastics, Performance Products, Functional Solutions, Agricultural Solutions, and Oil and Gas.

===Chemicals===
BASF produces a wide range of chemicals such as solvents, amines, resins, glues, electronic-grade chemicals, industrial gases, basic petrochemicals, and inorganic chemicals (such as Z-Cote). The most important customers for this segment are the pharmaceutical, construction, textile, and automotive industries.

===Plastics===
BASF&#x27;s plastic products include high-performance materials in thermoplastics, foams, and urethanes.

Engineering PlasticsBASF&#x27;s Engineering Plastics consists of the &quot;4 Ultras&quot; – Ultramid polyamide (PA) nylon-based resins, Ultradur, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), Ultraform, polyacetal (POM), and Ultrason, polysulfone (PSU) and polyethersulfone (PES).

StyrenicsBASF Styrenics consists of the Foams and Copolymers. BASF&#x27;s styrenic copolymers have applications in electronics, building and construction, and automotive components. In 2011 BASF and INEOS blended their global business activities in the fields of styrene monomers (SM), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), styrene butadiene copolymers (SBC) and other styrene-based copolymers (SAN, AMSAN, ASA, MABS) into a joint venture named Styrolution.

PolyurethanesBASF&#x27;s Polyurethanes business consists of diverse technologies and finished products. Urethane chemicals are raw materials used in rigid and flexible foams commonly used for insulation in the construction and appliance industries, furniture, packaging, and transportation.

FoamsFoams like Styropor are generally used as insulating materials. They are eco-efficient and offer advantages over other materials in terms of cost-effectiveness, preservation of resources and environmental protection. Investments made for insulating materials usually pay for themselves within a short time and contribute to retaining and even enhancing the value of buildings.

Polyamides and IntermediatesBASF manufactures polyamide precursors and polyamide.

Biodegradable plasticsBASF developed a biodegradable plastic with a high content of polylactic acid.

===Performance products===
BASF produces a range of performance chemicals, coatings and functional polymers. These include raw materials for detergents, textile and leather chemicals, pigments and raw materials for adhesives, paper chemicals. Customers are the automotive, oil, paper, packaging, textile, sanitary products, detergents, construction materials, coatings, printing, and leather industries.

===Functional Solutions===
BASF&#x27;s Functional Solutions segment consists of the Catalysts, Construction Chemicals and Coatings divisions. These divisions develop customer-specific products, in particular for the automotive and construction industries.

===Agricultural===
BASF supplies agricultural products and chemicals including fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and seed treatment products. The company also researches nutrigenomics. BASF opened a new crop protection technology center in Limburgerhof, Germany in 2016.

===Biotechnology===
BASF was cooperating with Monsanto Company in research, development and marketing of biotechnology. In correlation to this work, BASF has licensed many gene editing tools including CRISPR Cas9 and CRISPR Cas12a (Cpf1).

The BASF Plant Science subsidiary produces the Amflora and Starch Potato genetically modified potato with reduced amylose. In 2010 BASF conducted Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs approved trials of genetically modified potatoes in the United Kingdom. Starch Potato was authorised for use in the USA in 2014.

==Investors==
75% of the BASF shares are held by institutional investors (BlackRock more than 5%). 36% of the shares are held in Germany, 11% in the UK and 17% in the U.S.

==Production==
BASF&#x27;s recent success is characterized by a focus on creating resource efficient product lines after completely abandoning consumer products. This strategy was reflected in production by a re-focus towards integrated production sites. The largest such integrated production site is located in Ludwigshafen employing 33,000 people.

Integrated production sites are characterized by co-location of many individual production lines (producing a specific chemical), which share an interconnected material flow. Piping is used ubiquitously for volume materials. All production lines use common raw material sourcing and feed back waste resources, which can be used elsewhere (e.g. steam of various temperatures, sulfuric acid, carbon monoxide). The economic incentive for this approach is high resource and energy efficiency of the overall process, reduced shipping cost and associated reduced risk of accidents. Due to the high cost of such an integrated production site, it establishes a high entry barrier for competitors trying to enter the market for volume chemicals.

BASF built a new chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at a cost of $100 million. This facility has South Asia&#x27;s first methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) splitter for processing crude MDI. BASF has 8 production facilities in India.

BASF SE has succeeded in developing a semi-crystalline polyamide that allows light to pass through largely unhindered, known as Ultramid.
==Environmental record==
According to the 2022 &quot;Top 100 Polluters Indexes&quot; published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst&#x27;s &quot;Political Economy Research Institute&quot; (PERI), BASF was ranked the #2 largest polluter of air and #14 largest polluter of water in 2020, the most recent year for which data is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In 2006, BASF was included in the Climate Leadership Index for their efforts in relation to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

The BASF Company and Columbia University formed a partnership to further research &quot;environmentally benign and sustainable energy sources&quot;. The company has recently reported their emissions in 2006 to be &quot;1.50 million metric tons of waste,&quot; which is a decrease from previous years. The amount of waste BASF produces has continued to fall.

While BASF publishes its environmental information in the US and Europe, Greenpeace has expressed deep concerns at BASF&#x27;s refusal to release environmental information on its operations in China.

In May 2009, a BASF Plant in Hannibal, Missouri, United States, accidentally discharged chromium into the Mississippi River. The local Department of Natural Resources performed tests in December 2009 showing the chromium levels did not exceed regulatory safety limits. BASF worked with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) to resolve questions regarding the elevated level of hexavalent chromium that was detected in the effluent from one of its permitted outfalls into the Mississippi River. The state department of health reviewed the test results and determined that the amounts found were well below recommended public health screening levels.

In 2013, BASF reported a spill of several hundred kilogrammes of the chelating agent Trilon-B (tetrasodium Edta) into the river Rhine from BASF&#x27;s headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany. BASF has instituted an eco-efficiency analysis to promote green engineering principles.

== Corporate Social Responsibility ==
BASF works on supporting water, sanitation, education and health programmes as part of its social responsibility commitments. In a unique program technically supported by Edward &amp; Cynthia Institute of Public Health, BASF implemented Project SAFE ( Safety and Farm Efficiency).

In 2019, Harris took over the role of Atticus Finch in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; on Broadway. The role was previously played by original cast member Jeff Daniels.

=== 2020s ===
In 2022, Harris played Rear Admiral Chester &quot;Hammer&quot; Cain in the blockbuster film &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;. Harris was in the film &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; as Lou Sr. in 2024.

==Personal life==
Harris married actress Amy Madigan on November 21, 1983, while they were filming &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; together. They have one daughter, Lily Dolores Harris (b. May 3, 1993).

On March 21, 1999, during the 71st Academy Awards, Harris along with Amy Madigan openly showed disdain for Elia Kazan, who had received an Academy Honorary Award, by staying in their seats and not applauding. This was due to Kazan&#x27;s testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952, naming his friends from the Group Theatre as communists resulting in their being blacklisted, for which Kazan had never given an apology.

On March 20, 2012, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merged to form a new union, SAG-AFTRA. Harris, along with others including Edward Asner, Martin Sheen, Valerie Harper, Michael Bell, and Wendy Schaal, were opposed to the merger and sued SAG President Ken Howard and several SAG Vice Presidents, seeking to have the merger undone. They were unsuccessful. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 22, 2012.

Harris has a reputation for being serious on the film set. He told a journalist in 2006, &quot;I don&#x27;t like bullshittin&#x27; ... so, I guess that comes across as serious.&quot; On March 13, 2015, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard, for his work in motion pictures. Harris received an honorary degree from Muhlenberg College on May 17, 2015.

&quot;New York&quot; magazine once described Harris as &quot;the thinking woman&#x27;s sex symbol&quot;.

Harris lost his Malibu home in the Palisades Fire of January 2025.

<text>Before Night Falls () is the 1992 autobiography of Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas, describing his early life in Cuba, his time in prison, and his escape to the United States in the Mariel boatlift of 1980. It received a favorable review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and was on the newspaper&#x27;s list of the ten best books of 1993. The book was adapted into a film of the same name in 2000, starring Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp.

==Opera adaptation==
On May 29, 2010, the premiere performance of &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, an opera by Jorge Martín, took place at the Fort Worth Opera. The opera follows the book by Reinaldo Arenas closely.

On March 29, 2017, Florida Grand Opera premiered &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; in Miami with five performances at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.

<text>In economics, elasticity measures the responsiveness of one economic variable to a change in another. For example, if the price elasticity of the demand of a good is −2, then a 10% increase in price will cause the quantity demanded to fall by 20%. Elasticity in economics provides an understanding of changes in the behavior of the buyers and sellers with price changes. There are two types of elasticity for demand and supply, one is inelastic demand and supply and the other one is elastic demand and supply.

== Introduction ==

The concept of price elasticity was first cited in an informal form in the book &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; published by the author Alfred Marshall in 1890. Subsequently, a major study of the price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand for US products was undertaken by Joshua Levy and Trevor Pollock in the late 1960s.

Elasticity is an important concept in neoclassical economic theory, and enables in the understanding of various economic concepts, such as the incidence of indirect taxation, marginal concepts relating to the theory of the firm, distribution of wealth, and different types of goods relating to the theory of consumer choice. An understanding of elasticity is also important when discussing welfare distribution, in particular consumer surplus, producer surplus, or government surplus.

Elasticity is present throughout many economic theories, with the concept of elasticity appearing in several main indicators. These include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production, cross-price elasticity of demand, and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

In differential calculus, elasticity is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another causative variable. Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable when the latter variable has a causal influence on the former and all other conditions remain the same. For example, the factors that determine consumers&#x27; choice of goods mentioned in consumer theory include the price of the goods, the consumer&#x27;s disposable budget for such goods, and the substitutes of the goods.

Within microeconomics, elasticity and slope are closely linked. For price elasticity, the relationship between the two variables on the x-axis and y-axis can be obtained by analyzing the linear slope of the demand or supply curve or the tangent to a point on the curve. When the tangent of the straight line or curve is steeper, the price elasticity (demand or supply) is smaller; when the tangent of the straight line or curve is flatter, the price elasticity (demand or supply) is higher.

Elasticity is a unitless ratio, independent of the type of quantities being varied. An &quot;elastic&quot; variable (with an absolute elasticity value greater than 1) responds more than proportionally to changes in other variables. A &quot;unit elastic&quot; variable (with an absolute elasticity value equal to 1) responds proportionally to changes in other variables. In contrast, an &quot;inelastic&quot; variable (with an absolute elasticity value less than 1) changes less than proportionally in response to changes in other variables. A variable can have different values of its elasticity at different starting points. For example, for the suppliers of the goods, the quantity of a good supplied by producers might be elastic at low prices but inelastic at higher prices, so that a rise from an initially low price might bring on a more-than-proportionate increase in quantity supplied. In contrast, a raise from an initially high price might bring on a less-than-proportionate rise in quantity supplied.

In empirical work, an elasticity is the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs. Elasticity is a popular tool among empiricists because it is independent of units and thus simplifies data analysis.

== Definition ==
Elasticity is the measure of the sensitivity of one variable to another. A highly elastic variable will respond more dramatically to changes in the variable it is dependent on. The x-elasticity of y measures the fractional response of y to a fraction change in x, which can be written as
:x-elasticity of y: formula_1

In economics, the common elasticities (price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, and cross-price elasticity) all have the same form:
:P-elasticity of Q: formula_2 if continuous, or formula_3 if discrete.
Suppose price rises by 1%. If the elasticity of supply is 0.5, quantity rises by .5%; if it is 1, quantity rises by 1%; if it is 2, quantity rises by 2%.

Special cases:
:Perfectly elastic: formula_4; quantity has an infinite response to even a small price change.
:Perfectly inelastic: formula_5; quantity does not respond at all to a price change.

== Example of calculation ==

Suppose the demand curve is formula_6

Then

formula_7
formula_8
formula_9
The price-elasticity of demand will be:
formula_10

== Maximizing revenue ==

Seller revenue (or, alternatively, consumer expenditure) is maximized when formula_11 (unit elasticity) because at that point a change in price is exactly cancelled by the quantity response, leaving the total revenue formula_12 unchanged. To maximize revenue, a firm must decrease price if demand is inelastic: formula_13 and increase price if demand is elastic: formula_14

As the total revenue is unchanged, we have that

:formula_15

So

:formula_16

:formula_17

:formula_18

The cancellation of the formula_19&#x27;s is justified by the fact that both time differentials are non-zero and the same.

The elasticity of demand is different at different points of a demand curve, so for most demand functions, including linear demand, a firm following this advice will find some price at which formula_20 and further price changes would reduce revenue. (This is not true for some theoretical demand functions: formula_21 has an elasticity of -.5 for any value of formula_22, so revenue rises infinitely as price rises to infinity even though quantity approaches zero. See Isoelastic function.)

== Types of elasticity ==

=== Price elasticity of demand ===

formula_23

Price elasticity of demand measures sensitivity of demand to price. Thus, it measures the percentage change in demand in response to a change in price. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one per cent change in price (ceteris paribus, i.e. holding constant all the other determinants of demand, such as income). Expressing this mathematically, price elasticity of demand is calculated by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percentage change in the price.

If price elasticity of demand is calculated to be less than 1, the good is said to be inelastic. An inelastic good will respond less than proportionally to a change in price; for example, a price increase of 40% that results in a decrease in demand of 10%.

Goods that are inelastic often have at least one of the following characteristics: 

* Few, if any, available substitutes (e.g. precious metals)
* Essential goods (e.g. petrol)
* Addictive goods (e.g. alcohol, cigarettes)
* Bought infrequently or a small percentage of income (e.g. salt)

For goods with a high elasticity value, consumers will be more sensitive to price changes. For the average consumer, an increase in price of an inessential good with many available substitutes will often result in that consumer not purchasing the good at all, or purchasing one of the substitutes instead.

Example: In the above graphical representation which shows an effect of prices on demand. If the price of the pizza is $20 at which the quantity demanded is 5, if there is an increase in price of pizza to $30 it will lead to decrease in quantity demanded to 3 which shows that small changes in the price of pizza lead to higher changes in quantity demanded.

=== Price elasticity of supply ===
The price elasticity of supply measures how the amount of a good that a supplier wishes to supply changes in response to a change in price. In a manner analogous to the price elasticity of demand, it captures the extent of horizontal movement along the supply curve relative to the extent of vertical movement. If supply elasticity is zero, the supply of a good supplied is &quot;totally inelastic&quot;, and the quantity supplied is fixed. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity supplied by the percentage change in price.

The supply is said to be inelastic when the change in the prices leads to small changes in the quantity of supply. Whereas the elastic supply means the changes in prices causes higher changes in the quantity supplied.

=== Income elasticity of demand ===
Income elasticity of demand is a measure used to show the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good or service to a change in the consumer income. Mathematically, this is calculated by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percentage change in income. Generally, a higher income will increase quantity demanded as consumers will be willing to spend more.

=== Cross-price elasticity of demand ===
Cross-price elasticity of demand (or cross elasticity of demand) measures the sensitivity between the quantity demanded in one good when there is a change in the price of another good. As a common elasticity, it follows a similar formula to price elasticity of demand. Thus, to calculate it the percentage change in the quantity of the first good is divided by the percentage change in price in the second good. The related goods that may be used to determine sensitivity can be complements or substitutes. Finding a high-cross price elasticity between the goods may indicate that they are more likely substitutes and may have similar characteristics. If cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods are likely to be complements.

Real-world examples of cross-price elasticity:

=== Elasticity of scale ===

&quot;Elasticity of scale&quot; or &quot;output elasticity&quot; measures the percentage change in output induced by a collective percent change in the usages of all inputs. A production function or process is said to exhibit constant returns to scale if a percentage change in inputs results in an equal percentage in outputs (an elasticity equal to 1). It exhibits increasing returns to scale if a percentage change in inputs results in greater percentage change in output (an elasticity greater than 1). The definition of decreasing returns to scale is analogous.
== Determinants of elasticity ==

There are various factors that may affect elasticity, and these factors differ for the types of elasticity.

=== Factors affecting price elasticity of demand ===

==== Availability of substitutes ====
If a product has various available substitutes that exist in the market, it is likely that it would be elastic. If a product has a competitive product at a cheaper price in the market in which it shares many characteristics with, it is likely that consumers would deviate to the cheaper substitute. Thus, if many substitutions existed in the market, a consumer would have more choices and the elasticity of demand would be higher (elastic). In contrast, if there were few substitutions that existed in the market, consumers will have fewer choices and little to no available substitutes which means elasticity of demand would be lower (inelastic).

==== Product is necessity or luxury ====
If a product is a necessity to the survival or daily life of a consumer, it is likely to be inelastic. This is due to the fact that if a product is so intrinsically important to the daily life of a consumer, a change in price is not likely to affect its demand.

==== Time elapsed since price changed ====
If the price of a product is increasing and it has little available substitutes, it is likely that the consumer will still continue to pay this higher price. The fact that the consumer needs the good in the short-run, means that he is likely to continue this action regardless in the long-run. This shows inelasticity of demand, because even if there is a huge increase of a product&#x27;s price, there is no reduction of demand. However, if the consumer could not afford the new price of the product, they would likely have to learn to live without it, making the price elastic in the long-run.

==== Percentage Income spent on the good ====
When the consumer spends a considerable portion of their income on goods, it shows elastic demand. This indicates that a change in the price of the goods will have a low impact on the consumer&#x27;s marginal consumption propensity. If the income spent by the consumer on the goods is in a small proportion of their total income which means the price elasticity of demand is low in such case.

Alternatively, we may also determine the factors affecting demand elasticity by considering three &quot;Intuitive factors. Firstly, we may consider that there is different nature of elasticity when weighting a &quot;brand&quot; of a product or a &quot;category&quot; of a product, a particular brand of product is subject to elasticity as other brand may replace it, while a &quot;category&quot; of a product may not be easily replaced by other category of products. Secondly, like a complementary product, there are some commodities that is inelastic as buyer may have proceeding commitment to purchase it in the future, such as vehicle spare part. Thirdly, consumer mostly pay attention to product which cost a majority of share of their spending, hence any change of price in this product or services would be immediately affect consumer demand, hence this kind of product is elastic, while a product which is not part of consumer majority of purchase is inelastic due to &quot;low involvement to products&quot; effect.

=== Factors affecting price elasticity of supply ===

==== Availability of scarce resources in the market ====
It is one factor affecting the price elasticity of any industry if the industry uses scarce resources to produce goods. If there is an increase in demand for the goods, the company will not be able to meet the demand because of the availability of resources. Thus, it will increase the prices of the resources, leading to a corresponding increase in the price of the producer goods. For example, Petrol is a natural resource, and thus it is scarce. If the demand for Petrol increases as there is a scarcity of Petrol, it will lead to an increase in petrol prices.

==== Number of competitors in the industry ====
It means that if the number of competitors is producing the same goods, there is an easy supply of the goods and thus supply is more inelastic with the increase in competitors.

==== Others ====
Like Price Elasticity of Demand, time also affects Price Elasticity of Supply. Though, there are other varying factors that affect this too, such as: capacity, availability of raw materials, flexibility, and the number of competitors in the market. Though, the time horizon is arguably the most influential detriment to price elasticity of supply.

The longer the time horizon, the easier it is for commodity buyers to choose alternative products (substitutes). Further, as the time for suppliers to respond to price changes increases, a given price change will have a more significant impact on supply. However, suppliers can also hire more labour overtime, raise more funds, build more new factories to expand production capacity, and ultimately increase supply. In general, long-term supply is more elastic than short-term supply because producers need some time to adjust their ability to adapt to changes in demand.

==Applications==
The concept of elasticity has an extensive range of applications in economics. In particular, an understanding of elasticity is fundamental in understanding the response of supply and demand in a market.

Elasticity is also an important concept for enterprises and governments. For enterprises, elasticity is relevant in the calculation of the fluctuation of commodity prices, and its relation to income.

For enterprise, the concept of elasticity also can be applied for pricing strategy. At one hand a businessman has to calculate as if reducing price will necessarily increasing the demand of their products, or will it not be necessary so and resolving a lost for the company At the other hand, enterprise have to consider whether Increasing price and cutting production quantity led to greater revenue. To answer that, it is suggested that if the demand of that product is elastic enough, it is profitable for enterprises to cut price and let the demand to increase over time. But in other hand if the price is inelastic, it is profitable to cut the quantity of production and let the price to rise, because as the product is inelastic enough, so consumer have no alternative to purchase other type of product or services to replace it. Though it is clear that the enterprise should not let their product price to pass by that inelasticity threshold, if so, then the product will be subject to price elasticity and be affected by declining demand over time.

For governments, the concept is important for the implementation of taxation. When a government wants to increase taxes on goods, it can use elasticity to judge whether increasing the tax rate will be beneficial. Often, the demand for goods will be significantly reduced when a government increases taxes on them. Whilst a tax increase on inelastic goods will not impact their demand, it may affect goods that are elastic. Aside from taxation, elasticity can also assist in analysing the need for government intervention.

Additionally, for essential goods, the government must ensure that they are available to most consumers. Through setting price ceilings and floors, the government is intervening by ensuring that these goods are reasonably available.

As stated by British political economist David Ricardo, luxury goods taxes have certain advantages over necessities taxes. They are usually paid from income and, therefore, will not reduce the country&#x27;s production capital. For instance, when the price of wine products rises due to increased taxes, consumers can give up drinking wine.

Other common uses of elasticity include:
* Analysis of incidence of the tax burden and other government policies. &quot;See Tax incidence&quot;.
* Income elasticity of demand, used as an indicator of industry health, future consumption patterns, and a guide to firms&#x27; investment decisions. &quot;See Income elasticity of demand&quot;.
* Effect of international trade and terms of trade effects. &quot;See Marshall–Lerner condition and Singer–Prebisch thesis.
* Analysis of consumption and saving behavior. &quot;See Permanent income hypothesis.&quot;
* Analysis of advertising on consumer demand for particular goods. &quot;See Advertising elasticity of demand.&quot;

== Variants ==
In some cases the discrete (non-infinitesimal) arc elasticity is used instead. In other cases, such as modified duration in bond trading, a percentage change in output is divided by a unit (not percentage) change in input, yielding a semi-elasticity instead.

<text>The following is an overview of events in 1985 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable births and deaths.

==Highest-grossing films (U.S.)==

The top ten 1985 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:

===Context===
The year was considered an unsuccessful one for film. Despite a record number of film releases, many films failed at the box office, and ticket sales were down 17% compared with 1984. Industry executives believed the problem, in part, was a lack of original concepts. Films about fantasy and magic failed, as audiences leaned towards science-fiction. Janet Maslin said the fault for this lay partly with Steven Spielberg, who had created such a successful template with films like &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; that many fantasy films had imitated them. There was also a saturation of youth-oriented films targeted at those under 18. Executives were not fond of these films, but the financial rewards were too significant to ignore. The few films aimed at older audiences, like &quot;Cocoon&quot;, were surprise successes. Only &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; were successful blockbusters, earning more than double the box office of &quot;Cocoon&quot;. Films offering escapism and pro-America themes like &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; and &quot;Rocky IV&quot; had also fared well.

The glut of youth-targeted films like &quot;Return to Oz&quot; and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, and science-fiction comedies like &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Real Genius&quot;, and &quot;My Science Project&quot; had resulted in a string of failures. Executives said that the films were all very similar and marketed in the same way, offering no variety for audiences.

==Events==
* April – Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Group Publications officially acquires 50% of TCF Holdings, parent company of 20th Century Fox, for $250 million from Marvin Davis and his family.
*June 5 – The Chicago Cubs play the Atlanta Braves in a baseball game at Wrigley Field. Excerpts from the broadcast later pin this date as the day featured in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.
* December 3 – Roger Moore steps down from the role of James Bond after twelve years and seven films. He is replaced by Timothy Dalton.

==Awards==

<text>Judith Arundell Wright (31 May 191525 June 2000) was an Australian poet, environmentalist and campaigner for Aboriginal land rights. She was a recipient of the Christopher Brennan Award and nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, 1965 and 1967.

==Biography==
Judith Wright was born in Armidale, New South Wales. The eldest child of Phillip Wright and his first wife, Ethel, she spent most of her formative years in Brisbane and Sydney. Wright was of Cornish ancestry. Following the early death of her mother, she lived with her aunt and then boarded at New England Girls&#x27; School after her father&#x27;s remarriage in 1929. After graduating, Wright studied philosophy, English, psychology and history at the University of Sydney. At the beginning of World War II, she returned to her father&#x27;s station (ranch) to help during the shortage of labour caused by the war.

Wright&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;The Moving Image&quot;, was published in 1946 while she was working at the University of Queensland as a research officer. Then, she had also worked with Clem Christesen on the literary magazine &quot;Meanjin,&quot; the first edition of which was published in late 1947. In 1950 she moved to Mount Tamborine, Queensland, with the novelist and abstract philosopher Jack McKinney. Their daughter Meredith was born in the same year. They married in 1962, but Jack was to live only until 1966.

In 1966, she published &quot;The Nature of Love&quot;, her first collection of short stories, through Sun Press, Melbourne. Set mainly in Queensland, they include &#x27;The Ant-lion&#x27;, &#x27;The Vineyard Woman&#x27;, &#x27;Eighty Acres&#x27;, &#x27;The Dugong&#x27;, &#x27;The Weeping Fig&#x27; and &#x27;The Nature of Love&#x27;, all first published in The Bulletin. Wright was nominated for the 1967 Nobel Prize for Literature.

With David Fleay, Kathleen McArthur and Brian Clouston, Wright was a founding member and, from 1964 to 1976, president, of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland. In 1991, she was the second Australian to receive the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry.

She was involved in the Poets Union.

For the last three decades of her life, Wright lived near the New South Wales town of Braidwood. She moved to the Braidwood area to be closer to H. C. &quot;Nugget&quot; Coombs, her lover of 25 years, who was based in Canberra.

Wright started to lose her hearing in her mid-20s and became completely deaf by 1992.

==Poet and critic==

Wright was the author of collections of poetry, including &quot;The Moving Image&quot;, &quot;Woman to Man&quot;, &quot;The Gateway&quot;, &quot;The Two Fires&quot;, &quot;Birds&quot;, &quot;The Other Half&quot;, &quot;Magpies&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Hunting Snake&quot;. Her work is noted for a keen focus on the Australian environment, which began to gain prominence in Australian art in the years following World War II. She deals with the relationship between settlers, Indigenous Australians and the bush, among other themes. Wright&#x27;s aesthetic centres on the relationship between mankind and the environment, which she views as the catalyst for poetic creation. Her images characteristically draw from the Australian flora and fauna, yet contain a mythic substrata that probes at the poetic process, limitations of language, and the correspondence between inner existence and objective reality.

Wright&#x27;s poems have been translated into a number of languages, including Italian, Japanese and Russian. Along with Brendan Kennelly, she is the most featured poet in &quot;The Green Book of Poetry&quot;, a large ecopoetry anthology by Ivo Mosley (Frontier Publishing 1993), which was published by Harper San Francisco in 1996 as &quot;Earth Poems: Poems from Around the World to Honor the Earth&quot;.

===&quot;Birds&quot;===
In 2003, the National Library of Australia published an expanded edition of Wright&#x27;s collection titled &quot;Birds&quot;. Most of these poems were written in the 1950s when she was living on Tamborine Mountain in southeast Queensland. Meredith McKinney, Wright&#x27;s daughter, writes that they were written at &quot;a precious and dearly-won time of warmth and bounty to counterbalance at last what felt, in contrast, the chilly dearth and difficulty of her earlier years&quot;. McKinney goes on to say that &quot;many of these poems have a newly relaxed, almost conversational tone and rhythm, an often humorous ease and an intimacy of voice that surely reflects the new intimacies and joys of her life&quot;. Despite the joy reflected in the poems, however, they also acknowledge &quot;the experiences of cruelty, pain and death that are inseparable from the lives of birds as of humans ... and [turn] a sorrowing a clear-sighted gaze on the terrible damage we have done and continue to do to our world, even as we love it&quot;.

==Environmentalism and social activism==
Wright campaigned in support of the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and Fraser Island. With some of her 
friends, she helped found one of the earliest nature conservation movements. 

She was also an advocate for Aboriginal land rights. Tom Shapcott, reviewing &quot;With Love and Fury&quot;, her posthumous collection of selected letters published in 2007, comments that her letter on this topic to the Australian prime minister John Howard was &quot;almost brutal in its scorn&quot;. Shortly before her death, she attended a march in Canberra for reconciliation between non-indigenous Australians and the Aboriginal people.

==Awards==
* 1975 – Christopher Brennan Award
* 1991 – Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry
* 1994 – Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Poetry Award for &quot;Collected Poems&quot;
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Judith Wright was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for her role as an &quot;Influential Artists&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Wright died in Canberra on 25 June 2000, aged 85.
In June 2006 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) announced that the new federal electorate in Queensland, which was to be created at the 2007 federal election, would be named Wright in honour of her accomplishments as a &quot;poet and in the areas of arts, conservation and indigenous affairs in Queensland and Australia&quot;. However, in September 2006 the AEC announced it would name the seat after John Flynn, the founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, due to numerous objections from people fearing the name Wright may be linked to disgraced former Queensland ALP MP Keith Wright. Under the 2009 redistribution of Queensland, a new seat in southeast Queensland was created and named in Wright&#x27;s honour; it was first contested in 2010.

The Judith Wright Arts Centre in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, is named after her.

On 2 January 2008, it was announced that a future suburb in the district of Molonglo Valley, Canberra would be named &quot;Wright&quot;. There is a street in the Canberra suburb of Franklin named after her, as well. Another of the Molonglo Valley suburbs was named after Wright&#x27;s lover, &quot;Nugget&quot; Coombs.

The Judith Wright Award was awarded as part of the ACT Poetry Award by the ACT Government between 2005 and 2011, for a published book of poems by an Australian poet.

The Judith Wright Poetry Prize for New and Emerging Poets (worth ), was established in 2007 by &quot;Overland&quot; magazine.

The Judith Wright Calanthe Award has been awarded as part of the Queensland Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards since 2004.

<doc id="171618" wikidata="Q1466736" url="?curid=171618" title="Pollock (film)">
<text>Pollock is a 2000 American independent biographical drama film centered on the life of American painter Jackson Pollock, his struggles with alcoholism, as well as his troubled marriage to his wife Lee Krasner. The film stars Ed Harris, Marcia Gay Harden, Jennifer Connelly, Robert Knott, Bud Cort, Molly Regan, and Sada Thompson, and was directed by Harris.

Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for portraying Lee Krasner. Ed Harris received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Pollock. The film was a long-term personal project for Harris based on his reading of the 1989 biography &quot;Jackson Pollock: An American Saga&quot;, written by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith.

==Plot==
In the 1940s, abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock exhibits paintings in occasional group art shows.

Pollock lives with his brother Sande and sister-in-law Arloie at a tiny apartment in New York City. With Arloie expecting a new baby, Pollock decides to move out on her behalf. Soon afterward, Pollock meets and takes an interest in artist Lee Krasner. He learns later that his brother has taken a job in Connecticut building military gliders to avoid the draft.

Pollock, a struggling alcoholic, goes on a drinking binge and is found in a disheveled state by Sande and Lee to which Sande tells Lee that Pollock has been diagnosed as &quot;clinically neurotic.&quot; Taking pity on Pollock, Lee takes him home and becomes his manager.

One day, Pollock&#x27;s old friend Reuben Kadish visits him, bringing along Howard Putzel, who works for wealthy art collector Peggy Guggenheim. After Guggenheim views his work, he is given a contract to exhibit his paintings, plus a commission to paint a 8 ft by 20 ft mural in her New York townhouse entry way. Pollock&#x27;s first exhibit fails to attract any buyers. After a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, a drunken Pollock almost sleeps with Peggy. Afterwards, he falls into another stupor upon hearing that Putzel has died.

Pollock and Lee are wed after Lee says they either marry or &quot;split up&quot; before moving to Long Island. During a get-together at Peggy&#x27;s, Pollock dismisses art critic Clement Greenberg&#x27;s comments and refuses to change his painting style to be more marketable. Pollock&#x27;s paintings are not selling but Clement assures him it will change after a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article about him is published and his upcoming exhibit.

Pollock and Lee&#x27;s relationship is strained after he openly flirts with another woman. Meanwhile, to earn more income, Pollock tries various occupations but fails due to his alcoholism. He lies to Sande about his financial status, though this improves after the &quot;Life&quot; story about him is published. Later, cinematographer Hans Namuth films Pollock as he paints, though Namuth&#x27;s presence interrupts the spontaneous nature of his work. Pollock, who tried abstaining from alcohol, inadvertently ruins Thanksgiving dinner upon relapsing.

&quot;In medias res&quot; to the events of the film, Pollock autographs a copy of the &quot;Life&quot; magazine to a fan at an art exhibit in 1950. Five years after the exhibit, Clement tells Pollock that the &quot;Partisan Review&quot; is favoring artist Clyfford Still, saying that his original technique could be the next direction of modern art.

A drunk Pollock reacts badly, becoming angrier when Lee berates him for his drinking and womanizing. By this moment, Pollock&#x27;s marriage to Lee has become even more strained due to her refusal to conceive children with him, all of which has led Pollock to start an extramarital affair with abstract artist Ruth Kligman.

In 1956, following a conversation with Lee over the phone while she is in Venice, Pollock tells Ruth &quot;I owe the woman something.&quot; On a subsequent visit, Ruth brings along her friend Edith before the three go for a drive. An intoxicated Pollock crashes the car, killing himself and Edith, and throwing Ruth into a ditch, seriously injuring her.

A textual epilogue reveals Lee never remarried following Pollock&#x27;s death.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was adapted by Barbara Turner and Susan Emshwiller from the book &quot;Jackson Pollock: An American Saga&quot; by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. It was directed by Harris.

This film was a longtime passion project for Ed Harris. After his father gave him a copy of Pollock&#x27;s biography, he started thinking about adapting it, which took almost 10 years to bring to fruition.

Filming took a mere 50 days with a six-week layoff after forty days so Harris could take time to gain thirty pounds and grow a beard.

Harris himself did all the painting seen in the film.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;&quot;Pollock&quot; is confident, insightful work–one of the year&#x27;s best films. Harris is always a good actor but here seems possessed, as if he had a leap of empathy for Pollock. His direction is assured, economical, knows where it&#x27;s going and what it wants to do. No fancy visual gimmicks, just the look and feel of this world.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Pollock&quot; opened on December 15, 2000 in the US and Canada in a limited release in 2 theaters and grossed $44,244 with an average of $22,122 per theater and ranking #37 at the box office. The film&#x27;s widest release was 280 theaters and it ended up earning $8,598,593 domestically and $1,960,377 internationally for a total of $10,558,970.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;Pollock&quot; was released on February 13, 2001.

<text>Abraham Washington Attell (February 22, 1883 – February 7, 1970), often referred to by newspapers as &quot;The Little Hebrew&quot;, was an American boxer who became known for his record-setting, six year consecutive reign as World Featherweight Champion from 1906 to 1912, and his nearly consecutive ten-year reign starting in 1902. Said to be a friend of the gangster Arnold Rothstein, Attell was charged with game fixing in the Black Sox Scandal in 1919, but the charges were dismissed before trial. He also was suspected of other infractions including fixing fights, and using drugs during a fight.

==Life and career==
Attell was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Jewish parents. Many sources give his year of birth as 1884, but in an article published in the October 1961 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine, he stated that he had turned 78 that year. A copy of his passport also gives his birth year as 1883, and the 1900 U.S. Census gives his age as 17. Growing up in a mostly Irish neighborhood, he was often involved in fights with neighborhood boys. He said as a kid, he sometimes had up to 10 bouts each day. After his father abandoned the family when Attell was 13, he sold newspapers to earn money. Selling at the corner of 8th and Market, near the Mechanics Pavilion, a frequent venue for important boxing matches, Attell watched the fight between Solly Smith and George Dixon for the world&#x27;s Featherweight championship. With that, Attell and his brothers Caesar and Monte became convinced they might have futures in boxing.

Attell&#x27;s first professional fight was at age 17 on August 19, 1900, when he knocked out Kid Lennett in two rounds at the San Francisco Athletic Club. His mother, who strongly opposed his boxing, later became one of his staunchest supporters, betting on him to win.

==World featherweight champion==
After winning 10 fights in a row by knockout, Attell moved to Denver, Colorado. At the age of 18, he fought George Dixon and beat him in a 15-round decision after having drawn with him twice before. In 1903, he beat Johnny Reagan in a 20 round decision to claim the previously vacated featherweight title one year after Young Corbett II vacated.

Attell successfully defended his title twenty-two times between 1906 and 1912, which to this day remains a division record. Among other opponents, Attell beat Battling Nelson and Johnny Kilbane during this period. He was often called &quot;The Little Champ&quot; or &quot;The Little Hebrew&quot; by newspapers. From 1909 to 1910, his brother Monte Attell, called the &quot;Nob Hill Terror&quot;, held the Bantamweight Championship, making them the first brothers to hold world titles simultaneously. His brother, Caesar Attell also fought and was called &quot;Two and a Half,&quot; for always giving that amount whenever the hat was passed for charity at a boxing event, which he attended faithfully. During his time as world featherweight champion, Attell was allegedly involved with gambler/gangster Arnold Rothstein. According to some accounts, they became good friends during this period.

Attell defeated American 1905 World Bantamweight Champion Jimmy Walsh three times in title matches; on September 12, 1907, for a ten-round decision in Indianapolis, on December 7, 1906, in a ten-round TKO in Los Angeles, and on February 22, 1906, for a fifteen-round decision in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in which Attell &quot;badly punished&quot; Walsh. Not surprisingly, Attell was the odds on favorite for the December 1906 fight. He met Attell twice in non-title matches on April 3, 1913, in New York in a ten-round loss by decision and on October 24, 1912, in a twelve-round draw in Boston. After the April 3, 1913, New York bout, Walsh&#x27;s manager Eddie Keevin filed charges against Attell with the New York boxing commission stating that Attell had used eye gouging against Walsh during the fight.

===Later career===
Attell lost his World Featherweight Title to Johnny Kilbane in 1912, in a 20-round decision. Kilbane claimed that Attell&#x27;s handlers put chloroform on the fighter&#x27;s glove to blind him. Other witnesses claimed other illegal tactics were used in the fight. On July 4, 1913, Attell accidentally hit a referee during a win against Willie Beecher. He finally retired in 1917. Attell managed one boxer, Marty Goldman. He coached him to a 33 Win (10 ko&#x27;s), 11 Loss, 3 Draw record in 47 career fights.

After his professional boxing career ended, Attell operated a shoe store in New York City, doing a good business selling to customers, fans and sporting people who came in to see him. He gave up the shoe business around June 1916 to go into vaudeville.

His name was later linked to the infamous Black Sox baseball scandal of 1919. He was alleged to have been the bag man for gambler Arnold Rothstein and to have given $10,000 to several Chicago White Sox players. They had in return agreed to throw the World Series with Cincinnati. When the scandal broke in 1920, Attell went to Canada for a year to avoid being subpoenaed. Rothstein was never indicted for the crime.

===Black Sox Scandal===
In 1920 Attell was accused of being the messenger between the gangster Rothstein and players of the Chicago White Sox baseball organization, during the planning stages of the fix of the 1919 World Series. Prior to the series, Attell had been approached by former fighter Billy Maharg and former Major League Baseball pitcher &quot;Sleepy&quot; Bill Burns in their bid to get Rothstein to financially back the fix. The Black Sox scandal was considered a major outrage in sports and Attell&#x27;s name appeared in newspaper headlines related to the scandal. He and many White Sox players were formally charged with several counts, including fixing the event, however Rothstein was never charged. All were eventually acquitted at trial, but Major League Baseball banned them from participating in baseball activities at any level. Attell denied having been involved in any talks about fixing the series and convinced the jury that the wrong Abe Attell was accused.

Attell died in New Paltz, New York, on February 7, 1970.

===The Great Depression and beyond===

Following the 1919 Major League Baseball gambling impropriety, which did much to taint a spectacular featherweight career, Attell lived a full and extraordinary life.

In 2017, McFarland &amp; Company published the first comprehensive biography of Attell, &quot;The Fighting Times of Abe Attell&quot;, by author Mark Allen Baker.

==Legacy and honors==
Attell was inducted posthumously as a member of various halls of fame:

<text>The following is an overview of events in 1984 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths.

The year&#x27;s highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada was &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; overtook it, however, with a re-release the following year. It was the first time in five years that the top-grossing film did not involve George Lucas or Steven Spielberg although Spielberg directed and Lucas executive produced/co-wrote the third placed &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;; Spielberg also executive produced the fourth placed &quot;Gremlins&quot;.

U.S. box office grosses reached $4 billion for the first time and it was the first year that two films had returned over $100 million to their distributors with both &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; achieving this. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; made it three for films released in 1984 after its performance during 1985 took it to rentals of $108 million. Other popular films included &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;, which was the most expensive film produced in West Germany, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. A high number of sci-fi/fantasy films were released in 1984.

<text>Quills is a 2000 period film directed by Philip Kaufman and adapted from the Obie award-winning 1995 play by Doug Wright, who also wrote the original screenplay. Inspired by the life and work of the Marquis de Sade, &quot;Quills&quot; re-imagines the last years of the Marquis&#x27;s incarceration in the insane asylum at Charenton. It stars Geoffrey Rush as de Sade, Kate Winslet as laundress Madeleine &quot;Maddie&quot; LeClerc, Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé de Coulmier, and Michael Caine as Dr. Royer-Collard.

Well received by critics, &quot;Quills&quot; garnered acclaim for its performances from Rush and Winslet and for its screenplay. The film received nominations for three Academy Awards, four BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. The National Board of Review named it the Best Film of 2000. The Writers Guild of America awarded Doug Wright with the Paul Selvin Award.
The film was a modest art house success, averaging $27,709 per screen its debut weekend, and eventually grossing $17,989,277 internationally. Noted for its artistic licenses, &quot;Quills&quot; filmmakers and writers said they were not making a biography of de Sade, but exploring issues such as censorship, pornography, sex, art, mental illness, and religion.

==Plot==
In Paris, the encarcerated Marquis de Sade is confined to the asylum at Charenton, overseen by the Abbé du Coulmier. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine &quot;Maddy&quot; LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher. The Marquis&#x27; latest work, &quot;Justine&quot;, is published on the black market to great success. Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte orders all copies burned and the author shot, but his advisor, Delbené, suggest another idea: send Dr. Royer-Collard to silence the Marquis. Meanwhile, the Abbé teaches Madeleine to read and write.

Dr. Royer-Collard later arrives. The Abbé rejects Royer-Collard&#x27;s offers of aggressive archaic &quot;treatments&quot; and speaks with the Marquis himself, who swears obedience. Royer-Collard then travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage Simone. They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a young architect, Prouix, on hand for its renovation.

The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition. The audacious play, titled &quot;The Crimes of Love&quot;, is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abbé do more to control the Marquis. Infuriated, the Abbé confiscates the Marquis&#x27; quills and ink, prompting more subversive behavior, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. The Marquis is eventually left naked in an empty cell. A maid reveals that Madeleine has been helping the Marquis. Madeleine is whipped on the order of Royer-Collard until the Abbé stops him by offering himself instead and declaring that she will be sent away. That night, she visits the Abbé&#x27;s chamber to beg him to reconsider sending her away and confesses her love for him in the process, prompting him to kiss her. However, he abruptly breaks away.

Meanwhile, Royer-Collard rapes Simone on their wedding night, and keeps her as a virtual prisoner. She purchases a copy of Justine, seduces Prioux, and the lovers run off together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of Justine. Upon finding this, Royer-Collard seizes on the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge.

About to be sent away from Charenton, Madeleine begs a last story from the Marquis, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and kills Madeleine. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells.

Madeleine&#x27;s body is found by her blind mother and the Abbé in the laundry vat. Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine&#x27;s death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims that he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told that she died a virgin. The Abbé cuts out the Marquis&#x27; tongue as punishment. The Abbé then has a dream in which he has sex with Madeline&#x27;s corpse. The Marquis&#x27; health declines, but he perseveres, decorating his oubliette with a story, using feces as ink. As the Marquis lays dying, the Abbé reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.

A year later, the new Abbé arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis&#x27; old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abbé, who is herded off by Royer-Collard, now overseer of the asylum. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine&#x27;s mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.

==Cast==
* Geoffrey Rush as the Marquis de Sade; Director Philip Kaufman encouraged Rush to portray the Marquis as something of a dissolute rock star holed up in the Ritz Carlton. Rush used Francine du Plessix Gray&#x27;s 1998 biography &quot;At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life&quot; as a reference and had previously acted in a production of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;.
* Kate Winslet as Madeleine &quot;Maddy&quot; LeClerc; Screenwriter Doug Wright called Winslet the &quot;patron saint&quot; of the movie for being the first big name to back it, expressing interest as early as April 1999.
* Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé du Coulmier; Before settling on Phoenix, casting directors considered Jude Law, Guy Pearce, and Billy Crudup for the role.
* Michael Caine as Dr. Royer-Collard; Kaufman drew comparisons between Royer-Collard and Kenneth Starr, particularly the publication of de Sade&#x27;s works at the Charenton Printing Press and the release of Starr&#x27;s report online.
* Billie Whitelaw as Madame LeClerc
* Stephen Marcus as Bouchon
* Amelia Warner as Simone
* Stephen Moyer as Prioux
* Jane Menelaus as Renée Pelagie
* Ron Cook as Napoléon I Bonaparte
* Patrick Malahide as Delbené
* Elizabeth Berrington as Charlotte
* Tony Pritchard as Valcour
* Michael Jenn as Cleante
* Edward Tudor-Pole as Franval

==Production==
The interior set of Charenton was built at Pinewood Studios, where most of the filming took place. Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, and London stood in for the exterior shots of early 19th century France. Production designer Martin Childs imagined the primary location of Charenton as an airy, though circuitous place, darkening as Royer-Collard takes over operations. The screenplay specifies the way the inmates&#x27; rooms link together, which plays a key role in the relay of the Marquis&#x27; climactic story to Madeleine. Screenwriter/playwright Doug Wright was a constant presence on set, assisting the actors and producers in interpreting the script and bringing his vision to life. Casting directors Donna Isaacson and Priscilla John recruited a number of actors from a disabled actor&#x27;s company to play the parts of many of the inmates at Charenton.

Costume designer Jacqueline West created the intricate period costumes, using each character as inspiration. West previously worked with director Philip Kaufman on his crime drama &quot;Rising Sun&quot;. For Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s Abbé, costumers designed special &quot;pleather&quot; clogs to accommodate the actor&#x27;s veganism. In one scene, Rush&#x27;s Marquis de Sade wears a suit decorated in bloody script, which West described as &quot;challenging&quot; to make. It features actual writings of de Sade and costumers planned exactly where each sentence should go on the fabric. Before production began, West gave Winslet a copy of French painter Léopold Boilly&#x27;s &quot;Woman Ironing&quot; to give her a feel for the character, which Winslet said greatly influenced her performance.

==Music==
The &quot;Quills&quot; soundtrack was released by RCA Victor on 21 November 2000 featuring the music of Oscar-winning composer Stephen Warbeck (&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;). Featuring experimental instrumentation on such instruments as the serpent, the mediaeval shawm, and the bucket, most reviewers were intrigued by the unconventional and thematic score. Cinemusic.net reviewer Ryan Keaveney called the album a &quot;macabre masterpiece&quot;, with an &quot;addicting and mesmerizing&quot; sound. &quot;Urban Cinephile&quot; contributor Brad Green described the album as a &quot;hedonistic pleasure&quot; that &quot;captures the spirit of an incorrigible, perverse genius.&quot; Soundtrack.net&#x27;s Glenn McClanan disliked the &quot;lack of unifying unified themes and motifs&quot; that may have served each individual scene, but made the film feel &quot;incoherent.&quot;

Though not included on the soundtrack, the opening notes of &quot;Au Clair de la Lune,&quot; a traditional French children&#x27;s song, recur throughout the film, usually hummed by the Marquis. The song is originally sung by John Hamway during the opening scene of a beheading which was filmed in Oxford. The English translation provides some illumination as to its selection as a theme for the Marquis:
By the light of the moon,&lt;br&gt;
My friend Pierrot,&lt;br&gt;
Lend me your quill, &lt;br&gt;
To write a word.&lt;br&gt;
My candle is dead,&lt;br&gt;
I have no more fire.&lt;br&gt;
Open your door for me&lt;br&gt;
For the love of God.

By the light of the moon,&lt;br&gt;
Pierrot replied:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I don&#x27;t have any pens,&lt;br&gt;
I am in my bed&lt;br&gt;
Go to the neighbor&#x27;s,&lt;br&gt;
I think she&#x27;s there&lt;br&gt;
Because in her kitchen&lt;br&gt;
Someone is lighting the fire...&quot;

==Release==
===Box office===
Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures in 2000, &quot;Quills&quot; premiered in the United States at the Telluride Film Festival on 2 September 2000. It was given a limited release on 22 November 2000, with a wider release following on 15 December 2000. The film earned $249,383 its opening weekend in nine theaters, totaling $7,065,332 domestically and $10,923,895 internationally, for a total of $17,989,227.

===Critical reception===
The film holds a 75% &quot;fresh&quot; rating at the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Though hard to watch, this film&#x27;s disturbing exploration of freedom of expression is both seductive and thought-provoking.&quot; It has an average score of 70/100 at Metacritic, based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; complimented the &quot;euphoric stylishness&quot; of Kaufman&#x27;s direction and Geoffrey Rush&#x27;s &quot;gleeful... flamboyant&quot; performance. Peter Travers for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote about the &quot;exceptional&quot; actors, particularly Geoffrey Rush&#x27;s &quot;scandalously good&quot; performance as the Marquis, populating a film that is &quot;literate, erotic, and spoiling to be heard&quot;. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com enthused over the &quot;delectable and ultimately terrifying fantasy&quot; of &quot;Quills&quot;, with Rush as &quot;sun king&quot;, enriched by a &quot;luminous&quot; supporting cast.

In a December 2000 review, film critic Roger Ebert, rated it 3.5 stars out of 4 and stated, &quot;The message of &#x27;Quills&#x27; is perhaps that we are all expressions of our natures, and to live most successfully we must understand that.&quot;

The film was not without its detractors, including Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, who decried director Philip Kaufman&#x27;s approach as &quot;brutally horrific, vulgarly unamusing&quot;, creating a film that succeeds only as &quot;soft-gore porn&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; dismissed the picture as an &quot;overripe contrivance masquerading as high art&quot;, while de Sade biographer Neil Schaeffer in &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised it for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de Sade&#x27;s complex life.

== Awards and nominations ==

==Artistic licenses==
Neil Schaeffer, detailed a number of disparities between fact and film. Schaeffer, whose &quot;The Marquis de Sade: A Life&quot; was used by Director Philip Kaufman as reference, in a review published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, criticised the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de Sade&#x27;s complex life.

Schaeffer relates that de Sade&#x27;s initial incarceration &quot;had nothing to do with his writing&quot; but with sexual scandals involving servants, prostitutes, and his sister-in-law. He also criticised the opening scene&#x27;s implication that the reign of terror caused the &quot;sanguinary streak&quot; of de Sade&#x27;s writing, when &quot;his bloodiest and best work, &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot;, was written in the Bastille – obviously before the revolution&quot; and not at Charenton, as suggested by the film. In contrast to the film, the historical de Sade was &quot;not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers&quot; while at Charenton, nor did he cut the &quot;tall, trim figure of the Australian actor Geoffrey Rush&quot; but was of middling height and, at the time, of a &quot;considerable, even a grotesque, obesity&quot;.

The manuscripts smuggled out of the asylum were not the novel &quot;Justine&quot;, which features prominently in the film but was published thirteen years before de Sade&#x27;s incarceration at the asylum. De Sade&#x27;s smuggled works were not particularly outrageous, mostly consisting of conventional novels and a number of plays he worked on throughout his life in hopes of having them performed. Most of these were soundly rejected by publishers. De Sade was, in fact, involved in the theater productions at Charenton, though none like the play featured in &quot;Quills.&quot; The plays performed were popular, conventional Parisian dramas. The government shut the Charenton theater down on 6 May 1813, years before the real Dr. Royer-Collard had any influence at Charenton.

Schaeffer criticised also the film&#x27;s treatment of de Sade&#x27;s personal relations regarding his wife (who had formally separated from him after the revolution), the chambermaid (who did not serve as a liaison to a publisher but with whom he had a sexual relationship from her early teens until shortly before his death), and his &quot;companion of many years&quot; who had a room at Charenton (and actually smuggled out the manuscripts) but is ignored by the film. Furthermore, &quot;De Sade&#x27;s hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth, for he died in his sleep, in his 74th year, as peacefully as any good Christian&quot;.

According to Kaufman, Doug Wright did not have the rights to the original translations and therefore had to create and write the passages of de Sade&#x27;s work that are included in the original play and the film. He applied the vocabulary used in the translations to the passages to imitate de Sade&#x27;s style but the archaic language comes across as funny to a modern viewer whereas in the 1700s, as stated by Kaufman, these words were &quot;incendiary&quot;.

<text>The following is an overview of events in 1983 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths.

The top ten 1983 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:

==Events==

*October - Frank Price resigns as president of Columbia Pictures and is replaced by Guy McElwaine.

<text>Training Day is a 2001 American crime thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by David Ayer. It stars Denzel Washington as Alonzo Harris and Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt, two LAPD narcotics officers followed over a 24-hour period in the gang-ridden neighborhoods of Westlake, Echo Park, and South Central Los Angeles. It also features Scott Glenn, Eva Mendes, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.

&quot;Training Day&quot; was released on October 5, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Washington and Hawke&#x27;s performances but were divided on the screenplay. The film received numerous accolades and nominations with Washington&#x27;s performance earning him the Academy Award for Best Actor and Hawke being nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 74th Academy Awards.

A television series based on the film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, was announced in August 2015 and premiered on February 2, 2017, on CBS. Only Noel Gugliemi, Tom Berenger and Raymond J. Barry reprised their roles. The show was cancelled after one season.

==Plot==

Jake Hoyt, an ambitious LAPD officer, is assigned to work with Detective Alonzo Harris, a highly decorated narcotics officer for a one-day evaluation in order to determine if Jake will be invited to join the narcotics squad. Driving around in Alonzo&#x27;s Monte Carlo, they begin the day by catching some college kids buying marijuana. Alonzo confiscates the drugs, puts them into a pipe and tells Jake to smoke it. When Jake refuses, Alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that such a refusal while on the streets would get him killed. Jake smokes the pipe and gets very high. Alonzo laughs, disclosing that it was laced with PCP.

They pay a visit to Roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer. After they leave, Jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to rape Letty, a teenage girl in an alley. Jake intervenes while Alonzo watches him subdue the attackers. After Letty leaves, Alonzo menaces the rapists, but declines to arrest them and Jake collects Letty&#x27;s wallet from the ground.

Later, Alonzo and Jake apprehend a dealer named Blue, who has crack rocks and a loaded handgun in his possession. Rather than go to jail, Blue informs on his employer Kevin &quot;Sandman&quot; Miller, who is in prison. Using a fake search warrant, Alonzo steals $40,000 from Sandman&#x27;s home. At lunch, the two visit Alonzo&#x27;s mistress Sara and their young son. Alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;. Aware that the Russian mafia is hunting Alonzo, they suggest he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation and trades the $40,000 for an arrest warrant.

Alonzo assembles his squad of narcotics officers, and with Jake in tow they return to Roger&#x27;s house and use the warrant to seize $4 million, a quarter of which Alonzo keeps and shares with his squad. Jake refuses to take a share of the money, worrying Alonzo and the other officers. Alonzo executes Roger after Jake refuses his order to do so, staging the scene with his men to make the shooting look justified. Infuriated, Jake gets into a standoff with the corrupt officers. Alonzo reveals he orchestrated the day&#x27;s events to have leverage over Jake and threatens him with the police department&#x27;s post-incident blood test, which will catch the PCP Jake smoked and end his career. Alonzo promises to protect Jake from the drug test in exchange for his cooperation and Jake begrudgingly complies.

Later that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a Sureño gangster named Smiley for an errand. As he waits for Alonzo, Jake reluctantly plays poker with Smiley and his fellow gang members, Sniper and Moreno. Smiley then explains Alonzo&#x27;s situation: Alonzo got into a fight with a connected Russian mobster in Las Vegas and killed him. Alonzo must pay a million dollars as compensation, or be killed himself. Additionally, Smiley reveals Alonzo has abandoned Jake and paid Smiley to kill him. Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. Moreno searches Jake for money and finds the wallet of Letty, who happens to be Smiley&#x27;s cousin. After calling Letty and confirming that Jake saved her, Smiley releases Jake out of gratitude.

An infuriated Jake returns to Sara&#x27;s apartment to arrest Alonzo before he leaves to pay the Russians with Roger&#x27;s money. A gunfight and chase ensue, and Alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood gathers to watch. Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jake, but the neighborhood residents, tired of Alonzo&#x27;s abuse, refuse. Jake takes the stolen cash to submit as evidence against Alonzo and the neighborhood gang allows him to leave safely with earned respect. An enraged Alonzo, realizing his plan has been foiled, unravels into a final desperate tantrum and threatens retaliation against the neighborhood, but, knowing he no longer holds any sway over them, the residents ignore Alonzo and walk away during his rant. Alonzo attempts to flee for the Los Angeles International Airport, but is ambushed and gunned down by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzo&#x27;s death.

==Production==
===Development===
Although corruption in the LAPD&#x27;s C.R.A.S.H. unit was yet to be exposed when &quot;Training Day&quot; was written, Antoine Fuqua has stated that the emergence of the Rampart Scandal in the late 1990s catalyzed the completion of the film. Denzel Washington also grew a beard in order to emulate the appearance of Rafael Pérez, an LAPD narcotics officer involved in multiple scandals. Fuqua wanted Washington&#x27;s character to be seductive and part of a machine, and not just a random rogue cop. In Washington&#x27;s own words: &quot;I think in some ways he&#x27;s done his job too well. He&#x27;s learned how to manipulate, how to push the line further and further, and, in the process, he&#x27;s become more hard-core than some of the guys he&#x27;s chasing.&quot;

Fuqua also saw Ethan Hawke&#x27;s character as generally honorable but so driven by ambition that he was willing to compromise his principles, particularly when following the charming and persuasive example of Washington&#x27;s character. He has said that he fought with studio executives who wanted to cut the Three Wise Men scene, thinking it slowed the film. He insisted that the scene was pivotal in establishing that at least some of Alonzo&#x27;s illegal actions were sanctioned by his superiors who regarded unethical behavior as a necessary evil.

Fuqua wanted &quot;Training Day&quot; to look as authentic as possible, and he shot on location in some of the most infamous neighborhoods of Los Angeles. He even obtained permission to shoot in the Imperial Courts housing project, the first time L.A. street gangs had allowed a film crew to be brought into that neighborhood. The crew also filmed in Hoover Block and Baldwin Village. Parts of the film were shot on the dead end street Palmwood Drive, where Black P. Stones gang members were seen on the rooftops. Cle Shaheed Sloan, the gang technical advisor of &quot;Training Day&quot;, managed to get on screen real-life gang members from Rollin&#x27; 60 Crips, PJ Watts Crips, and Black P. Stones. According to Fuqua, the actors and crew ended up receiving a warm welcome from local residents. When he was unable to shoot a scene directly on location, he recreated the locations on sets.

There were also two police officers on hand as technical advisors, Michael Patterson and Paul Lozada (the latter from the San Francisco Police Department). Washington, Hawke and other cast members also met with undercover police officers, local drug dealers, and gang members to help understand their roles better.

===Casting===
Davis Guggenheim was originally attached to direct the film, with Matt Damon as Jake Hoyt and Samuel L. Jackson as Alonzo Harris. Once Washington became attached to the project, however, he requested to have Guggenheim replaced with Fuqua. Eminem was offered the role of Hoyt, but turned it down in order to focus on preparing for &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002). If he had appeared, he would&#x27;ve shared scenes with his mentor Dr. Dre as well as Snoop Dogg, both of whom do appear in the film. Tobey Maguire, Paul Walker, Freddie Prinze Jr., Ryan Phillippe, and Scott Speedman all auditioned for the role of Hoyt.

===Music===

A soundtrack to the film was released on September 11, 2001, by Priority Records. It peaked at 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 19 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and spawned two hit singles, Nelly&#x27;s &quot;#1&quot; and Dr. Dre and DJ Quik&#x27;s &quot;Put It on Me&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Training Day&quot; was originally scheduled for release on September 21, 2001, and had a strong advertising push. However, following the September 11 attacks, the film was pushed back to October 5, 2001, replacing &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;″s original release date.

===Home media===
&quot;Training Day&quot; was initially released on DVD and VHS on March 19, 2002. A Blu-ray version was initially released on August 1, 2006. A 4K Blu-ray version was released on February 28, 2023.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Training Day&quot; opened at number one, grossing $22.5million, ahead of fellow new release &quot;Serendipity&quot; in second place. Upon opening, it achieved the second-highest October opening weekend, behind &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. It repeated in the top spot in its second weekend, above that week&#x27;s new release of &quot;Bandits&quot; in second place, and spent its first six weeks in the Top 10 at the box office. It went on to gross $76.6million in the United States and Canada, and $28.2million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $104.9million, against a budget of $45million.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert said: &quot;Washington seems to enjoy a performance that&#x27;s over the top and down the other side&quot;. Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, praising both the lead and supporting actors and the film&#x27;s gritty, kinetic energy. He criticized the plot&#x27;s implausibility, but praised its execution, stating: &quot;Ayer&#x27;s screenplay is ingenious in the way it plants clues and pays them off in unexpected ways, so that &#x27;Training Day&#x27; makes as much sense as movies like this usually can.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Michael Rechtshaffen gave the film a positive review, stating: &quot;Denzel Washington ventures into the dark side as a seriously corrupt narcotics cop... and the results are electrifying. So is the picture, thanks to taut, sinewy direction by Antoine Fuqua and a compelling script by David Ayer.&quot;

Denzel Washington&#x27;s performance as Detective Alonzo Harris was highly praised by critics. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Amy Taubin wrote that his &quot;old-fashioned combination of decency and sexiness suggests the African American counterpart to Gregory Peck (in his &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; period), as an LAPD cop so evil he makes Harvey Keitel&#x27;s &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; look like even smaller potatoes than he was meant to be&quot;.

===Accolades===
In June 2003, the American Film Institute named Alonzo Harris the 50th greatest screen villain of all time in its list &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot;.

==TV series adaptation==

On August 7, 2015, it was announced that Antoine Fuqua had decided to develop a television series based on the movie, and had teamed with Jerry Bruckheimer to develop the concept. Warner Bros. Television was shopping the show to the American broadcast networks. Will Beall would write the series, while Fuqua would serve as executive producer, and would direct the potential pilot. CBS ordered a pilot on August 14, 2015. In addition to Fuqua, Bruckheimer, Beall, and Jonathan Littman will serve as executive producers for the series, which is set 15 years after the original film. In May 2016, CBS picked up the series.

In the CBS television series Alonzo is mentioned by Deputy Chief Joy Lockhart when briefing Officer Kyle Craig on sending him undercover at LAPD&#x27;s Special Investigation Section to investigate Detective Frank Roarke. Frank briefly mentions Alonzo at the end of the first season. The series, starring Bill Paxton and Justin Cornwell, premiered on February 2, 2017, with a 13-episode run as a mid-season replacement.

Filming for the first season had been completed in December 2016, so the run was not affected by Paxton&#x27;s death on February 25, 2017, two days after the fourth episode aired. The lowest rated drama series on CBS that season, it was canceled on May 17, 2017, the same week the season finale aired.

==Prequel==
In October 2019, it was reported that Warner Bros. was developing a prequel to &quot;Training Day&quot;. The prequel follows a young Alonzo Harris in late April 1992, two days before the verdict of the Rodney King trial and the associated L.A. riots. The prequel, named &quot;Training Day: Day of the Riot&quot;, was set to start production in California in February 2022, but as of November 2024, the film appears to be still in development.

<text>James the Great (Koinē Greek: Ἰάκωβος, : &quot;Iákōbos&quot;; Aramaic: ܝܥܩܘܒ, : &quot;Yaʿqōḇ&quot;; died AD 44) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. According to the New Testament, he was the second of the apostles to die after Judas Iscariot and the first to be martyred. Saint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to tradition, what are believed to be his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia.

He is also known as James, son of Zebedee, Saint James the Great, Saint James the Greater, Saint James the Elder, or Saint Jacob, James the Apostle or [[Santiago (name)|Santiago]].

==In the New Testament==

James was born into a family of Jewish fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. His parents were Zebedee and Salome. Salome was a sister of Mary (mother of Jesus) which made James the Great a cousin of Jesus. James is styled &quot;the Greater&quot; to distinguish him from the Apostle James &quot;the Less,&quot; with &quot;greater&quot; meaning older or taller, rather than more important. James the Great was the brother of John the Apostle.

James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels state that James and John were preparing to fish with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him.

James, along with his brother John, and Peter, formed an informal triumvirate among the Twelve Apostles. Jesus allowed them to be the only apostles present at three particular occasions during his public ministry, the raising of Jairus&#x27; daughter, transfiguration of Jesus and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. James and John (or, in another tradition, their mother) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, asking if they were ready to drink from the cup he was going to drink from and saying the honor was not even for him to grant. The other apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a Samaritan town, but were rebuked by Jesus.
The Acts of the Apostles records that &quot;Herod the king&quot; (usually identified with Herod Agrippa) had James executed by the sword. Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James&#x27; fiery temper, in which he and his brother earned the nickname &quot;Boanerges&quot; or &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;. F. F. Bruce contrasts this story to that of the Liberation of Saint Peter, and writes that the proposition that &quot;James should die while Peter should escape&quot; is a &quot;mystery of divine providence&quot;.

==Veneration==
In the Catholic tradition, Saint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to legend, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. This name &quot;Santiago&quot; is the local evolution of the Latin genitive &quot;Sancti Iacobi&quot;, &quot;(church or sanctuary) &quot;of Saint James&quot;&quot; (evolved into a personal name in Spanish, and also in Portuguese as &quot;Tiago&quot; which spelled in ancient orthography as &quot;Thiago&quot; and still commonly used as a proper name, with its derivatives &quot;Diego&quot;/&quot;Diogo&quot;). The traditional pilgrimage to the grave of the saint, known as the &quot;Way of St. James&quot;, has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the Early Middle Ages onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stem from Walter Starkie&#x27;s 1957 book, &quot;The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James&quot;. Officially, 327,378 pilgrims registered in 2018 as having completed the final walk ( by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a Compostela. When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a &quot;Holy Year&quot; (a Jacobean holy year) and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years follow a 6-5-6-11 pattern (except when the last year of a century is not a leap year, which can yield a gap of 7 or 12 years). In the 2004 Holy Year, 179,944 pilgrims were received at Compostela. In the 2010 Holy Year, the number had risen to 272,412. The most recent of such Holy Year was 2021; the next will be 2027.

===Feast===

The feast day of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the liturgical calendars of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and certain other Protestant churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern Gregorian Calendar) and on 30 June (Synaxis of the Apostles). The National Day of Galicia is also celebrated on 25 July: St James is its patron saint.

Saint James the Apostle is remembered in the Church of England with the Festival on 25 July.

==Jerusalem==
The site of martyrdom is located within the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Chapel of Saint James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred when King Agrippa ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1–2). His head is believed to be buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.

==Spain==
===Mission in Hispania and burial at Compostela===

The 12th century &quot;Historia Compostelana&quot; commissioned by Diego Gelmírez provides a summary of the legend of St. James, as it was believed at Compostela at that time. Two propositions are central to the legend: first, that James preached the gospel in Hispania as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa, his followers carried his body by sea to Hispania, where they landed at Padrón on the coast of Galicia, then carried it over land for burial at Santiago de Compostela.

According to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Hispania. She appeared upon a pillar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judaea, where he was beheaded by Herod Agrippa I in AD 44.

The translation of his relics from Judaea to Galicia in the northwest of Hispania was, in legend, accomplished by a series of miraculous events: his decapitated body was taken up by angels and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Hispania, where a massive rock closed around his body. Tradition has it that when the disciples of James, Theodore and Athanasius, arrived in Iria Flavia, they approached Queen Lupa about giving them a place to bury his body. Lupa appears in the &quot;Codex Calixtinus&quot; which further relates that she decides to trick the disciples and sends them to the governor of Duio with the intent of having them killed. Sensing a trap, they escape the governor and return to the queen. Once again Lupa tries to deceive them and sends them to Pico Sacro (the Sacred Peak) to collect two of her oxen to carry the necessary material to build the tomb. She does not tell them that the mountain has a cave which is the entrance to hell and is guarded by a dragon. However, the presence of the holy cross protects the disciples from harm and tames the bulls. Upon witnessing the miraculous events, Lupa converts to Christianity and helps build the apostle&#x27;s tomb in Libredon.

The tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the 9th century, by Pelayo in the Libredon forest in the time of Bishop Theodemir and king Alfonso II. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela became a famous pilgrimage site within the Christian world. The Way of St. James is a network of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago de Compostela through northern Spain.

===Medieval &quot;Santiago Matamoros&quot; legend===

An even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary battle of Clavijo, and was henceforth called &quot;Santiago Matamoros&quot; (Saint James the Moor-slayer). &quot;¡Santiago, y cierra, España!&quot; (&quot;St. James and strike for Spain&quot;) was the traditional battle cry of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. Miguel de Cervantes has Don Quixote explaining that &quot;the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector&quot;.

===Emblem===

James&#x27; emblem was the scallop shell (or &quot;cockle shell&quot;), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French term for a scallop is &quot;coquille St. Jacques&quot;, which means &quot;cockle (or mollusc) of [St.] Jacob&quot;. The German word for a scallop is &quot;Jakobsmuschel&quot;, which means &quot;Jacob&#x27;s mussel (or clam)&quot;; the Dutch word is &quot;Jacobsschelp&quot;, meaning &quot;Jacob&#x27;s shell&quot;. In Danish and with the same meaning as in Dutch, the word is &quot;Ibskal&quot; – &quot;Ib&quot; being a Danish version of the name &quot;Jakob&quot; and &quot;skal&quot; meaning &quot;shell&quot;.

===Military Order of Santiago===
The military Order of Santiago, named after Saint Tiago or Saint James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the Moors. Later, as in other orders of chivalry, the membership became a mark of honor.

==Latter-day Saints==
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that in 1829 the Apostles James, Peter and John appeared as heavenly messengers to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon them the Melchizedek priesthood authority of apostolic succession, and thus exclusively on earth to their organization.

According to the teaching, this occurred sometime after May 15, 1829, when John the Baptist similarly appeared to Smith and Cowdery and conferred upon them the Aaronic, or lesser, priesthood, stating that he was doing so under the direction of James, Peter and John.

==In Islam==
The Quranic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John and Simon the Zealot.

<doc id="171626" wikidata="Q913545" url="?curid=171626" title="Ali (film)">
<text>Ali is a 2001 American biographical sports drama film co-written, produced and directed by Michael Mann. The film focuses on ten years in the life of the boxer Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, beginning with his capture of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston in 1964 and ending with his reclaiming the title from George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle fight of 1974.

The project began in 1992 when producer Paul Ardaji optioned the movie rights to Muhammad Ali&#x27;s life story. In 1992, Ardaji visited Ali on his 50th birthday and persuaded him to allow a film to be made about his life. Nearing the end of his option period, Ardaji signed a contract with Sony Pictures, joining forces with producer Jon Peters as producing partner. In February 2000, it was announced that Mann had taken over as a director, following his Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Insider&quot;. Filming began in Los Angeles on January 11, 2001, on a $105 million budget, shooting took place in New York City, Chicago, Miami, and Mozambique.

&quot;Ali&quot; was well received by critics, but was a box-office bomb, grossing just $87 million against a production budget of approximately $118 million. Will Smith and Jon Voight received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.

==Plot==
Before his championship debut against the heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, Cassius Clay Jr. taunts Liston then dominates the early rounds of the match. Halfway through, he complains of a burning feeling in his eyes (implying that Liston has tried to cheat) and says he is unable to continue. His trainer/manager Angelo Dundee gets him to keep fighting. Once Clay sees again, he dominates the fight and Liston quits before round seven, making Clay the second-youngest heavyweight champion at the time after Floyd Patterson.

Clay spends time with Malcolm X and is invited to the home of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, where he is given the name Muhammad Ali, much to the disapproval of his father, Cassius Sr. Ali marries Sonji Roi, an ex-Playboy Bunny, although she is not Muslim and does not abide sex segregation. Ali goes to Africa and meets up with Malcolm X, but later refuses to speak to him, honoring the wishes of Elijah. He is distraught over the assassination of Malcolm X.

Upon returning to America, Ali fights Liston a second time and knocks him out in the first round. He and Sonji divorce after she objects to various obligations Muslim women have.

Ali then refuses conscription for the Vietnam War and is stripped of his boxing license, passport, and title, and sentenced to five years in prison. After marrying 17-year-old Belinda Boyd and a three-year hiatus from boxing, his conviction is overturned in Clay v. United States, and in his comeback fight, he goes against Jerry Quarry and wins by technical knockout in three rounds. Ali attempts to regain the heavyweight championship against Joe Frazier. In the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;, Frazier generally has the upper hand against Ali and wins by decision, the first loss of Ali&#x27;s career. Frazier later loses the championship to George Foreman.

Foreman and Ali go to Kinshasa, Zaire, for the Rumble in the Jungle fight. There, Ali meets Veronica Porché and has an affair with her. After reading rumors of his infidelity in newspapers, his wife Belinda travels to Zaire to confront him. Ali says he is unsure whether he loves Veronica, but is focused solely on his upcoming title shot.

For a good portion of the fight against Foreman, Ali leans back against the ropes (Rope-a-dope) allowing Foreman to tire himself out. He then knocks out the exhausted Foreman, regaining the Heavyweight Championship.

==Production==
The project began in 1992 when producer Paul Ardaji optioned the movie rights to Muhammad Ali&#x27;s life story. In 1992, Ardaji visited Ali on his 50th birthday and persuaded him to allow a film to be made about his life. Nearing the end of his option period, Ardaji signed a contract with Sony Pictures, joining forces with producer Jon Peters as producing partner. Producer Jon Peters started developing the film in 1994. Gregory Allen Howard wrote the initial draft of the script, which had the working title &quot;Power and Grace&quot;. Howard&#x27;s draft focused on Ali&#x27;s life from 12 to 40 years old, and his relationship with his father. Howard was replaced by writers Stephen J. Rivele and Chris Wilkinson, and by 1998 the biopic was set up at Columbia Pictures, with Will Smith attached to star and the possibility of Ron Howard directing. During the filming of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, Smith presented director Barry Sonnenfeld with the script. Columbia was hoping for filming to start towards the end of 1998, but it was pushed back, and Sonnenfeld exited in November 1999. It was speculated that Columbia was hesitant to move forward with Sonnenfeld following the disappointing box office performance of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. In February 2000, it was announced that Michael Mann had taken over as director, following his Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Insider&quot;. Prior to Mann&#x27;s involvement, Spike Lee had been in negotiations to direct the film, feeling that only a black man could do justice to Ali&#x27;s story. Smith, however, preferred Mann, who turned down the opportunity to direct early versions of &quot;The Aviator&quot;, &quot;Shooter&quot; and &quot;Savages&quot; to commit to &quot;Ali&quot;, and brought Eric Roth on to co-write the script. After years of being attached to the Ali biopic, Smith officially signed on in May 2000 with a $20 million salary.

Filming began in Los Angeles on January 11, 2001, on a $105 million budget. Shooting also took place in New York City, Chicago, Miami and Mozambique.

Smith spent about one year learning about Ali&#x27;s life. These included boxing training (up to seven hours a day), Islamic studies with Wiljah Akbar, and dialect training. Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.

One of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. Smith worked alongside boxing promoter Guy Sharpe from SharpeShooter Entertainment, and his lead fighter Ross Kent, to get the majority of his boxing tips for the film. All of the boxers in the film are former or current world heavyweight championship-caliber boxers. It was quickly decided that &#x27;Hollywood fighting&#x27;—passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit—would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays George Foreman). He was permitted to hit Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.

Smith had to gain weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Ali&quot; opened on December 25, 2001, and grossed a total of $14.7 million in 2,446 theaters during its opening weekend. The film went on to gross a total of $87.7 million worldwide.

Due to its high production and marketing costs, the film ended up losing Columbia Pictures as much as $100 million. The film&#x27;s failure was partly due to its competition with &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Ali&quot; holds an approval rating of 68% based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus: &quot;Though perhaps no film could fully do justice to the fascinating life and personality of Muhammad Ali, Mann&#x27;s direction and Smith&#x27;s performance combine to pack a solid punch.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert derided the film with two stars in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and mentioned, &quot;it lacks much of the flash, fire and humor of Muhammad Ali and is shot more in the tone of a eulogy than a celebration&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, Todd McCarthy wrote, &quot;The director&#x27;s visual and aural dapplings are strikingly effective at their best, but over the long haul don&#x27;t represent a satisfactory alternative to in-depth dramatic scenes; one longs, for example, for even one sequence in which Ali and Dundee discuss boxing strategy or assess an opponent&quot;, but he did have praise for the performances: &quot;The cast is outstanding, from Smith, who carries the picture with consummate skill, and Voight, who is unrecognizable under all the makeup but nails Cosell&#x27;s distinctive vocal cadences&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two and half stars out of four and stated that, &quot;for many Ali fans, the movie may be good enough, but some perspective is in order. The documentaries &quot;a.k.a. Cassius Clay&quot; and the Oscar-winning &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; cover a lot of the same ground and are consistently more engaging&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell proclaimed &quot;Ali&quot; to be a &quot;breakthrough&quot; film for Mann, adding that it was his &quot;first movie with feeling&quot; and that &quot;his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds&quot;. J. Hoberman, in his review for the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, felt that the &quot;first half percolates wonderfully—and the first half hour is even better than that. Mann opens with a thrilling montage that, spinning in and out of a nightclub performance by Sam Cooke, contextualizes the hero in his times&quot;, and concluded that, &quot;Ali&#x27;s astonishing personality is skillfully evoked but, in the end, remains a mystery&quot;.

When Ali died on June 3, 2016, Smith was chosen to be one of Ali&#x27;s pallbearers for the memorial service in Louisville.

==Accolades==
==Alternate versions==
&quot;Ali&quot; was released theatrically in 2001 at a length of 157 minutes; this version was released on DVD in 2002. Mann then re-edited the film, creating a new Director&#x27;s Cut that ran 165 minutes and was released on DVD in 2004; approximately 4 minutes of theatrical footage was removed, while 14 minutes of previously unseen footage was inserted. The Director&#x27;s Cut also featured an audio commentary by Mann

In 2016 Mann created a third cut, significantly re-editing the film in the wake of Ali&#x27;s death. He deleted one fight and added scenes and footage focusing on the political side of Ali&#x27;s life. This version runs 152 minutes and was released in 2017 on Blu-Ray as the Commemorative Edition.

<doc id="171627" wikidata="Q4115712" url="?curid=171627" title="Kaunas">
<text>Kaunas (; ; previously known in English as Kovno ) is the second-largest city in Lithuania after Vilnius, the fourth largest city in the Baltic States and an important centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, and cultural life. Kaunas was the largest city and the centre of a in the Duchy of Trakai of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Trakai Palatinate since 1413. In the Russian Empire, it was the capital of the Kaunas Governorate from 1843 to 1915.

During the interwar period, it served as the temporary capital of Lithuania, when Vilnius was seized and controlled by Poland between 1920 and 1939. During that period Kaunas was celebrated for its rich cultural and academic life, fashion, construction of countless Art Deco and Lithuanian National Revival architectural-style buildings as well as popular furniture, interior design of the time, and a widespread café culture. The city interwar architecture is regarded as among the finest examples of European Art Deco and has received the European Heritage Label. It contributed to Kaunas being designated as the first city in Central and Eastern Europe as a UNESCO City of Design, and also to becoming a World Heritage Site in 2023 as the only European city representing large scale urbanization during the interwar period and versatile modernism architecture.

Kaunas was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2022, together with Esch-sur-Alzette and 

The city is the capital of Kaunas County, and the seat of the Kaunas city municipality and the Kaunas District Municipality. It is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas. Kaunas is located at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the Nemunas and the Neris, and is near the Kaunas Reservoir, the largest body of water in the whole of Lithuania.

As defined by Eurostat, the population of Kaunas functional urban area, is estimated at 391,153 ( 2021), while according to statistics of Kaunas territorial health insurance fund, there are 447,946 permanent inhabitants (as of 2022) in Kaunas and Kaunas district municipalities combined. Moreover, the tertiary education institutions of Kaunas attract thousands of students annually.

==Name==
===Etymology===

The city&#x27;s name is of Lithuanian origin and most likely derives from a personal name, however the exact person is unknown and it is believed that he was the ruler of Kaunas Castle. The personal name Kaunas is derived from an adjective which means &quot;who likes to fight&quot;. Other possible meaning of the name of the city of Kaunas is that it is derived from an old adjective which is not in use anymore and which meant &quot;deep&quot;, &quot;low&quot;, &quot;located in the valley&quot;.

Before Lithuania regained independence, the city was generally known in English as &quot;Kovno&quot;, the traditional Slavicized form of its name. The Polish name is , and the names in Belarusian include ( ) and ( ). The Yiddish name is &#x27;, and the names in German include &#x27; and &#x27;. On Carta Marina from 1539, the city was named &#x27;. The city and its elderates also have names in other languages (see Names of Kaunas in other languages and names of Kaunas elderates in other languages).

===Folk history===
A 16th-century legend in the &quot;Bychowiec Chronicle&quot; claims that Kaunas was established by the Romans in ancient times. These Romans were supposedly led by a patrician named Palemon, who had three sons: Barcus, Kunas and Sperus. Palemon fled from Rome because he feared the mad Emperor Nero. Palemon, his sons and other relatives travelled to Lithuania. After Palemon&#x27;s death, his sons divided his land. Kunas got the land where Kaunas now stands. He built a fortress near the confluence of the Nemunas and Neris rivers and the city that grew up there was named after him. A suburban region in the vicinity is named &quot;Palemonas&quot;.

According to historian Teodor Narbutt the Lithuanians previously worshiped god Kaunis whose statue was located in the current Kaunas Old Town near Neman River.

==Coat of arms==

In 1408 Vytautas the Great granted Kaunas the city rights and himself chose the coat of arms of Kaunas with aurochs.

On 30 June 1993, the historical coat of arms of Kaunas city was re-established by a special presidential decree. The coat of arms features a white aurochs with a golden cross between its horns, set against a deep red background. The aurochs was the original heraldic symbol of the city, established in 1400. The heraldic seal of Kaunas, introduced in the early 15th century during the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas, is the oldest city heraldic seal known in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The current emblem was the result of much study and discussion on the part of the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission, and realized by the artist Raimondas Miknevicius. An aurochs has replaced a wisent, which was depicted in the Soviet-era emblem that was used since 1969.

Blazon: &quot;Gules, an aurochs passant guardant argent ensigned with a cross Or between his horns.&quot;

Kaunas also has a greater coat of arms, which is mainly used for purposes of Kaunas city representation. The sailor, three golden balls, and Latin text &quot;Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram&quot; (English: Cherish justice, you who judge the earth) in the greater coat of arms refers to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of merchants and seafarers, who was regarded as a heavenly guardian of Kaunas by Queen Bona Sforza.

==History==
===Early history===
According to the archeological excavations, the richest collections of ceramics and other artifacts found at the confluence of the Nemunas and the Neris rivers are from the second and first millennium BC. During that time, people settled in some territories of the present Kaunas: the confluence of the two longest rivers of Lithuania area, Eiguliai, Lampėdžiai, Linkuva, Kaniūkai, Marvelė, Pajiesys, Romainiai, Petrašiūnai, Sargėnai, and Veršvai sites.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===

A settlement was established on the site of the current Kaunas Old Town, at the confluence of two large rivers, by at latest the 10th century AD and more settlements developed in the 11th century AD. Kaunas was first mentioned in written sources in 1361 and at the end of the 13th century the brick Kaunas Castle was constructed to defend the residents from attacks by the Teutonic Order. At the time only two brick castles stood near the Nemunas River (in Kaunas and Grodno), which was the main front line of fights between the Crusaders and Lithuanians. Consequently, Kaunas Castle had a strategic importance, as it prevented the Crusaders from intruding deeper into Lithuania and its capital, Vilnius.

In 1362, the castle was captured after a siege of several weeks and destroyed by the Teutonic Order. Lithuanian rulers Kęstutis and Grand Duke Algirdas arrived to help the castle&#x27;s defenders, but the castle was already surrounded by the fortifications of the Crusaders, and they could only watch the collapse of the castle. Most of the 400 castle&#x27;s defenders were killed in action, and commander Vaidotas of the Kaunas Castle garrison tried to break through with 36 men, but was taken and made a prisoner. It was one of the largest and most important military victory of the Teutonic Knights in the 14th century against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
The Lithuanians constructed a new wooden castle on the island of Virgalė, which stood at the confluence of the Nemunas and Nevėžio rivers; however in 1363 the Crusaders burned the castle. The wooden castle was rebuilt, but in 1368 the Crusaders attacked once again, destroyed the castle and, according to the chronicles, killed 600 pagan defenders, while they themselves suffered only three casualties.

The Lithuanians attempted to rebuild the castle with masonry and higher, wider walls, four flanking towers, and surrounded by a moat, but before its completion the Crusaders attacked in the summer of 1369, expelled the Lithuanians from the island of Virgalė and with their masonry built Gotteswerder Castle. Gotteswerder Castle was captured after a five-week siege by the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, led by Algirdas and Kęstutis, and two wooden castles were built close to it. Nevertheless, the fighting between the Crusaders and the Lithuanians for the area went on until the Lithuanians eventually took control in 1404; it was an important point during the 1409 Samogitian Rebellion and the 1410 war with the Crusaders.

Grand Duke Vytautas the Great funded Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Kaunas (the construction was completed in 1400) to show his gratitude to the Virgin Mary for saving him from almost drowning in the river, during the Battle of the Vorskla River, in 1399. Following the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, Kaunas Castle became a residence of the elder of Kaunas, and its military significance decreased.
In 1408, the town was granted Magdeburg rights by Vytautas the Great and in 1413 became the centre of Kaunas Powiat, in Trakai Voivodeship. Moreover, Vytautas ceded Kaunas the right to own the scales used for weighing the goods brought to the city or packed on the site, the wax processing, and woolen cloth-trimming facilities. The power of the self-governing Kaunas was shared by three interrelated major institutions: &quot;vaitas&quot; (the Mayor), the Magistrate (12 lay judges and 4 burgomasters), and the so-called Benchers&#x27; Court (12 persons). Kaunas began to gain prominence, since it was at the intersection of trade routes and a river port. At the time, Kaunas became an important port and centre of trade with Western Europe, thus rapidly growing. In 1441, Kaunas joined the Hanseatic League, and Hansa merchant office Kontor was opened – the only one in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

By the 16th century, Kaunas also had a public school and a hospital and was one of the most firmly established towns in the whole country. Furthermore, in the 16th century Grand Duchess Bona Sforza achieved that the Kaunas Eldership should become a property of the Jagiellonian dynasty; starting in 1533, she carried out the Volok Reform.
The greatest economic boom of Kaunas was in the late 16th – early 17th century, which led to construction of many brick masonry buildings throughout the city. In the early 17th century, the prosperity of Kaunas led to the beginning of the construction of the Wall of Kaunas, which, however, was not completed, due to later wars and economic reasons. In 1665, the Russian army attacked the city several times, and in 1701 the city was occupied by the Swedish Army, during the Great Northern War. The bubonic plague struck the area in 1657 and 1708, killing many residents. Fires destroyed parts of the city in 1731 and 1732.

In the first half of the 18th century, the northern wall and two towers of the Kaunas Castle collapsed, due to damage from river water, and this led to abandonment of the castle, and it turned into ruins. Subsequently, a jail was established in one part of the castle, in the middle of the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, the castle was sometimes used to hold meetings of noble families of Kaunas Powiat.

===Russian Empire===
After the third and final partition of the Polish–Lithuanian state in 1795, the city was taken over by the Russian Empire and became a part of Vilna Governorate. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Grand Army of Napoleon passed through Kaunas twice, devastating the city both times. A hill fort mound in Kaunas is named Napoleon&#x27;s Hill.

To prevent possible easy access through the city and protect the western borders of Russia, the Kovno Fortress was built. It is still visible throughout the town.

Kovno Governorate, with a centre in Kovno (Kaunas), was formed in 1843. In 1862, a railway connecting the Russian Empire and Imperial Germany was built, making Kaunas a significant railway hub with one of the first railway tunnels in the Empire, completed in 1861. In 1898 the first power plant in Lithuania started operating.

After the unsuccessful January Uprising in 1863 against the Russian Empire, the tsarist authority moved the Catholic Seminary of Varniai, prominent bishop Motiejus Valančius and Samogitian diocese institutions to Kaunas, where they were given the former Bernardine Monastery Palace and St. George the Martyr Church. Only selected noblemen were permitted to study in the Seminary, with the only exception being peasant son Antanas Baranauskas, who illegally received the nobleman documents from Karolina Praniauskaitė. He began lectures using the Lithuanian language, rather than Russian, and greatly influenced the spirit of the seminarians by narrating about the ancient Lithuania and especially its earthwork mounds. Later, many of the Seminary students were active in Lithuanian book smuggling; its chief main objective was to resist the Russification policy. Kaunas Spiritual Seminary finally became completely Lithuanian when in 1909 professor Jonas Mačiulis-Maironis became the rector of the Seminary, and replaced use of the Polish language for teaching with the Lithuanian language.

Prior to the Second World War, Kaunas, like many cities in Eastern Europe, had a significant Jewish population. According to the Russian census of 1897, Jews numbered 25,500, 35.3% of the total of 73,500. The population was recorded as 25.8% Russian, 22.7% Polish, 6.6% Lithuanian. It established numerous schools and synagogues and were important for centuries to the culture and business of the city.

During the Imperial Russian Army&#x27;s Great Retreat of World War I, Paul von Hindenburg&#x27;s German Tenth Army occupied Kaunas in August 1915.

===Interwar Lithuania===

After Vilnius was occupied by the Red Army in 1919, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania established its main base in Kaunas during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. Later, after the capital, Vilnius, had been annexed by the Second Polish Republic, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania. It would hold this position until 28 October 1939, when the Red Army handed Vilnius over to Lithuania after its invasion of Poland. The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania first met in Kaunas on 15 May 1920. It passed some important laws, particularly on land reform, on the national currency, and adopted a new constitution. The military coup d&#x27;état took place in Kaunas on 17 December 1926. It was largely organized by the military, especially general Povilas Plechavičius, and resulted in the replacement of the democratically elected Government and President Kazys Grinius with a conservative nationalist authoritarian Government led by Antanas Smetona. Shortly afterwards, tension between Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras, supported by the Iron Wolf Association, arose seeking to gain authority. After the unsuccessful coup attempt in June 1934, Voldemaras was imprisoned for four years and received an amnesty on condition that he leave the country.


During the interwar period, Kaunas was nicknamed the &quot;Little Paris&quot; because of its rich cultural and academic life, fashion, Art Deco architecture, Lithuanian National Romanticism architectural style buildings as well as popular furniture, interior design of the time and widespread café culture. The interim capital and the country itself also had a Western standard of living with sufficiently high salaries and low prices. At the time, qualified workers there were earning very similar real wages to workers in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France, the country also had a high natural increase in population of 9.7 and the industrial production of Lithuania increased by 160% from 1913 to 1940. The population of Kaunas increased 8,6 times during the interwar period from ~18,000 to ~154,000 residents.

Between the World Wars, industry prospered in Kaunas, which was the largest city in Lithuania. Under the direction of Mayor Jonas Vileišis (1921–1931) Kaunas grew rapidly and was extensively modernised. A water and waste water system, costing more than 15 million Lithuanian litas, was put in place, the city expanded from , more than 2,500 buildings were built, plus three modern bridges over the Neris and Nemunas rivers. All of the city&#x27;s streets were paved, horse-drawn transportation was replaced with modern bus lines, new suburbs were planned and built (Žaliakalnis neighbourhood in particular), and new parks and squares were established. The foundations of a social security system were laid, three new schools were built, and new public libraries, including the Vincas Kudirka library, were established. Vileišis maintained many contacts in other European cities, and as a result, Kaunas was an active participant in European urban life.

The city also was a particularly important centre for the Lithuanian Armed Forces. In January 1919, during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the War School of Kaunas was established and started to train soldiers who were soon sent to the front to strengthen the fighting Lithuanian Armed Forces. Part of the Lithuanian armoured vehicles military unit was moved to Žaliakalnis, armed with advanced and brand new tanks, including the famous Renault FT, Vickers-Armstrong Model 1933 and Model 1936. In May 1919, the Lithuanian Aircraft State Factory was founded in Freda to repair and to supply the army with military aircraft. It was considerably modernized by Antanas Gustaitis and started to build Lithuanian ANBO military aircraft. The exceptional discipline and regularity caused the Lithuanian Air Force to be an example for other military units. The ANBO 41 was far ahead of the most modern foreign reconnaissance aircraft of that time in structural features, and most importantly in speed and in rate of climb.

At the time, Kaunas had a Jewish population of 35,000–40,000, about one quarter of the city&#x27;s total population. Jews made up much of the city&#x27;s commercial, artisan, and professional sectors. Kaunas was a centre of Jewish learning, and the yeshiva in Slobodka (Vilijampolė) was one of Europe&#x27;s most prestigious institutes of higher Jewish learning. Kaunas had a rich and varied Jewish culture. There were almost 100 Jewish organizations, 40 synagogues, many Yiddish schools, 4 Hebrew high schools, a Jewish hospital, and scores of Jewish-owned businesses. It was also an important Zionist centre.

Initially prior to World War II, Lithuania declared neutrality. However, on 7 October 1939, the Lithuanian delegation departed to Moscow, where it later had to sign the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty because of the unfavorable situation. The treaty resulted in five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops established across Lithuania in exchange for Lithuania&#x27;s historical capital Vilnius. According to the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Kazys Musteikis, Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys initially told that Lithuanians refused Vilnius Region as well as the Russian garrisons, but the nervous Joseph Stalin replied, &quot;No matter if you take Vilnius or not, the Russian garrisons will enter Lithuania anyway&quot;. He also informed Juozas Urbšys about the Soviet–German secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. Two of the military bases with thousands of Soviet soldiers were established close to Kaunas in Prienai and Gaižiūnai. Despite regaining the beloved historical capital, the Presidency and the Government remained in Kaunas.
On 14 June 1940, just before midnight, the last meeting of the Lithuanian government was held in Kaunas. During it, the ultimatum presented by the Soviet Union was debated. President Antanas Smetona categorically declined to accept most of the ultimatum&#x27;s demands, argued for military resistance and was supported by Kazys Musteikis, Konstantinas Šakenis, Kazimieras Jokantas, however the Commander of the Armed Forces Vincas Vitkauskas, Divisional General Stasys Raštikis, Kazys Bizauskas, Antanas Merkys and most of the Lithuanian government members decided that it would be impossible, especially the previously stationed Soviet soldiers, and accepted the ultimatum. On that night before officially accepting the ultimatum, the Soviet forces executed the Lithuanian border guard near the Byelorussian SSR border. In the morning, the Lithuanian Government resigned, and the president left the country to avoid the fate of the Soviets&#x27; puppets and in the hope of forming a government-in-exile. Soon the Red Army flooded Lithuania through the Belarus–Lithuania border with more than 200,000 soldiers and took control of the most important cities, including Kaunas where the heads of state resided. The Lithuanian Armed Forces were ordered not to resist, and the Lithuanian Air Force remained on the ground. At the time, the Lithuanian Armed Forces had 26,084 soldiers (of which 1,728 officers) and 2,031 civil servants. While the Lithuanian Riflemen&#x27;s Union, subordinate to the army commander, had over 62,000 members, of which about 70% were farmers and agricultural workers.

After the occupation, the Soviets immediately took brutal action against the high-ranking officials of the state. Both targets of the ultimatum, Minister of the Interior Kazys Skučas and the Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania Augustinas Povilaitis, were transported to Moscow and later executed. Antanas Gustaitis, Kazys Bizauskas, Vytautas Petrulis, Kazimieras Jokantas, Jonas Masiliūnas, Antanas Tamošaitis also faced that fate, and President Aleksandras Stulginskis, Juozas Urbšys, Leonas Bistras, Antanas Merkys, Pranas Dovydaitis, Petras Klimas, Donatas Malinauskas and thousands of others were deported. Stasys Raštikis, persuaded by his wife, secretly crossed the German border. After realizing this, NKVD started terror against the Raštikis family. His wife was separated from their one-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated at Kaunas Prison, his old father Bernardas Raštikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia. Soldiers, officers, senior officers and generals of the Lithuanian Army and LRU members, who were seen as a threat to the occupiers, were quickly arrested, interrogated and released to the reserve, deported to the concentration camps or executed, which made many, trying to avoid that fate, join the Lithuanian partisan forces. The army itself was initially renamed the Lithuanian People&#x27;s Army but was later reorganised into the 29th Rifle Corps of the Soviet Union.

===Soviet occupation and June Uprising===
In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Vladimir Dekanozov, a Soviet emissary from Moscow, gained effective power in Lithuania. Shortly afterwards, on 17 June 1940 the puppet People&#x27;s Government of Lithuania was formed, which consistently destroyed Lithuanian society and political institutions and opened the way for the Communist Party to establish itself. To establish the legitimacy of the government and design the plans of Lithuania&#x27;s &quot;legal accession to the USSR&quot;, on 1 July, the Seimas of Lithuania was dismissed, and elections to the puppet People&#x27;s Seimas were announced. The controlled (passports had imprints) and falsified elections to the People&#x27;s Seimas were won by the Lithuanian Labour People&#x27;s Union, which obeyed the occupiers&#x27; proposal to &quot;ask&quot; the Soviet authorities to have Lithuania admitted to the Soviet Union.

After the occupation, the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service did not recognize the new occupiers&#x27; authority and started the diplomatic liberation campaign of Lithuania. In 1941, Kazys Škirpa, Leonas Prapuolenis, Juozas Ambrazevičius and their supporters, including the former Commander of the Lithuanian Army General Stasys Raštikis, whose whole family was deported to Siberia, began organizing an uprising. After realizing the reality of the repressive and brutal Soviet rule, in the early morning of 22 June 1941 (the first day when the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union), Lithuanians began the June Uprising, which was organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front, in Kaunas, where its main forces were concentrated. The uprising soon expanded to Vilnius and other locations. Its main goal was not to fight the Soviets but to secure the city from the inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of 22 June, the Lithuanians had controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, and radio station. Control of Vilnius and most of the rest of Lithuanian territory was also shortly taken over by the rebels.

Multiple Red Army divisions stationed around Kaunas, including the brutal 1st Motor Rifle Division NKVD responsible for the June deportation, and the puppet Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic regime commanders were forced to flee into the Latvian SSR through the Daugava River. The commander of the Red Army&#x27;s 188th Rifle Division colonel Piotr Ivanov reported to the 11th Army Staff that during the retreat of his division through Kaunas &quot;local counterrevolutionaries from the shelters deliberately fired on the Red Army, the detachments suffering heavy losses of soldiers and military equipment&quot;. About 5,000 occupants were killed in Lithuania.

On 23 June 1941 at 9:28 am &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot;, the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem with tears in their eyes. From Kaunas radio broadcasts, Lithuania learned that the rebellion was taking place in the country, the insurgents took Kaunas and the Proclamation of the Independence Restoration of Lithuania and the list of the Provisional Government were announced by Leonas Prapuolenis. The message was being repeated several times in different languages. The Provisional Government hoped that Nazi Germany would re-establish Lithuanian independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic), was seeking the protection of its citizens and did not support the Nazis&#x27; Holocaust policy. However, the Provisional Government did little to stop the anti-Jewish violence encouraged by the Nazis and the anti-Semitic leadership of the Lithuanian Activist Front.

Minister of National Defence General Stasys Raštikis met personally with the Wehrmacht generals to discuss the situation. He approached the Kaunas War Field Commandant General Oswald Pohl and the Military Command Representative General Karl von Roques by trying to plead for him to spare the Jews, but they replied that the Gestapo is handling those issues and that they could not help. Furthermore, in the beginning of the occupation, the prime minister of the Provisional Government of Lithuania, Juozas Ambrazevičius, convened the meeting in which the ministers participated together with the former President Kazys Grinius, Bishop Vincentas Brizgys and others. Ministers expressed distress at the atrocities being committed against the Jews but advised only that &quot;despite all the measures which must be taken against the Jews for their Communist activity and harm done to the German Army, partisans and individuals should avoid public executions of Jews&quot;. According to the Lithuanian-American Holocaust historian Saulius Sužiedėlis, &quot;none of this amounted to a public scolding which alone could have persuaded at least some of the Lithuanians who had volunteered or been co-opted into participating in the killings to rethink their behavior.&quot; Lithuanian police battalions formed by the Provisional Government were eventually enlisted by the Nazis to help carry out the Holocaust.

In the first issue of the daily &quot;Į laisvę&quot; (Towards Freedom) newspaper, the Independence Restoration Declaration was published, which had been previously announced on the radio. It stated that &quot;The established Provisional Government of revived Lithuania declares the restoration of the Free and Independent State of Lithuania. The young Lithuanian state enthusiastically pledges to contribute to the organization of Europe on a new basis in front of the whole world innocent conscience. The Lithuanian Nation, exhausted from the terror of the brutal Bolsheviks, decided to build its future on the basis of national unity and social justice.&quot; and signatures.

On 24 June 1941, tank units of the Red Army in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The rebels radioed the Germans for assistance. The units were bombed by the Luftwaffe and did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian–German action. The first German scouts, lieutenant Flohret and four privates, entered Kaunas on 24 June and found it in friendly hands. A day later the main forces marched into the city without obstruction and almost as if they were on parade.

===Nazi occupation===

On 26 June 1941 the German ordered the rebel groups to disband and disarm. Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties. Already in July, in a conversation the Tilsit Nazi Gestapo agent clearly stated to Stasys Raštikis that the Provisional Government was formed without German knowledge. Such a form, although not having anything against individuals, is unacceptable to the Germans. The current Provisional Government should be transformed into a National Committee or Council under the German military authority. The Nazi Germans did not recognize the new Provisional Government, but they did not take any action to dissolve it. The Provisional Government, not agreeing to continue to be an instrument of the German occupiers, disbanded itself on 5 August 1941 after signing a protest for the Germans action of suspending the Lithuanian Government powers. Members of the Provisional Government then went as a body to the Garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum, where they laid a wreath near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the presence of numerous audience. The Sicherheitsdienst confiscated the pictures of the wreath-laying ceremony, thinking that it could be dangerous for the German occupation policy in Lithuania.

On 17 July 1941 the German civil administration was established. The government&#x27;s powers were taken over by the new occupants. Nazi Germany established the Reichskommissariat Ostland in the Baltic states and much of Belarus, and the administrative centre for Lithuania (&quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot;) was in Kaunas ruled by a Generalkommissar Adrian von Renteln.

===Jewish community of Kaunas===
Jews began settling in Kaunas in the second half of the 17th century. They were not allowed to live in the city, so most of them stayed in the Vilijampolė settlement on the right bank of the Neris river. Jewish life in Kaunas was first disrupted when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940. The occupation was accompanied by arrests, confiscations, and the elimination of all free institutions. Jewish community organizations disappeared almost overnight. Soviet authorities confiscated the property of many Jews, while hundreds were exiled to Siberia.

As the Second World War began, there were 30,000 Jews living in Kaunas, comprising about 25% of the city&#x27;s population. When the Soviet Union took over Lithuania in 1940, some Jewish Dutch residents in Lithuania approached the Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk to get a visa to the Dutch West Indies. Zwartendijk agreed to help them and Jews who had fled from German-occupied Poland also sought his assistance. In a few days, with the help of aides, Zwartendijk produced over 2,200 visas for Jews to Curaçao. Then refugees approached Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese consul, who gave them a transit visa through the USSR to Japan, against the disapproval of his government. This gave many refugees an opportunity to leave Lithuania for the Russian Far East via the Trans-Siberian Railway. The fleeing Jews were refugees from German-occupied Western Poland and Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland, as well as residents of Kaunas and other Lithuania territories. The Sugihara House, where he was previously issuing transit visas, currently is a museum and the Centre For Asian Studies of Vytautas Magnus University.

Following Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Soviet forces fled from Kaunas. Both before and during the German occupation starting 25 June, the anti-Communists, encouraged by the anti-Semitic leadership of the Berlin-based Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), began to attack Jews, blaming them for the Soviet repressions, especially along Jurbarko and Kriščiukaičio streets. The LAF&#x27;s manifesto-type essay &quot;What Are the Activists Fighting for?&quot; states: &quot;The Lithuanian Activist Front, by restoring the new Lithuania, is determined to carry out an immediate and fundamental purging of the Lithuanian nation and its land of Jews ...&quot;. Nazi authorities took advantage of the Lithuanian TDA Battalions and established a concentration camp at the Seventh Fort, one of the city&#x27;s ten historic forts, and 4,000 Jews were rounded up and murdered there. The Kaunas pogrom was a massacre of Jewish people living in Kaunas that took place on 25–29 June 1941; the first days of the Operation Barbarossa and of Nazi occupation of Lithuania. Prior to the construction of the Ninth Fort museum on the site, archaeologists unearthed a mass grave and personal belongings of the Jewish victims. The Ninth Fortress has been renovated into a memorial for the wars and is the site where nearly 50,000 Lithuanians were killed during Nazi occupation. Of these deaths, over 30,000 were Jews.

===Soviet administration===
Beginning in 1944, the Red Army began offensives that eventually led to the reconquest of all three of the Baltic states. Kaunas was captured on 1 August 1944 and this led to the continuation of Soviet repressions.
Kaunas again became the major centre of resistance against the Soviet Union. From the very start of the Lithuanian partisans war, the most important partisan districts were based around Kaunas. Although guerrilla warfare ended by 1953, Lithuanian opposition to Soviet rule did not. In 1956 people in the Kaunas region supported the uprising in Hungary by rioting.

On All Souls&#x27; Day in 1956, the first public anti-Soviet protest rally took place in Kaunas: citizens burned candles in the Kaunas military cemetery and sang national songs, resulting in clashes with the &quot;Militsiya&quot;.
On 14 May 1972, 19-year-old Romas Kalanta, having proclaimed &quot;Freedom for Lithuania!&quot;, immolated himself in the garden of the Musical Theatre, after making a speech denouncing the Soviet suppression of national and religious rights. The event broke into a politically charged riot, which was forcibly dispersed by the KGB and Militsiya. It led to new forms of resistance: passive resistance all around Lithuania. The continuous oppression of the Catholic Church and its resistance caused the appearance of the &quot;Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania&quot;. In strict conspiracy, Catholic priest Sigitas Tamkevičius (now the Archbishop Metropolitan of Kaunas) implemented this idea and its first issue was published in the Alytus district on 19 March 1972. The Kronika started a new phase of resistance in the life of Lithuania&#x27;s Catholic Church and of all Lithuania fighting against the occupation by making known to the world the violation of the human rights and freedoms in Lithuania for almost two decades. 
On 1 November 1987, a non-sanctioned rally took place near the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica, where people gathered to mark famous Lithuanian poet Maironis&#x27; 125th-birthday anniversary. On 10 June 1988, the initiating group of the Kaunas movement of Sąjūdis was formed. On 9 October 1988, the Flag of Lithuania was raised above the tower of the Military Museum. Kaunas, along with Vilnius, became the scene of nearly constant demonstrations as the Lithuanians, embarked on a process of self-discovery. The bodies of Lithuanians who died in Siberian exile were brought back to their homeland for reburial, and the anniversaries of deportations as well as the important dates in Lithuanian history began to be noted with speeches and demonstrations.

On 16 February 1989 Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevičius, for the first time, called for the independence of Lithuania in his sermon at the Kaunas Cathedral. After the services, 200,000 persons gathered in the centre of Kaunas to participate in the dedication of a new monument to freedom to replace the monument that had been torn down by the Soviet authorities after World War II.

=== Restored independence ===
After World War II Kaunas became the main industrial city of Lithuania; it produced about a quarter of Lithuania&#x27;s industrial output.

After the proclamation of Lithuanian independence in 1990, Soviet attempts to suppress the rebellion focused on the Sitkūnai Radio Station. They were defended by the citizenry of Kaunas. Pope John Paul II said Holy Mass for the faithful of the Archdiocese of Kaunas at the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica and held a meeting with the young people of Lithuania at the S. Darius and S. Girėnas Stadium, during his visit to Lithuania in 1993. Kaunas natives Vytautas Landsbergis and Valdas Adamkus became the Head of state in 1990, and, respectively, in 1998 and 2004. Since the restoration of independence, substantially improving air and land transport links with Western Europe have made Kaunas easily accessible to foreign tourists.

Kaunas is famous for its basketball club, Žalgiris, which was founded in 1944 and was one of the most popular nonviolent expressions of resistance during its struggle with the CSKA Moscow. In 2011, the largest indoor arena in the Baltic states was built and was named Žalgiris Arena. Kaunas hosted finals of the EuroBasket 2011.

In March 2015, Kaunas&#x27;s interwar buildings received the European Heritage Label.

On 29 March 2017, Kaunas was named European Capital of Culture of 2022.

On 28 September 2017, the winner of the M. K. Čiurlionis Concert Centre architectural competition was announced and the centre was planned to be completed by 2022, close to the Vytautas the Great Bridge.

On 18 September 2023, Kaunas&#x27;s interwar modern architecture was included in the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==Geography==
The city covers 15,700 hectares. Parks, groves, gardens, nature reserves, and agricultural areas occupy 8,329 hectares. The city follows in suit of the country and is lowland. Kaunas is known for its landscape complexes of rivers and stream valleys as the city is located at the confluence of Neris and Nemunas rivers.

In Kaunas there are 16 urban parks (Ąžuolyno, A.Šančių ąžuolynas, Dainavos, Draugystės, Kalniečių, Santakos, Vilijos, Nepriklausomybės, Santarvės, Marvos dvaro, Girstupio, Gričiupio, Kovo 11-osios, Neries krantinės, Antakalnio g., Sargėnų dvaro) which total territory is 1080 hectares. Moreover, there are three forest parks (Panemunės, Kleboniškio, Lampėdžių), three landscape reserves (Jiesios, Veršvos, Nevėžio), one regional park (Kauno Marios Regional Park), five teriological reserves, and one ornithological reserve.

In Kaunas and its surrounding area there are 43 mineral deposits that are suitable for extracting: anhydrite and gypsum, sand and gravel, freshwater limestone, clay, chalk marl, peat, mineral water.

==Administrative divisions==

Kaunas is divided into the following elderships:

==Climate==

Kaunas has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with an average annual temperature of approximately .

Despite its northern location, the climate in Kaunas is relatively mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the Baltic Sea. Because of its latitude, Kaunas has 17 hours of daylight in midsummer but only around 7 hours in midwinter. The Kazlų Rūda Forest, west of Kaunas, creates a microclimate around the city, regulating humidity and temperature of the air, and protecting it from strong westerly winds.

Summers in Kaunas are warm and pleasant with average daytime high temperatures of and lows of around , but temperatures could reach on some days. Winters are relatively cold, and sometimes snowy with average temperatures ranging from , and rarely drop below . Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild.

==Religion==

Following the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387 which marked the Lithuanians&#x27; shift from the Lithuanian paganism to Catholicism, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great in ~1400 had funded the establishment of the Church of Vytautas the Great to possibly give thanks to the God for saving his life during the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. Subsequently, in a period before 1413, Vytautas the Great established a parish church of St. Peter which in the 15th century already had the highest status in Kaunas and is the basis of the Cathedral Basilica of Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1471, the Church of St. George the Martyr and Bernardines Monastery was funded and were wooden, the Bernardine monks constantly had preachers in the Lithuanian language to attract Lithuanian-speaking townspeople of Kaunas and soon gained popularity, while in the 15th–16th centuries the church and the monastery were rebuilt using bricks. Other surviving 15th century Catholic churches in Kaunas are the Church of Saint Nicholas and Church of St. Gertrude. In 1558, the Lutherans established their first parish in Kaunas and their masses were held in a small church near Town Hall Square, however the church was damaged by fire and in 1682–1683 the Kaunas Lutheran Holy Trinity Church was built.

In the early 17th century the Church of Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul became the center of Kaunas Deanery of the Vilnius Diocese, but the occupations of Kaunas by Muscovites (1655), Swedes (1707) and a fire in 1732 damaged the church, thus it gained nowadays interior appearance only after the restoration in the second half of the 18th century. The Jesuits opened their first residence in Kaunas in 1642 and established a chapel in the House of Perkūnas in 1643, while their Church of St. Francis Xavier was constructed in 1666–1720. Moreover, since 1664 Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac funded the construction of the Pažaislis Monastery and the Church of the Visitation, a splendid example of Italian Baroque in Lithuania, dedicated to Camaldolese monks. In the first half of the 17th century the Dominican Order monks arrived in Kaunas and in 1641 Grand Duke Władysław IV Vasa granted a permission for them to build the Church of the Blessed Sacrament and a monastery, both of which were completed in the late 17th century.

Following the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the Tsarist authorities had arbitrarily moved the center of the Diocese of Samogitia from Varniai to Kaunas in 1863, but this was recognized by Pope Leo XIII only in 1883, while in 1895 the Church of Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul was granted cathedral status and since then it had the throne of the Bishop of Samogitia and was the highest status church of Samogitia. The Samogitian Priest Seminary (now Kaunas Priest Seminary) was also moved from Varniai to Kaunas in 1863 and subsequently became one of the centers of the Lithuanian National Revival during the Russification era. In 1862, the Holy Resurrection Orthodox Church was built for Orthodox Russians living in the city. In 1895, Russian Emperor Alexander III ordered the construction of the Neo-Byzantine style Church of St. Michael the Archangel for the use of the Russian Orthodox imperial garrison of the Kaunas Fortress.

After the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s statehood in 1918, the Lithuanian Ecclesiastical Province was established by Pope Pius XI in 1926 with a center in Kaunas, while the Cathedral of Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul received the archcathedral status and since then has archbishop&#x27;s metropolitan throne. During the interwar period the Catholic Church had the status of a national church and its popularity was boosted due to the pro-Lithuanian stances of its priests during Tsarist times. In 1930, the 500th death anniversary of Vytautas the Great was commemorated by building the Kaunas Mosque, which replaced the older mosque which was built in 1906, for the Lipka Tatars who were settled in Lithuania by Vytautas the Great during the Middle Ages. In 1934, the construction of the Christ&#x27;s Resurrection Church was started as a monument to the Independence of Lithuania.

After the outbreak of the World War II, many priests of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas and Kaunas Priest Seminary were repressed and killed during the Soviet and Nazis occupations of Lithuania, while since the start of the second Soviet occupation in 1944 the religious buildings in Kaunas were nationalized or abolished by the Soviets who also restricted priests and bishops rights. Nevertheless, priests of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas regularly gathered secretly, transmitted information abroad, and since 1972 participated in the publishing of &quot;Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania&quot;, which focused on Soviet repressions against Catholics and human rights in Lithuania. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the start of the Sąjūdis movement and the restoration of the independence of Lithuania, the returning of the nationalized church property began and church institutions were restored or newly created, while Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevičius was appointed as Archbishop of Kaunas. According to 2023 statistics, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas had ~430,000 residents of who 334,000 were Catholics.

==Culture==

Kaunas is a city centered around culture. The Old Town of Kaunas is located at the confluence of the Nemunas and Neris Rivers where old architectural monuments and other historical buildings are located. Located to the East of the Old Town is the city&#x27;s New Town, which started developing in 1847 and got its name when it became a distinct part of the city. Central Kaunas is defined by two pedestrian streets: the 1.6 km long Laisvės alėja (Liberty Avenue), a central street of the city, lined by linden trees and decorated with flower beds.

The Old Town is the historical center of Kaunas. The streets in Old Town have been turned to pedestrian sidewalks, so it is best to tour the place by foot. Prominent features of the Old Town include Kaunas Castle, the Town Hall, and the historical Presidential Palace. The Town Hall in Kaunas played an important role in the Medieval Times as a center for trade, festivals, and criminals were brought here for punishment. The Town Hall was originally built with wooden frames, however, after numerous fires in 1542 they began to construct buildings with stone. The stone buildings, however, also burned down so the Town Hall that stands today was constructed in a more advanced way, which took from 1771 to 1780. The Town Hall is still a center of culture today, it holds weddings and is the home of the Museum of Ceramics.

Other historical, cultural features of Kaunas include:

* Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Eternal flame, and Statues of Lithuanian national renaissance figures are located in the Vienybės square in front of the War museum

Although the &quot;AB&quot; printing house worked regularly, it was never detected by KGB. It was included into the Registry of Immovable Cultural Heritage Sites of Lithuania in 1999.
* The apartments of some famous Kaunas natives, including Paulius Galaunė, Adam Mickiewicz, Juozas Grušas, Balys Sruoga, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Salomėja Nėris, Juozas Zikaras, Vincentas Sladkevičius have been turned into public museums.

There was established static circus in the Vytautas park of Kaunas in the beginning of the 19th century. The only professional circus organisation in Lithuania, the Baltic Circus, was founded in Kaunas in 1995. Kaunas theatres play an important role in Lithuanian society. There are at least seven professional theatres, many amateur theatres, ensembles and abundant groups of art and sports. Some of the best examples of cultural life in Kaunas are theatres of various styles:
* Kaunas State Drama Theatre
* Kaunas State Musical Theatre
* Kaunas Pantomime Theatre

==Cityscape==

===Urbanism and architecture===
The city plan is mixed. The rectangular old town at the confluence of the Nemunas and the Neris rivers is rich in valuable buildings and their complexes. During the Gothic period, the Kaunas Castle (13th–16th centuries), Old Kaunas Ducal Palace (15th century), Church of Vytautas the Great (beginning of the 15th century; also known as the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary), Church of Saint Nicholas (late 15th century), St. George&#x27;s Church and the Bernardine Monastery (1472), Church of St. Gertrude (15th–16th centuries; also has Renaissance elements), Kaunas Cathedral Basilica (construction began in the 15th century; later was reconstructed and expanded), Kaunas Town Hall (construction began in 1542; later gained late Baroque and early Classicism forms), House of Perkūnas (late 15th century – early 16th century), residential houses in the Town Hall Square, Vilnius and Kurpių Streets were built. The ensemble of the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Bernardine monastery (started in the late 16th century), the so-called Napoleonic House (16th century) has Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Mannerist architecture features. The Renaissance remains of Kaunas defensive fortifications have survived (2nd half of the 17th century).

One of the most famous monuments of Baroque architecture is the ensemble of Pažaislis Church and Monastery (started in 1667, architects G. Frediani, C. Puttini, P. Puttini). Other Baroque style buildings: Kaunas Lutheran Holly Trinity Church (1683; in 1862 Romanticism style bell tower was built, its architect was J. Woller), Corpus Christi Church (1690, in 1866 was reconstructed to an Orthodox church gained Byzantine forms), Church of St. Francis Xavier (1720; towers were built in 1725); Baroque and Classicism elements: the ensemble of the Church of the Holy Cross (1690) and the Carmelite Monastery (1777), Siručiai Palace (18th century; also known as Maironis House, from 1936 is used as the Maironis Lithuanian Literature Museum).

Forms of classicist architecture are typical in the Aukštoji Freda Manor (early 19th century), post station building complex (early 19th century; architect J. Poussier). Notable buildings of the Historicism period in Kaunas are: Kaunas State Musical Theatre (1892; architect J. Golinevičius; was expanded in the 20th century), St. Michael the Archangel Church (Neo-Byzantine style; architect K. Limarenko), brick style Saulės Gymnasium building (1913; engineer F. Malinovskis, later E. A. Frykas), Kaunas Fortress (1889).


In the first half of the 20th century, when Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania in 1919, the city was extensively modernized and thousands of new buildings were built. From 1918 to 1940 more than 12.000 construction permits were issued in Kaunas, which was an extremely rapid growth for a relatively small-scale city (90.000 inhabitants) that fundamentally changed the city&#x27;s character. The construction permits resulted in more than 10.000 buildings being built in the city and the area of Kaunas expanded 7,1 times during the interwar period. Neoclassicism prevailed in the 3rd decade of the 20th century (Kaunas School of Arts, built in 1923, Bank of Lithuania building, built in 1928, Palace of Justice and the Parliament with Art Deco elements, built in 1930) and a search for the Lithuanian national style was typical (e.g. residential house of &quot;Ragutis&quot; factory, built in 1925). The styles of Classicism and Modernism intertwined in buildings built in the beginning of the 1930s (e.g. Faculty of Medicine at Vytautas Magnus University, built in 1933, now belongs to the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Vytautas the Great War Museum and M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum, built in 1936), while Modernism and national style intertwined in the Kaunas Central Post Office (architect F. Vizbaras), built in 1932, Kaunas Garrison Officers&#x27; Club Building (architect S. Kudokas and others), built in 1937.

The most notable Rationalism style buildings in Kaunas are: Christ&#x27;s Resurrection Church (construction began in 1933, but it was converted into a radio factory from 1952 and so it was returned to the believers only in 1990 and was reconstructed in 2005), palaces of &quot;Pienocentras&quot; (architects Vytautas Landsbergis-Žemkalnis, K. Reisonas), &quot;Pažangos&quot; with Art Deco decoration elements (architect F. Vizbaras), Physical Culture (architect V. Landsbergis‑Žemkalnis, now belongs to the Lithuanian Sports University), &quot;Prekybos, pramonės ir amatų&quot; (1938, architect V. Landsbergis‑Žemkalnis), &quot;Taupomųjų kasų&quot; (1939; architects A. Funkas, B. Elsbergas, A. Lukošaitis; now is the primary building of Kaunas City Municipality); Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (1938; architect A. Šalkauskis), Military Research Laboratory for the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defense (1938; architect V. Landsbergis‑Žemkalnis; now Faculty of Chemical Technology at Kaunas University of Technology), Kaunas Clinics complex (1939; French architect U. Cassan), Kaunas Sports Hall (1939; engineer A. Rozenbliumas), Pasaka Cinema (1939), Romuva Cinema (1940), residential houses complex in V. Putvinskio Street (formed in 1928–1937). In 2023, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre included the Kaunas modernist architecture into the List of World Heritage Sites.

After World War II buildings of pseudoclassical forms were built (e.g. Kaunas railway station, built in 1953), complex engineering structures (Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant, built in 1960). From the 7th decade of the 20th century Modernism style buildings were further developed. New residential areas were built (e.g. Kalniečiai, completed in 1985), public buildings (e.g. Industrial Construction Design Institute, 1966, House for Political Education (now part of Vytautas Magnus University), 1976), shopping malls (e.g. Girstupis, 1975, Vitebskas, 1980, Kalniečių, 1986), shops (Viešnagė, 1982, Merkurijus, 1983), galleries (e.g. Kaunas Picture Gallery, 1978, Mykolas Žilinskas Art Gallery, 1989), educational institutions (e.g. Faculty of Light Industry at Kaunas University of Technology, 1983).

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
At the time of paganism Lithuanian children were educated at home schools near manors, however following the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387 schools began to be established near churches and the first parochial school in Kaunas was established in 1473. The ability to write was essential for Kaunas&#x27; merchants, craftsmen and employees of the offices of city self-government institutions work.

In 1648, Kaunas Jesuit College () was established and until 1702 its status as &quot;collegium inchoatum&quot; settled down, which meant a high school with a shortened philosophy course. Therefore, in the 16th–18th centuries Kaunas had education with levels from primary to secondary school and the studies met demands not only of Kaunas but also of the surrounding area.

On 14 October 1773, the Commission of National Education was created by the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Grand Duke Stanisław August Poniatowski, which supervised universities, schools and was responsible for other educational matters in the Commonwealth. Because of its vast authority and autonomy, it is considered as the first Ministry of Education in European history and an important achievement of the Enlightenment in the Commonwealth. At the time the education province of Lithuania was assigned to be managed by Vilnius University.

Following the Third Partition of the Commonwealth, Kaunas and Lithuania proper became a part of the Russian Empire. In 1843, the Gymnasium of the Kražiai College, one of the most important centers of education and Jesuit science in Lithuania, was transferred from Kražiai to Kaunas, and currently it is named Kaunas Maironis University Gymnasium. In 1848, Kaunas became capital of the Kovno Governorate which had 197 Lithuanian primary schools, however the education was greatly affected by the Lithuanian press ban (1865–1904) and Russification policies, especially after the 1863 January Uprising. Nevertheless, Kovno Governorate was one of the leading governorates by population literacy – 55,3%, compared to the average of 19% of population (9 years or older) of the Russian Empire in 1897.
Following the adoption of the Act of Independence of Lithuania in 1918, the Government of Lithuania was soon forced to retreat from Vilnius to Kaunas in January 1919, therefore since 1919 the Ministry of Education of Lithuania operated in Kaunas. These events resulted in the influx to Kaunas of Lithuanian intellectuals (e.g. Jonas Jablonskis, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas) and teachers who began educational activities. During the interwar period the Lithuanian educational system was transformed based on Western countries examples and the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania adopted the Primary Schools Act which required 7-11-year-old children to attend free primary education for four years (the primary education was prolonged to six years in 1936) and many new schools for various ages pupils were established. Moreover, children were taught patriotism from an early age, later children joined Ateitis and Lietuvos Skautija organizations, while school notebooks covers for pupils were printed with famous Lithuanian personalities portraits (e.g. Vytautas, Birutė, Jonas Basanavičius, etc.). In 1922, the Kaunas Art School was established in Kaunas and it was the only public art school in interwar Lithuania. In 1931, Jonas Laužikas established a special education school in Kaunas which was the first such type school in Lithuania and it still operates. The overall improvement of education system during the interwar period resulted in 92% of literacy rate of the population in Lithuania in 1939 (mostly only part of the older age inhabitants were still illiterate).

In January 1919, the War School of Kaunas was established as a military school for junior officers, while since 1921 the senior officers studied at the Higher Officers&#x27; Courses which in 1932 became the Higher Military School when a department of the General Staff was established, however both institutions were dissolved in 1940.

The Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940 and in 1944 resulted in the Sovietization of Lithuanian education system which also affected education in Kaunas until 1990, while many students, teachers, and lecturers departed to the Western Europe or faced Soviet deportations.

Following the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990, the Lithuanian education system was once again significantly reformed. Currently, Kaunas has a network of state-funded schools: 6 primary schools, 17 progymnasiums, 20 gymnasiums, and 43 private pre-school and general education institutions. The Kaunas University of Technology Gymnasium is one of the best ranked gymnasiums in Lithuania (2nd in 2024). Most of pupils in Kaunas later studies in the universities or colleges as Lithuania is one of the world&#x27;s leading countries in OECD&#x27;s statistics of population with tertiary education (58.15% of 25–34-year-olds in 2022).

===Tertiary education===


Until the 20th century Kaunas had no tertiary education institutions as the Vilnius University (est. 1579) for centuries was the only university in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but it was closed in 1832 by the tsarist authorities and the Council of Lithuania desired to revive it in the 20th century. However, during the conflict for the Vilnius Region the Lithuanians were unable to maintain control in the since 1918 declared capital Vilnius with the remnants of the Vilnius University which was firstly captured by the Bolsheviks in January 1919, then by the Polish forces in November 1920 and was eventually annexed by Poland in 1922 which left a newly restored Lithuania without any tertiary education institutions, therefore Lithuanian intellectuals sought to promptly establish it.

Already in the fall of 1919 a memorandum of Lithuanian cultural workers to establish a tertiary education institution in Kaunas was handed to the Government of Lithuania, however it was rejected due to difficult political and financial situation. Nevertheless, on 27 January 1920 the Lithuanian intellectuals who initiated the memorandum decided to establish (without the permission and financial support of the Government) the Higher Courses with six divisions which was the first higher education institution of a restored Lithuania. On 16 February 1922, the Higher Courses were reorganized to the University of Lithuania and in March an autonomy was granted, while in 1930 it was renamed after Vytautas the Great commemorating his 500th death anniversary. The status of the university diminished during the Soviet and Nazi periods and on 31 October 1950 it was even reorganized to two institutes. In 1988, the issue of re-establishment of the university was raised, while in March 1989 the Re-establishment Council was elected and in April 1989 re-established Vytautas Magnus University. Currently, VMU is among three percent of the best ranked universities worldwide per QS World University Rankings (741–750) and is the second largest Lithuanian university according to the number of enrolments.

The Kaunas University of Technology also traces its origins to the interwar VMU as a part of it was reorganized in 1950 by the Soviets to the Kaunas Polytechnic Institute, however in 1990 its university status was restored. Currently, the KTU is ranked 751-760 worldwide per QS World University Rankings and has over 1,000 academicians along with over 7,000 students. Moreover, KTU is a member of the European Consortium of Innovative Universities.

The Lithuanian University of Health Sciences is yet another university which traces its origins to the interwar VMU as a part of it was reorganized in 1950 by the Soviets to the Kaunas Medical Institute, but in 1998 its university status was restored as the Kaunas Medical University which in 2010 was merged with the Lithuanian Veterinary Academy to form a single university and currently is the largest Lithuanian university in the field of biomedical sciences.

The Lithuanian Sports University (est. in 1934, granted university status in 2012) is a unique tertiary education institution in Lithuania which specializes in the training of physical education, sports and wellness specialists of which it has already prepared 15,000.

Some Lithuanian tertiary education institutions has its divisions in Kaunas: Vilnius University Kaunas Faculty, Mykolas Romeris University Faculty of Public Security, Vilnius Academy of Art Kaunas Faculty of Art.

Non-university tertiary education in Kaunas is provided by Kaunas College, Kaunas Technical College, Kolpingo College, Kaunas College of Forestry and Environmental Engineering, SMK College of Applied Sciences, St. Ignatius of Loyola College, V. A. Graičiūnas School of Management, Vilnius Cooperative College Kaunas Branch.

The Santaka Valley is an integrated Science, Studies and Business Centre (Valley) which is one of the largest and most modern in Baltic states.

The network of tertiary education institutions which attracts a high number of students (e.g. 40,000 in 2023) resulted in Kaunas being nicknamed the &quot;student city&quot; for decades and in 2024 Kaunas was included in the worldwide list of the QS Best Student Cities Rankings 2025.

<doc id="171628" wikidata="Q640387" url="?curid=171628" title="I Am Sam">
<text>I Am Sam (stylized in all lowercase) is a 2001 American drama film co-written and directed by Jessie Nelson. It stars Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianne Wiest, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Richard Schiff, Loretta Devine and Laura Dern.
Nelson and co-writer Kristine Johnson researched the problems facing adults with intellectual disabilities by visiting the non-profit organization L.A. GOAL (Greater Opportunities for the Advanced Living). They subsequently cast two actors with disabilities, Brad Silverman and Joe Rosenberg, in key roles. The film&#x27;s title is derived from the lines &quot;I am Sam / Sam I am&quot; of the book &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; by Dr. Seuss, which is included in the movie.

The film received polarized reviews from critics and audiences. It grossed over $97 million at the box office, against a production budget of $22 million. For his role as Sam, Penn was highly acclaimed and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. The film launched the career of Dakota Fanning and her younger sister Elle Fanning, who were then seven and almost three years old respectively. Dakota Fanning became the youngest person to be nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

==Plot==
In 1993, Sam Dawson, a Starbucks barista with an intellectual disability, becomes the single father of Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, following her abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman with whom Sam had sex. Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with disabilities as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor, Annie, who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Nearly seven years later in 2001, Sam provides a loving place for precocious Lucy, though she soon surpasses his mental capacity and ability. Other children bully her for having an intellectually disabled father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more intelligent than he is.

In danger of losing child custody, Sam gets advice from his friends and also hires a lawyer, Rita Harrison, whose absorption in her work, and neglect of her son, reveals she also struggles with her role as a parent. In an attempt to prove that she is not cold, Rita agrees to take on Sam&#x27;s case &quot;pro bono&quot;. As they work to secure Sam&#x27;s rights, Sam helps Rita see her own life anew. This includes encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repair her fractious relationship with her son.

At the trial, due to pressure from the prosecutor, Sam breaks down after becoming convinced he is not capable of raising Lucy. Afterward, Lucy resides in a foster home with Miranda &quot;Randy&quot; Carpenter but tries to convince Sam to help her run away. Sam moves so he is near Lucy, so she continually leaves in the middle of the night to go to his apartment, though he immediately returns her. The foster parents, though, decide not to adopt her as they had planned, and return her to Sam. Randy assures him that she will tell the judge he is the best parent for Lucy. In turn, Sam asks Randy if she will help him raise Lucy because he feels she needs a mother figure.

The final scene depicts a soccer game, in which Sam referees and Lucy participates as a player. In attendance are Lucy&#x27;s former foster family, Sam&#x27;s friend group, and a newly single Rita with her son.

==Cast==
==Soundtrack==
The Grammy Award–nominated soundtrack, consists of original music by John Powell and cover versions of songs by The Beatles. The album contents are made up entirely of cover versions of songs by The Beatles, although it was originally intended to consist of the group&#x27;s original recordings. When producers were unable to obtain the rights to the original tracks, they commissioned artists such as the Black Crowes, Nick Cave, Stereophonics, Eddie Vedder, Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, Rufus Wainwright, the Wallflowers, Ben Harper, the Vines, and Ben Folds to record the versions released. Penn&#x27;s brother, Michael Penn, is also featured on a duet with his wife Aimee Mann.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on reviews from 146 critics, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Not only does the manipulative &quot;I Am Sam&quot; oversimplify a complex issue, it drowns it in treacle.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 28 of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A to F.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;I Am Sam&quot; is not a bad movie, and its intentions are unimpeachable. But its sentimentality is so relentless and its narrative so predictable that the life is very nearly squeezed out of it.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Undone by its best intentions, &quot;I Am Sam&quot; is an especially insipid example of the Hollywood message movie&quot;. Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;The lesson ″&quot;I Am Sam&quot;″ wants to teach us is, &#x27;All you need is love.&#x27; This is not quite strictly true. Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience.&quot; Ebert also criticized the morality tale character of the movie, saying that &quot;You can&#x27;t have heroes and villains when the wrong side is making the best sense.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewed it positively as a &quot;most inviting and accessible film that turns upon a mental condition that most people would prefer not to think about.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; commended Sean Penn for his performance: &quot;Penn&#x27;s accuracy, his lack of or sentiment, and his willingness to inhabit his character without any implicit commentary take what might have been the equivalent of an inflated TV movie and elevate it to the level of art.&quot; David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; found Michelle Pfeiffer to be the standout: &quot;Pfeiffer, enormously likable in the role, almost saves the movie.&quot;

===Accolades===
Sean Penn was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.

Dakota Fanning won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Young Performer, the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Youth in Film, the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Youth Actress, the Satellite Special Achievement Award for Outstanding New Talent, and the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Actress Age Ten or Under. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.

The soundtrack was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

The film won the inaugural Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America and was nominated for the Humanitas Prize and the Japan Academy Prize for Outstanding Foreign Language Film.

<text>The Australian Greens (AG), commonly referred to simply as the Greens, are a confederation of green state and territory political parties in Australia. As of the 2022 federal election, the Greens are the third largest political party in Australia by vote and the fourth-largest by elected representation. The leader of the party is Adam Bandt, with Mehreen Faruqi serving as deputy leader. Larissa Waters currently holds the role of Senate leader.

The party was formed in 1992 as a confederation of eight state and territorial parties. In their early years, the party was largely built around the personality of well-known Tasmanian politician Bob Brown, before expanding its representation substantially in the early part of the 21st century. The party cites four core values as its ideology, namely ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy, and peace and non-violence. The party&#x27;s origins can be traced to early environmental movement in Australia, the Franklin Dam controversy, the Green bans, and the nuclear disarmament movement. The party began with the United Tasmania Group, one of the first green parties in the world.

Following the 2022 federal election, the Australian Greens had twelve senators and four members in the House of Representatives, and as of 2020 had over 15,000 party members.

== History ==
=== Formation ===

The origins of the Australian Greens can be traced to the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group, one of the first green parties in the world, but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales who were inspired by the Builders Labourers Federation Green bans in Sydney. Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests. Key people involved in these campaigns included Bob Brown and Christine Milne, who went on to contest and win seats in the Parliament of Tasmania and eventually form the Tasmanian Greens. Both Brown and Milne subsequently became leaders of the federal party. 

The formation of the federal party in 1992 brought together over a dozen green groups, from state and local organisations, some of which had existed for 20 years. Following the formation of the national party in 1992, regional emphasis variations remained within the Greens, with members of the &quot;industrial left&quot; remaining a presence in the New South Wales branch. Brown resigned from the Tasmanian Parliament in 1993, and in 1996 he was elected as a senator for Tasmania, the first elected as an Australian Greens candidate.

Initially, the most successful Greens group during this period was The Greens (WA), which was still a separate organisation from the Australian Greens at the time. Vallentine was succeeded by Christabel Chamarette in 1992, and she was joined by Dee Margetts in 1993. However, Chamarette was defeated in the 1996 federal election. Margetts lost her seat in the 1998 federal election, leaving Brown as the sole Australian Greens senator.

=== Bob Brown era 2001–2012 ===

==== 2001–2004 ====

In the 2001 federal election, Brown was re-elected as a senator for Tasmania, and a second Greens senator, Kerry Nettle, was elected in New South Wales. The Greens opposed the Howard government&#x27;s Pacific Solution of offshore processing for asylum seekers, and opposed the bipartisan offers of support to ANZUS and the Afghanistan War by the government and Beazley Opposition in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The party described the Afghanistan commitment in particular as &quot;warmongering&quot;. Brown and Nettle&#x27;s performance in the Senate increased voter support for the party, as it showcased that the Greens were not deep ecologists nor a single-issue environmentalist organisation, thus granting approval from disaffected Labor voters.

==== 2002 Cunningham by-election ====
On 19 October 2002, the Greens won a House of Representatives seat for the first time when Michael Organ won the Cunningham by-election. In the 2004 federal election, the Australian Greens fielded candidates in every House of Representatives seat in Australia. The Greens&#x27; primary vote rose by 2.3% to 7.2%. This won them two additional Senate seats, taken by Christine Milne in Tasmania and Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, bringing the total to four.

==== 2004–2007 ====
At the 2004 Federal Election, the Greens ran John Kaye as their lead Senate candidate but were unsuccessful due to unfavourable preference flows.

==== 2007–2010 ====
The Greens increased their national vote by 1.38 points to 9.04% at the 2007 federal election, with the election of South Australian senator Sarah Hanson-Young taking the number of Greens senators to five. Senators Bob Brown (Tas) and Kerry Nettle (NSW) were up for re-election, Brown was re-elected, but Nettle was unsuccessful, becoming the only Australian Greens senator to lose their seat despite increasing her vote from 2001.

In November 2008, Senator Christine Milne was elected deputy leader in a ballot contested against Senator Rachel Siewert.

In 2009, the Greens and the Liberal Party voted to defeat Labor&#x27;s emission trading scheme legislation after failed negotiations for an emissions cut target.

==== 2010–2012 ====
The 2010 federal election marked a high point for the Greens electorally, with the party receiving its largest vote to date and sharing the balance of power. The Greens received a four percent swing to finish with 13 percent of the vote in the Senate. The Greens won a seat in each of the six states at the election, bringing the party to a total of nine senators from July 2011, holding the balance of power in the Senate. The new senators were Lee Rhiannon in New South Wales, Richard Di Natale in Victoria, Larissa Waters in Queensland, Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, Penny Wright in South Australia and Christine Milne in Tasmania. Incumbents Scott Ludlam in Western Australia, Sarah Hanson-Young in South Australia and Bob Brown in Tasmania were not due for re-election. The Greens also won their first House of Representatives seat at a general election, the seat of Melbourne with candidate Adam Bandt, who was a crossbencher in the first hung parliament since the 1940 federal election. Almost two weeks after the election, the Greens agreed to support a Gillard Labor minority government on confidence and supply votes. Labor was returned to government with the additional support of three independent crossbenchers.

Prior to the 2010 Federal Election, the Electrical Trades Union&#x27;s Victorian branch donated $325,000 to the Greens&#x27; Victorian campaign – the largest political donation ever directed to the Party up to that time.

The Greens signed a formal agreement with the Australian Labor Party involving consultation in relation to policy and support in the House of Representatives in relation to confidence and supply and three of the independents declared their support for Labor on confidence and supply, allowing Gillard and Labor to remain in power with a 76–74 minority government.

On 24 February 2011, in a joint press conference of the &quot;Climate Change Committee&quot; – comprising the Government, Greens and two independent MPs – Prime Minister Gillard announced a plan to legislate for the introduction of a fixed price to be imposed on &quot;carbon pollution&quot; from 1 July 2012 The carbon price would be placed for three to five years before a full emissions trading scheme is implemented, under a blueprint agreed by a multi-party parliamentary committee. Key issues remained to be negotiated between the Government and the cross-benches, including compensation arrangements for households and businesses, the carbon price level, the emissions reduction target and whether or not to include fuel in the price.

In April 2012, Bob stepped down as leader of the Australian Greens, and retired from the Senate in June 2012.

=== Christine Milne era 2012–2015 ===
Christine Milne led the Australian Greens through the remainder of the minority parliament, after being elected unopposed.

==== 2013 Federal Election ====
At the 2013 federal election, the House of Representatives (lower house) primary vote was 8.7 percent (−3.1) with the Senate (upper house) primary vote at 8.7 percent (−4.5). Despite receiving a decline in votes, the Greens representation in the parliament increased. Adam Bandt retained his Melbourne seat with a primary vote of 42.6 percent (+7.0) and a two-candidate preferred vote of 55.3 percent (−0.6). The Greens won four Senate positions, increasing their Senate representation from nine to ten senators.

==== 2014 Australian Senate Special Election in Western Australia ====
At the 2014 Australian Senate special election in Western Australia, the Greens won in excess of a quota with the primary vote increasing from 9.5 to 15.6 percent, re-electing Scott Ludlam.

==== 2015 ====
In December 2015, the Greens struck a deal with the Coalition government, passing a law requiring multinational private companies with a turnover over $200 million to disclose their tax arrangements. This law also made it mandatory for multinational companies with a &quot;global&quot; turnover of $1 billion or more to have to prepare &quot;general purpose&quot; financial statements, which disclose greater tax details than previously occurred in Australia. The following year the Coalition government and the Greens agreed on a permanent 15% tax rate for backpackers, in exchange for a $100 million funding boost to environmental stewardship not-for-profit Landcare.

Christine Milne stepped down from the leadership of the Australian Greens on 6 May 2015.

=== Richard Di Natale era 2015–2020 ===
Di Natale was elected unopposed as parliamentary leader of the Greens party room on 6 May 2015 following the resignation of Christine Milne from the position.

At the 2016 federal election, the House of Representatives (lower house) primary vote increased to 10.23 percent (+1.58) but decreased in the Senate (upper house), with primary vote at 8.65 percent (−0.58). Adam Bandt was elected to a third term in his Melbourne seat with a primary vote of 43.75 percent (+1.13) and a two-candidate preferred vote of 68.48 percent (+13.21). Despite a campaign focus on winning additional seats in the lower house, The Greens failed to win any lower house contests.

The Greens also lost one Senate position in South Australia, decreasing their Senate representation from ten to nine senators, to a total of ten Green members in the Parliament of Australia. The result was seen as disappointing, and caused internal divisions to flare up, with former Federal Leader Bob Brown calling upon Senator Lee Rhiannon to resign, citing the &quot;need for renewal&quot;.

==== 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis ====

In 2017, Senators Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters were forced to resign during 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis after it was found that Ludlam had dual Australian–New Zealand citizenship and Waters had dual citizenship with Canada. Subsequently, Adam Bandt and Rachel Siewert were named as temporary co-deputy leaders until the arrival of Ludlam and Waters&#x27; replacements in Canberra.

==== 2019 election ====
At the 2019 federal election, the Australian Greens received a primary vote of 10.4% in the House of Representatives, with a federal swing of +0.2%. The party&#x27;s highest vote was captured in the Australian Capital Territory (16.8%), followed by Victoria (11.9%), Western Australia (11.6%), Queensland (10.3%), Northern Territory (10.2%), Tasmania (10.1%), South Australia (9.6%) and New South Wales (8.7%). The party retained the federal electorate of Melbourne with Adam Bandt sitting at a 71.8% two-party preferred vote.

In the Senate, the Greens received favourable swings in South Australia (+5.03%), Queensland (+3.12%), the Australian Capital Territory (+1.61%), Western Australia (+1.48%), Tasmania (+1.41%) and New South Wales (+1.32%). Small swings against the Greens in the Senate were observed in only Victoria (−0.25%) and the Northern Territory (−0.54%). All six Greens senators up for re-election retained their seats, including Senators Mehreen Faruqi, Janet Rice, Larissa Waters, Sarah Hanson-Young, Jordon Steele-John and Nick McKim.

Three key seats were targeted by the Greens in Victoria, including Kooyong, Higgins and Macnamara. Prominent barrister Julian Burnside, who stood for Kooyong, came close to unseating treasurer and deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg, falling short by 5.7% in the two-party preferred vote. Greens candidate Jason Ball, for the Division of Higgins, failed to enter the two-party preferred vote, despite optimism within the Greens and a diminishing Liberal vote. In Macnamara (formerly Melbourne Ports), a three-way contest emerged between the Liberals, Labor and Greens. Greens candidate Steph Hodgins-May had come within a few hundred votes in 2016 of taking the seat, however, redistributions in the electorate for the 2019 election were unfavourable for the Greens&#x27; vote, and the party&#x27;s final vote sat at 24.2%.

On 3 February 2020, Di Natale resigned as leader of the Greens and announced his intention to resign from the Senate.

=== Adam Bandt era 2020–present ===
On 4 February, Adam Bandt was elected unopposed as parliamentary leader of the Australia Greens party room.

==== 2022 election ====

The Greens&#x27; strategy for the 2022 federal election involved targeting nine key seats, including the previously Labor-held seats of Macnamara, Griffith, Richmond, Wills, and Canberra, and four previously Liberal-held seats of Kooyong, Brisbane, Ryan and Higgins. Bandt claimed that polling suggested a hung parliament was a likely outcome and the Greens would work with Labor to &quot;kick the Liberals out and make the next government go further and faster on climate action, and make billionaires and mining corporations pay their fair share.&quot; Antony Green suggested that a redistribution in Victoria by the Australian Electoral Commission would likely increase the Greens&#x27; odds of winning the seat of Macnamara.

The party had its best ever result at the election, picking up three seats in inner Brisbane, Elizabeth Watson-Brown in the seat of Ryan, Stephen Bates in the seat of Brisbane, and Max Chandler-Mather in the seat of Griffith, to boost their representation in the House to four MPs, and won a Senate seat in every state to increase to 12 senators with new Senators Barbara Pocock, David Shoebridge and Penny Allman-Payne. This gave them the balance of power. Analysis of vote trends suggested the party succeeded in picking up former votes of both Labor and the Liberal Party. The party were unsuccessful in picking up the seat of Richmond with their high-profile candidate Mandy Nolan.

On 6 February 2023, Victorian Greens senator Lidia Thorpe announced that she would resign from the Greens to become an independent senator, over disagreements concerning the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament.

In mid-March 2024, the Greens announced they would introduce legislation seeking to break the dominance of the two supermarket giants Woolworths Group and Coles Group by forcing them to sell some of their operations. While the Albanese government did not support the bill, it found support from the centre-right National Party.

== Ideology ==

The Australian Greens are part of the global &quot;green politics&quot; movement. Party Leader Adam Bandt describes The Greens as a social democratic party. The charter of the Australian Greens identifies four main pillars as the party&#x27;s policy: &quot;social justice&quot;, &quot;sustainability&quot;, &quot;grassroots democracy&quot; and &quot;peace and non-violence&quot;.

=== Policy positions ===
==== Environment and climate change ====
The party favours environmentalism, including expansion of recycling facilities; phasing out single-use plastics; conservation efforts; and addressing species extinction, habitat loss and deforestation in Australia.

The Greens support the achieving of 100% renewable energy by 2030 through the establishment of a Green New Deal, which entails investment in renewable energy technology and a revitalisation of Australian manufacturing. Manufacturing would be required to produce solar panels, wind turbines and green steel produced from hydrogen. The party supports the creation of a publicly owned renewable energy provider to boost renewable energy and lower household electricity prices. To support the transition to clean energy, the party calls for growth in lithium mining. The Greens have also proposed plans to boost jobs and apprenticeships in the construction of public housing units as further economic stimulus as well as to address rising homelessness in Australia.

==== Finance ====
The Greens oppose tax cuts that solely benefit the top bracket of income earners and lead to economic inequality. The Greens believe that all essential services need to be adequately funded to suit community needs; and argue for the re-establishment of a publicly owned bank. The party argues for a Corporate Super-Profits Tax on major corporations, the establishment of a wealth tax on billionaires, and an end to multi-national corporation&#x27;s tax avoidance.

The party advocates a significant improvement of welfare policies. They propose solving housing shortages and homelessness through the creation of affordable social housing. The party also wants to introduce rent caps to limit growth of rental prices. Greens also propose increase in all income support payments to $88 a day, that would make them $1,232 per fortnight. To help students, the party wants to forgive all student debt. The Greens also advocate for free childcare as well as free public transport. Finally Greens propose to increase the minimum wage. 

Green politicians have campaigned on free university and technical and further education. The party opposes fee hikes for degrees and funding cuts for universities, and have called for increased funding for public schools. The party also supports the abolition of all student debt.

==== Health ====
The party supports universal health care through extending Medicare coverage into dental health care and mental health care. Furthermore, the party supports reproductive health rights and voluntary euthanasia. The Greens support drug law reform, including the legalisation of cannabis; treating drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal issue; and the provision of free drug checking stations at community events and relevant venues. Further information on the Greens cannabis legalisation proposed law can be found at Legalising Cannabis Bill 2023.

==== Social issues ====
The Greens are often known for their outspoken advocacy on numerous social issues, such as the legalisation of marriage equality, the right to seek asylum, and gender equality. The Greens also advocate for policies that they believe will strengthen Australian democracy and &quot;clean up politics&quot;, including capping political donations and instituting a federal anti-corruption watchdog.

==== Agriculture ====
In terms of agricultural policy, the party strongly favours policies to promote animal welfare and climate resilience with farmers. The Greens strongly support reducing soil and water degradation through community-driven decision-making processeses, and supporting farmers experiencing effects of climate change.

==== Animal welfare ====
The Greens are in favour of phasing out live animal exports, instead favouring investment in the domestic chilled meat industry. The Greens have also campaigned on banning greyhound racing, whaling and animal-tested cosmetics. The party believes in phasing out caged egg production and sow stalls, instead favouring ethical farming practices. The party advocates for the reduction of methane emissions from livestock through research, animal health and nutrition, selection and genetics.

==== Foreign affairs ====
On foreign policy, the party says that it wants &quot;Independent, transparent and accountable foreign and defence policies based on mutual respect.&quot;

==== Voting system ====
The party supports proportional representation in the House of Representatives and local government.

== Structure ==
===Parliament===
====Federal leaders====

On Saturday 12 November 2005 at the national conference in Hobart, the Australian Greens abandoned their long-standing tradition of having no official leader and approved a process whereby a parliamentary leader could be elected by the Greens Parliamentary Party Room. On Monday 28 November 2005, Bob Brown – who had long been regarded as &quot;de facto&quot; leader by many inside the party, and most people outside the party – was elected unopposed as the Parliamentary Party Leader. Each leader has been described to represent a faction within the party, with the political journalist Paddy Manning describing that Christine Milne came from the right wing of the party, while Bandt is the first Greens leader from the left wing of the party.

====Parliamentary portfolios====

Greens MPs are each assigned their own portfolios, or specific areas of responsibility. All portfolios are decided by the party and may differ in title from the government&#x27;s portfolio priorities The Greens have formed a Gun Control portfolio, of which there is no equivalent in the government.

Portfolios are divided into five major categories according to the Greens: &quot;an equal society&quot;, &quot;world-class essential services&quot;, &quot;climate and the environment&quot;, &quot;the green economy&quot;, and &quot;a confident Australia&quot;.

===National Council===

The Australian Greens is federally organised with separately registered state parties signing up to a national constitution, yet retaining considerable policy-making and organisational autonomy from the centre. The national decision-making body of the Australian Greens is the National Council, consisting of delegates from each member body (a state or territory Greens party), two members of the federal party room, a representative of the Australian Greens First Nations Network (AGFNN, or Blak Greens), and the national office bearers including the National Convenor, Secretary and Treasurer. As at May 2020, all seven of the party&#x27;s office bearer positions are held by women. There is also a Public Officer, a Party Agent and a Registered Officer. The National Council arrives at decisions by consensus. All policies originating from this structure are subject to ratification by the members of the Australian Greens at National Conference.

===State and territory parties===

The Australian Greens are a federation consisting of eight parties from each state and territory. The various Australian states and territories have different electoral systems, all of which allow the Greens to gain representation. As of 2024, the Greens hold at least one seat in all eight state and territory legislatures.

Five Greens have become ministers at the state/territory level: Nick McKim and Cassy O&#x27;Connor in Tasmania, 2010–2014; and in the ACT, Shane Rattenbury since 2012 and Emma Davidson and Rebecca Vassarotti since 2020.

Most of the state-based Green parties which have joined the Australian Greens do not have a formal leader, and instead they have a shared leadership structure. However, Tasmania, Victoria, and the ACT have adopted singular leadership structures into their party.

The current Australian Green member parties are the following:
====Working groups====

A variety of working groups have been established by the National Council, which are directly accessible to all Greens members. Working groups perform an advisory function by developing policy, reviewing or developing the party structure, or by performing other tasks assigned by the National Council.

The Australian Young Greens are a federation of Young Greens groups from each Australian state and territory. Together they form the youth wing of the Australian Greens

A national Sexuality and Gender Identity Working Group exists at a federal level, and there are LGBTIQ working groups in some state and territory parties, including: Queer Greens Victoria, Queensland Rainbow Greens, SA Greens Queer Members Action Group, NSW Greens Sex, Sexuality and Gender Identity Working Group.

== Support ==
The Greens generally draw support from younger voters with higher than average educational attainment. The Greens absorbed much of the Australian Democrats&#x27; support base following its downfall as the third party in Australia and many of the social and environmental policies and issues that the Democrats advocated for have been taken up by the Greens. Much like the Democrats, the Greens have a higher proportion of supporters who are university educated, under 40, identify as professionals in their field, are small business owners, and earn above the national average wage. Notably, there has also been a steady increase in working-class support for the Greens since the creation of the party.

In 2019, Ian McAllister in an analysis of class voting patterns found that Greens voters are distinguished as being high in cultural capital, such as a university education, but tend to be in asset poverty due to not owning their own home. Political scientist Todd Farrell in an analysis in 2020 found that, unlike other minor parties in the past (such as the Australian Democrats), Greens supporters hold high levels of party identification and consistent durable vote, indicating a political realignment in Australian politics away from the major Labor and Liberal parties.

David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;Observed with sensitivity and played with a deep well of sorrow by Wilkinson, this story breathes real tenderness into the movie&#x27;s reflections on growing older and making peace with past mistakes&quot;. 

In 2013 he portrayed Lord Mansfield in the costume drama &quot;Belle&quot; starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The following year Wilkinson portrayed Lyndon B.

<text>EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is an international airport in the administrative commune of Saint-Louis, in the French Alsace part of the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel. It is west of the tripoint of France, Germany, and Switzerland, northwest of the city of Basel in Switzerland, southeast of Mulhouse in France, and south-southwest of Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany. The airport is jointly administered by France and Switzerland, governed by a 1949 international convention. The airport serves as a base for easyJet Switzerland and mainly features flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Plans for the construction of a joint Swiss–French airport started in the 1930s but were halted by the Second World War. Swiss planners identified Basel as one of the four cities for which a main urban airport would be developed and recognized that the existing airfield at Sternenfeld in Birsfelden was too small and, due to the development of the adjacent river port facilities, unsuitable for expansion. The suburb of Allschwil was proposed for a new airport, and this would require being constructed across the Franco-Swiss border, leading to talks with French authorities centered on developing a single airport that would serve both countries, enhancing its international airport status.

In 1946 talks resumed and it was agreed that an airport would be built north of Blotzheim, France. France would provide the land and the Swiss canton of Basel-Stadt would cover the construction costs. Basel-Stadt&#x27;s Grand Council agreed to pay the costs for a provisional airport even before an international treaty was signed (which was not until 1949). Construction began on 8 March 1946 and a provisional airport with a runway was officially opened on 8 May.

Between autumn 1951 and spring 1953, the east–west runway was extended to and the &quot;Zollfreistrasse&quot;(:fr:Route douanière de l&#x27;aéroport à Bâle) (customs-free road) was constructed, allowing access from Basel to the departure terminal without passing through French border controls.

The first enlargement project was approved by referendum in Basel in 1960 and, over the following decades, the terminals and runways were continually extended. The north–south runway was extended further to in 1972. In 1984, an annual total of 1 million passengers was reached. In 1987, the trademark name &quot;EuroAirport Basel–Mulhouse–Freiburg&quot; was introduced.

In 1992 a total of 2 million passengers used the airport. By 1998, this number rose up to 3 million.

In December 1998, Swissair inaugurated service to Newark using Airbus A310s. The main reason it launched the route was that it had heard another carrier was planning to begin flights from Basel to Newark; Swissair wanted to start flying the route before the other airline did. The company also hoped to attract people working for the pharmaceutical companies in Basel. Crossair, a subsidiary of Swissair, code-shared on the flight. The carrier operated a hub at the EuroAirport, from which it flew to 40 regional destinations.

===Development in the 2000s===
Swissair terminated the flight to Newark in March 2000, saying it suffered from low occupancy. The local newspaper &quot;bz Basel&quot; commented that the airline did not advertise it well.

A decision was made to enlarge the terminals again with a new &quot;Y-finger&quot; dock. The first phase was completed in 2002 and the second phase in 2005.

Crossair was the largest airline at the Basel airport. Following the Swissair liquidation in 2001, the subsequent ending of services in early 2002, and the transformation of Crossair into Swiss International Air Lines, the number of flights from Basel fell and the new terminal was initially underused. In 2004 the low-cost carrier easyJet opened a base at Basel and the passenger totals rose again, reaching 4 million in 2006.

From 2007 until 2009, Ryanair also flew to the airport for the first time. However, as a result of a dispute over landing fees, the airline closed all eight routes. More recently Ryanair announced it would return in April 2014, with the resumption of Basel–Dublin route as well as a short-lived revival of the Basel – London–Stansted route. Ryanair added a Basel-Zagreb route in December 2021.

In May 2008, Air Transat commenced seasonal service to Montreal. The airline flew an Airbus A310 on the route. In December 2014, Swiss International Air Lines announced it would cease all operations at Basel by 31 May 2015 due to heavy competition from low-cost carriers. Swiss faced direct competition on five out of its six Basel routes, all of which were operated by Swiss Global Air Lines. The Lufthansa Group announced it would set up Eurowings&#x27; first base outside Germany at the EuroAirport as a replacement. However these plans were later cancelled in favour of Vienna Airport.

In January 2017, the removal of Basel/Mulhouse from Air Berlin and its Swiss subsidiary Belair&#x27;s route networks was announced.

==International status==
EuroAirport is one of the few airports in the world operated jointly by two countries, in this case France and Switzerland. It is governed by a 1949 international convention. The headquarters of the airport&#x27;s operations are located in Blotzheim, France. The airport is located completely on French soil; it also has a Swiss customs border and is connected to the Swiss customs area by a -long customs-free road to Basel, allowing air travellers access into Switzerland bypassing French customs clearance. The airport is operated via a state treaty established in 1946 wherein the two countries (Switzerland and France) are granted access to the airport without any customs or other border restrictions. The airport&#x27;s board has eight members each from France and Switzerland and two advisers from Germany.

The airport building is split into two separate sections: Swiss and French. Though the entire airport is on French soil and under French jurisdiction, the Swiss authorities have the authority to apply Swiss laws regarding customs, medical services and police work in the Swiss section, including the customs road connecting Basel with the airport. French police are allowed to execute random checks in the Swiss section as well. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Treaty in March 2009, the air side was rearranged to include a Schengen and non-Schengen zone. As border control is staffed by both Swiss and French border officers, passengers arriving from non-Schengen countries must approach the customs office of the country for which they have received the Schengen entry visa, which is either France or Switzerland. On the other hand, the Schengen area can be left from any Schengen area country.

Due to its international status, EuroAirport has three IATA airport codes: BSL (Basel) is the Swiss code, MLH (Mulhouse) is the French code and EAP (EuroAirport) is the neutral code. Some booking systems show different ticket prices for flights to BSL and MLH, as one of them can be a domestic flight within France (with different rules on fuel taxation, etc.), and in some cases, tickets can be issued where a &quot;flight&quot; between BSL and MLH is shown on the itinerary. The airport&#x27;s ICAO airport code is LFSB. LSZM, the old code, has been reassigned to the airport of Mollis.

In 2020, a French court decided that job contracts on the airport are governed by French labor laws, not Swiss ones. Basing on a 2012 agreement, the Swiss companies active on the airport have used Swiss labor regulations, which are more employer-friendly than the French ones. For example, the Swiss laws made it easier to dismiss workers, while the French rules prescribe a 35-hour week, earlier retirement, and much higher compensations in case of dismissals. In exchange, working under Swiss laws results in much higher wages.

==Terminal==
The EuroAirport consists of a single terminal building, a brick-style main area with four levels and the Y-shaped gate area attached to it. The basement (&quot;Level 1&quot;) contains the access to the car park, the ground level (&quot;Level 2&quot;) features the arrivals facilities. &quot;Level 3&quot; is the check-in area divided into halls 1–4 while the departure gates are located at &quot;Level 4&quot;. The gate area features gates 1–2, 20–46, 60–61 and 78–87 of which gates 22–32 are used for non-Schengen flights. Six of the boarding gates feature jet bridges, the others are used for walk- or bus-boarding. The entry and exit area is divided into French and Swiss parts.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at the EuroAirport:


===Cargo===
==Statistics==
==Other facilities==

* The headquarters of Swiss International Air Lines and Swiss Global Air Lines are on the grounds at EuroAirport Basel–Mulhouse–Freiburg in the Swiss section of the airport; even though the airport is within France, the Swiss head office is only accessible from Switzerland. The Swiss division &quot;Swiss Aviation Software&quot; has its head office there as well.
* Farnair Switzerland formerly had its head office at EuroAirport. As in the case of the Swiss head office, the area with the former Farnair head office may only be accessed from Switzerland. The head office moved to its current location, the Villa Guggenheim in Allschwil, in proximity to EuroAirport, on 1 October 2011.
* Hello, a now defunct Swiss airline, had its head office in the General Aviation area of EuroAirport.
* Prior to the formation of Swiss International Air Lines, the regional airline Crossair was headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport. Prior to its dissolution, Crossair Europe was headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport as well.

==Ground transportation==

===Car===

The airport is connected to motorway A3 which leads from Basel to the southeast of Switzerland passing Zürich.

===Bus===
There are several bus connections to and from the EuroAirport to all three countries around it:

*On the Swiss exit Basel&#x27;s BVB bus No. 50 connects the airport to the Basel SBB railway station, which is the main Swiss and French railway station in Basel. During weekdays, there is a service every 7–8 minutes and on weekends, every 10 minutes during daytime. The duration of the trip is about 20 minutes. On the day of a visitor&#x27;s arrival to Basel, a reservation confirmation from a local hotel guarantees a free transfer by public transport from the station or the EuroAirport to the hotel.
*On the French exit, Saint-Louis&#x27; DistriBus bus No. 11 connects the airport to the Saint-Louis railway station in 10 minutes.
*The German private bus company Flixbus calls at Zürich, Basel and Freiburg Germany up to five times a day. FlixBus however only serves the French exit of the airport. Serving Swiss destinations from the French part of the airport is a questionable legal trick, as people transport by foreign companies inside of Switzerland is illegal without official authorization due to cabotage regulations, which will not be granted by Swiss authorities on routes already supported by tax-financed public services. It&#x27;s illegal to travel between Swiss destinations only. Police started to do random checks and to fine failing travelers. Serving Swiss destinations from abroad however is compliant.

===Rail===
As of 2021, the closest train station is the Saint-Louis-la-Chaussée station, some north of the terminal. Plans to build a dedicated airport rail link have existed for some time, however political delays have pushed the earliest operating date to 2035.

=== Tram ===
There are two town tramway systems in relatively close proximity to the airport - Basel tramway and Mulhouse tramway. As the former was extended across the border in the 2010s, there are plans to further extend it to serve the airport. Presently, the tramway serves St Louis SNCF Station, where one can change for the shuttle bus to the airport. Plans to extend the Mulhouse tramway to the airport do seem to be further from realization, however.

<doc id="171635" wikidata="Q606583" url="?curid=171635" title="Why did the chicken cross the road?">
<text>&quot;Why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; is a common riddle joke with the answer being &quot;To get to the other side.&quot; It is commonly seen as an example of anti-humor, in that the curious setup of the joke leads the listener to expect a traditional punchline, but they are instead given a simple statement of fact. The joke has become iconic as an exemplary generic joke to which most people know the answer, and has been repeated and changed numerous times over the course of history.

== History ==

The riddle appeared in an 1847 edition of &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, a New York City monthly magazine:
There are &#x27;quips and quillets&#x27; which &quot;seem&quot; actual conundrums, but yet are none. Of such is this: &#x27;Why does a chicken cross the street?[&#x27;] Are you &#x27;out of town?&#x27; Do you &#x27;give it up?&#x27; Well, then: &#x27;Because it wants to get on the other side!&#x27;
According to music critic Gary Giddins in the Ken Burns documentary &quot;Jazz&quot;, the joke was spread through the United States by minstrel shows beginning in the 1840s as one of the first national jokes.

In the 1890s, a pun variant version appeared in the magazine &quot;Potter&#x27;s American Monthly&quot;:

Why should not a chicken cross the road?
It would be a fowl proceeding.
== Variations ==
There are many riddles that assume a familiarity with this well-known riddle and its answer. For example, an alternate punchline can be used for the riddle, such as &quot;it was too far to walk around&quot;. One class of variations enlists a creature other than the chicken to cross the road, in order to refer back to the original riddle. For example, a duck (or turkey) crosses &quot;because it was the chicken&#x27;s day off,&quot; and a dinosaur crosses &quot;because chickens didn&#x27;t exist yet.&quot; Some variants are both puns and references to the original, such as &quot;Why did the duck cross the road?&quot; &quot;To prove he&#x27;s no chicken&quot;.

Other variations replace side with another word often to form a pun. Some examples are:
&quot;Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the idiot&#x27;s house. ...Knock-knock.&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s there?&quot;) &quot;The chicken.&quot;

&quot;Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide.&quot;

&quot;Why did the chewing gum cross the road? It was stuck to the chicken&#x27;s foot.&quot;

&quot;Why did the whale cross the ocean? To get to the other tide.&quot;

&quot;Why did the dinosaur cross the road? Chickens didn&#x27;t exist yet.&quot;

&quot;Why did Darth Vader cross the road? To get to the Dark Side.&quot;

&quot;Why did the chicken cross the Möbius strip? To get to the same side.&quot;

As with the lightbulb joke, variants on these themes are widespread.

<doc id="171637" wikidata="Q553790" url="?curid=171637" title="Thomas Dolby">
<text>Thomas Morgan Robertson (born 14 October 1958), known by the stage name Thomas Dolby, is an English musician, producer, composer, entrepreneur and teacher.

Dolby came to prominence in the 1980s, releasing hit singles including &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hyperactive!&quot; (1984). He has also worked as a producer and as a session musician.

In the 1990s, Dolby founded Beatnik, a Silicon Valley software company whose technology was used to play internet audio and later ringtones, most notably on Nokia phones. He was also the music director for TED Conferences. On the faculty at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University since 2014, Dolby leads Peabody&#x27;s Music for New Media program, which enrolled its first students in the fall of 2018.

==Early life==
Dolby was born Thomas Morgan Robertson in London, England, to (Theodosia) Cecil, &quot;née&quot; Spring Rice (1921–1984) and Martin Robertson (1911–2004), professor of classical Greek Art and Archaeology at the University of London, Oxford University, and Trinity College, Cambridge. His older brother is the academic Stephen Robertson (computer scientist). In at least one interview in the 1980s, Dolby claimed, &quot;I was born in Cairo, because my father is an archaeologist&quot; — many subsequent articles have republished or reprinted this spurious claim.

At school in London, Dolby was good friends with Shane MacGowan of The Pogues and used to sit with him in the back row of the English Literature class. Dolby described him as &quot;extremely smart&quot;. Dolby later attended Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, England, from 1975 to 1976, where he completed his A Levels. One of his first jobs was a part-time position at a fruit and vegetable shop. In his youth, Dolby lived or worked in France, Italy, and Greece.

Dolby spoke of his early musical experiences in a 2012 interview:
==Stage name==
The stage name Thomas Dolby originated from a nickname &quot;Dolby&quot; that he picked up in the early 1970s, when he was &quot;always messing around with keyboards and tapes&quot;. The name derives from the name of the audio noise-reduction process of Dolby Laboratories used for audio recording and playback. He adopted the stage name &quot;Thomas Dolby&quot; to avoid confusion with British singer Tom Robinson, who was popular when he began his career. Early publicity implied that &quot;Dolby&quot; was a middle name, and that Dolby&#x27;s full name was Thomas Morgan Dolby Robertson; this is legally incorrect, but he does sometimes informally go by the initials TMDR.

After Dolby released &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot; in 1982, Dolby Laboratories expressed concern regarding the stage name. Dolby&#x27;s record label refused to make him change his name, and Dolby Labs did not raise the issue again until later. After a lengthy legal battle, the court decided that Dolby Labs had no right to restrict the musician from using the name. It was agreed that he would not release any electronic equipment using the name.

Dolby is unrelated to Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Dolby, who is a novelist, filmmaker, and son of the Dolby Laboratories founder Ray Dolby.

==Music career==
In the late 1970s Dolby formed the Camera Club with Bruce Woolley. After leaving the Camera Club he joined Lene Lovich&#x27;s band as keyboardist and wrote her hit song &quot;New Toy&quot;. He also wrote songs for other artists and worked as a record producer before launching his solo career in 1981.

==Solo music career==
Dolby is associated with the new wave movement of the early 1980s, a form of pop music incorporating electronic instruments, but Dolby&#x27;s work covers a wide range of musical styles and moods distinct from the high-energy pop sound of his few, better-known commercial successes.

===&quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot;===
Originally released in the UK and US and including the songs &quot;Europa and the Pirate Twins,&quot; &quot;Airwaves,&quot; and &quot;Radio Silence,&quot; the first releases of Dolby&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot; (Harvest, 1982) did not include the signature hit, &quot;She Blinded Me with Science.&quot; After the five-song EP &quot;Blinded by Science&quot; introduced the catchy single, &quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot; was re-released with the single that, combined with its accompanying video, became Dolby&#x27;s most commercially successful single, reaching No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was released a total of five times, each with changes in song order and included songs, or even including a different version of &quot;Radio Silence&quot; or extended remix of &quot;She Blinded Me with Science.&quot;

&quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot; reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. It juxtaposed themes of radio technology, aircraft, and naval submarines with those of relationships and nostalgia. While much of the album&#x27;s instrumentation is synthesisers and samplers, the album credits a long list of guest musicians as well, with instruments ranging from harmonica and violin to guitar and percussion.

===Dolby&#x27;s Cube===
Beginning in 1983, Dolby collaborated with a number of artists in an occasional studio-bound project called Dolby&#x27;s Cube. The project had no set line-up, and was essentially a forum for Dolby to release material that was more dance-oriented. Dolby&#x27;s Cube released a single in 1983 (&quot;Get Out of My Mix&quot;), another in 1985 (&quot;May the Cube Be with You&quot;), and performed soundtrack work for the film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; in 1986. Collaborators in Dolby&#x27;s Cube at various junctures included Lene Lovich, George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic, Francois Kevorkian, and Lea Thompson.

===&quot;The Flat Earth&quot;===
In 1984, Dolby released his second LP, &quot;The Flat Earth&quot; (Capitol), which peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart and at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in the US. With a wide range of influences including nostalgic jazz, funk-tinged Motown R&amp;B, and world music along with a strong electronic element, and featuring a slew of guest musicians including longtime Dolby collaborator Matthew Seligman on bass, Kevin Armstrong on guitar, Clif Brigden on percussion, and guest vocals from Robyn Hitchcock, Bruce Woolley, and others, &quot;The Flat Earth&quot; further established Dolby&#x27;s wide range of talents as musician, songwriter, and producer. The album included a cover of the Dan Hicks song &quot;I Scare Myself.&quot;

&quot;Hyperactive!&quot; was the first and most successful single from the album, peaking at No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Dolby&#x27;s highest-charting single in his home country.

===&quot;Aliens Ate My Buick&quot;===
In contrast to the overall introverted nature of &quot;The Flat Earth&quot;, Dolby described his next release, &quot;Aliens Ate My Buick&quot; (1988):
&quot;Aliens Ate My Buick&quot; was strongly funk and dance influenced. The first single was &quot;Airhead&quot;, a satirical song about a stereotypical young-and-rich California woman, which peaked at No. 53. The second single, &quot;Hot Sauce&quot;, a George Clinton song, peaked at No. 80. Another single, &quot;My Brain Is Like A Sieve,&quot; peaked at No. 89 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was co-produced by Bill Bottrell, and featured Terry Jackson on bass guitar.

===&quot;Astronauts and Heretics&quot;===
For &quot;Astronauts &amp; Heretics&quot; (Virgin UK), Dolby expanded even further stylistically, starting the songwriting process at the piano, then again collaborating with a variety of guest musicians. Both Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia played guitar on &quot;The Beauty of a Dream&quot;. Eddie Van Halen plays on &quot;Eastern Bloc&quot; and &quot;Close but No Cigar.&quot; Other collaborators included Jimmy Z on sax, Budgie (of Siouxsie and the Banshees) on drums and Leland Sklar on bass guitar. Terry Jackson also contributed bass guitar on four songs before his 1991 death in a plane accident with seven other members of Reba McEntire&#x27;s support band for her &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot; tour. 

The highest-charting song off this album was &quot;Close but No Cigar,&quot; which reached No. 22 on the UK charts. Two other songs on the album, &quot;I Love You Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Silk Pyjamas&quot;, employed Zydeco influences, courtesy of Crowley, Louisiana, and guest musicians Michael Doucet of BeauSoleil on violin, Wayne Toups on accordion, and Al Tharp on banjo. Even though some recording for the album was done in remote locations, the bulk of &quot;Astronauts &amp; Heretics&quot; was recorded at NRG Recording Studios with input from trusted Dolby co-producer Bill Bottrell, and mixed down at Smoke Tree Studios in Chatsworth, California.

===&quot;The Sole Inhabitant&quot;===

Following his involvement in Beatnik, Dolby returned to his musical career in 2006. He performed his first public solo show in 15 years at the Red Devil Lounge in San Francisco, California, on 21 January 2006, surprising the crowd who were there to see local band Notorious. He then launched an American tour, the Sole Inhabitant Tour, on 12 April 2006, comprising a string of small dates in California, a science education benefit in Boulder, Colorado, and gigs across America before receptive crowds.

The United States leg of the &quot;Sole Inhabitant Tour 2006&quot; was captured on a &quot;live&quot; CD and DVD. The CD represents a recording of two gigs played by Dolby at Martyrs in Chicago, while the DVD was filmed at the Berklee Performance Center at Berklee College of Music. The DVD also includes a 30-minute interview and a lecture by Dolby at the college. Both the CD and DVD were released in November 2006. Dolby autographed and numbered the first 1,000 copies of the CD and DVD.

A show at the 800-capacity Scala club in London was booked for 3 July 2006 as a warm-up for Dolby&#x27;s Hyde Park set opening for Depeche Mode. The show sold out in a matter of days and prompted Dolby to reprioritise the UK, resulting in him moving with his family from California back to England and in a nine-date Sole Inhabitant tour of the UK in October 2007, coinciding with the release of a lavish box set of the Sole Inhabitant CD and DVD by UK independent label Invisible Hands Music.

Thomas toured throughout the months of November and December 2006 with electronic musician BT. This tour included a version of &quot;Airwaves&quot; that BT added his own technique to, which was the opening song on the UK leg of the Sole Inhabitant tour (&quot;sans&quot; BT).

Thomas Dolby&#x27;s 15 March 2007 performance at the SxSW festival was released as the live EP &quot;Thomas Dolby &amp; The Jazz Mafia Horns, Live at SxSW&quot; (with musicians from San Francisco&#x27;s Jazz Mafia collective).

The 2007 UK Sole Inhabitant tour included three new songs previously played on the US tour, one called &quot;Your Karma Hit My Dogma&quot;, another called &quot;Jealous Thing&quot;, and a cover version of the Special AKA&#x27;s &quot;What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend.&quot; &quot;Your Karma Hit My Dogma&quot; was inspired by Kevin Federline&#x27;s unauthorised use of a sample from Mobb Deep&#x27;s &quot;Got It Twisted,&quot; which in turn had used an authorised sample of &quot;She Blinded Me with Science.&quot; The tag line from that story became the title of the song. The wording was lifted by Thomas from a bumper sticker on a car that he saw whilst living in the San Francisco Bay area. In a move close to performance art, Dolby tried to post a &#x27;cease and desist&#x27; legal letter on Kevin Federline&#x27;s MySpace page when other attempts to contact him proved fruitless. The song is on the &quot;Live at SxSW&quot; EP.

The second new song, &quot;Jealous Thing&quot;, was performed at least at The Graduate in Cambridge and London&#x27;s Islington Academy on the UK tour in Summer 2007 and features a Bossa-Nova type rhythm.

===2009 reissues===
A CD plus DVD set entitled &quot;The Singular Thomas Dolby&quot; was released by EMI on 18 May 2009. As the name suggests it is a digitally remastered compilation of previously released singles. The DVD contains all the video singles that were available on the original VHS/BETA/LASERDISC release of &quot;The Golden Age of Video&quot;, as well as the videos for the songs &quot;Silk Pyjamas&quot;, &quot;I Love You Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Close but No Cigar&quot;. These three missing videos are for the singles taken from the 1992 album &quot;Astronauts &amp; Heretics&quot;, which received critical acclaim but garnered unimpressive sales.

&quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot; and &quot;The Flat Earth&quot; were remastered and reissued later that year with numerous previously unreleased bonus tracks. &quot;The Golden Age of Wireless&quot; reissue was a two disc set including a DVD of the complete &quot;Live Wireless&quot; video.

===&quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;===
In 2010 Dolby began work on a new studio album entitled &quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;. The album is divided into three parts, with the first two parts initially made available to members of The Flat Earth Community Forum, Dolby&#x27;s online community. Each of the three digital EPs takes its name from one of the three sections of the full-length album that later followed. The first EP, &quot;Amerikana&quot;, was released digitally on 16 June 2010. The second EP is entitled &quot;Oceanea&quot;, and was released on 29 November 2010. Due to favourable reviews and radio airplay, &quot;Oceanea&quot; was released commercially on 28 March 2011. The third section of the album, entitled &quot;Urbanoia&quot;, was not released as a download or physical CD, but the songs were premiered online as part of the Floating City game (see below).

Contributors to the album include Kevin Armstrong, Matthew Seligman (both had played together with him on &quot;The Flat Earth&quot; and as part of David Bowie&#x27;s Live Aid appearance), Bruce Woolley, drummer Liam Genockey, guitarist Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Regina Spektor, Natalie MacMaster, Eddi Reader and Imogen Heap.

In a 2010 press release he was quoted as saying:
&quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot; was recorded in the &quot;Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, Dolby&#x27;s recording studio built within a 1930s lifeboat and powered entirely by renewable energy, which is located in the garden of Dolby&#x27;s beach house on England&#x27;s North Sea coast.

===&quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot; game===
In June 2011 Dolby announced the game &quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;, a multiplayer online game that shares a title with the full-length album release planned to follow after the game&#x27;s conclusion. In Dolby&#x27;s own words, &quot;The Floating City is set against a dystopian vision of the 1940s that might have existed had WWII turned out a lot differently.&quot; Survivors explore a fictional Google map, forming tribes and trading relics amidst a bizarre sea-going barter society. As they struggle to unravel the enigma that is The Floating City, players can haggle over merchandise and music downloads, including brand new songs from &quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;, Dolby&#x27;s first album in 20 years, scheduled to be released following the climax of the game. The game was played from June through August 2011, and included elements of trading, mystery, competition, and co-operation. Players earned free song downloads, and the winning team or &quot;tribe&quot; was awarded a private performance from Dolby.

==Session and production work ==
Parallel to his solo career, Dolby also worked as a session musician and record producer. He played on albums such as Thompson Twins album &quot;Set&quot; and Foreigner&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;4&quot;. Dolby also worked as session keyboard player on Def Leppard&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Pyromania&quot; album. Dolby appeared on &quot;Pyromania&quot; using the alias Booker T. Boffin.

In 1985, Dolby was a member of David Bowie&#x27;s band for his performance at Live Aid. He also provided production on Joni Mitchell&#x27;s album &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. He had previously covered the Mitchell song &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; in 1981 after being inspired by her 1975 album &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot;. He and Mitchell clashed in the studio, with Dolby&#x27;s precise working methods proving incompatible with Mitchell&#x27;s more freeform approach. Dolby wrote in his memoir that he was &quot;probably too much of a brat, with my own blinkered way of working&quot;.

Dolby produced two albums for the English sophisti-pop band Prefab Sprout: 1985&#x27;s &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. He also produced four tracks from 1988&#x27;s &quot;From Langley Park to Memphis&quot;, including the hit single &quot;The King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

In 1987, Dolby played synthesizer on Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States that December.

==Film and video games==
Dolby has composed for a handful of films and video games. He also played the role of Stanley in the 1990 film &quot;Rockula&quot;.

===Scores for film and video games===

====Films====
====Video games====
===&quot;The Invisible Lighthouse&quot;===
In 2012, Dolby learned of the decommissioning of the Orfordness Lighthouse near his Suffolk home, and proceeded to film a documentary, &quot;The Invisible Lighthouse&quot;, to chronicle the shutdown of the lighthouse as well as his childhood growing up in the area. Dolby took this film on the road through the US and UK in the Autumn of 2013, accompanying the film with live music, narration, and sound effects by Blake Leyh. The film won the DIY Film Festival award for Best Picture.

==Headspace and Beatnik==

In 1993, Dolby established the Headspace company. This was intended to provide tools for interactive audio, as at the time Dolby was frustrated about the lack of interactive audio tools. During this period, Dolby worked on a number of video game soundtracks through his company. The company was later approached to create MIDI-based music for WebTV, leading to Dolby composing several key music tracks that were bundled with the devices.

Following the acquisition of the company Igor&#x27;s Software Laboratories in 1996, which was also involved with creating audio for WebTV, Headspace developed a new downloadable file format designed specifically for Internet usage called Rich Music Format with the RMF file extension. It had the advantage of small file size like MIDI but allowed recorded sampled sounds to be included at a higher bitrate for better overall reproduction. RMF music files could be played in a browser using the free Beatnik Player plug-in, and were also encrypted to prevent unauthorised duplication, while info such as the composer and copyright information could also be embedded within the files. In 1999, Headspace, Inc., was renamed Beatnik, Inc., and later shifted its focus towards software synthesizers for mobile phones, which it licensed to mobile phone manufacturers including Nokia. As truetone ringtones eventually overtook polyphonic ringtones in popularity, Beatnik went defunct in 2011.

Dolby stepped down from his position as CEO in 2002, feeling that the business was no longer interesting to him, although he remained on the board. This subsequently led to him founding Retro Ringtones LLC, which produced the RetroFolio ringtone asset management software suite for companies involved in the mobile phone ringtone business, as well as offering ringtones that could be purchased by businesses. These ringtones largely consisted of sound clips such as animal sounds, celebrity quotes and sci-fi sound effects, as well as polyphonic covers of popular theme songs. At the 2004 second annual Mobile Music Awards in Miami, Florida, RetroFolio won &quot;Best of Show&quot; and &quot;Best New Technology&quot; awards. The company ended business in 2005 and has since been suspended by Secretary of State of California.

Dolby created hundreds of digital polyphonic ringtones on mobile phones, both at Beatnik and Retro Ringtones. He was often a speaker at technology conferences such as Comdex, Websphere, and Nokia.

==Other endeavours==
===1985 Grammy Awards===
In 1985, Dolby, along with Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, and Howard Jones, appeared at the Grammy Awards, which were televised. All four musicians were successful in the mid-1980s music scene, and they were also all keyboard and synthesizer experts.

===Virtual reality===
Dolby&#x27;s first experiment with virtual reality took place in the fall of 1992, when he was invited by the Guggenheim Museum, New York, to design and install a sonic VR experience. This led to The Virtual String Quartet programmed by Eric Gullichsen, and sponsored by Intel Corp. The experience ran on an IBM 386 processor with a Convolvatron 4-channel audio card. Users wore a head-mounted display and found themselves in the midst of a computer-generated string quartet playing Mozart. The sound was fully spatialized as the user moved around the physical space. Tickling a player with the joystick resulted in that musician switching to improvisation in a &#x27;hot jazz&#x27; or Appalachian bluegrass style.

In the fall of 2018, Dolby created a New Media workshop at The Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University with VR equipment donated by HTC Vive. Students in his course are learning to compose music for VR and AR.

On 4 October 2018, Dolby performed a live score for the High Fidelity VR event &#x27;Escape from Zombie Island.&#x27; He appeared &#x27;in-world&#x27; as his own avatar, where he triggered and played real-time horror film music. He also performed his first ever full VR concert at the Futvrelands Festival on 17 November 2018, in front of over 250 other avatars.

===TED Conference===

From 2001 to 2012, Dolby was musical director of the TED Conference, an annual event held, first, in Monterey, California, and subsequently in Long Beach, California. He provided live musical introductions to sessions, sometimes with a TED house band, and helped secure guest musicians and entertainers. Onstage, he played with singers and performers such as Eddi Reader, Natalie MacMaster, Rachelle Garniez and David Byrne, and premiered his own song &quot;Love Is a Loaded Pistol&quot; onstage at TEDGlobal 2010. He stood down from the position in September 2012 to pursue music.

In March 2012, at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, Dolby spoke at the DESIGN West conference, produced by UBM Electronics.

===Academic career===
In March 2014, Dolby was named Homewood Professor of the Arts at Baltimore&#x27;s Johns Hopkins University. In March 2017, the Peabody Institute announced that Dolby would lead a new four-year undergraduate degree program, &quot;Music for New Media&quot;, and the first cohort would commence in the fall of 2018.

==Equipment==
Dolby said he became interested in electronic music because &quot;I&#x27;m not a very proficient keyboard player, so the computer became my musical instrument ... None of the equipment is essential, though. In a way, I was happier when I just had one monophonic synthesizer and a two-track tape deck&quot;. His first instrument, found in EMS&#x27;s garbage dumpster at 277 Putney Bridge Road, was the Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser.

The following is a list of notable instruments and the electronic equipment that Dolby has used on his recordings:

* PPG 340/380 Wave Computer &amp; Sequencer
* PPG Wave 2.2 synthesizer
* Fairlight CMI Series III sampler
* Moog Micromoog synthesizer
* Roland D-50 synthesizer
* Roland MKS-20 digital piano rack
* Roland MKS-70 Super JX rackmount synthesizer
* Opcode Studio Vision sequencing software
* Apple Macintosh Quadra 840AV computer
* Roland Jupiter-4
*Roland Jupiter-8
* Korg M1 rackmount synthesizer
* E-MU SP-12 sampling drum sequencer
* Linn 9000 sampling drum sequencer
* Simmons electronic drums
* Yamaha DX7
* Yamaha REV-1 digital reverb processor

== Personal life ==
Dolby married actress Kathleen Beller in 1988; they have three children. His brother is the probabilistic information retrieval researcher Stephen Robertson.

==Awards and nominations==
In July 1998, Dolby received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement in Internet Music&quot; award from &quot;Yahoo! Internet Life&quot;. In 2012 he performed at Moogfest and was the recipient of The Moog Innovation Award, which celebrates &quot;pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog&quot;. In February 2018, Dolby was awarded the Roland Lifetime Achievement Award. Dolby has received four Grammy nominations, two each in 1984 and 1988.

<doc id="171638" wikidata="Q1139202" url="?curid=171638" title="Minamoto no Yoshinaka">
<text>, also known as , was a Japanese samurai lord mentioned in the epic poem &quot;The Tale of the Heike.&quot; A member of the Minamoto clan, he was a cousin and rival of shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo during the Genpei War between the Minamoto and the Taira clans in the late Heian period. 

== Early life ==
Yoshinaka was born in Musashi Province. His father, Minamoto no Yoshikata, was killed by Minamoto no Yoshihira in 1155. Yoshihira also sought to kill Yoshinaka who escaped to Shinano Province. He was raised by Nakahara no Kanetō, the father of Imai Kanehira, together with his milk-brother Imai Kanehira, who would later become his best friend and most loyal retainer. Yoshinaka later changed his name from Minamoto to , to reflect the Kiso Mountains where he was raised.

== Genpei War ==

Yoshinaka accepted Prince Mochihito&#x27;s call to the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira in 1181. He entered the Genpei War by raising an army and invading Echigo Province. He then defeated a Taira force sent to pacify the area.

The Taira army captured the fortress of Hiuchi in 1183. Yoshinaka later that year was confronted by his cousin, Minamoto no Yoritomo, whose army had entered Shinano. They reconciled and resolved to unite against the Taira. Yoshinaka to seal the agreement sent his son Yoshitaka (or Yoshimoto) to Kamakura as a hostage. However, having been shamed by the process, Yoshinaka was now determined to beat Yoritomo to Kyoto, defeat the Taira on his own, and take control of the Minamoto clan.

Yoshinaka defeated the army of Taira no Koremori at the Battle of Kurikara Pass and marched to Kyoto. The Taira retreated out of the capital, taking the child Emperor Antoku with them. Yoshinaka&#x27;s army entered the capital with the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa who issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to join with Yukiiye in &quot;destroying Munemori and his army&quot;. The emperor also bestowed upon Yoshinaka the title of &quot;Asahi Shōgun&quot; ().

Yoshinaka plotted with Yukiie in &quot;setting up a government in their own northern province&quot;. Learning Go-Shirakawa had sought help from his cousin Yoritomo, Yoshinaka seized the cloistered emperor and burned his palace. Yoritomo ordered his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to destroy Yoshinaka.

He was subsequently driven out of Kyoto and killed by his cousins at the Battle of Awazu in Ōmi Province (present-day Shiga Prefecture) along with Kanehira. With night coming and with many enemy soldiers chasing him, he attempted to find an isolated spot to kill himself. However, the story says that his horse became trapped in a field of partly frozen mud and his enemies were able to approach him and kill him.

== Legacy ==
Yoshinaka was buried in Ōtsu, in Ōmi; a temple was built in his honor during the later Muromachi period. Its name, Gichū-ji, has the same two kanji as his given name. Kanehira&#x27;s grave is also in Otsu, but it is not close to Yoshinaka&#x27;s. The Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō, pursuant to his last wishes, was buried next to Minamoto no Yoshinaka in Gichū-ji.

Minamoto no Yoshinaka is one of many main characters in the Kamakura period epic, the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot;. The story of Yoshinaka and Kanehira is fairly well known in Japan; it is also the subject of the Noh play &quot;Kanehira&quot;, in which Kanehira&#x27;s tormented ghost describes his and Yoshinaka&#x27;s death, and his wish to go to the other side.

==In popular media==
*In the &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; timeline, Minamoto-no-Yoshinaka is the romantic partner of Tomoe Gozen, an Archer-class servant. Yoshinaka is summoned for the first time as a rogue Saber-class servant in the game &quot;Fate/Samurai Remnant&quot; where his backstory aligns with Tomoe&#x27;s.
