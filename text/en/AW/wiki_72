<text>In the Book of Mormon, the Lamanites () are one of the four peoples (along with the Jaredites, the Mulekites, and the Nephites) described as having settled in the ancient Americas. The Lamanites also play a role in the prophecies and revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants, another sacred text in the Latter Day Saint movement.

In the Book of Mormon&#x27;s narrative, the Lamanites begin as wicked rivals to the more righteous Nephites, but when the Nephite civilization became decadent, it lost divine favor and was destroyed by the Lamanites. Latter Day Saints have historically associated Lamanites with present-day Native American cultures.

==Book of Mormon narrative==

According to the Book of Mormon, the family of Lehi, described as a wealthy Hebrew prophet, the family of Ishmael, and Zoram traveled from the Middle East to the Americas by boat in around 600 BC. In his dying blessings to his children, Lehi assigns tribes to his descendants, usually named after the son whose family made up the tribe: Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites after Nephi, Joseph, Zoram, Laman, and Lemuel. Lehi&#x27;s son Sam is included in the Nephites, his sons-in-law are presumably included together in the Ishmaelites, and Zoram was not Lehi&#x27;s son, but his family travelled with Lehi&#x27;s family. In 2 Nephi 5, the narrative divides the people into Nephites and Lamanites; in his book &quot;The Testimony of Two Nations&quot;, Michael Austin interprets these as categories of convenience for the sake of the narrative, similar to how the twelve tribes of Israel are divided into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah in the Old Testament.

After the two groups separated from each other, the rebellious Lamanites were cursed and &quot;cut off from the presence of the Lord.&quot; They received a &quot;skin of blackness&quot; so they would &quot;not be enticing&quot; to the Nephites. Centuries later, the narrative in the Book of Alma still describes the skin of the Lamanites as &quot;dark.&quot;

The Book of Mormon describes the animosity the Lamanite people held toward the Nephites. The Lamanites believed they were &quot;driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers&quot; and were wronged by Nephi and so swore vengeance against his descendants. The Lamanites taught their children to have &quot;eternal hatred&quot; towards the Nephites, and &quot;that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them.&quot;

After the two groups warred for centuries, the narrative states that Jesus Christ appeared to the more righteous Nephites and the Lamanites, who, by then, had converted in large numbers to righteousness before God. Soon after his visit, the Lamanites and Nephites merged into one nation and co-existed for two centuries in peace. The Book of Mormon further recounts, &quot;There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.&quot;

However, 84 years after the coming of Christ, &quot;a small part of the people who had revolted from the church&quot; started calling themselves Lamanites again. Those who remained were again identified as Nephites, but both groups were reported to have fallen into apostasy. The reestablished Lamanites and Nephites were largely distinguished by ideological choices rather than by previous ethnic distinctions. The Book of Mormon recounts a series of large battles over two centuries, ending with the extermination of the Nephites by the Lamanites.

==Doctrine and Covenants==
The Doctrine and Covenants is composed of writings that adherents in the Latter Day Saint movement believe to be revelations from God. It is considered scripture in the sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement and says that God called Oliver Cowdery (D&amp;C 28:8) and later Peter Whitmer and Parley P. Pratt (D&amp;C 32:1–2) to teach the gospel to the Lamanites. Cowdery is given the power to build up God&#x27;s church among them (D&amp;C 30:6). The men believed that God was referring to the Native Americans and began teaching among the Lenape.

==Proposed modern descendants==


Historically, Mormons have identified the Lamanites as the primary ancestors of the North American Native Americans.

===Teachings in the 1800s===
Early Mormons expected large numbers of Native American converts, who would teach gentiles how to interpret scripture, according to a revelation given to Joseph Smith in May 1829. In the Book of Mormon, Jesus told people in the New World that conversion would precede the millennium, and members interpreted this promise as one referring to Lamanites, and by extension, Native Americans. These Native American converts would work alongside other members as partners in building Zion. After the failure of early missions to Indigenous peoples, Smith focused on building Zion without the cooperation of &quot;Lamanite&quot; people. The concept began to expand to include all Indigenous peoples of the Americas.

===Teachings in the 1900s===
Twentieth century teachings connecting modern Native Americans and Lamanites reached their height under the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball (1973 –1985), then declined, but did not disappear. For example, in 1967, then apostle (later church president) Kimball stated that Native Americans were descendants of Middle Eastern settlers who traveled over the ocean, and were &quot;not Orientals&quot; of East Asian origin, further quoting a previous First Presidency proclamation which said God, &quot;has revealed the origin and the records of the aboriginal tribes of America, and their future destiny.-And we know it.&quot; During the time many Polynesian people converted, the concept expanded to include them as well. The scriptural account of Hagoth was used to justify the connection. Kimball definitively stated in 1971, &quot;The term Lamanite includes all Indians and Indian mixtures, such as the Polynesians ...&quot; and, &quot;the Lamanites number about sixty million; they are in all of the states of America from Tierra del Fuego all the way up to Point Barrows, and they are in nearly all the islands of the sea from Hawaii south to southern New Zealand.&quot; The 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon said Lamanites &quot;are the principal ancestors of the American Indians&quot;.

===Teachings in the 2000s===
The existence of a Lamanite population has received no support in mainstream science or archaeology. Genetic studies indicate that the Indigenous Americans are related to the present populations in Mongolia, Siberia, and the vicinity, and Polynesians to those in Southeast Asia.

In the twenty-first century, LDS Church outlets have stated that &quot;[n]othing in the Book of Mormon precludes migration into the Americas by peoples of Asiatic origin&quot;. The 1981 edition introduction to the Book of Mormon was changed in 2006 from stating Lamanites &quot;are the principal ancestors of&quot; to &quot;are among the ancestors of the American Indians.&quot;

Apologetics seeking to maintain relatively orthodox understandings of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s depiction of Lamanites while recognizing the findings of modern genetic studies—some of which were publicized by the LDS Church at the turn of the twenty-first century—argued that DNA findings invalidated not the existence of Book of Mormon peoples per se but the presumption that they were a hemispheric society. This has involved supposing that Nephites and Lamanites dwelled in only part of the Americas while genetically identified ancestors of Indigenous peoples occupied the rest.

==Impact on views on race==


In the Book of Mormon, Lamanites are described as having received a &quot;skin of blackness&quot; to distinguish them from the Nephites. The &quot;change&quot; in skin color is often mentioned in conjunction with God&#x27;s curse on the descendants of Laman for their wickedness and corruption: 
And he had caused the cursing to come upon [the Lamanites], yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, and they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.
On the other hand, the Book of Mormon teaches that skin color is not a bar to salvation and that God:
denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.

The non-canonical 1981 footnote text of the Book of Mormon closely linked the concept of &quot;skin of blackness&quot; with that of &quot;scales of darkness falling from their eyes,&quot; which suggests that the LDS Church has now interpreted both cases as being examples of figurative language.

Several Book of Mormon passages have been interpreted by some Latter Day Saints as indicating that Lamanites would revert to a lighter skin tone upon accepting the gospel. For example, at a 1960 LDS Church General Conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that the skin of Latter-day Saint Native American was gradually turning lighter:

That view was buoyed by passages such as 2 Nephi 30:6, which in early editions of the Book of Mormon, read: [T]heir scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and a delightsome people. In 1840, with the third edition of the Book of Mormon, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, whose adherents believe translated the writings of ancient prophets to become the Book of Mormon, changed the wording to &quot;a pure and a delightsome people,&quot; consistent with contemporary interpretation of the term &quot;white&quot; as used in scripture. However, all future LDS Church printings of the Book of Mormon until 1981 continued from the second edition, saying the Lamanites would become &quot;a white and delightsome people.&quot;

Eventually in the Book of Mormon narrative, the labels &quot;Nephite&quot; and &quot;Lamanite&quot; became terms of political convenience, and membership was both varied and fluid and not based on skin color. Within the first 200 years of the Nephites&#x27; 1,000 year chronology, the prophet Jacob stated that any who were enemies of his people were called Lamanites and that any who were friends were called Nephites:
But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.

===Anti-Lamanite narrator bias===
Book of Mormon scholars have used various lenses to interpret how race is portrayed in the Book of Mormon, particularly in relation to the Lamanites. Throughout the book, Nephite narrators describe the Lamanites as a &quot;wild&quot;, &quot;ferocious&quot;, and &quot;bloodthirsty people&quot; who &quot;loved murder&quot;. As Grant Hardy, Jared Hickman, Elizabeth Fenton, and Terryl Givens explain, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s first-person narration means its content is couched in &quot;limited, human perspectives&quot;. The Nephite narrators of the Book of Mormon had the power to &quot;characterize their antagonists [the Lamanites] as they wished&quot;, Armand Mauss writes. Deidre Green, a professor of Mormon studies, suggests that the prophet Jacob condemns the Nephites&#x27; racist attitudes towards the Lamanite people and &quot;clarifies that righteousness is manifest through right intentions and actions, not physical appearance.&quot; Michael Austin argues that Jacob&#x27;s warning to the Nephite people concerning their prejudice against the Lamanites is one of the book&#x27;s attempts to combat the &quot;anti-Lamanite&quot; biases presented by the individual narrators. Austin further supports Max Perry Mueller&#x27;s assertion that the narrative of the Book of Mormon does not support anti-Lamanite prejudices, using the story of Samuel the Lamanite as an example of criticism in the book&#x27;s narrative of Nephite tendencies to &quot;link skin color to righteousness&quot;.

===Book of Mormon chapter summaries===
In December 2010, the LDS Church made changes to the non-canonical chapter summaries and to some of the footnotes in its online version of the Book of Mormon. In Second Nephi 5, the original wording was the following: &quot;Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cursed, receive a skin of blackness, and become a scourge unto the Nephites.&quot; The phrase &quot;skin of blackness&quot; and the passage was changed to &quot;Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from the presence of the Lord, are cursed, and become a scourge unto the Nephites.&quot; The second change appears in the summary of Mormon 5. Formerly, it included the phrase that &quot;the Lamanites shall be a dark, filthy, and loathsome people.&quot; The new version deleted the phrase &quot;dark, loathsome, and filthy&quot; and now reads &quot;the Lamanites will be scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with them.&quot;

The changes are seen by some critics to be another step in the evolution of the text of the Book of Mormon to delete racist language from it. Others, such as Marvin Perkins, see the changes as better conforming the chapter headers and footnotes to the meaning of the text in light of the LDS Church&#x27;s 1978 Revelation on Priesthood. In an interview, a former Brigham Young University graduate student suggested that the changes were made for &quot;clarity, a change in emphasis and to stick closer to the scriptural language&quot;.

<doc id="172592" wikidata="Q648191" url="?curid=172592" title="Organic reaction">
<text>Organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds. The basic organic chemistry reaction types are addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions, photochemical reactions and redox reactions. In organic synthesis, organic reactions are used in the construction of new organic molecules. The production of many man-made chemicals such as drugs, plastics, food additives, fabrics depend on organic reactions.

The oldest organic reactions are combustion of organic fuels and saponification of fats to make soap. Modern organic chemistry starts with the Wöhler synthesis in 1828. In the history of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awards have been given for the invention of specific organic reactions such as the Grignard reaction in 1912, the Diels–Alder reaction in 1950, the Wittig reaction in 1979 and olefin metathesis in 2005.

==Classifications==
Organic chemistry has a strong tradition of naming a specific reaction to its inventor or inventors and a long list of so-called named reactions exists, conservatively estimated at 1000. A very old named reaction is the Claisen rearrangement (1912) and a recent named reaction is the Bingel reaction (1993). When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey–House–Posner–Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction.

Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.

Finally, reactions are also classified by mechanistic class. Commonly these classes are (1) polar, (2) radical, and (3) pericyclic. Polar reactions are characterized by the movement of electron pairs from a well-defined source (a nucleophilic bond or lone pair) to a well-defined sink (an electrophilic center with a low-lying antibonding orbital). Participating atoms undergo changes in charge, both in the formal sense as well as in terms of the actual electron density. The vast majority of organic reactions fall under this category. Radical reactions are characterized by species with unpaired electrons (radicals) and the movement of single electrons. Radical reactions are further divided into chain and nonchain processes. Finally, pericyclic reactions involve the redistribution of chemical bonds along a cyclic transition state. Although electron pairs are formally involved, they move around in a cycle without a true source or sink. These reactions require the continuous overlap of participating orbitals and are governed by orbital symmetry considerations. Of course, some chemical processes may involve steps from two (or even all three) of these categories, so this classification scheme is not necessarily straightforward or clear in all cases. Beyond these classes, transition-metal mediated reactions are often considered to form a fourth category of reactions, although this category encompasses a broad range of elementary organometallic processes, many of which have little in common and very specific.

==Fundamentals==
Factors governing organic reactions are essentially the same as that of any chemical reaction. Factors specific to organic reactions are those that determine the stability of reactants and products such as conjugation, hyperconjugation and aromaticity and the presence and stability of reactive intermediates such as free radicals, carbocations and carbanions.

An organic compound may consist of many isomers. Selectivity in terms of regioselectivity, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity is therefore an important criterion for many organic reactions. The stereochemistry of pericyclic reactions is governed by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules and that of many elimination reactions by Zaitsev&#x27;s rule.

Organic reactions are important in the production of pharmaceuticals. In a 2006 review, it was estimated that 20% of chemical conversions involved alkylations on nitrogen and oxygen atoms, another 20% involved placement and removal of protective groups, 11% involved formation of new carbon–carbon bond and 10% involved functional group interconversions.

==By mechanism==
There is no limit to the number of possible organic reactions and mechanisms. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens, although this detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone. Organic reactions can be organized into several basic types. Some reactions fit into more than one category. For example, some substitution reactions follow an addition-elimination pathway. This overview isn&#x27;t intended to include every single organic reaction. Rather, it is intended to cover the basic reactions.

In condensation reactions a small molecule, usually water, is split off when two reactants combine in a chemical reaction. The opposite reaction, when water is consumed in a reaction, is called hydrolysis. Many polymerization reactions are derived from organic reactions. They are divided into addition polymerizations and step-growth polymerizations.

In general the stepwise progression of reaction mechanisms can be represented using arrow pushing techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition to intermediates and products.

== By functional groups ==
Organic reactions can be categorized based on the type of functional group involved in the reaction as a reactant and the functional group that is formed as a result of this reaction. For example, in the Fries rearrangement the reactant is an ester and the reaction product an alcohol.

An overview of functional groups with their preparation and reactivity is presented below:

==Other classification==
In heterocyclic chemistry, organic reactions are classified by the type of heterocycle formed with respect to ring-size and type of heteroatom. See for instance the chemistry of indoles. Reactions are also categorized by the change in the carbon framework. Examples are ring expansion and ring contraction, homologation reactions, polymerization reactions, insertion reactions, ring-opening reactions and ring-closing reactions.

Organic reactions can also be classified by the type of bond to carbon with respect to the element involved. More reactions are found in organosilicon chemistry, organosulfur chemistry, organophosphorus chemistry and organofluorine chemistry. With the introduction of carbon-metal bonds the field crosses over to organometallic chemistry.

<text>Search and rescue (SAR) is the search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger. The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain rescue; ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs (such as K9 units); urban search and rescue in cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water.

International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) is a UN organisation that promotes the exchange of information between national urban search and rescue organisations. The duty to render assistance is covered by Article 98 of the UNCLOS.

==Definitions==
There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved and country in question.

*Canadian Armed Forces and Canadian Coast Guard: &quot;Search and Rescue comprises the search for, and provision of aid to, persons, ships or other craft which are, or are feared to be, in distress or imminent danger.&quot;
*United States Coast Guard: &quot;The use of available resources to assist persons or property in potential or actual distress.&quot;
*United States Department of Defense: A search is &quot;an operation normally coordinated by a Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) or rescue sub-center, using available personnel and facilities to locate persons in distress&quot; and rescue is &quot;an operation to retrieve persons in distress, provide for their initial medical or other needs, and deliver them to a place of safety&quot;.

==History==

One of the world&#x27;s earliest well-documented SAR efforts ensued following the 1656 wreck of the Dutch merchant ship &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot; off the west coast of Australia. Survivors sought help, and in response three separate SAR missions were conducted, without success.

On 29 November 1945, a Sikorsky R-5 performed the first civilian helicopter rescue operation in history, with Sikorsky&#x27;s chief pilot Dmitry &quot;Jimmy&quot; Viner in the cockpit, using an experimental hoist developed jointly by Sikorsky and Breeze. All five crew members of an oil barge, which had run aground on Penfield Reef, were saved before the barge sank.

In 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 with 269 occupants was shot down by a Soviet aircraft near Sakhalin. The Soviets sent SAR helicopters and boats to Soviet waters, while a search and rescue operation was initiated by U.S., South Korean, and Japanese ships and aircraft in international waters, but no survivors were found.

In July 2009, Air France Flight 447 was lost in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. An international SAR effort was launched, to no avail. A third effort nearly two years later discovered the crash site and recovered the flight recorders.

In early 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 crashed under mysterious circumstances. Many nations contributed to the initial SAR effort, which was fruitless. In June 2014, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau commissioned the MV &quot;Fugro Equator&quot; to lead a three-month survey of the ocean bed. , the search for Flight 370 had become the largest SAR to date.

==Types of search and rescue==

===Ground (lowland) search and rescue===
Ground search and rescue is the search for persons who are lost or in distress on land or inland waterways. People may go missing for a variety of reasons. Some may disappear voluntarily, due to issues like domestic abuse. Others disappear for involuntary reasons such as mental illness, getting lost, an accident, death in a location where they cannot be found or, less commonly, due to abduction. Ground search and rescue missions that occur in urban areas should not be confused with &quot;urban search and rescue&quot;, which in many jurisdictions refers to the location and extraction of people from collapsed buildings or other entrapments.

In some countries, the police are the primary agency for carrying out searches for a missing person on land. Some places have voluntary search and rescue teams that can be called out to assist these searches.

Search and rescue agencies may contain small specialist teams for executing operations where there are specific environmental risks. Examples include swift water rescue, flood response, technical rope rescue, confined space rescue, over-snow rescue, and thin ice rescue.

===Mountain rescue===
Mountain rescue relates to search and rescue operations specifically in rugged and mountainous terrain.

===Cave rescue===
Cave rescue is a highly specialised form of rescue for rescuing injured, trapped or lost cave explorers.

===Urban search and rescue===
Urban search and rescue (US&amp;R or USAR), also referred to as Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR), is the location and rescue of persons from collapsed buildings or other urban and industrial entrapments. Due to the specialised nature of the work, most teams are multi-disciplinary and include personnel from police, fire and emergency medical services. Unlike traditional ground search and rescue workers, most US&amp;R responders also have basic training in structural collapse and the dangers associated with live electrical wires, broken natural gas lines and other hazards. While earthquakes have traditionally been the cause of US&amp;R operations, terrorist attacks and extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes have also resulted in the deployment of these resources.

===Combat search and rescue===
Combat search and rescue (CSAR) is search and rescue operations that are carried out during war that are within or near combat zones.

===Maritime search and rescue===
Maritime search and rescue is carried out at sea to save sailors and passengers in distress, or the survivors of downed aircraft. The type of agency which carries out maritime search and rescue varies by country; it may variously be the coast guard, navy or voluntary organisations. When a distressed or missing vessel is located, these organisations deploy helicopters, rescue vessels or any other appropriate vessel to return them to land. In some cases, the agencies may carry out an air-sea rescue (ASR). This refers to the combined use of aircraft (such as flying boats, floatplanes, amphibious helicopters and non-amphibious helicopters equipped with hoists) and surface vessels. Another type of Maritime search and rescue is Submarine rescue. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention) is the legal framework that applies to international maritime and air-sea rescue.

==By nation==

===Australia===

;National
The Australian search and rescue service is provided by three authorities; the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the State/Territory Police Jurisdictions. In a very broad sense, the JRCC respond to national and international registered aircraft, off shore marine incidents and beacon activations. The ADF are responsible for Australian and foreign military personnel, vehicles, vessels and aircraft while within the Australian SRR. Police are responsible for coastal marine incidents, lost persons, unregistered aircraft, inland waterways, ports and identified beacons. The JRCC operates a 24-hour Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Canberra and is responsible for the national coordination of both maritime and aviation search and rescue. The JRCC is also responsible for the management and operation of the Australian ground segment of the Cospas-Sarsat distress beacon detection system. The JRCC&#x27;s jurisdiction spans Australia and as well as covering 52.8 million square kilometres of the Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans constituting about 11% of the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The JRCC is staffed by SAR specialists who have a naval, merchant marine, air force, civil aviation or police service background. The JRCC also coordinates medical evacuations, broadcasts maritime safety information and operates the Australian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP). In coordinating search and rescue missions, the JRCC will call on assistance from organisations as appropriate, such as the Defence forces, Border Protection Command, trained aviation organisations (Civil SAR Units), emergency medical helicopters, state Police services and trained Air Observers from the State Emergency Service. There are also other organisations, such as the non-profit Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service that is based at a number of sites around Australia and contracted by various authorities to deliver search and rescue services.

;State

State Police in many states operate state-based search and rescue squads, such as the Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad, which provides specialist expertise, advice and practical assistance in land search and rescue on most terrain including snow and vertical cliff search and rescue. There are also state-based volunteer search and rescue groups such as the NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue in New South Wales and Bush Search and Rescue Victoria in Victoria. These state-based groups draw searchers from bushwalking, mountaineering and specialist rescue clubs within their State. A few groups respond on horseback as mounted search and rescue. The State Emergency Service is a collection of volunteer-based emergency organisations established in each state or territory which are responsible for many rescue efforts in urban and rural areas and in any rescue that results from flood or storm activity. In rural areas the SES conducts most bush search, vertical and road traffic rescues. In urban areas they assist the police and fire services with USAR.

===Azerbaijan===
Search and rescue operations in Azerbaijan are managed by the Ministry of Emergency Situations onshore in cooperation with the State Civil Aviation Administration in air and the State Maritime Administration offshore.

===Belgium===
Search and rescue duties along the Belgian part of the North Sea are executed by the Belgian Air Component. From its Koksijde Air Base it operates NH-90 helicopters.

===Brazil===
Search and rescue duties in Brazil are the responsibility of the Salvarmar Brasil (MRCC Brazil), of the Brazilian Navy and Divisão de Busca e Salvamento (D-SAR) (English: Search and Rescue Division), of the Brazilian Air Force.

===Canada===


Air and marine Search and rescue duties in Canada are the responsibility of the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard in conjunction with volunteer organisations. The Department of National Defence (DND) has overall responsibility for the coordinated search and rescue system. SAR operations are organised by Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC). The JRCC are staffed 24 hours a day by SAR Co-ordinators from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces. Authority for the provision of maritime SAR is assigned to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans by the Canada Shipping Act and the Canada Oceans Act. Ground and inland water search and rescue (GSAR) is the responsibility of provinces and territories with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and other police forces coordinating operations, often using volunteer GSAR teams operating in specific areas under provincial coordinating bodies.

The Canada Shipping Act, most recently passed in 2001, is the framework document that funds international SAR activities.

The Canadian Forces have five assigned SAR squadrons:

*103 Search and Rescue Squadron, CFB Gander, CH-149 Cormorant
*413 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Greenwood, CH-149 Cormorant &amp; CC-130 Hercules
*424 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Trenton, CH-146 Griffon &amp; CC-130 Hercules
*435 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Winnipeg, CC-130 Hercules
*442 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Comox, CH-149 Cormorant &amp; CC-115 Buffalo

Plus three Combat Support Squadrons with SAR roles:

*417 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Cold Lake, CH-146 Griffon
*439 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Bagotville, CH-146 Griffon
*444 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Goose Bay, CH-146 Griffon

Some municipalities and provinces have their own SAR units:
* Halton Regional Police Service Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario
* Toronto Police Service Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario
* Peel Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario and rivers in Peel Region
* Ontario Provincial Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Great Lakes (excluding Lake Michigan) and Georgian Bay
* Durham Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario and lakes within Durham Region
* York Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Simcoe

* Vancouver Police Department - using marine craft on waterways around the City of Vancouver
* Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (Toronto) - using land base equipment
* Brockville Police Service Marine Patrol Unit - using a boat on the St. Lawrence River
There are also volunteer non-profit associations that conduct SAR in Canada:
* British Columbia, there are 80 community based volunteer Groups in B.C. providing GSAR services within assigned areas in conjunction with Police, ambulance and other agencies. The GSAR Groups are represented by the British Columbia Search and Rescue Association
* Alberta / BC Cave Rescue, Alberta/British Columbia
* Canada Task Force 2, Alberta

* Search and Rescue Manitoba (SARMAN), Manitoba
* Vancouver Urban Search and Rescue (Canadian Task Force One), British Columbia
*York Sunbury Search &amp; Rescue - New Brunswick

===Croatia===

In Croatia the SAR Service is part of the Croatian Navy and the Croatian Coast Guard with their headquarter in Rijeka.

===Cyprus===

The Cyprus Republic Search and Rescue (SAR) system is organised by the Cyprus Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC Larnaca).

The JRCC (Greek: Κέντρο Συντονισμού Έρευνας και Διάσωσης) is an independent agency of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus that started its operations on a 24h basis on 7 August 1995 as a unit of the Cyprus Air Force Command.

On 1 March 2002, the JRCC took full responsibility for investigating, organising, coordinating and executing every SAR incident-operation in the Republic of Cyprus Search &amp; Rescue Region (SRR). JRCC Larnaca operated as a military unit until 26 July 2010, when JRCC was transformed to an independent agency under the Ministry of Defence with the Minister being responsible for its operational aspects. Logistic and technical support is the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications &amp; Works. Its primary mission is to organise the Cyprus Republic Search And Rescue system, to co-ordinate, control and direct SAR operations in its area of responsibility (which is identical to the Nicosia FIR), in order to find and rescue people whose lives are at risk, as a result of an air or naval accident, in the least possible time. This is achieved by coordinating all the different agencies involved such as the Cyprus Police Aviation Unit, the Cyprus Port and Naval Police, the Cyprus National Guard Naval Command, the Cyprus National Guard Air Force Command, the Cyprus Civil Defence and other secondary units.

The JRCC reports directly to the operational control of the Ministry of Defence and it is staffed by qualified personnel of the Cyprus National Guard, mainly from the branches of the Navy and the Air Force.

==== Northern Cyprus ====
There are also search and rescue teams in Northern Cyprus. Search and rescue operators in Turkish Republic of North Cyprus are primarily:

* SSTB Civil Defence Organisation Presidency (Turkish : &quot;Sivil Savunma Teşkilat Başkanlığı&quot;)
** Emergency Management Committee
* DAK Search and Rescue in Natural Disasters (Turkish : &quot;Doğal Afetlerde Arama Kurtarma)&quot;
* AKUT TRNC

Military

* TRNC Coast Guard Command 
* TRNC Coastal Safety (police)
* Security Forces Command Search and rescue teams.

===Denmark===

Search and rescue operators in Denmark are primarily: Danish air force Squadron 722, Danish navy air squadron, naval home guard and the Danish Maritime Safety Administration, coordinated by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, operated by the navy and air force in the Danish Naval Commands facilities near Aarhus. Internationally the Danish works mainly with Germany, Norway and Sweden. With the two latter, the annual exercises &quot;Baltic SAREX&quot; and
&quot;Scan-SAR&quot; are conducted.

SAR services in Denmark started in 1957 with seven Sikorsky S-55s. Their piston engines produced only and they had limited fuel capacity, so their operational range was short. To increase the operational area, Pembroke twin-engined fixed-wing aircraft were employed for search. These aircraft would localise the distressed person(s) and the S-55s would then rescue them. The SAR service was started for respond to fighter-plane crashes as 79 aircraft crashed, with 62 dead, in the period 1950–1955., but civilian SAR duties are also conducted.

In 1962, eight ship-based Aérospatiale Alouette IIIs were received. These were primarily meant for the ships patrolling the North Atlantic, but also supported the S-55s. In 19641965 the seven S-55s were replaced with eight Sikorsky S-61A helicopters.

In 2007, the Danish Defence held a public display in Horsens, to raise awareness about rescue services and maritime safety. Maritime SAR is important because Denmark has a relative long coast line to its land mass.

In 2008, the SAR forces in Denmark were equipped with eight EH-101, one or two Lynx, 34 naval home guard vessels and 21 rescue vessels, as well as the naval vessels at sea. The EH-101s operate from bases in Aalborg, Skrydstrup and Roskilde. When the sea water temperatures are low a helicopter is also deployed to the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The Lynx operates from Karup. Maritime vessels are spread out through the entire coastline and on islands. The S-61s and EH-101s have a crew of six: two pilots, a navigator, a flight engineer, a physician and a rescue swimmer.

===Estonia===

The Estonian Border Guard (Piirivalve) is the Estonian security authority responsible for the border security. It is the main support organisation for search and rescue missions in Estonia, and operates a small fleet of SAR vessels and helicopters.

===Finland===
In Finland local rescue services (i.e. fire departments) are responsible for land and inland water SAR, the Border Guard is responsible for maritime areas. These organisations alert and decide on the most suitable response for the location and situation. The country also has several volunteer organisations such as the volunteer fire department (VPK), the Finnish Lifeboat Institution (SMPS) and the Red Cross Finland (SPR).

===France===

The Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM) provides sea rescue on the French coast and at seas. In 2016, they helped 7,500 people in 5,200 rescues. The service has 41 all-weather rescue boats, 34 first-class rescue boats and 76 second-class lifeboats.
In France, Search and rescue operations are led by different entities according to the rescue area. For sea rescue, the French navy use airborne unit (e.g. Flottille 33F in Brittany) and specialized boats (e.g. &quot;L&#x27;abeille Bourbon&quot;). In Mountains, French gendarmerie is equipped with EC-145 &#x27;chouka&#x27;. In the other areas, French civil protection agency &quot;Securité Civile&quot; works with paramedics, fire unit and hospital mobile unit using EC-145 &#x27;Dragon&#x27;.

===Germany===

Search and Rescue in German waters is conducted by the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service with air support by the German Navy, the Federal Police and the German Army Aviation. All incoming requests are coordinated by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Bremen. The DGzRS is a non-governmental organisation entirely supported by donations.

Besides the offshore Search And Rescue services, the German Army Aviation provides 3 SAR Command Posts on a 24/7 basis at Holzdorf Air Base with the Airbus H145 LUH SAR (Light Utility Helikopter Search and Rescue) and at Nörvenich Air Base and 2 at Niederstetten Army Airfield. 
Further, the Technisches Hilfswerk is a key component of the German disaster relief framework. It is, among other things, regularly involved in urban search and rescue efforts abroad.

===Hong Kong===

SAR operations are conducted by the Government Flying Service (GFS) and before 1993 by the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force. The GFS conducts maritime SAR within the radius of the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (FIR).

As of 2020, the GFS fleet consists of nine aircraft including:
* 2 Bombardier Challenger 605 - for aerial SAR surveillance
* 7 Airbus Helicopters H175 - for inshore and offshore SAR

Other civilian search and rescue units in Hong Kong include:

* Civil Aid Service - works in conjunction with the Hong Kong Fire Services Dept and the air support from the Government Flying Service, also provides mountain rescue service
* Hong Kong Fire Services/Hong Kong Marine Police - various vessels and rescue divers - with air support from the GFS
* Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre is responsible for coordinating other civil agencies in regards to marine SAR operations in waters around Hong Kong
* Countryside Volunteer Search Team

===Iceland===
The Icelandic Coast Guard is responsible for coordinating all maritime and aviation search and rescue activities in the Icelandic Search and Rescue Region (SRR), that has the sise of 1.9 million square kilometres. The Icelandic Coast Guard operates JRCC ICELAND in combination with the Coast Guard&#x27;s operation centre, the maritime traffic service and the coastal radio stations. If aircraft crash site is located on land the control of the rescue operations is diverted to the Icelandic Police, which is responsible for SAR operations on land. The Icelandic Coast Guard (JRCC ICELAND) is the Cospas-Sarsat SAR Point of Contact. ISAVIA, which operates the Air Traffic Control in Iceland, is responsible for the aviation alerting services. The Icelandic Coast Guard operates maritime patrol aircraft, SAR helicopters and patrol vessels.

The Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue (Slysavarnafélagið Landsbjörg) (ICESAR) is a volunteer organisation with about 100 rescue teams located all around the island. ICESAR is a great support to SAR operations both on land and sea. All the rescue teams contain groups of specially trained individuals.

A specialised INSARAG External Classification certified rubble rescue squad operates under the Icelandic Association of Search and Rescue. It was the first rescue squad to arrive in Haiti following the earthquake of 2010.

===Indonesia===
The National Search and Rescue Agency of Indonesia known in Indonesian as &quot;Badan Nasional Pencarian dan Pertolongan&quot; abbreviated &quot;BASARNAS&quot;, is a government agency responsible for conducting search and rescue duties nationally in Indonesia. BASARNAS may also be assisted in conducting SAR in Indonesia by the TNI, Mobile Brigade Corps, and local Fire brigade units.

===Ireland===

Maritime SAR services are provided by two civilian bodies - the Irish Coast Guard and the RNLI. The Coast Guard has responsibility for the Irish Search and Rescue Region. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has 43 lifeboat stations including inland stations at Enniskillen and Lough Derg, the coastguard inshore rescue boats, and community rescue boats at fifteen stations: Ballinskelligs, County Kerry; Ballybunion, County Kerry; Ballyheigue, County Kerry; Banna, County Kerry; Bantry, County Cork; Bunmahon, County Waterford; Cahore, County Wexford; Carna, County Galway; Corrib/Mask Lakes, County Galway; Derrynane, County Kerry; Limerick City (River Shannon); Mallow Search and Rescue, County Cork; Schull, County Cork; Tramore, County Waterford; Waterford City River Rescue; Waterford Marine Search and Rescue. There are some 25 other independent rescue services.

Mountain Rescue in Ireland is provided by 12 voluntary teams based in different regions of the country.

The IRCG operate a number of contracted Sikorsky Search and Rescue helicopters from bases in Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo under the €500 million contract, from 2010, a previous fleet of Sikorsky S-61N helicopters were replaced with five newer Sikorsky S-92 helicopters. One of the new S-92 helicopters is located at each of the four IRCG bases, with one spare replacement aircraft being rotated between bases.

The Irish Coast Guard are launching a tender for a future SAR Aviation Contract, which is one of several tenders for similar services.

The Irish Air Corps provide top cover for search and rescue over land or sea and is available for maritime and mountain rescue if needed. The Irish Naval Service frequently assists the other agencies in search and rescue. Its patrol ships at sea and the communications centre at Haulbowline maintain a 24-hour watch on all distress frequencies.

Civil Defence Ireland also operates a range of land and inland water search and rescue services.

===Israel===
SAR in Israel is the responsibility of the IDF Home Front Command &quot;Search and Rescue&quot; (SAR). The unit was established at its current strength in 1984, combining all the specialist units that were involved with SAR until that time.

The SAR unit is a rapid mobilisation force and has an airborne transport and deployment capability for its personnel and equipment. The unit is composed of reserve personnel, with a regular cadre based at the Bahad 16 Unit training facility. With a focus on urban SAR, the unit operates specialised equipment, including a locally developed device for locating persons trapped under rubble by detecting seismic and acoustic emissions given off by the victims. The SAR unit also uses Search and rescue dogs specially trained to locate people buried under debris.

===Italy===
Italian SAR operations are carried out by the Guardia Costiera, backed up by naval aviation and the air force, including Aeronautica Militare Comando 15° Stormo (15th Wing), the Italian Red Cross, and other organisations.

===Jordan===
Jordan&#x27;s Civil Defense Urban Search and Rescue team (USAR) has achieved the UN classification as a heavy USAR team. The team&#x27;s role mainly earthquake rescue.

===Kenya===
The Kenya Maritime Authority and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority are responsible for Aeronautical SAR within Kenya&#x27;s waterways and aerospace respectively.

===Macau===
Macau&#x27;s maritime SAR is conducted by two units:

The Macau Marine Department and responsible for maritime SAR within Macau&#x27;s waterways. The Macau Search and Rescue Coordination Centre is under the Vessel Traffic Control Centre of Macao of the Maritime Administration of Macau.

=== Malaysia ===

For land rescue, Malaysia has two primary SAR units: the Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART), which reports to the National Security Council, and the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department&#x27;s (FRDM) Special Tactical Operation and Rescue Team of Malaysia (STORM) unit. They are sometimes aided by the jungle experts, the aboriginal police unit named Senoi Praaq, Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) VAT 69 Commando, the Malaysian Armed Forces&#x27; special operations force, and the Malaysian Civil Defence Force. Both SMART and STORM, as with other FRDM&#x27;s special operations, often participate in international SAR missions.

For maritime SAR, it is the responsibility of Malaysia Coast Guard and FRDM, along with support from the RMP&#x27;s Marine Operations Force and the Royal Malaysian Air Force&#x27;s PASKAU.

===Malta===
The responsibility for SAR at sea in the Malta Search and Rescue Region falls under the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM). It is carried out by maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters and vessels under the co-ordination, command and control of the Rescue Co-ordination Centre.

The AFM, in close collaboration with the US Coast Guard, also runs a Search and Rescue Training Centre for International Students in Maritime SAR Mission Co-ordination and Planning. To date more than 30 foreign students from 15 countries including Albania, Cameroon, Croatia, Equatorial Guinea and Kenya have attended these courses.

Malta is also in talks with Libya about enhancing SAR cooperation between the two countries.

===Netherlands===
SAR responsibility in the Netherlands is held by the Netherlands Coastguard, carried out by vessels and aircraft from various organisations among which mostly the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution, the Dutch Lifeguard Association, the Ministry of Transport and Water Management and the Ministry of Defence (Netherlands).

===New Zealand===
New Zealand&#x27;s Search and Rescue Region extends from the South Pole to the southern border of the Honolulu region, including Norfolk, Tonga, Samoa, and Cook Islands.

Smaller searches are controlled by the local police, who call on LandSAR for land-based operations, such as for lost hikers known as tramping in New Zealand, and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard for coastal maritime incidents. Larger maritime search and rescue events, as well as reports of overdue aircraft, fall under the control of the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), based in Avalon, which coordinates response from local coastguard, helicopter operators, merchant marine, air force and naval resources.

Urban Search and Rescue falls primarily within the domain of the Fire and Emergency New Zealand, particularly the three USAR Taskforce groups based in Palmerston North, Christchurch, and Auckland. These teams draw together numerous specialists and organisations to achieve an integrated multi-agency response.

Among those organisations that act in a support capacity for FENZ are Response Teams (NZRTs). These are regional rescue groups of professional volunteers that train to a minimum industry standard of USAR Category 1R (USAR Responder), which is also standard for FENZ firefighters. Response Teams are registered with the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM), and assist their local MCDEM Groups and communities in emergencies to supplement full-time emergency services. Their additional capabilities, which vary among different teams, include: high angle rope rescue, storm response, swift water response, medics, welfare, and rural fire support. Many Response Teams were deployed to assist in the rescue and recovery effort of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

Other resources:
*Westpac Rescue Helicopter (New Zealand) - charitable organisation
*New Zealand Land SAR Search Dogs - the official NZ search dogs group providing land search &amp; rescue services under NZ Land SAR, wilderness and avalanche rescue dogs.

===Norway===
On a national level and on sea, two agencies maintain the responsibility of leading search and rescue missions: the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway.

In case of local search and rescue missions, particularly on land and usually missing person cases, each of Norway&#x27;s police districts are responsible of leading search and rescue missions on behalf of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centres. The police can call in both civilian, military and voluntary units with various and specialized competencies for carrying out the search and rescue mission, such as:

Professionals:

* Norwegian Civil Defence
* Norwegian Home Guard
* No. 330 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force
* Police Helicopter Service
* Norwegian Air Ambulance Service
* Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (professional crew)
Volunteers:

* Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps
* Norwegian People&#x27;s Aid
* Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (voluntary crew)
* Norwegian Radio Relay League
* Norwegian Speleological Society
* Norwegian Scouts&#x27; Emergency Response Teams
* Norwegian Search and Rescue Dogs
* Norwegian Air Sports Federation&#x27;s Air Service

Although the voluntary organizations are represented on a national level, the organizations are usually independent on local levels. They&#x27;re governed like confederacies or chain stores – e.g. Sandefjord Red Cross is an independent organization, but is still a subject to the regional Vestfold Red Cross and thereafter the national Norwegian Red Cross.

Depending on each local organization&#x27;s needs and budgets, the voluntary organizations may have specialized equipment for carrying out missions effectively, such as boats, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, ambulances, and quadcopters with thermal cameras. Depending on geography and other local circumstances, the local voluntary organizations tend to course their volunteers in fields that are relevant to the local and surrounding areas. Some local voluntary organizations have blue emergency lights and sirens on their vehicles, though orange and white lights without sirens are more common. All organizations, either professional or voluntary, have access to the Public Safety Network.

The No. 330 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force is the only dedicated search and rescue unit operated by the Norwegian government. The squadron operates a total of 16 AgustaWestland AW101, named SAR Queen. Until 2023, the RNoAF used 16 Westland Sea Kings. There have been issues with the phasing in of SAR Queen, due to landing sites across the country not being sized for the increased downwash.

===Philippines===
The agencies responsible for Search and Rescue activities in the Philippines are:

* Office of Civil Defense
* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council
* Philippine Air Force
* Philippine Army
* Philippine Coast Guard
* Bureau of Fire Protection

=== Portugal ===
Three different agencies are responsible for providing search and rescue in Portugal. The Portuguese Navy is responsible for all sea rescues, the Portuguese Air Force for all the rescues originating within the airspace, including aircraft crashes and the Autoridade Nacional de Protecção Civil (ANPC) for all inland rescues. All of the above coordinate closely with each other providing a comprehensive search and rescue service.

The Portuguese area of responsibility comprises the Lisbon and Santa Maria Flight Information Regions (FIR).

===Poland===

In Poland most search and rescue operations are undertaken by the airborne units of the Polish Armed Forces. The Navy currently has the largest SAR fleet of helicopters and also operates a number of small vessels for the purpose of rescuing crewmen of stricken ships. There is also, however a semi-governmental organisation known as the &#x27;Morska Służba Poszukiwania i Ratownictwa&#x27; (&quot;Maritime Search and Rescue Service&quot;) which provides the vast majority of seaborne services to vessels in distress; the service is currently (as of 2010) in the process of overhauling and replacing a large portion of its fleet of lifeboats.

Other civilian search and rescue units in Poland include:

* Górskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, GOPR (Mountain Volunteer Search and Rescue)
* Tatrzańskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, TOPR (Tatra Mountains Volunteer Search and Rescue)
* Wodne Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, WOPR (Water Volunteer Search and Rescue) - operating on inland and coastal waters

=== South Africa ===
Search and Rescue services are offered by various government departments, non governmental organisations, commercial/private organisations and voluntary organisations in South Africa. There is no single organisation responsible for urban, wilderness, swift water, aviation or maritime/sea rescue.

Aviation and maritime incidents are the responsibility of the South African Search and Rescue Organisation (SASAR). SASAR is a voluntary organisation that functions under the auspices of the Department of Transport. Its main role is to search for, assist and carry out rescue operations for the survivors of aircraft or vessel accidents. Depending on the nature of the accident, the RCCs (Aeronatautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) or Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC)) coordinate the search and rescue missions. These operations are carried out by other government departments, non governmental organisations, commercial/private organisations and voluntary organisations.

===Spain===

Search and rescue duties in Spain are the responsibility of the national government, in conjunction with regional and municipal governments. The Sociedad de Salvamento y Seguridad Marítima is the main organisation, and has overall responsibility for the maritime search and rescue, that also coordinates the SAR efforts with other agencies:

* Spanish Navy
* Spanish Air and Space Force
* Servicio de Vigilancia Aduanera
* Servicio Marítimo de la Guardia Civil

=== Sweden ===

The Swedish Maritime Administration is responsible for maritime SAR in Swedish waters, and operate seven AgustaWestland AW139 SAR helicopters from five bases along the coast of Sweden. Together with the Swedish Sea Rescue Society and the Swedish Coast Guard they are carrying out Sar in Swedish waters. The Coast guard has 31 larger Ships and 3 De Havilland Canada Dash 8 aeroplanes for SAR. The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is an organisation aiming at saving lives and recovering property at sea. The society operates 68 search and rescue stations and some 185 ships crewed by 2100 volunteers, of those more than 300 are on call at any time, and can respond within 15 minutes. In 2011, the volunteers turned out to an emergency 3274 times. The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is involved 70% of the number SAR missions in Swedish waters.

===Switzerland===

REGA (Schweizerische REttungsflugwacht / Garde Aérienne / Guardia Aerea) is the air rescue service which provides emergency medical assistance in Switzerland, notably in mountains but also in cases of life-threatening emergencies elsewhere. They will also return a citizen to Switzerland from a foreign country if they are in need of urgent medical care. Rega was established on 27 April 1952 by Dr. Rudolf Bucher, who thought that the Swiss rescue organisation needed a specialised air sub-section.

===Taiwan===
National Airborne Service Corps (NASC; ) is the agency of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of China responsible for executing and providing support for search and rescue, disaster relief, emergency medical service, transportation, monitoring, reconnaissance and patrol in Taiwan.

Coast Guard Administration (CGA; ) is charged with maintaining coastal waters and the pelagic zone patrols, smuggling and stowaway crackdowns, maritime rescues, natural resource conservation, and public services. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces.

=== Turkey ===

Search and Rescue operators in Turkey are primarily:

Civil governmental and non-governmental organisations

* Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency; also known as AFAD
* AKUT Search and Rescue Association
*National Medical Rescue Team (UMKE)
* GEA Search and Rescue Association is a group of search and rescue, ecology and social campaigners, founded in 1994, made up of volunteer members.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine search and rescue is conducted by the &quot;State Search and Rescue Aviation Service&quot; of the Ministry of Emergencies of Ukraine Ukraviaposhuk.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, land-based searches for a missing person are usually coordinated by the local police. There is a network of local volunteer agencies that can be called out to assist these searches, which are part of the Association of Lowland Search And Rescue. Other voluntary agencies exist to provide specialist search and rescue services, such as the Cave Rescue Organisation and Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland. These organisations are usually called out indirectly by the police. For example, the British Cave Rescue Council advises that if someone goes missing in a cave, callers should contact the local police who will then summon cave rescue. Urban search and rescue units are run by the fire services.

His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard are in charge of maritime search and rescue missions. The Coastguard is one of the four emergency services that can be contacted on 999. Their role is to initiate and coordinate the searches. Lifeboats are provided by volunteer agencies, most often by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Aircraft for an air-sea rescue were originally provided by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Under the programme UK-SAR, they are now operated under contract by Bristow Helicopters. The Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency are launching a tender for their second generation UK search and rescue aviation programme (UKSAR2G), which is one of several tenders for similar services.

Examples of local resources include:
*Berkshire Lowland Search and Rescue
*Cardiff and Vale Rescue Association
*Cave Rescue Organisation
*Emergency Response Team Search and Rescue
*Mercia Inshore Search and Rescue
*Scarborough and Ryedale Mountain Rescue Team
*Surrey Search and Rescue
*Severn Area Rescue Association
*Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association
*West Mercia Search and Rescue

=== United States ===

In the United States there are many organisations with SAR responsibilities at the national, state and local level. Most day-to-day SAR missions in the US are run by the County Sheriffs, except in states like Alaska, where the State Highway Patrol oversees SAR, or in other areas where SAR services are part of fire/rescue, EMS, or a wholly separate, non-profit organization. They in turn, can request help from other departments, as well as state and national resources if they think they need them. A typical Sheriff&#x27;s Office has a volunteer SAR team that matches the terrain and population of that county. SAR members are typically trained in the Incident Command System (ICS), first aid, and the outdoor skills needed in that terrain and climate. Most of this article is about the federal response to assist large complicated SAR missions.

In January 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the National Response Framework which serves as the guiding document for a federal response during a national emergency. Search and Rescue is divided into four primary elements, while assigning a federal agency with the lead role for each of the four elements.
* Structural Collapse-USAR: Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency
* Waterborne: United States Coast Guard, United States Coast Guard Auxiliary
* Inland-wilderness: United States Department of Interior, National Park Service
* Aeronautical: United States Air Force via the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and USAF rescue wings, groups and squadrons in the Air Combat Command, Pacific Air Forces (for Alaska and Hawaii), Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard; the Civil Air Patrol in its role as the USAF Auxiliary; and the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps, both Active and Reserve (secondary missions for land-based USN maritime patrol and reconnaissance squadrons and land-based and sea-based USN/USMC helicopter squadrons)

SAR standards adopted by agencies having jurisdiction are developed primarily by non-governmental organisations, including ASTM International and National Fire Protection Association. These standards are adopted also by training and certification organisations such as Mountain Rescue Association and National Association for Search and Rescue to develop training that will meet or exceed those standards. Within ASTM International, standards specific to SAR are developed by Technical Committee F32 on Search and Rescue. Formed in 1988, the committee had 85 current members and jurisdiction of 38 approved standards.

==Legitimacy of Search and Rescue==

The legitimacy of sea rescue refers to the ethical, legal, and moral justification for acceptance of the act of rescuing individuals or groups of people who are in distress at sea. Sea rescue operations are conducted to save lives, prevent accidents, and offer assistance to those in peril on the water.

Legitimacy in this context encompasses various aspects:

1. Legal Legitimacy: This refers to compliance with international, regional, and national laws and regulations governing maritime safety, search and rescue operations, and the treatment of individuals in distress. These legal frameworks establish a clear foundation for the authority and duty to conduct sea rescue operations.

2. Ethical Legitimacy: Ethical legitimacy pertains to the moral principles and values associated with rescuing people in distress at sea. The duty to save lives, the principle of non-refoulement (not returning individuals to places where they might face persecution), and the broader humanitarian imperative underpin ethical legitimacy.

3. Moral Legitimacy: Moral legitimacy extends beyond legal and ethical considerations and involves public perception and societal acceptance. It is related to how society views and supports rescue efforts. The moral legitimacy of sea rescue operations is often influenced by the belief that saving human lives is a fundamental moral duty.

4. Operational Legitimacy: This aspect concerns the practical and operational effectiveness of sea rescue operations. Ensuring that rescues are conducted efficiently, safely, and with the appropriate resources and expertise contributes to their operational legitimacy.

5. Stakeholder Acceptance: The legitimacy of sea rescue operations also depends on the acceptance and cooperation of various stakeholders, including coastal states, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), international organisations, and local communities. The involvement and support of these actors can enhance the overall legitimacy of rescue efforts.

In the context of the Mediterranean migration crisis, discussions about the legitimacy of sea rescue operations often revolve around these dimensions. Challenges and controversies related to legal ambiguities, accusations against NGOs, pushback practices by some states, and public opinion can all affect the perceived legitimacy of these operations. Balancing legal obligations, ethical imperatives, and the practical challenges of sea rescue remains a complex and ongoing issue, but many argue that the fundamental duty to save lives at sea should be the guiding principle that legitimizes these operations.

The Mediterranean Sea has, for many years, been a major route for migration, hosting numerous asylum seekers, refugees, and economic migrants seeking a better life in Europe. This region is known for its perilous journey, often undertaken in overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels, leading to frequent humanitarian crises at sea. As a result, the question of the legal legitimacy of sea rescue operations in the Mediterranean has emerged as a central concern.

==2. International Law of the Sea==

International law establishes a clear foundation for the legitimacy of sea rescue operations in the Mediterranean.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and international conventions like the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) obligate states to render assistance to those in distress at sea. These conventions provide a solid legal basis for sea rescue operations, emphasizing the duty to save lives.

==2.1 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)==

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a legal framework for various maritime activities, including sea rescue operations. This framework can be introduced as a two-step process. First, states are sorted into groups depending on activity and typical interest in the sea, principally coastal states and flag states. Second, the sea is divided into different zones (the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf, and the high seas) where different categories of states have different authority.

UNCLOS does establish the legal basis for conducting such operations by outlining key principles and obligations related to maritime safety and search and rescue at sea. These principles contribute to the legitimacy of sea rescue efforts:

1. Duty to Render Assistance: UNCLOS, under its article 98, places an obligation on all vessels and aircraft to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost and to inform the appropriate authorities. This duty underscores the moral and legal imperative to provide assistance to those in distress at sea.

2. Non-refoulment principle: While UNCLOS doesn&#x27;t explicitly mention the principle of non-refoulement, it is a fundamental aspect of international refugee law and human rights law, which plays a significant role in the legitimacy of sea rescue. Non-refoulement prohibits returning individuals to places where their lives or freedoms might be threatened.

3. SAR Regions and Coordination: UNCLOS encourages the establishment of search and rescue (SAR) regions and coordination centres. These provisions promote efficient and effective responses to maritime distress situations, enhancing the legitimacy of rescue efforts.

==2.1.1 Duty to Render Assistance==

The duty to render assistance at sea is set out by Article 98 of the UNCLOS, as follows:

‘&quot;1. Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers:&quot;
&quot;(a) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost;&quot;
&quot;(b) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him; (…)&quot;’

It imposes a general duty on state parties to require their vessels “&quot;to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost”&quot; and “&quot;to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected”&quot;. Where ships collide, each ship’s master is to be obliged “to render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, where possible, to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship, its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call”. No immigration or other exceptions apply.

UNCLOS also at Article 98(2) imposes a duty on state parties to “promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and over the sea and, where circumstances so require, by way of mutual regional arrangements cooperate with neighbouring States for this purpose&quot;.

On the face of it, UNCLOS Article 98 obliges state parties, including the United Kingdom, to rescue refugees in distress at sea and also to operate a search and rescue system. There is an argument that Article 98 falls within the part of UNCLOS addressed only to the high seas and therefore the obligation does not apply within territorial waters or the contiguous zone (see Article 86). The words of Article 98 itself do not support this approach.
Article 18 seems to imply a duty of rescue in territorial waters and the contiguous zone; and, in any event, other conventions apply similar obligations without any similar restriction.

==2.1.2 Non-refoulement Principle==
The principle of non-refoulement refers to the obligation on states not to send individuals to territories in which they may be persecuted, or in which they are at risk of torture or other serious harm. It may not immediately correlate with the right of every one to seek asylum, but it does clearly place limits on what states may lawfully do.

This rule is solidly grounded in international human rights and refugee law, in treaty, in doctrine, and in customary international law. It is an inherent aspect of the absolute prohibition of torture, even sharing perhaps in some of the latter&#x27;s jus cogens character. It applies independently of any formal recognition of refugee status or entitlement to other forms of protection, and it applies to the actions of states, wherever undertaken, whether at the land border, or in maritime zones, including the high seas.

Its essential characteristics are acts attributable to the state or other international actor, which have the foreseeable effect of exposing the individual to a serious risk of irreversible harm, contrary to international law.
UNHCR&#x27;s Executive Committee, indeed, has particularly emphasized the importance of fully respecting the principle of non-refoulement in the context of maritime operations:

&quot;‘… interception measures should not result in asylum-seekers and refugees being denied access to international protection, or in those in need of international protection being returned, directly or indirectly, to the frontiers of territories where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of a Convention ground, or where the person has other grounds for protection based on international law.’&quot;

==2.2 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR)==

UNCLOS has been described as a “quasi-constitution for the oceans”. Three (or maybe four) further conventions set out the details of search and rescue obligations.
The first of these is the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), which was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 1979 and came into force in 1985. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue aims to enhance the effectiveness of search and rescue operations at sea by establishing a framework for coordination, cooperation, and the provision of assistance to persons in distress. It aims to create an international system for coordinating rescue operations that guarantees their efficiency and safety. States parties are thus invited to conclude SAR agreements with neighbouring states to regulate and coordinate SAR operations and services in the agreed maritime zone. Such agreements technically and operationally implement the obligation set out in Article 98 (2) of the UNCLOS, which provides that, where needed, neighbouring states shall cooperate through regional agreements to promote and maintain adequate and effective SAR services.

Following an amendment taking effect in 2004 for all parties except Malta, which formally objected, the obligation to provide assistance to a person at distress at sea expressly applies “regardless of the nationality or status of such a person or the circumstances in which that person is found” (para 2.1.10). Once a person has been rescued, they must be delivered to a “place of safety” (para 1.3.2 and 3.1.9). In particular, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted two resolutions that amended SAR Convention (and SOLAS Convention), and which entered into force 1 July 2006. Consequently, Article 3 (1) (9) of the SAR Convention now provides:

‘Parties shall co-ordinate and co-operate to ensure that masters of ships providing assistance by embarking persons in distress at sea are released from their obligations with minimum further deviation from the ships’ intended voyage (…). The Party responsible for the search and rescue region in which such assistance is rendered shall exercise primary responsibilityfor ensuring such co-ordination and co-operation occurs, so that survivors assisted are disembarked from the assisting ship and delivered to a place of safety (…). In these cases, the relevant Parties shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effective as soon as reasonably practicable’.

According to the MSC Guidelines, a ‘place of safety’ means a location where the rescue operations can be considered as completed. In accordance with Principle 6.14 of the Guidelines, the rescue unit can be the place of safety, but only provisionally. In fact, the text insists on the role that the flag state and the coastal state should play in substituting for the master of the rescuing vessel (Principle 6.13).
Moreover, pursuant to the same guidelines, the state in whose SAR zone the operation took place has the duty to provide or, at least, to secure a place of safety for the rescued persons (Principle 2.5). This Principle simply requires that the coastal state carries out the SAR operations and brings them effectively to an end, i.e., not leaving the rescued persons (whatever their status) at sea. Considering that the MSC Guidelines are not binding, Principle 2.5 suggests that the coastal state has a ‘residual obligation’ to allow disembarkation on its own territory when it has not been possible to do so safely anywhere else.[16] This has been clarified by the IMO Facilitation Committee (FAL), which adopted the ‘Principles relating to administrative procedures for disembarking persons rescued at sea’.

Another issue concerns the identification of the beneficiary of the obligation: is the duty to render assistance a purely inter-state obligation or does it entail a right to be rescued for people in distress at sea? The law of the sea is a field of international law where individuals or more generally private actors have little involvement. The main aim of the law of the sea consists of allocating obligations and rights in different maritime zones to states. However, the multiplication of activities at sea and the increased human presence led to the question of the protection of the human element, in particular of the application of human rights at sea. Many scholars have already discussed the application of the relevant human rights treaties at sea, pointing out that the law of the sea, specifically the LOSC, pursues some community interests, among which the protection of human rights. Building on this scholarship, the duty to render assistance can be considered to be the operational obligation deriving from the application of the human right to life at sea.

==2.3 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)==

The second one is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (SOLAS), which is primarily concerned with the seaworthiness of ships. This convention is also widely ratified, including by the United Kingdom. It is a very substantial and detailed document, the first version of which was adopted in 1914 in response to the sinking of the Titanic. 
SOLAS imposes a duty on the master of a ship at sea, on receiving information from any source that persons are in distress at sea, “to proceed with all speed to their assistance” (Chapter V, regulation 33-1 as amended). While the wording appears directed to the master in person, the obligation is probably better read as being on the state party to ensure that a master of a ship acts in the required way. 
The convention also imposes on state parties an obligation “to ensure that necessary arrangements are made for distress communication and co-ordination in their area of responsibility and for the rescue of persons in distress at sea around its coasts” (Chapter V, regulation 7). These duties apply to “all ships on all voyages” other than ships of war and ships in the Great Lakes and tributaries (Chapter V, regulation 1).
Mirroring the 2004 adjustments to SAR, SOLAS was also amended explicitly to state that the duty to provide assistance “applies regardless of the nationality or status of such persons or the circumstances in which they are found”. It further provides that a rescued person should be treated “with humanity” while on board a rescue ship and then delivered to a place of safety.

==2.4 Salvage conventions==

Finally, there are two international conventions on salvage, both of which impose a requirement to render assistance at sea. The reason the salvage conventions impose this obligation is to ensure that priority is given to saving lives rather than property in a salvage situation.

The first is the Brussel Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules with Respect to Assistance and Salvage at Sea of 1910, or simply the Brussels Convention. Article 11 provides that:
&quot;‘Every master is bound, so far as he can do so without serious danger to his vessel, her crew and her passengers, to render assistance to everybody, even though an enemy, found at sea in danger of being lost.&quot;

The second is the International Convention on Salvage of 1989 (the Salvage Convention). Article 10 requires every ship’s master, &quot;“so far as he can do so without serious danger to his vessel and persons thereon, to render assistance to any person in danger of being lost at sea”&quot; and imposes a duty on state parties to adopt the measures necessary to enforce that duty.

==3. European Union Law==
The European Union (EU) has played a significant role in shaping the legal framework for sea rescue in the Mediterranean. 
First of all, it has established the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) to coordinate and support member states in border and maritime security.

==3.1 Frontex==
Frontex is the European Union agency responsible for “European integrated border management” (EU, 2016). Its mission is to “ensure safe and well-functioning external borders providing security” (Frontex, 2019).

Frontex was founded by a Council Regulation in 2004 as the “European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders” and became operational a year later. The founding regulation was amended several times, until it was replaced by a new Regulation in 2016, establishing a “European Border and Coast Guard” (European Commission, 2004; EU, 2016). These repeated legal revisions are mirrored by a rapid organisational growth of the agency. Frontex, currently, has a budget of over 300 million euros and will dispose of 11.3 billion euros in 2021–2027, with which it aims to finance a 10,000 standing corps of operational staff and acquire its own ships, vehicles and planes (European Commission, 2018).Frontex plays a central role in managing and regulating sea rescue operations within the EU. EU law, particularly regulations related to Frontex, outlines the responsibilities, actions, and legal parameters for Frontex-coordinated rescue operations.

Ten studies (14 per cent) shed light on the nature and implementation of Frontex’ activities. The Frontex Regulation has been repeatedly revised to expand the agency’s mandate. In fact, Article 8 of the EU Regulation establishing the European Border and Coast Guard identified no less than 21 tasks that Frontex is mandated to carry out. Beyond merely listing these responsibilities, these studies describe how such official tasks are translated into practice.
Frontex can be viewed as the EU’s attempt to implement “integrated border management” (IBM), which aims to introduce non-arrival measures and curb illegal migration. This requires cooperation of Frontex with various partners, such as Member States, third countries and relevant other agencies (e.g. Europol) (Demmelhuber, 2011). Frontex is primarily preoccupied with joint operations to reinforce border control, many of which focus on the Mediterranean (Üstübici and Içduygu, 2018). To this end, Frontex coordinates the deployment of border officials, who participate in border patrol, thereby contributing to the arrest of suspected facilitators and setting in motion a continuous decline in the number of migrants crossing (Tryfon, 2012). An analysis of hot spot “Moria” on Lesbos, Greece, demonstrates that Frontex personnel not only monitors the border but also engages in migrant identification and registration. As migrants arrive in the camp, they access a “registration street”, in which Frontex screeners identify the nationality of migrants, while advanced-level document officers check the veracity of their identification papers. Fingerprinters take fingerprints and enter these into databases, after which Frontex’ partners begin the asylum process and provide humanitarian aid.

To facilitate the effective and efficient deployment of personnel and capabilities, Frontex also gathers intelligence and produces its own risk analyses, which address the (expected) situation at the EU external borders. As its intelligence role is growing, the agency collects data from cross-border movements inside the EU and from entrance information that Member States and the various organisational partners provide (Den Boer, 2015; Takle, 2017). Some of this information is also retrieved from third countries, with which Frontex has concluded working arrangements. This is beneficial for Frontex as it ensures continuous data exchange on relevant migration trends and the sharing of best practices (Coman-Kund, 2018). In turn, representatives of these third countries have been participant observers in Frontex operations (Sagrera, 2014). To what extent these agreements are binding remains subject to debate (cf. Sagrera, 2014; Coman-Kund, 2018).
Finally, Frontex also mediates between the Member States to coordinate joint returns when multiple Member States have nationals of the same country to be sent back. The agency makes sure that returnees are gathered in one Member State from where a collective return flight departs. A Frontex staff member monitors compliance with its Code of Conduct when it organises the return flight (Pirjola, 2015).
It is striking how rapid Frontex’ responsibilities have expanded. Frontex’ tasks, first of all, horizontally expanded with its mandate to set up rapid response teams that can be deployed on short notice. Frontex’ tasks have also deepened as existing responsibilities were elaborated. For instance, Frontex received the authority to organise return flights. At this moment, Frontex could even contribute to the reintroduction of border controls when a Member State does not comply with the recommendations that follow its vulnerability assessments (Scipioni, 2017).
Current studies on Frontex display strong links to the field of critical theory, migration law research and literature on EU public administration. This has provided many insightful publications. Yet, there are very few connections with organisation and management literature, crisis studies and policing scholarship, even though these disciplines may improve our understanding of Frontex’ agency characteristics, how it operates during joint operations and how Frontex negotiates tensions between providing care and exercising control. Likewise, EU studies can shed light on the relations between EU agencies and other European actors and what this means for their relative autonomy (e.g. Egeberg and Trondal, 2011). Next, while there are some links between the five themes, these connections can be reinforced in the interest of theory-building. For instance, there is a suggestion that Frontex’ autonomy (in line with neo-institutionalist explanations) reduces its accountability (Carrera et al., 2013). Likewise, Frontex’ limited accountability and transparency may help to explain its continuing struggles with human rights. In general, as Frontex continues to expand, new theory-building is needed to further assess and understand the agency and its impact.

==3.2 Common European Asylum System==
The European Union has established a Common European Asylum System (CEAS).

It is a legal and policy framework developed to guarantee harmonised and uniform standards for people seeking international protection in the EU. It is based on an understanding that the EU, an area of open borders and freedom of movement where countries share the same fundamental values, needs to have a common approach to implement transparent, effective and equitable procedures.

CEAS emphasizes a shared responsibility to process applicants for international protection in a dignified manner, ensuring fair treatment and similar procedures in examining cases, irrelevant of the country where the application is lodged. At its core, CEAS aims to achieve: a clear functional process to determine which country is responsible for examining an application for protection; a set of common standards to inform fair and efficient asylum procedures; a set of common minimum conditions for the dignified reception of applicants for protection and convergence on the criteria for granting protection associated with those statuses.

Within the context of CEAS, the Tampere Declaration set out the foundation for a comprehensive approach to migration by addressing political, human rights and developmental issues in countries and regions of origin and transit.68 Through this agreement with governments, legislative and policy measures were adopted at the EU level to set a framework to manage high influxes of displaced persons by accommodating persons in need of protection while supporting Member States experiencing pressure on their asylum systems.
After the first phase (from 1999 to 2005), Member States reflected on the functioning of CEAS and implemented improvements to the five legislations that govern the minimum standards of the European asylum system.
The increased – and often uneven – pressure that national asylum and reception systems in EU+ countries faced since 2015 presented both a challenge and an opportunity for EU+ countries to take bold steps toward systemic and commonly-agreed solutions for further harmonisation, on the basis of solidarity and responsibility-sharing. Above all, it underlined the importance of the very existence of CEAS and a common migration policy – to have an EU-wide framework to manage mixed migratory flows, iv including border management, international protection and the return of rejected applicants. In the EU context, mixed migratory flows are defined as &quot;complex migratory population movements, including refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants and other types of migrants as opposed to migratory population movements that consist entirely of one category of migrants&quot;.

==3.3 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union==
EU law is bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which brings together the most important personal freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens of the EU into one legally binding document.

The Charter was declared in 2000, and came into force in December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon. It includes provisions related to human dignity, non-discrimination, and asylum. The Convention is divided into 6 chapters (Dignity, Freedoms, Equality, Solidarity, Citizen’s rights, Justice) and articles. These rights and principles are instrumental in shaping the legitimacy of sea rescue operations.

==3.4 Schengen Area==
Moreover, for EU member states participating in the Schengen Area, there are legal obligations and responsibilities for border control and management, including responding to situations at sea that may require rescue operations.

The border-free Schengen Area guarantees free movement to more than 400 million EU citizens, along with non-EU nationals living in the EU or visiting the EU as tourists, exchange students or for business purposes (anyone legally present in the EU). Free movement of persons enables every EU citizen to travel, work and live in an EU country without special formalities. Schengen underpins this freedom by enabling citizens to move around the Schengen Area without being subject to border checks.
Today, the Schengen Area encompasses most EU countries, except for Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. However, Bulgaria and Romania are currently in the process of joining the Schengen Area and already applying the Schengen acquis to a large extent. On 1 January 2023 Croatia became the newest member state to join the Schengen area. Additionally, also the non-EU States Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have joined the Schengen Area.

<text>AmigaOne is a series of computers intended to run AmigaOS 4 developed by Hyperion Entertainment, as a successor to the Amiga series by Commodore International. Unlike the original Amiga computers which used Motorola 68k processors, the AmigaOne line uses PowerPC processors. Earlier models were produced by Eyetech; in September 2009, Hyperion secured an exclusive licence for the AmigaOne name and subsequently new AmigaOne computers were released by A-Eon Technology and Acube Systems.

==History==

===AmigaOne by Eyetech (2000–05)===
Originally in 2000, AmigaOne was the name of a project for new computer hardware to run the Amiga Digital Environment (DE), later plans replaced by AmigaOS 4. Initially it was managed by Eyetech and designed by the German company Escena GmbH. The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models, the AmigaOne-1200 and the AmigaOne-4000 as expansions for the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 computers. This would probably not have been actually possible. This AmigaOne project was cancelled in the design stage in 2001, mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable northbridge chip. Eyetech, who at this point had invested funds into the project, was forced instead to license the Teron CX board from Mai to form the basis of the new AmigaONE computer range. The first fruit of this partnership with Mai, AmigaOne SE, was announced with a connector for an optionally attached Amiga 1200, in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga for backwards compatibility. However, no such solution was ever introduced.

The main difference between the ATX-format AmigaOne SE and AmigaOne XE was that the SE had a soldered-on 600 MHz PowerPC 750CXe processor, whereas the XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard. While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the Apple Power Mac G4 CPU daughtercard connector, it is not electrically compatible. There were G3 and G4 options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz. The G4 module originally used a Freescale 7451 processor which was later changed to a Freescale 7455, both without level 3 cache. The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines. Consequently, the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz. In 2007 Acube offered 1.267 GHz 7457. The Micro-A1 was announced in two configurations, under the Micro-A1 I (Industrial) and Micro-A1 C (Consumer) labels. Only the C configuration was produced.

Both AmigaOneG3-XE and AmigaOneG4-XE has four 32-bit PCI-slots (3× 33 MHz, 1× 66 MHz) and one AGP-2x slot. The Micro-A1 has only one 32-bit PCI-slot and an integrated Radeon 7000 via AGP with dedicated 32 MB VRAM.

AmigaOne (SE and XE) motherboards had several hardware issues including conflicts between the onboard IDE and Ethernet controllers, problems with USB device detection and initially no support for the on-board AC97 audio. Due to the mistaken belief that the on-board AC97 audio could not be supported, the AC97 codec was removed from later builds of the motherboard. The technical issues preventing AC97 audio support were later resolved.

When the AmigaOne boards first became available, AmigaOS 4 was not ready: they were supplied with various Linux distributions. From April 2004 onwards, boards were shipped for developers with a pre-release version of OS4. The Final Update of OS4.0 was released in December 2006, for AmigaOne computers only, with the PowerUP version being released in December 2007. AmigaOS 4.1 for AmigaOne was released in September 2008.

MAI Logic Inc. went bankrupt, and consequently the supply of Eyetech AmigaOnes dried up. Eyetech Group Ltd retired from the market in 2005, selling their remaining Amiga business to Amiga Kit.

===AmigaOne by Hyperion Entertainment (2009–present)===
In September 2009, as part of the resolution of a dispute over ownership of AmigaOS Hyperion was granted (among other provisions of the Settlement Agreement with Amiga, Inc.) an exclusive licence for the AmigaOne (or Amiga One) name. This Settlement Agreement thus created a legal basis for a new generation of AmigaOne computers.

In February 2010, a new Belgian company A-Eon Technology CVBA, in co-operation with Hyperion Entertainment, officially announced a new AmigaOne model, the AmigaOne X1000, first presented at the Vintage Computer Fair at Bletchley Park in June 2010. The project was delayed but the new platform was launched in 2012 with AmigaOS 4.1.5.

In September 2011, Acube Systems introduced the AmigaOne 500 based on a Sam460ex mainboard.

In October 2011, Hyperion Entertainment announced that it was launching an AmigaOne netbook in mid-2012, but it was announced at Amiwest 2013 that the netbook project had been cancelled.

Also at Amiwest 2013, A-Eon Technology Ltd, a British computer company, announced three new AmigaOne motherboards, with the project named Cyrus. A-Eon had a list of proposed names which could be voted for and in January 2014 A-Eon Technology announced names for new models as AmigaOne X5000/20, AmigaOne X5000/40 and AmigaOne X3500. The new motherboards were aimed as replacements for the AmigaOne X1000. The AmigaOne X5000/20 was released in October 2016 and - unlike the X1000 - sold via various distributors. ArsTechnica review of the AmigaOne X5000 commended its compatibility with old Amiga applications and games, but criticised the very high price and lack of new software.

Lastly, A-Eon Technology Ltd announced at Amiwest 2013 that A-Eon had signed a 1.2 million-dollar investment contract with Ultra Varisys for the ongoing design, development and manufacture of PowerPC hardware for its AmigaOne line of desktop computers.

In January 2015, Acube Systems started selling AmigaOne 500 computers based on the Sam460cr motherboard, a cost reduced version of original Sam460ex. Features that were removed included the Silicon Motion SM502 embedded MoC and 1× SATA2 port.

In autumn 2015, A-Eon Technology Ltd announced a new motherboard with the project development name Tabor based on a P1022 1.2 GHz SoC. The motherboard design is a microATX form factor with single PCIe slot and SODIMM memory slots. The full system is to be designated as the AmigaOne A1222. The A1222 was released in early 2024.

<text>Gerd &quot;Gudrun&quot; Maria Schyman (born 9 June 1948) is a Swedish politician. She served as leader of the Swedish Left Party from 1993 until January 2003. She remained a member of the Left Party until 2004, when she left to focus entirely on her feminist political work after a tax evasion scandal. She remained an independent member of the Riksdag until 2006. She co-founded Feminist Initiative in 2005 and was its co-spokesperson from 2005 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2019. She left the party in 2022.

==Leader of the Left Party==
In 1993, Schyman was elected leader of the Left Party. Schyman&#x27;s greatest asset was her appeal to the voters, and her party more than doubled its number of MPs during her leadership. She gained popularity for her candor: for example, she was open about her struggle with alcoholism and supported an initiative to make the Riksdag an alcohol-free workplace. During her period as party president, the party adopted feminism as an ideological basis. In 2003, she was charged with and later found guilty of misleading the tax authorities by attempting to take illicit tax deductions. She was temporarily succeeded by Ulla Hoffmann.

In 2002, she made a controversial speech concerning men&#x27;s oppression of women, in which she said &quot;The discrimination and the violations appears in different shapes depending on where we find ourselves. But it&#x27;s the same norm, the same structure, the same pattern, that is repeated both in the Taliban&#x27;s Afghanistan and here in Sweden&quot;.

In October 2004, Schyman together with other MEPs of the Left Party proposed before the Riksdag, a national assessment of the cost of men&#x27;s violence towards women; furthermore they demanded that the state fund women&#x27;s shelters. The proposal attracted wide attention, with the media calling it a &quot;man tax&quot;.

==Founder of the Feminist Initiative==
Schyman left the Left Party in 2004, and in 2005 co-founded Feminist Initiative (Fi), an organization which at its first congress decided to contest the coming parliamentary elections. Jane Fonda supported her in 2006, during the party&#x27;s campaign prior to the 2006 Swedish general election. Fi received only approximately 0.7% of the vote, well below the 4% threshold required for parliamentary representation. In the 2009 European Parliament election in Sweden, the party received 2.22% of the vote.

In the summer leading up to the 2010 Swedish general election, Schyman burned 100,000 Swedish krona in a protest against unequal pay in Sweden. The stunt, staged by advertising collective Studio Total, gave Fi widespread attention; however, the party received only 0.4% of the vote in the election.

The 2014 European Parliament election in Sweden proved to be the party&#x27;s most successful election so far; it attracted 5.3% of the national vote, with Soraya Post taking one seat as an MEP. In the 2014 Swedish general election Fi received 3.1% of the vote; despite still not meeting the 4.0% threshold for getting seats, it became the most popular party outside of the Riksdag.

<doc id="172609" wikidata="Q317243" url="?curid=172609" title="Allen Dulles">
<text>Allen Welsh Dulles ( ; April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969) was an American lawyer who was the first civilian director of central intelligence (DCI), and its longest serving director. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état, the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program, the Project MKUltra mind control program, and the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. As a result of the failed invasion of Cuba, Dulles was fired by President John F. Kennedy.

Dulles was a member of the Warren Commission that investigated Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. A conspiracy theory suggesting that Dulles and the CIA were somehow involved in Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and its potential cover up in the Warren Commission have been subject to popular debate among historians, political commentators and conspiracy theorists. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that the CIA was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.

Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. His older brother, John Foster Dulles, was the Secretary of State during the Eisenhower administration and is the namesake of Dulles International Airport.

==Early life and family==
Dulles was born on April 7, 1893, in Watertown, New York, one of five children of Presbyterian minister Allen Macy Dulles, and his wife, Edith ( Foster) Dulles. Allen Macy Dulles mixed theological liberalism with stern orthopraxy.

He was five years younger than his brother, John Foster Dulles, Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of State and chairman and senior partner of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and two years older than his sister, the diplomat Eleanor Lansing Dulles. His maternal grandfather, John W. Foster, was Secretary of State under Benjamin Harrison, while his uncle by marriage, Robert Lansing was Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson. Growing up in a parsonage, Dulles was made to attend church daily. As his parents distrusted public education, Dulles was homeschooled by various private tutors.

Dulles graduated from Princeton University, where he participated in the American Whig–Cliosophic Society. He taught school in India before entering the diplomatic service in 1916. In 1920, he married Martha &quot;Clover&quot; Todd (March 5, 1894 – April 15, 1974). They had three children: daughters Clover and Joan, and son Allen Macy Dulles II (1930–2020), who was wounded and permanently disabled in the Korean War and spent the rest of his life in and out of medical care. 

According to his sister, Eleanor, Dulles had &quot;at least a hundred&quot; extramarital affairs, including some during his tenure with the CIA.

==Early career==
Initially assigned to Vienna, he was transferred to Bern, Switzerland, along with the rest of the embassy personnel shortly before the U.S. entered the First World War. Later in life Dulles said he had been telephoned by Vladimir Lenin, seeking a meeting with the American embassy on April 8, 1917, the day before Lenin left Switzerland to travel to Saint Petersburg aboard a German train. After recovering from the Spanish flu he was assigned to the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, along with his elder brother Foster. 

In 1921, while at the US Embassy in Istanbul, he helped expose &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; as a forgery. Dulles unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the US State Department to publicly denounce the forgery.

From 1922 to 1926, Dulles served as chief of the Near East division of the Department of State. He then earned a law degree from George Washington University Law School and took a job at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the New York firm where his brother, John Foster Dulles, was a partner. He became a director of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1927, the first new director since the Council&#x27;s founding in 1921. He was the Council&#x27;s secretary from 1933 to 1944 and its president from 1946 to 1950.

During the late 1920s and the early 1930s, he served as legal adviser to the delegations on arms limitation at the League of Nations. He met with Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, and the prime ministers of Britain and France. In April 1933, Dulles and Norman Davis met with Hitler in Berlin on State Department duty. After the meeting, Dulles wrote to his brother Foster and reassured him that conditions under Hitler&#x27;s regime &quot;are not quite as bad&quot; as an alarmist friend had indicated. Dulles rarely spoke about his meeting with Hitler, and future CIA director Richard Helms had not even heard of their encounter until decades after the death of Dulles and expressed shock that his former boss had never told him about it. After meeting with German Information Minister Joseph Goebbels, Dulles stated he was impressed with him and cited his &quot;sincerity and frankness&quot; during their interaction.

In 1935, Dulles returned from a business trip to Germany concerned by the Nazi treatment of German Jews and, despite his brother&#x27;s objections, led a movement within the law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to close their Berlin office. The effort was successful, and the firm ceased to conduct business in Nazi Germany.

As the Republican Party began to divide into isolationist and interventionist factions, Dulles became an outspoken interventionist, running unsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination in New York&#x27;s Sixteenth Congressional District on a platform calling for the strengthening of U.S. defenses. Dulles collaborated with Hamilton Fish Armstrong, the editor of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine, on two books, &quot;Can We Be Neutral?&quot; (1936), and &quot;Can America Stay Neutral?&quot; (1939). They concluded that diplomatic, military, and economic isolation, in a traditional sense, were no longer possible in an increasingly interdependent international system. Dulles helped some German Jews, such as the banker Paul Kemper, escape to the United States from Nazi Germany.

== World War II and OSS career ==
Dulles was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services by William J. Donovan in October 1941, after the outbreak of the World War II in Europe, and on November 12, 1942, he moved to Bern, Switzerland, where he lived at Herrengasse 23 for the duration of World War II. As Swiss Director of the OSS, Dulles worked on intelligence about German plans and activities, and established wide contacts with German émigrés, resistance figures, and anti-Nazi intelligence officers. He was assisted in intelligence-gathering activities by Gero von Schulze-Gaevernitz, a German emigrant. Dulles also received valuable information from Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat, one whom he described as the best spy of the war. Kolbe supplied secret documents about active German spies and plans for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.
Dulles was in contact with the Austrian resistance group around the priest Heinrich Maier, who collected information through many different contacts with scientists and the military. From 1943 onward, he received very important information from this resistance group about V-1, V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, and other aircraft and the related factories. This helped Allied bombers to target war-decisive armaments factories. In particular, Dulles then had crucial information for Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra. The group reported to him about the mass murder in Auschwitz. Through the Maier Group and Kurt Grimm, Dulles also received information about the economic situation in the Nazi sphere of influence. After the resistance group was uncovered by the Gestapo, Dulles sent American agents to Austria to contact any surviving members.

Although Washington barred Dulles from making firm commitments to the plotters of the July 20, 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler, the conspirators nonetheless gave him reports on developments in Germany, including sketchy but accurate warnings of plans for Hitler&#x27;s V-1 and V-2 missiles.

Dulles was involved in Operation Sunrise, secret negotiations in March 1945 to arrange a local surrender of German forces in northern Italy. His actions in Operation Sunrise have been criticized by historians for offering German SS General Karl Wolff protection from prosecution at the Nuremberg trial, and creating a diplomatic rift between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. After the war in Europe, Dulles served for six months as the OSS Berlin station chief and later as station chief in Bern. The Office of Strategic Services was dissolved in October 1945 and its functions transferred to the State and War Departments.

In 1947, Dulles served as a senior staffer on the Herter Committee.

==CIA career==
In the 1948 Presidential election, Dulles was, together with his brother, an advisor to Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey. The Dulles brothers and James Forrestal helped form the Office of Policy Coordination. During 1949 he co-authored the Dulles–Jackson–Correa Report, which was sharply critical of the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been established by the National Security Act of 1947. Partly as a result of the report, Truman named a new Director of Central Intelligence, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith.

Smith recruited Dulles into the CIA to oversee the agency&#x27;s covert operations as Deputy Director for Plans, a position he held from January 4, 1951. On August 23, 1951, Dulles was promoted to deputy director of Central Intelligence, second in the intelligence hierarchy. In this capacity, in 1952–53 he was one of five members of the State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament during the last year of the Truman administration.

After the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Bedell Smith shifted to the Department of State and Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence. Dulles played a role in convincing Eisenhower to follow one of the conclusions of the State Department Panel report, that the American public deserved to be informed of the perils of possible nuclear war with the Soviet Union, because even though America held numerical nuclear superiority, the Soviets would still have enough nuclear weapons to severely damage American society regardless of how many more such bombs the United States might possess or how badly those U.S. weapons could destroy the Soviets.

The Agency&#x27;s covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s new Cold War national security policy known as the &quot;New Look&quot;.

At Dulles&#x27;s request, President Eisenhower demanded that Senator Joseph McCarthy discontinue issuing subpoenas against the CIA. In March 1950, McCarthy had initiated a series of investigations into potential communist subversion of the Agency. Although none of the investigations revealed any wrongdoing, the hearings were potentially damaging, not only to the CIA&#x27;s reputation but also to the security of sensitive information. Documents made public in 2004 revealed that the CIA, under Dulles&#x27;s orders, had broken into McCarthy&#x27;s Senate office and fed disinformation to him in order to discredit him, in order to stop his investigation of alleged communist infiltration of the CIA.

In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force conducted a competition for a new photo reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s Skunk Works submitted a design number called the CL-282, which married sailplane-like wings to the body of a supersonic interceptor. This aircraft was rejected by the Air Force, but several of the civilians on the review board took notice, and Edwin Land presented a proposal for the aircraft to Dulles. The aircraft became what is known as the U-2 &#x27;spy plane&#x27;, and it was initially operated by CIA pilots. Its introduction into operational service in 1957 greatly enhanced the CIA&#x27;s ability to monitor Soviet activity through overhead photo surveillance. The aircraft eventually entered service with the Air Force. The Soviet Union shot down and captured a U-2 in 1960 during Dulles&#x27;s term as CIA chief.

Dulles is considered one of the essential creators of the modern United States intelligence system and was an indispensable guide to clandestine operations during the Cold War. He established intelligence networks worldwide to check and counter Soviet and eastern European communist advances as well as international communist movements.

===Coup in Iran===
In 1953, Dulles was involved, along with Frank Wisner, in Operation Ajax, the covert operation that led to the removal of democratically elected prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh, and his replacement with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran. Rumors of a Soviet takeover of the country had surfaced due to the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. By coincidence, on August 18, 1953, Dulles was taking a vacation in Rome while the Shah fled there after a setback in the coup, and the two met while checking in to the Hotel Excelsior. The meeting turned out to be fortuitous for the United States and the coup. CIA and independent historians say that the meeting was happenstance, but conspiracy theories abound.

===Coup in Guatemala===
President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman of Guatemala was removed in 1954 in a CIA-led coup carried out under the code name Operation PBSuccess.

Eduardo Galeano described Dulles as a former member of the United Fruit Company&#x27;s Board of Directors. However, in a detailed examination of the connections between the United Fruit Company and the Eisenhower Administration, Immerman makes no mention of Dulles being part of the United Fruit Company&#x27;s Board, although he does note that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell had represented the company.

===Congo===
Dulles was strongly opposed to Congolese president Patrice Lumumba. In 1960 a plan to kill Lumumba was considered and Dulles allocated $100,000 to the plan, but it never materialised. Dulles believed that Lumumba posed &quot;a grave danger as long as he was not disposed of&quot;.

===Bay of Pigs===
Several failed assassination plots utilizing CIA-recruited operatives and anti-Castro Cubans directly against Castro undermined the CIA&#x27;s credibility. The reputation of the agency and its director declined drastically after the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco of 1961. President Kennedy reportedly said he wanted to &quot;splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.&quot; However, following a &quot;rigorous inquiry into the agency&#x27;s affairs, methods, and problems ... [Kennedy] did not &#x27;splinter&#x27; it after all and did not recommend Congressional supervision. Instead, President Kennedy transferred the CIA&#x27;s command of foreign paramilitaries to the Department of Defense under the close supervision and control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which would also report on CIA plans and operations to the President.&quot;

===Dismissal===

During the Kennedy Administration, Dulles faced increasing criticism. In autumn 1961, following the Bay of Pigs incident and the Algiers putsch against Charles de Gaulle, Dulles and his entourage, including Deputy Director for Plans Richard M. Bissell Jr. and Deputy Director Charles Cabell, were forced to resign. On November 28, 1961, Kennedy presented Dulles with the National Security Medal at the CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The next day, November 29, the White House released a resignation letter signed by Dulles. He was replaced by John McCone.

Dulles referred to the Bay of Pigs failure as &quot;the worst day of my life&quot; and developed a strong dislike of Kennedy, later telling journalist Willie Morris &quot;that little Kennedy, he thought he was a god&quot;. Dulles found life outside the CIA difficult, with his friend James Angleton recalling &quot;He had a very difficult time to decompress&quot;.

==Later life==
Later, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, on November 22, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dulles as one of seven commissioners of the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of the U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Some historians later criticized the appointment, noting that Kennedy fired him. Therefore, he was unlikely to be impartial in passing the judgments charged to the Warren Commission. In the view of journalist and author Stephen Kinzer, Johnson appointed Dulles primarily so that Dulles could &quot;coach&quot; the Commission on how to interview CIA witnesses and what questions to ask because Johnson and Dulles were both anxious to ensure that the Commission did not discover Kennedy&#x27;s secret involvement in the administration&#x27;s illegal plans to assassinate Castro and other foreign leaders. Robert F. Kennedy also urged Lyndon Johnson to put Allen Dulles on the Warren Commission most likely fearing revelation of Kennedy&#x27;s clandestine involvement in Cuba.

In 1966, Princeton University&#x27;s American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Dulles the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service.

Dulles published the book &quot;The Craft of Intelligence&quot; in 1963, and edited &quot;Great True Spy Stories&quot; in 1968.

He died on January 29, 1969, of influenza, complicated by pneumonia, at the age of 75, in Georgetown, D.C. He was buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, officially known as Tullie since July 2024, is a museum in Carlisle, England. Opened by the Carlisle Corporation in 1893, the original building is a converted Jacobean mansion, with extensions added when it was converted. At first the building contained the museum and also a library, an art school and a technical school.

Tullie House Museum is currently partly closed to the public for redevelopment work. It will fully re-open in the autumn of 2024, when it will have a new main entrance on Castle Street to its north-east.

The building, including the extensions, is a Grade I listed building, and the wall, gates and railings in front of the house are separately Grade I listed.

The two schools were moved in the 1950s and the library in 1986. The museum expanded into the city Guildhall in 1980 and with new space available from 1986 it underwent an extensive redevelopment over 1989–90 and again in 2000–01.

Since May 2011 the museum has been an independent charitable trust, the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery Trust. It is one of the three members of the Cumbria Museum Consortium, along with Lakeland Arts and the Wordsworth Trust. In 2012–15 and 2015–18 this consortium was one of the 21 museums or consortia (16 in the earlier period) to be funded by Arts Council England as &quot;Major Partner Museums&quot;.

== Collections ==

The museum has large and eclectic collections of zoological, botanical and geological material. The plant collector, Clara Winsome Muirhead worked at the museum in the 1940s and donated a large collection of botanical specimens to the museum. The fine and decorative arts collections include works by Burne-Jones and other Pre-Raphaelite artists, as well as Stanley Spencer, Winifred Nicholson, Sheila Fell and Phil Morsman.

=== Musical instruments ===
There is collection of stringed instruments including a violin by Andrea Amati from the royal collection of France.

=== Roman Britain ===
There were two Roman forts in Carlisle, one of which, Uxelodunum (or Stanwix to use the modern toponym), was the largest along the length of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The museum houses important collections and temporary exhibitions associated with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

=== Post-Roman history ===
The human history collection also features permanent exhibitions dedicated to the Vikings and the Border Reivers.

== Accolades ==
Tullie House Museum won the annual Family Friendly Museum Award (sponsored by the Telegraph Media Group) in 2015.

<text>Jules Joseph Bonnot (14 October 1876 – 28 April 1912) was a French soldier, anarchist, bank robber, and murderer. He is notorious for his role in the French anarchist band &quot;The Bonnot Gang&quot; that committed many crimes in early 20th-century Paris.

Born in Pont-de-Roide, Bonnot experienced many hardships in his youth, such as his mother dying when he was a child. Before his gang affiliation and time serving in the army, he had several run-ins with the law as a teenager. In 1887, he joined the French army as a mechanic, which resulted in an expertise in motor vehicles. After leaving the army, Bonnot adopted anarchist ideas in response to his frustration with the bourgeois society and followed a philosophy called illegalism.

Soon after, Bonnot formed the notorious &quot;Bonnot Gang&quot; in Paris, France with several fellow anarchists. They specialized in bank robberies utilizing motor vehicles to escape. From 1911 to 1912, the gang went on to commit many crimes around France that resulted in the deaths of many, including Bonnot&#x27;s.

== Early life ==

Jules Bonnot was born on 14 October 1876 in Pont-de-Roide, France, a small commune in eastern France. His father labored as a smelter at a factory close to his childhood home. His father also struggled with alcoholism. When he was five years old, his mother died, leaving his grandmother to raise him throughout his entire childhood. In school, Bonnot was very intelligent; however, he lacked work ethic and was described as &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;insolent&quot; by one of his teachers. When Bonnot reached his adolescence, his father remarried. Bonnot&#x27;s early life took a turn for the worse when his brother Justin drowned himself in the waters of a nearby river due to heartbreak. As he got older, Bonnot developed a short temper and got in several fights at a local bar when he would go out into town. He even spent several days in prison after severely beating another person. Like his father, he also worked in a local factory but was promptly let go after robbing from the worksite, so he left for the town of Nancy, France in search of employment. When he was residing there, he was placed in jail for a period of three months after striking a members of the local police. As a result, Bonnot&#x27;s father ceased all communication with him for he had disappointed him.

At the age of twenty-one, Bonnot was conscripted into the French army for a mandatory three years. He served in the 133rd Line regiment that was stationed near Lyon, France. During his time serving, Bonnot behaved himself and gained experience with the intricacies of the motor vehicles within the unit. When he finished his three years, he became engaged to a seamstress from Vouvray, France in 1900, named Sophie Burdet. They were married in August 1901, and they left to Bellegrade, France where Bonnot was employed at another factory. As a theme that was common in Bonnot&#x27;s life, more tragic events unfolded. Bonnot&#x27;s wife, Sophie, gave birth to a daughter in 1902 that only lived for four days. At the same time, Bonnot bounced around three different jobs but was fired for being violent and unruly towards his superiors. In 1903, Sophie gave birth to a son, who they named Justin after Bonnot&#x27;s late brother. Later in 1903, when Bonnot contracted a case of tuberculosis, his wife Sophie left him to live in Dijon, France with a lover. Despite his calls for the custody of their son, Sophie refused every attempt and ceased all communication.

== Adoption of Illegalism ==
In 1907, Bonnot began working at a factory as a mechanic in Lyon. As a result, he acquired a driver&#x27;s license. Bonnot became frustrated with the constant unemployment and poverty. He felt that the new French society had turned its back on the common man, the worker, and the proletariat. During this time, he joined the local anarchist and individualist meetings and partook in counterfeiting, which he learned from several members of the group. The group was made up of like-minded individuals frustrated with the bourgeois and capitalistic society.

With another member of the anarchist group named Platano, Bonnot began burglarizing local companies and houses with the usage of his driver&#x27;s license. According to Bonnot, the best way to fight against this new French society was to live outside the law and to get retribution against the wealthy. He began specializing in using motor vehicles to make a quick getaway from each incident. His group of anarchists burglarized many items that they rented a place out to store it all. In one particular occasion, Bonnot stole upwards of thirty-five thousand francs by utilizing the motor vehicle to great effect. He always considered himself as a professional burglar and favored wealthy outfits, a well-groomed appearance, and swift robberies.

This philosophy that he and his anarchist partners adopted and lived by was illegalism, a form of anarchism. In late 1911, the garages that held all the robbed items were discovered by the police. In response, both Bonnot and Platano fled to Paris; however, in a freak accident, Platano was fatally shot while fiddling around with his own pistol. As a result, blame was inevitably placed on Bonnot, for Platano had a considerable amount of money under his name. Bonnot then became wanted for murder and burglary by the Lyon police.

== The Bonnot Gang ==

Upon returning to Paris, Bonnot lacked money as most of the stolen items remained in Lyon. Bonnot felt he had no other choice but to continue his life of crime because of his standing in society and the warrants for his arrest. Thus, he joined a group of anarchists that were known to write issues of &quot;L&#x27;Anarchie&quot;. Together with other local anarchists, they formed &quot;The Bonnot Gang,&quot; an act of rebellion against their society. The group consisted of Edouard Carouy, André Soudy, Stephen Monier, René Valet, Raymond Callemin, Octave Garnier, and others, all whom were local anarchists of French and Belgian descent. Their common denominator was their hatred of bourgeois society and the warrants for their incarceration.

When Bonnot&#x27;s frustration with capitalistic society grew to a breaking point, he decided that bank robberies were the most suitable expression of the sentiments of the Illegalists. The Bonnot Gang began by robbing a rare luxury car, a Delaunay-Belleville, to serve as the getaway vehicle for their crimes. This theft, in particular, was a triumph for Bonnot because it proved to him that the bourgeois were vulnerable to their exploits. The gang then built up an arsenal of weapons and a collection of hiding spots from the police. In late December 1911, the gang robbed and shot a bank messenger, stealing five thousand francs and bonds worth upwards of one hundred thousand francs. With this crime, several newspapers put up notices of a reward for the capture of the members of &quot;The Bonnot Gang,&quot; and they were notorious among the general public of Paris as car bandits, an unprecedented new form of crime as motor vehicles had not been fully integrated into society at that point. This crime became known as one of the first robberies utilizing a motor vehicle to leave the crime scene. In light of their attacks against the capitalist society, the gang was able to garner support from some of the general public that sympathized with their hatred of the bourgeois. Bonnot never considered himself as the leader of the gang because each member played a crucial role in each crime; however, because of his past notoriety and skills with motor vehicles, Bonnot was stamped as the face of the group.

== 1912 crime spree and Bonnot&#x27;s death ==

Once the year turned 1912, &quot;The Bonnot Gang&quot; were beginning their infamous series of crimes. In addition to France, the gang commenced expanding their crime to Belgium. In January, the gang murdered two elderly people in their houses and stole several thousands of francs. In Paris, they successfully sold stolen goods for eight thousand francs and robbed a wealthy residence. Later that month, several friends of the members of the gang were arrested and interrogated by the French police. Bonnot and Octave Garnier were able to evade capture while they were in Lyon.

After taking a train to Paris and then traveling to Ghent, Garnier and Bonnot murdered a chauffeur and severely wounded a watchman as they attempted to steal two cars but returned to Paris emptyhanded in late January. While there, several members altered their appearance in order to evade arrest. Instead of laying low, Bonnot Bonnot and Garnier continued their bouts of crime, venturing into Belgium and southern France at times.

In late February, the duo traveled to a wealthy neighborhood of Paris and robbed another Delaunay-Belleville and changed the plates. While on their way to Southern France, the car broke down and was repaired. Bonnot, in a hurry after the delay, sped at significant speed and nearly caused an accident in a suburb of Paris. A police officer spotted their traffic infraction and attempted to stop the vehicle only to be mortally wounded. With Bonnot at the wheel, the gang&#x27;s vehicle ran over and severely injured a young woman while in a haste to leave the scene. With the murder of the policeman, the French ramped up their efforts to round up the &quot;bandits&quot; and the general public was placed on high alert to report any suspicious activity directly to the French authorities.

In late March, the group attempted to rob vehicles owned by the bourgeois in two different instances and came up empty-handed in both. As a result, they plotted to rob a car in broad daylight in the middle of a Parisian road. On 25 March, they targeted a newly purchased luxury limousine that was being delivered. When the limousine was most vulnerable in a suburb of Paris, Bonnot and Garnier shot the passengers and hijacked the vehicle. Immediately, the gang embarked towards a bank that was seventy kilometers away from the scene. They entered, shot three bank clerks, and got away from the French police with fifty thousand francs and without any confrontation.

After this event, French police were placed on high alert and armed with revolvers in order to capture the gang once and for all. The infamy of the Bonnot Gang and the driving prowess of Bonnot was instilling fear in all of the French citizens. In the following days, some of the members of the Bonnot Gang were captured by the French police, and on April 24, while in hiding, Bonnot was surprised by police. He quickly drew his weapon and killed a policeman, wounded another, and evaded capture; however, four days later, the police caught him hiding in a residence in Choisy-le-Roi. Bonnot bunkered himself in the house while under siege by upwards of five hundred police men. He was able to wound three officers and fend off the force before the front of the residence was blown up with dynamite. Bonnot was shot ten times before finally being captured. The following day, April 28, 1912, Bonnot succumbed to his injuries and died in his hospital bed. He was not the only member of the gang to be killed. Rene Valet and Octave Garnier were killed the next month by French police in a shootout.

== Legacy ==
After his death, the gang&#x27;s and Bonnot&#x27;s notoriety was immortalized in French history forever. His expertise in automobile theft and the usage of these vehicles to facilitate an escape from a crime were a precedent for future crimes. The remaining members of the gang was tried for their crimes and many of them were executed as a result of their actions. In the days after Bonnot&#x27;s death, many anarchists in Paris attempted their own robberies on bourgeois vehicles and proclaimed their Illegalist views in support of the gang. These acts of crime were met with a swift response from the Paris police in order to discourage any more criminals from recreating the gang&#x27;s crime spree. Any proletariat that stated their support for Bonnot were jailed instantly to discourage any rebellion against the upper class. Bonnot was either seen as a martyr for the fight against the bourgeois or a tyrant that was a threat to the stability of society. The French bourgeois made many efforts to shun any attempt to tear down the upper class.

<text>The Bonnot Gang (&quot;La Bande à Bonnot&quot;), or The Tragic Bandits (&quot;Les Bandes Tragiques&quot;), was a French criminal anarchist group that operated in France and Belgium during the late &quot;Belle Époque&quot; from 1911 to 1912. Composed of individuals who identified with the emerging illegalist &quot;milieu&quot;, the gang used new technology, such as cars and repeating rifles not then available to the police.

The press originally referred to them as simply &quot;The Auto Bandits&quot;, as they carried out the first motorized robberies and bank raids in world history. The group also earned the moniker &quot;Les bandes tragiques&quot; from the press due to a sense of the group&#x27;s &quot;desperate courage&quot;, who were painted as tragicomic figures for their working-class origins and espoused anarchist politics. Ultimately, the gang became known by the title of &quot;The Bonnot Gang&quot; after Jules Bonnot gave an interview at the office of &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot;, a popular daily paper. Bonnot&#x27;s perceived prominence within the group was later reinforced by his high-profile death during a shootout with French police in Choisy-le-Roi.

While many of the gang&#x27;s members originated from regions across France and Belgium, such as Lyon, Brussels, Charleroi, and Alais, they congregated in the city of Paris. Only some decades after the Paris Commune of 1871 and the wave of anarchist terrorism of the 1890s, and not long after the General Strike of 1906 organized by the &quot;Confédération Générale du Travail&quot; (CGT), Paris was a hotbed of anarchist debate and organizing, with ongoing bitter disagreements between the anarcho-individualists (such as the illegalists) and anarcho-communists and anarcho-syndicalists.

== Crime spree ==

The first robbery by Bonnot&#x27;s Gang was on 21 December 1911 at the AB Branch of Société Générale Bank, located at 148 rue Ordener in the 18th Arrondissement of Paris. They shot a collection clerk in the neck and lung (yet he survived) and snatched his cash bags.

On 25 March 1912, the gang stole a de Dion-Bouton automobile in the Forest of Sénart south of Paris by shooting the driver through the heart. They drove into Chantilly, north of Paris, where they robbed the local branch of Société Générale Bank, and fatally shot two bank cashiers and severely wounded a bookkeeper.

Sûreté Chief Xavier Guichard took the matter personally. Even politicians became concerned, increasing police funding by 800,000 francs. Banks began to prepare for forthcoming robberies and many cashiers armed themselves. The Société Générale promised a reward of 100,000 francs for information that would lead to arrests.

<doc id="172618" wikidata="Q201622" url="?curid=172618" title="Potsdam Giants">
<text>The Potsdam Giants was the name given to Prussian infantry regiment No 6. The regiment was composed of taller-than-average soldiers, and was founded in 1675. It was eventually dissolved in 1806, after the Prussians were defeated by Napoleon. Throughout the reign of the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia (1688–1740), the unit was known as the &quot;Potsdamer Riesengarde&quot; (&quot;giant guard of Potsdam&quot;) in German, but the Prussian population quickly nicknamed them the &quot;Lange Kerls&quot; (&quot;long fellows&quot;).

==Regiment&#x27;s history==

The Regiment was founded with a strength of two battalions in 1675 as “Regiment Kurprinz” under the command of Prince Frederick of Brandenburg, the later King Frederick I of Prussia. In 1688 the later King Frederick William I of Prussia became the nominal Commander of the Regiment. After Frederick William I ascended to the throne in 1713, he proceeded to strengthen his military, including hiring 40,000 mercenaries.
He had already begun to recruit taller soldiers and needed several hundred more recruits each year.

As the number of tall soldiers increased, the regiment earned its nickname &quot;Potsdam Giants&quot;. The original required height was 6 Prussian feet (about ), well above average then and now. The king was about tall himself. He tried to obtain them by any means, including recruiting them from the armies of other countries. The Emperor of Austria, Russian Tsar Peter the Great and even the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire sent him tall soldiers in order to encourage friendly relations. Several soldiers were given by Tsar Peter I as a gift in return for the famous Amber Room. Pay was high, but not all giants were content, especially if they were forcibly recruited, and some attempted desertion or suicide.

Frederick tried to pair these men with tall women, in order to breed giants. In &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, Charles Darwin mentions this attempt as the only case of intentional selective breeding in humans: &quot;Nor have certain male and female individuals been intentionally picked out and matched, except in the well-known case of the Prussian grenadiers; and in this case man obeyed, as might have been expected, the law of methodical selection; for it is asserted that many tall men were reared in the villages inhabited by the grenadiers with their tall wives.&quot;

Although Prussia briefly intervened in the Great Northern War, the Potsdam Giants never saw battle. Some sources state that there was a military reason to create a regiment of &quot;long fellows&quot; because loading a muzzleloader is easier to handle for a taller soldier. Another source states that many of the men were unfit for combat due to their gigantism.

The king trained and drilled his own regiment every day. He liked to paint their portraits from memory. He tried to show them to foreign visitors and dignitaries to impress them. At times he would try to cheer himself up by ordering them to march before him, even if he was in his sickbed. This procession, which included the entire regiment, was led by their mascot, a bear. Their uniform was not in any way unique for the time, consisting of a red mitre, a Prussian blue jacket with gold lacing, scarlet breeches and white gaiters.

One of the tallest soldiers, the Irishman James Kirkland, was reportedly in height. Kirkland&#x27;s fellow Irishman, the poet Tomás Ó Caiside, also served in the regiment. Daniel Cajanus, the famous Swedish/Finnish giant, was also a member of the regiment. 

When the king died in 1740, the regiment consisted of 3,200 men. However, his successor Frederick the Great did not share his father&#x27;s sentiments about the regiment, which seemed to him an unnecessary expense. The regiment was largely disbanded and most of its soldiers were integrated into other units. The regiment itself was downgraded to a battalion (Garde – Grenadier No. 6) and employed during the War of the Austrian Succession at Hohenfriedberg in 1745 and at Rossbach, Leuthen, Hochkirch, Liegnitz, and Torgau throughout the Seven Years&#x27; War. The battalion surrendered near Erfurt and Prenzlau after the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806 and was disbanded and absorbed into the 1st Guard Regiment on foot.

<doc id="172624" wikidata="Q642227" url="?curid=172624" title="Wickham, Hampshire">
<text>Wickham () is a village in the civil parish of Wickham and Knowle, in the Winchester district, in the county of Hampshire, England. It is about 3 miles north of Fareham. In 2021 it had a population of 2173. At the 2001 census, it the parish a population of 4,816, falling to 4,299 at the 2011 Census.

Wickham has one of the oldest continuous historic market squares lined with historic buildings and is designated a conservation area. Most of the square is taken by parking spaces.

It was the fording place of the River Meon on the Roman road between Noviomagus Regnorum (Chichester) and Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and the inferred divergent point of the route to Clausentum (Bitterne). The Roman road from Wickham to Chichester is still followed today by local roads, passing behind Portsdown Hill to the north of Portsmouth Harbour and then onwards via Havant. In contrast, the route to Winchester is mostly likely lost through neglect in the Dark Ages, before present field patterns emerged.

Nearby sites have been connected to Romano-British industry, mainly pottery kilns focused around the limit of navigation of the River Hamble, near Botley, and a ford on the Clausentum road.

Wickham has been suggested as an alternative to Nursling (on the River Test) or Neatham (near Alton) for the Roman station Onna listed in the Antonine Itinerary. However, no definite location for Onna has been determined.

It was the birthplace of William of Wykeham, founder of Winchester College and New College, Oxford.

The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Wickham.

The village was an intermediate station on the Meon Valley Railway, a late Victorian route, until the line closed in 1955. At one time this railway was conceived as a direct route from London to the Isle of Wight. The closed line is now established as a cycle path and bridleway along the valley of the River Meon.

A traditional gypsy horse fair is held annually every 20 May, or another day if a Sunday, in the village square.

==History==

===Early settlements===
The Romans established a settlement at Wickham, on the road from the Roman centres of Chichester and Winchester. Iron works have been found northeast of the village, and various Roman finds to the southwest.

It was in Saxon Britain that the first written mention of the village appears, in a Royal Charter document dated 826. Recent excavation (1965–70) at the Manor House showed its grounds had dwellings and huts, evidence of Saxon settlement.

===Post-Norman Conquest===
After the Norman Conquest, King William granted the Manor of Wickham to Hugo de Port and the Village appeared in the Doomsday Book of 1086, as part of the Titchfield Hundred. The present church of St Nicholas dates from 1126 and was run by the Canons of Titchfield. In 1269, King Henry III granted a charter to Roger de Scures, the Lord of The Manor at the time, for markets to be held on a Thursday. It is from this time that the layout of the village as we now know it began to emerge. Wickham also had a fair which attracted buyers and sellers from a wide area. Wickham fair (often referred to Wickham Horse Fair) is still held each year on 20 May.
The Church of St Nicholas in Wickham was built in the early 12th century (although there has probably been a church on the site since the 7th century when the people of Hampshire were first converted to Christianity), however the church was largely rebuilt in the 19th century.

===Industrialisation and Victorian Wickham===
In the 18th century, there was a tanning industry in Wickham and in the 18th and 19th centuries a brewing industry. Both needed a supply of fresh water, which was readily available from the River Meon. In 1801, Wickham had a population of 901 and compared to most of the villages in Hampshire it was a large community. In 1820, Chesapeake Mill was built with timber taken from an American ship , which was captured in the War of 1812. Sir Richard Grindall who commanded at the Battle of Trafalgar is buried in Wickham churchyard.

In 1903, a branch railway was built from Fareham through Wickham, to Droxford and Alton. It was closed to passengers in 1955 and the line converted to a footpath. The original station platforms can still be found.

In 1978, Wickham was twinned with the French village of Villiers-Sur-Mer. Wickham Vineyard opened in 1984.

In 1990, an old brewery and village hall in Wickham were converted into flats called Riverside Mews. The brewery had shut in 1910 and the buildings were given to Wickham Parish Council to use as a village hall.

==Culture and events==

===Wickham Festival===
Farmland north of Wickham serves as the venue for the award-winning Wickham Festival, which is an annual 4-day music event. The first Wickham Festival was held from 3–6 August 2006 in the Community Centre and environs. Artists performing included Daby Blade from Senegal, Spiers and Boden, Los Pacaminos, Richard Thompson, Shooglenifty, Sparks, Oysterband, Fiddlers&#x27; Bid, Osibisa, Flook, Steeleye Span and The Larry Love Showband.

After briefly moving to Stokes Bay in 2008 and 2009, the festival returned to Wickham in 2010, where it has remained ever since. Wickham Festival has expanded over the years, and has featured performances from such artists as James Blunt, 10cc, Wilko Johnson, The Proclaimers, KT Tunstall, Hugh Cornwell and Lightning Seeds.

===Taste of Wickham===

Taste of Wickham is a food festival, first held in Wickham&#x27;s medieval square in 2014. The festival offers local produce, barbecues, tasters and cookery demonstrations, and has attracted crowds of over 4,000 people to the village. Taste of Wickham returned in 2015, with increased numbers of stalls, crafts and musical displays.

===Wickham horse fair===

England&#x27;s biggest and oldest horse fair takes place in Wickham on 20 May every year. It is one of just two major horse-trading events in the country and can trace its history back to the year 1269, making it one of the oldest fairs of this type in the UK. Ever since, crowds have gathered annually in the village to trade secrets, meet with friends and parade their stock. The fair includes bareback parades with ponies decorated with ribbons.

==Shopping==

Wickham&#x27;s village square has bars, restaurants, shops and hotels. Bay Tree Walk is a shopping walk. The Chesapeake Mill is a former water mill which is a retail centre.

==Sport and leisure==
Wickham has a community centre &quot;Wickham Community Centre&quot;.

Wickham has a tennis club. The village has a public skatepark and a floodlit astroturf pitch located behind the Community Centre.

The Meon Valley Railway Line is a 17.5 km (11 mi) recreational bridleway that runs through the village. The trail follows part of the bed of the former Meon Valley Railway (Alton to Fareham), which closed in 1968. It ends at West Meon due to removal of the former viaduct across the Meon Valley, and the presence of tunnels further north.

==Wickham and Knowle civil parish==
Known as Wickham civil parish until its name was changed in 2022 to Wickham and Knowle.

Wickham Common is an area of common land a mile south-east of Wickham village. It is a mix of grassland and woodland. Wickham Common is also the name of a hamlet on Forest Lane, south of the common.

Main roads running through the parish are the A32, the A334 and the B2177 (former A333).

<text>Mamluk or Mamaluk (; (singular), , &quot;mamālīk&quot; (plural); translated as &quot;one who is owned&quot;, meaning &quot;slave&quot;) were non-Arab, ethnically diverse (mostly Turkic, Caucasian, Eastern and Southeastern European) enslaved mercenaries, slave-soldiers, and freed slaves who were assigned high-ranking military and administrative duties, serving the ruling Arab and Ottoman dynasties in the Muslim world.

The most enduring Mamluk realm was the knightly military class in medieval Egypt, which developed from the ranks of slave-soldiers. Originally the Mamluks were slaves of Turkic origins from the Eurasian Steppe, but the institution of military slavery spread to include Circassians, Abkhazians, Georgians, Armenians, Russians, and Hungarians, as well as peoples from the Balkans such as Albanians, Greeks, and South Slavs (&quot;see&quot; Saqaliba). They also recruited from the Egyptians. The &quot;Mamluk/Ghulam Phenomenon&quot;, as David Ayalon dubbed the creation of the specific warrior class, was of great political importance; for one thing, it endured for nearly 1,000 years, from the 9th century to the early 19th century.

Over time, Mamluks became a powerful military knightly class in various Muslim societies that were controlled by dynastic Arab rulers. Particularly in Egypt and Syria, but also in the Ottoman Empire, Levant, Mesopotamia, and India, mamluks held political and military power. In some cases, they attained the rank of sultan, while in others they held regional power as &quot;emirs&quot; or &quot;beys&quot;. Most notably, Mamluk factions seized the sultanate centered on Egypt and Syria, and controlled it as the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). The Mamluk Sultanate famously defeated the Ilkhanate at the Battle of Ain Jalut. They had earlier fought the western European Christian Crusaders in 1154–1169 and 1213–1221, effectively driving them out of Egypt and the Levant. In 1302 the Mamluk Sultanate formally expelled the last Crusaders from the Levant, ending the era of the Crusades.

While Mamluks were purchased as property, their status was above ordinary slaves, who were not allowed to carry weapons or perform certain tasks. In places such as Egypt, from the Ayyubid dynasty to the time of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, mamluks were considered to be &quot;true lords&quot; and &quot;true warriors&quot;, with social status above the general population in Egypt and the Levant. In a sense, they were like enslaved mercenaries.

==Overview==


Daniel Pipes argued that the first indication of the Mamluk military class was rooted in the practice of early Muslims such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Uthman ibn Affan who, before Islam, owned many slaves and practiced Mawla (Islamic manumission of slaves). The Zubayrids army under Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, son of Zubayr, used these freed slave retainers during the second civil war.

Meanwhile, historians agree that the massive implementation of a slave military class such as the Mamluks appears to have developed in Islamic societies beginning with the 9th-century Abbasid Caliphate based in Baghdad, under the Abbasid caliph al-Muʿtaṣim. Until the 1990s, it was widely believed that the earliest Mamluks were known as &quot;Ghilman&quot; or &quot;Ghulam&quot; (another broadly synonymous term for slaves) and were bought by the Abbasid caliphs, especially al-Muʿtaṣim (833–842).

By the end of the 9th century, such slave warriors had become the dominant element in the military. Conflict between the Ghilman and the population of Baghdad prompted the caliph al-Muʿtaṣim to move his capital to the city of Samarra, but this did not succeed in calming tensions. The caliph al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by some of these slave soldiers in 861 (see Anarchy at Samarra).

Since the early 21st century, historians have suggested that there was a distinction between the Mamluk system and the (earlier) Ghilman system, in Samarra, which did not have specialized training and was based on pre-existing Central Asian hierarchies. Adult slaves and freemen both served as warriors in the Ghilman system. The Mamluk system developed later, after the return of the caliphate to Baghdad in the 870s. It included the systematic training of young slaves in military and martial skills. The Mamluk system is considered to have been a small-scale experiment of al-Muwaffaq, to combine the slaves&#x27; efficiency as warriors with improved reliability. This recent interpretation seems to have been accepted.

After the fragmentation of the Abbasid Empire, military slaves, known as either Mamluks or Ghilman, were used throughout the Islamic world as the basis of military power. The Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171) of Egypt had forcibly taken adolescent male Armenians, Turks, Sudanese, and Copts from their families to be trained as slave soldiers. They formed the bulk of their military, and the rulers selected prized slaves to serve in their administration. The powerful vizier Badr al-Jamali, for example, was a Mamluk from Armenia. In Iran and Iraq, the Buyid dynasty used Turkic slaves throughout their empire. The rebel al-Basasiri was a Mamluk who eventually ushered in Seljuq dynastic rule in Baghdad after attempting a failed rebellion. When the later Abbasids regained military control over Iraq, they also relied on the Ghilman as their warriors.

Under Saladin and the Ayyubids of Egypt, the power of the Mamluks increased and they claimed the sultanate in 1250, ruling as the Mamluk Sultanate. Throughout the Islamic world, rulers continued to use enslaved warriors until the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s devşirme, or &quot;gathering&quot; of young slaves for the Janissaries, lasted until the 17th century. Regimes based on Mamluk power thrived in such Ottoman provinces as the Levant and Egypt until the 19th century.

==Organization==
Under the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo, Mamluks were purchased while still young males. They were raised in the barracks of the Citadel of Cairo. Because of their isolated social status (no social ties or political affiliations) and their austere military training, they were trusted to be loyal to their rulers. When their training was completed, they were discharged, but remained attached to the patron who had purchased them. Mamluks relied on the help of their patron for career advancement, and likewise the patron&#x27;s reputation and power depended on his recruits. A Mamluk was &quot;bound by a strong esprit de corps to his peers in the same household&quot;.

Mamluks lived within their garrisons and mainly spent their time with each other. Their entertainments included sporting events such as archery competitions and presentations of mounted combat skills at least once a week. The intensive and rigorous training of each new recruit helped ensure continuity of Mamluk practices.

Sultans owned the largest number of mamluks, but lesser &quot;amirs&quot; also owned their own troops. Many Mamluks were appointed or promoted to high positions throughout the empire, including army command. At first their status was non-hereditary. Sons of Mamluks were prevented from following their father&#x27;s role in life. However, over time, in places such as Egypt, the Mamluk forces became linked to existing power structures and gained significant amounts of influence on those powers.

==Relations with homelands and families ==
In Egypt, studies have shown that mamluks from Georgia retained their native language, were aware of the politics of the Caucasus region, and received frequent visits from their parents or other relatives. In addition, they sent gifts to family members or gave money to build useful structures (a defensive tower, or even a church) in their native villages.

==Egypt==
===Early origins in Egypt===


The practice of recruiting slaves as soldiers in the Muslim world and turning them into Mamluks began in Baghdad during the 9th century CE, and was started by the Abbasid caliph al-Muʿtaṣim.

From the 900s through the 1200s, medieval Egypt was controlled by dynastic foreign rulers, notably the Ikhshidids, Fatimids, and Ayyubids. Throughout these dynasties, thousands of Mamluk slave-soldiers and guards continued to be used and even took high offices. This increasing level of influence among the Mamluks worried the Ayyubids in particular. Eventually, a Mamluk rose to become Sultan of Egypt. The Mamluks in medieval Egypt were predominantly of White Turkic and Circassian origins, and most of them descended from enslaved Christians. After they were taken from their families, they became renegades. Because Egyptian Mamluks were enslaved Christians, Muslim rulers and clerics did not believe they were true believers of Islam despite the fact that they were deployed for fighting in wars on behalf of several Islamic kingdoms as slave-soldiers.

By 1200, Saladin&#x27;s brother al-ʿĀdil succeeded in securing control over the whole empire by defeating and killing or imprisoning his brothers and nephews in turn. With each victory, al-ʿĀdil incorporated the defeated Mamluk retinue into his own. This process was repeated at al-ʿĀdil&#x27;s death in 1218, and at his son al-Kāmil&#x27;s death in 1238. The Ayyubids became increasingly surrounded by the Mamluks, who acted semi-autonomously as regional &quot;atabegs&quot;. The Mamluks increasingly became involved in the internal court politics of the kingdom itself as various factions used them as allies.

===French attack and Mamluk takeover===
In June 1249, the Seventh Crusade under Louis IX of France landed in Egypt and took Damietta. After the Egyptian troops retreated at first, the sultan had more than 50 commanders hanged as deserters.

When the Egyptian sultan as-Salih Ayyub died, the power passed briefly to his son al-Muazzam Turanshah and then his favorite wife Shajar al-Durr, a Turk according to most historians, while others say she was an Armenian. She took control with Mamluk support and launched a counterattack against the French. Troops of the Bahri commander Baibars defeated Louis&#x27;s troops. The king delayed his retreat too long and was captured by the Mamluks in March 1250. He agreed to pay a ransom of 400,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot; to gain release (150,000 livres were never paid).

Because of political pressure for a male leader, Shajar married the Mamluk commander, Aybak. He was assassinated in his bath. In the ensuing power struggle, viceregent Qutuz, also a Mamluk, took over. He formally founded the Mamluke Sultanate and the Bahri mamluk dynasty.

The first Mamluk dynasty was named Bahri after the name of one of the regiments, the &quot;Bahriyyah&quot; or River Island regiment. Its name referred to their center on Rhoda Island in the Nile. The regiment consisted mainly of Kipchaks and Cumans.

===Relationship with the Mongols===
When the Mongol Empire&#x27;s troops of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad in 1258 and advanced towards Syria, the Mamluk emir Baibars left Damascus for Cairo. There he was welcomed by Sultan Qutuz. After taking Damascus, Hulagu demanded that Qutuz surrender Egypt. Qutuz had Hulagu&#x27;s envoys killed and, with Baibars&#x27; help, mobilized his troops.

When Möngke Khan died in action against the Southern Song, Hulagu pulled the majority of his forces out of Syria to attend the kurultai (funeral ceremony). He left his lieutenant, the Christian Kitbuqa, in charge with a token force of about 18,000 men as a garrison. The Mamluk army, led by Qutuz, drew the reduced Ilkhanate army into an ambush near the Orontes River, routed them at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, and captured and executed Kitbuqa.

After this great triumph, Qutuz was assassinated by conspiring Mamluks. It was widely said that Baibars, who seized power, had been involved in the assassination plot. In the following centuries, the Mamluks ruled discontinuously, with an average span of seven years.

The Mamluks defeated the Ilkhanids a second time in the First Battle of Homs and began to drive them back east. In the process they consolidated their power over Syria, fortified the area, and formed mail routes and diplomatic connections among the local princes. Baibars&#x27; troops attacked Acre in 1263, captured Caesarea in 1265, and took Antioch in 1268.
Mamluks also defeated new Ilkhanate attacks in Syria in 1271 and 1281 (the Second Battle of Homs). They were defeated by the Ilkhanids and their Christian allies at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299. Soon after that the Mamluks defeated the Ilkhanate again in 1303/1304 and 1312. Finally, the Ilkhanids and the Mamluks signed a treaty of peace in 1323.

===Burji dynasty===

By the late fourteenth century, the majority of the Mamluk ranks were made up of Circassians from the North Caucasus region, whose young males had been frequently captured for slavery. In 1382 the Burji dynasty took over when Barquq was proclaimed sultan. The name &quot;Burji&quot; referred to their center at the citadel of Cairo.

Barquq became an enemy of Timur, who threatened to invade Syria. Timur invaded Syria, defeating the Mamluk army, and he sacked Aleppo and captured Damascus. The Ottoman sultan, Bayezid I, then invaded Syria. After Timur&#x27;s death in 1405, the Mamluk sultan an-Nasir Faraj regained control of Syria. Frequently facing rebellions by local emirs, he was forced to abdicate in 1412. In 1421, Egypt was attacked by the Kingdom of Cyprus, but the Egyptians forced the Cypriotes to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Egyptian sultan Barsbay. During Barsbay&#x27;s reign, Egypt&#x27;s population became greatly reduced from what it had been a few centuries before; it had one-fifth the number of towns.

Al-Ashraf came to power in 1453. He had friendly relations with the Ottoman Empire, which captured Constantinople later that year, causing great rejoicings in Muslim Egypt. However, under the reign of Khushqadam, Egypt began a struggle with the Ottoman sultanate. In 1467, sultan Qaitbay offended the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II, whose brother was poisoned. Bayezid II seized Adana, Tarsus and other places within Egyptian territory, but was eventually defeated. Qaitbay also tried to help the Muslims in Spain, who were suffering after the Catholic Reconquista, by threatening the Christians in Syria, but he had little effect in Spain. He died in 1496, several hundred thousand ducats in debt to the great trading families of the Republic of Venice.

===Portuguese–Mamluk Wars===
Vasco da Gama in 1497 sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and pushed his way east across the Indian Ocean to the shores of Malabar and Kozhikode. There he attacked the fleets that carried freight and Muslim pilgrims from India to the Red Sea, and struck terror into the potentates all around. Various engagements took place. Cairo&#x27;s Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri was affronted at the attacks around the Red Sea, the loss of tolls and traffic, the indignities to which Mecca and its port were subjected, and above all for losing one of his ships. He vowed vengeance upon Portugal, first sending monks from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as envoys, he threatened Pope Julius II that if he did not check Manuel I of Portugal in his depredations on the Indian Sea, he would destroy all Christian holy places.

The rulers of Gujarat in India and Yemen also turned for help to the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. They wanted a fleet to be armed in the Red Sea that could protect their important trading sea routes from Portuguese attacks. Jeddah was soon fortified as a harbor of refuge so Arabia and the Red Sea were protected. But the fleets in the Indian Ocean were still at the mercy of the enemy.

The last Mamluk sultan, Al-Ghawri, fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels. As Mamluks had little expertise in naval warfare, he sought help from the Ottomans to develop this naval enterprise. In 1508 at the Battle of Chaul, the Mamluk fleet defeated the Portuguese viceroy&#x27;s son Lourenço de Almeida.

But, in the following year, the Portuguese won the Battle of Diu and wrested the port city of Diu from the Gujarat Sultanate. Some years after, Afonso de Albuquerque attacked Aden, and Egyptian troops suffered disaster from the Portuguese in Yemen. Al-Ghawri fitted out a new fleet to punish the enemy and protect the Indian trade. Before it could exert much power, Egypt had lost its sovereignty. The Ottoman Empire took over Egypt and the Red Sea, together with Mecca and all its Arabian interests.

===Ottomans and the end of the Mamluk Sultanate===
The Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II was engaged in warfare in southern Europe when a new era of hostility with Egypt began in 1501. It arose out of the relations with the Safavid dynasty in Persia. Shah Ismail I sent an embassy to the Republic of Venice via Syria, inviting Venice to ally with Persia and recover its territory taken by the Ottomans. Mameluk Egyptian sultan Al-Ghawri was charged by Selim I with giving the Persian envoys passage through Syria on their way to Venice and harboring refugees. To appease him, Al-Ghawri placed in confinement the Venetian merchants then in Syria and Egypt, but after a year released them.

After the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, Selim attacked the bey of Dulkadirids, as Egypt&#x27;s vassal had stood aloof, and sent his head to Al-Ghawri. Now secure against Persia, in 1516 he formed a great army for the conquest of Egypt, but gave out that he intended further attacks on Persia.

In 1515, Selim began the war which led to the conquest of Egypt and its dependencies. Mamluk cavalry proved no match for the Ottoman artillery and Janissary infantry. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, Sultan Al-Ghawri was killed. Syria passed into Turkish possession, an event welcomed in many places as it was seen as deliverance from the Mameluks.

The Mamluk Sultanate survived in Egypt until 1517, when Selim captured Cairo on 20 January. Although not in the same form as under the Sultanate, the Ottoman Empire retained the Mamluks as an Egyptian ruling class and the Mamluks and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of their influence, but as vassals of the Ottomans.

===Independence from the Ottomans===

In 1768, Ali Bey Al-Kabir declared independence from the Ottomans. However, the Ottomans crushed the movement and retained their position after his defeat. By this time new slave recruits were introduced from Georgia in the Caucasus.

====Napoleon invades====

In 1798, the ruling Directory of the Republic of France authorised a campaign in &quot;The Orient&quot; to protect French trade interests and undermine Britain&#x27;s access to India. To this end, Napoleon Bonaparte led an Armée d&#x27;Orient to Egypt.

The French defeated a Mamluk army in the Battle of the Pyramids and drove the survivors out to Upper Egypt. The Mamluks relied on massed cavalry charges, changed only by the addition of muskets. The French infantry formed square and held firm. Despite multiple victories and an initially successful expedition into Syria, mounting conflict in Europe and the earlier defeat of the supporting French fleet by the British Royal Navy at the Battle of the Nile decided the issue.

On 14 September 1799, General Jean-Baptiste Kléber established a mounted company of Mamluk auxiliaries and Syrian Janissaries from Turkish troops captured at the siege of Acre. Menou reorganized the company on 7 July 1800, forming three companies of 100 men each and renaming it the &quot;Mamluks de la République&quot;. In 1801 General Jean Rapp was sent to Marseille to organize a squadron of 250 Mamluks. On 7 January 1802 the previous order was canceled and the squadron reduced to 150 men. The list of effectives on 21 April 1802 reveals three officers and 155 of other rank. By decree of 25 December 1803 the Mamluks were organized into a company attached to the Chasseurs-à-Cheval of the Imperial Guard (see Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard).
Napoleon left with his personal guard in late 1799. His successor in Egypt, General Jean-Baptiste Kléber, was assassinated on 14 June 1800. Command of the Army in Egypt fell to Jacques-François Menou. Isolated and out of supplies, Menou surrendered to the British in 1801.

===After Napoleon===
After the departure of French troops in 1801 the Mamluks continued their struggle for independence; this time against the Ottoman Empire. In 1803, Mamluk leaders Ibrahim Bey and Osman Bey al-Bardisi wrote to the Russian consul-general, asking him to mediate with the Sultan to allow them to negotiate for a cease-fire, and a return to their homeland Georgia. The Russian ambassador in Constantinople refused however to intervene, because of nationalist unrest in Georgia that might have been encouraged by a Mamluk return.

In 1805, the population of Cairo rebelled. This provided a chance for the Mamluks to seize power, but internal friction prevented them from exploiting this opportunity. In 1806, the Mamluks defeated the Turkish forces in several clashes. in June the rival parties concluded an agreement by which Muhammad Ali, (appointed as governor of Egypt on 26 March 1806), was to be removed and authority returned to the Mamluks. However, they were again unable to capitalize on this opportunity due to discord between factions. Muhammad Ali retained his authority.

===End of power in Egypt===
Muhammad Ali knew that he would have to deal with the Mamluks if he wanted to control Egypt. They were still the feudal owners of Egypt and their land was still the source of wealth and power. However, the economic strain of sustaining the military manpower necessary to defend the Mamluks&#x27;s system from the Europeans and Turks would eventually weaken them to the point of collapse.

On 1 March 1811, Muhammad Ali invited all of the leading Mamluks to his palace to celebrate the declaration of war against the Wahhabis in Arabia. Between 600 and 700 Mamluks paraded for this purpose in Cairo. Muhammad Ali&#x27;s forces killed almost all of these near the Al-Azab gates in a narrow road down from Mukatam Hill. This ambush came to be known as the Massacre of the Citadel. According to contemporary reports, only one Mamluk, whose name is given variously as Amim (also Amyn), or Heshjukur (a Besleney), survived when he forced his horse to leap from the walls of the citadel.

During the following week an estimated 3,000 Mamluks and their relatives were killed throughout Egypt, by Muhammad&#x27;s regular troops. In the citadel of Cairo alone more than 1,000 Mamluks died.

Despite Muhammad Ali&#x27;s destruction of the Mamluks in Egypt, a party of them escaped and fled south into what is now Sudan. In 1811, these Mamluks established a state at Dunqulah in the Sennar as a base for their slave trading. In 1820, the sultan of Sennar informed Muhammad Ali that he was unable to comply with a demand to expel the Mamluks. In response, the Pasha sent 4,000 troops to invade Sudan, clear it of Mamluks, and reclaim it for Egypt. The Pasha&#x27;s forces received the submission of the Kashif, dispersed the Dunqulah Mamluks, conquered Kordofan, and accepted Sennar&#x27;s surrender from the last Funj sultan, Badi VII.

==Impact==
According to Eric Chaney and Lisa Blades, the reliance on mamluks by Muslim rulers had a profound impact on the Arab world&#x27;s political development. They argue that, because European rulers had to rely on local elites for military forces, lords and bourgeois acquired the necessary bargaining power to push for representative government. Muslim rulers did not face the same pressures partly because the Mamluks allowed the Sultans to bypass local elites.

==Other regimes==
There were various places in which Mamluks gained political or military power as a self-replicating military community. Some examples of this can be seen in the Tripolitania region of Libya, where Mamluk governors instated their various policies under the Ottoman Empire until October 18, 1912, when Italian forces took over the region in the Italo-Turkish War.

===South Asia===
====India====

In 1206, the Mamluk commander of the Muslim forces in the Indian subcontinent, Qutb al-Din Aibak, proclaimed himself Sultan, creating the Mamluk Sultanate in Delhi which lasted until 1290.
===West Asia===
====Iraq====

Mamluk corps were first introduced in Iraq by Hassan Pasha of Baghdad in 1702. From 1747 to 1831 Iraq was ruled, with short intermissions, by Mamluk officers of Georgian origin who succeeded in asserting autonomy from the Sublime Porte, suppressed tribal revolts, curbed the power of the Janissaries, restored order, and introduced a program of modernization of the economy and the military. In 1831 the Ottomans overthrew Dawud Pasha, the last Mamluk ruler, and imposed direct control over Iraq.

<text>William of Wykeham (; 1320 or 1324 – 27 September 1404) was Bishop of Winchester and Chancellor of England. He founded New College, Oxford, and New College School in 1379, and founded Winchester College in 1382. He was also the clerk of works when much of Windsor Castle was built.

==Early life==

William of Wykeham (born William Longe) was the son of John Longe, a freeman from Wickham in Hampshire. He was educated at a school in Winchester, and probably enjoyed early patronage from two local men, Sir Ralph Sutton, constable of Winchester Castle, and Sir John Scures, lord of the manor of Wickham, and then from Thomas Foxley, Constable of Windsor Castle. In 1349, Wykeham was described as a chaplain when he was appointed rector of Irstead in Norfolk, a position which was in the gift of the Crown.

==Builder==
William became secretary to the constable of Winchester Castle and in that capacity learned about building. This led to architectural work for King Edward III, for whom he reconstructed Windsor Castle whilst residing at Bear&#x27;s Rails in Old Windsor.

William developed a reputation for the administration and supervision of royal building works during the reign of Edward III. By May 1356, he was clerk of the works for houses being built for the Crown at Henley on the Heath in Surrey and Easthampstead in Berkshire, and he was appointed surveyor of the long-running works to develop Windsor Castle in October 1356. He rapidly rose in royal service, and in July 1359 he was appointed chief keeper and surveyor of Windsor Castle, Leeds Castle, Dover Castle, and Hadleigh Castle, and many royal manors, including Sheen, Eltham and Langley, effectively in the office later called clerk of the king&#x27;s works. He also took charge of the building works at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.

==State administrator under Edward III==

William&#x27;s career took a turn by 1361, when he became a royal secretary, part of the administration of the royal finances, and by 1363 he was a royal councillor. He was present when the Treaty of Brétigny was agreed in Calais in 1360. In January 1361, Edward III and John II of France jointly to petitioned Pope Innocent VI, to make William a canon at Lincoln Cathedral. He was appointed Justice in Eyre south of the Trent along with Peter Atte Wode in 1361, a position he held until about 1367. William was ordained in 1362 and paid for his services by being given the incomes of various churches. For instance, in April 1363, Edward III presented him to the archdeaconry of Lincoln, a move that was approved by Pope Urban V in November 1363 only after representations from Sir Nicholas de Loveyne, the king&#x27;s ambassador to the papal court. By 1366, William held two benefices and eleven prebends, with an annual income exceeding £800.

William had shown considerable talent as an administrator and in June 1363 was appointed Lord Privy Seal and then in October 1366 he was elected Bishop of Winchester, Pope Urban V approved his appointment in July 1367, and he was consecrated at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London on 10 October 1367 and enthroned at Winchester Cathedral in July 1368. In 1367 he was appointed Chancellor of England. He struggled to find the funds necessary to pay the army fighting against France after conflict resumed in 1369. He lost the favour of the king, who turned to William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and he resigned as Chancellor in 1371.

As Edward III aged and weakened, William maintained good relationships with Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, John of Gaunt and Edward, the Black Prince. He remained politically important, and was one of four bishops appointed to the new royal council in May 1376 after Latimer was impeached during the Good Parliament. His friendship with the Earl of March led to a long conflict with John of Gaunt, who supported Latimer. Latimer was pardoned by king in October 1376, and William found himself charged with financial irregularities and mismanagement towards the end of the year. He was banished from court and the income from his church properties was seized in late 1376, but he was pardoned by the new king Richard II in July 1377, weeks after Edward III died. (Richard was the son of Edward, the Black Prince, who had died in June 1376, a year before his father.)

==Richard II==

Under Richard II, William resumed his position as a royal councillor. Although he took the side of the Lords Appellant in their disputes with the king in 1388, he also managed to maintain good relations with the king, and served as Chancellor again from May 1389 to September 1391.

After years of supporting poor scholars at Oxford University, he founded New College, which was granted a royal charter in 1379. He also founded a school, Winchester College, to supply New College with students, obtaining a papal bull in 1378 and a royal licence in 1382. Construction work began in Oxford in 1380, and in Winchester in 1387, under the architect William Wynford. At both colleges, William stipulated daily prayers for Richard II and his queen, William and his parents, and his former patrons, Sir Ralph Sutton, Sir John Scures, and Thomas Foxley. The funds to endow the colleges, and pay for the building works, came from William&#x27;s lucrative church positions, discounting of exchequer tallies (that is, speculation on tax revenues due to the king), exporting wool, and using his influence to obtain papal approval for the acquisition of the income of the &quot;alien priories&quot; that belonged to monasteries in France, which were confiscated by the crown during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He also started the rebuilding of the nave of Winchester Cathedral in 1394.

William was concentrating on his foundation by the time Henry IV deposed Richard II in 1399, but he welcomed the new king in Winchester in 1400.

==Death and legacy==
William died at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in Hampshire on 27 September 1404 and was buried in his chantry chapel on the south side of the nave in Winchester Cathedral. At the time of his death, he was one of the richest men in England. Much of his wealth went into the schools he patronised, but he also contrived to leave a fortune to a nephew, whose descendants include the Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes family and the Longe family.

William&#x27;s motto was &#x27;Manners makyth man&#x27;. This, along with a coat of arms, was assumed by him and not acquired by descent. His biography was written by Bishop Lowth. He was also written about by Lord Brougham in his &#x27;Old England&#x27;s Worthies&#x27; (1857) and by Froissart. &#x27;Manners Makyth Man&#x27; is also the motto of the establishments Wykeham founded, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.

<text>The Transmeta Crusoe is a family of x86-compatible microprocessors developed by Transmeta and introduced in 2000.

Instead of the instruction set architecture being implemented in hardware, or translated by specialized hardware, the Crusoe runs a software abstraction layer, or a virtual machine, known as the Code Morphing Software (CMS). The CMS translates machine code instructions received from programs into native instructions for the microprocessor. In this way, the Crusoe can emulate other instruction set architectures (ISAs). This is used to allow the microprocessors to emulate the Intel x86 instruction set.

== Design ==

The Crusoe is notable for its method of achieving x86 compatibility. Instead of the instruction set architecture being implemented in hardware, or translated by specialized hardware, the Crusoe runs a software abstraction layer, or a virtual machine, known as the Code Morphing Software (CMS). The CMS translates machine code instructions received from programs into native instructions for the microprocessor. In this way, the Crusoe can emulate other instruction set architectures (ISAs). This is used to allow the microprocessors to emulate the Intel x86 instruction set. In theory, it is possible for the CMS to be modified to emulate other ISAs. Transmeta demonstrated Crusoe executing Java bytecode by translating the bytecodes into instructions in its native instruction set. The addition of an abstraction layer between the x86 instruction stream and the hardware means that the hardware architecture can change without breaking compatibility, just by modifying the CMS. For example, Transmeta Efficeon — a second-generation Transmeta design — has a 256-bit-wide VLIW core versus the 128-bit core of the Crusoe. Efficeon also supports SSE instructions.

The Crusoe is a VLIW microprocessor that executes bundles of instructions, termed &quot;molecules&quot; by Transmeta. Each &quot;molecule&quot; contains multiple instructions, termed &quot;atoms&quot;. The Code Morphing Software translates x86 instructions into native instructions. The native instructions are 32 bits long. Instructions that meet a set of conditions can be executed simultaneously and are combined to form a 64- or 128-bit &quot;molecule&quot; containing two or four &quot;atoms&quot;, respectively. In the event that there are not enough instructions to fill a molecule, the software inserts NOPs as padding to fill out empty slots. This is required in all VLIW architectures and is criticised for being inefficient, which is why there are &quot;molecules&quot; of two separate lengths.

The Crusoe performs in software some of the functionality traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. instruction re-ordering), resulting in simpler hardware with fewer transistors. The relative simplicity of the hardware means that Crusoe consumes less power (and therefore generates less heat) than other x86-compatible microprocessors running at the same frequency. A 700 MHz Crusoe ran x86 programs at the speed of a 500 MHz Pentium III x86 processor, although the Crusoe processor was smaller and cheaper than the corresponding Intel processor.

The Crusoe was initially available in two forms: the TM3120 (later called TM3200) for embedded applications and the TM5400 for low-power personal computing. Both were based on the same architecture but differed in clock frequency and peripheral support. The TM3120/TM3200 were manufactured in speeds of 333(TM3120 only) 366 and, 400 MHz using a 220 nm process. It has a 96k L1 cache (64 KB instruction and 32 KB data) and no L2 cache. The TM3120/TM3200 has an integrated SDRAM memory controller and a PCI interface. It measures 77 mm2 and uses a 1.5 V power supply, dissipating less than 1.5 W of power (typically). The TM5400 differs from the TM3120/TM3200 with the inclusion of a 128K of L1 Cache(with the addition of 32 KB data cache) as well as the addition of DDR memory support, 256 KB unified L2 cache and LongRun power reduction technology manufactured using a smaller 180 nm process. It measures 73 mm2 and uses a 1.10 V (f = 25%) and 1.6 V (f = 100%) power supply, dissipating 0.5–1.5 W typically and a maximum of 6 W. Later the TM5600 was introduced as a higher end offering to the TM5400 with double the L2 cache (512 KB vs 256 KB). Both the TM5400 and TM5600 operated at clock frequencies of 500–700 MHz.

The TM5500/TM5800 are die shrunk versions of the TM5400/5600 Built on a TSMC 130 nm process at clock frequencies of 667-1000 MHz. Embedded versions rated for 10 years of continuous use were marketed as Crusoe SE (for Special Embedded) TM55E/TM58E respectively at clock frequencies of 667-993 MHz.

The TM5700/TM5900 removes SDRAM support for its integrated memory controller and now comes in a 54% smaller 399 pin FC-OBGA package rather than the ceramic 479 BGA package used previously. Clock speed remains the same between 667 and 1000 MHz.

== Production ==
Transmeta was a fabless semiconductor company, without the facilities to fabricate their designs. Instead, both processors were fabricated by IBM Microelectronics, the semiconductor business of International Business Machines (IBM). IBM fabricated the Crusoe in a 0.18 μm CMOS process with five levels of copper interconnect.

== Software limitations ==
The Crusoe processor supports MMX but not SSE. As of 2022, most browsers on Windows and Linux, and some other programs, need SSE or SSE2 support; therefore, that software will no longer run on the Crusoe platform. For example, Firefox dropped support for systems without SSE2 in 2017, although K-Meleon could run without SSE on Windows XP. The Efficeon processor added support for SSE and SSE2.

<text>Illbient is a genre of electronic music and an art movement that originated among hip hop-influenced experimental musicians from New York City in the early 1990s. The word &quot;illbient&quot; combines the hip hop slang term &quot;ill&quot; and &quot;ambient&quot;; DJ Olive and DJ Spooky, pioneers of the genre, have claimed to have coined the term.

Though there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by dub- and industrial-influenced layering of beats and soundscapes, hip hop-influenced use of breaks and samples, and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses many forms of world music and electronic music.

Besides DJ Olive and DJ Spooky, other notable names and acts that were part of the original illbient scene included Raz Mesinai, We™, Byzar, Spectre and the artists that were released on his &quot;WordSound&quot; label around that time. Subsequent illbient artists have included Techno Animal, Sixtoo and Odd Nosdam.

<doc id="172640" wikidata="Q1326388" url="?curid=172640" title="Iterator">
<text>In computer programming, an iterator is an object that progressively provides access to each item of a collection, in order. 

A collection may provide multiple iterators via its interface that provide items in different orders, such as forwards and backwards.

An iterator is often implemented in terms of the structure underlying a collection implementation and is often tightly coupled to the collection to enable the operational semantics of the iterator.

An iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor. 

Iterators date to the CLU programming language in 1974.

==Pattern==
An iterator provides access to an element of a collection (&quot;element access&quot;) and can change its internal state to provide access to the next element (&quot;element traversal&quot;). It also provides for creation and initialization to a first element and indicates whether all elements have been traversed. In some programming contexts, an iterator provides additional functionality.

An iterator allows a consumer to process each element of a collection while isolating the consumer from the internal structure of the collection. The collection can store elements in any manner while the consumer can access them as a sequence.

In object-oriented programming, an iterator class is usually designed in tight coordination with the corresponding collection class. Usually, the collection provides the methods for creating iterators.

A loop counter is sometimes also referred to as a loop iterator. A loop counter, however, only provides the traversal functionality and not the element access functionality.

==Generator==
One way of implementing an iterator is via a restricted form of coroutine, known as a generator. By contrast with a subroutine, a generator coroutine can &quot;yield&quot; values to its caller multiple times, instead of returning just once. Most iterators are naturally expressible as generators, but because generators preserve their local state between invocations, they&#x27;re particularly well-suited for complicated, stateful iterators, such as tree traversers. There are subtle differences and distinctions in the use of the terms &quot;generator&quot; and &quot;iterator&quot;, which vary between authors and languages. In Python, a generator is an iterator constructor: a function that returns an iterator. An example of a Python generator returning an iterator for the Fibonacci numbers using Python&#x27;s codice_1 statement follows:

def fibonacci(limit):
 a, b = 0, 1
 for _ in range(limit):
 yield a
 a, b = b, a + b

for number in fibonacci(100): # The generator constructs an iterator
 print(number)
==Internal iterator==

An internal iterator is a higher-order function (often taking anonymous functions) that traverses a collection while applying a function to each element. For example, Python&#x27;s codice_2 function applies a caller-defined function to each element:
digits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

squared_digits = map(lambda x: x**2, digits)
# Iterating over this iterator would result in 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 81.
==Implicit iterator==

Some object-oriented languages such as C#, C++ (later versions), Delphi (later versions), Go, Java (later versions), Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby provide an intrinsic way of iterating through the elements of a collection without an explicit iterator. An iterator object may exist, but is not represented in the source code.

An implicit iterator is often manifest in language syntax as codice_3.

In Python, a collection object can be iterated directly:
for value in iterable:
 print(value)
In Ruby, iteration requires accessing an iterator property:
iterable.each do |value|
 puts value
end
This iteration style is sometimes called &quot;internal iteration&quot; because its code fully executes within the context of the iterable object (that controls all aspects of iteration), and the programmer only provides the operation to execute at each step (using an anonymous function).

Languages that support list comprehensions or similar constructs may also make use of implicit iterators during the construction of the result list, as in Python:
names = [person.name for person in roster if person.male]
Sometimes the implicit hidden nature is only partial. The C++ language has a few function templates for implicit iteration, such as codice_4. These functions still require explicit iterator objects as their initial input, but the subsequent iteration does not expose an iterator object to the user.

==Stream==
Iterators are a useful abstraction of input streams – they provide a potentially infinite iterable (but not necessarily indexable) object. Several languages, such as Perl and Python, implement streams as iterators. In Python, iterators are objects representing streams of data. Alternative implementations of stream include data-driven languages, such as AWK and sed.

==Contrast with indexing==

Instead of using an iterator, many languages allow the use of a subscript operator and a loop counter to access each element. Although indexing may be used with collections, the use of iterators may have advantages such as:

* Counting loops are not suitable to all data structures, in particular to data structures with no or slow random access, like lists or trees.
* Iterators can provide a consistent way to iterate on data structures of all kinds, and therefore make the code more readable, reusable, and less sensitive to a change in the data structure.
* An iterator can enforce additional restrictions on access, such as ensuring that elements cannot be skipped or that a previously visited element cannot be accessed a second time.
* An iterator may allow the collection object to be modified without invalidating the iterator. For instance, once an iterator has advanced beyond the first element it may be possible to insert additional elements into the beginning of the collection with predictable results. With indexing this is problematic since the index numbers must change.

The ability of a collection to be modified while iterating through its elements has become necessary in modern object-oriented programming, where the interrelationships between objects and the effects of operations may not be obvious. By using an iterator one is isolated from these sorts of consequences. This assertion must however be taken with a grain of salt, because more often than not, for efficiency reasons, the iterator implementation is so tightly bound to the collection that it does preclude modification of the underlying collection without invalidating itself.

For collections that may move around their data in memory, the only way to not invalidate the iterator is, for the collection, to somehow keep track of all the currently alive iterators and update them on the fly. Since the number of iterators at a given time may be arbitrarily large in comparison to the size of the tied collection, updating them all will drastically impair the complexity guarantee on the collection&#x27;s operations.

An alternative way to keep the number of updates bound relatively to the collection size would be to use a kind of handle mechanism, that is a collection of indirect pointers to the collection&#x27;s elements that must be updated with the collection, and let the iterators point to these handles instead of directly to the data elements. But this approach will negatively impact the iterator performance, since it must effectuate a double pointer following to access the actual data element. This is usually not desirable, because many algorithms using the iterators invoke the iterators data access operation more often than the advance method. It is therefore especially important to have iterators with very efficient data access.

All in all, this is always a trade-off between security (iterators remain always valid) and efficiency. Most of the time, the added security is not worth the efficiency price to pay for it. Using an alternative collection (for example a singly linked list instead of a vector) would be a better choice (globally more efficient) if the stability of the iterators is needed.

===Classification===

====Categories====

Iterators can be categorised according to their functionality. Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of iterator categories:

====Types====
Different languages or libraries used with these languages define iterator types. Some of them are

==In different programming languages==
===.NET===
Iterators in the .NET Framework (i.e. C#) are called &quot;enumerators&quot; and represented by the codice_5 interface.codice_5 provides a codice_7 method, which advances to the next element and indicates whether the end of the collection has been reached; a codice_8 property, to obtain the value of the element currently being pointed at. and an optional codice_9 method, to rewind the enumerator back to its initial position. The enumerator initially points to a special value before the first element, so a call to codice_7 is required to begin iterating.

Enumerators are typically obtained by calling the codice_11 method of an object implementing the codice_12 interface. a codice_8 property, to obtain the value of the element currently being pointed at;Container classes typically implement this interface. However, the foreach statement in C# can operate on any object providing such a method, even if it does not implement codice_12 (duck typing). Both interfaces were expanded into generic versions in .NET 2.0.

The following shows a simple use of iterators in C# 2.0:
// explicit version
IEnumerator&lt;MyType&gt; iter = list.GetEnumerator();
while (iter.MoveNext())
 Console.WriteLine(iter.Current);

// implicit version
foreach (MyType value in list)
 Console.WriteLine(value);
C# 2.0 also supports generators: a method that is declared as returning codice_5 (or codice_12), but uses the &quot;codice_17&quot; statement to produce a sequence of elements instead of returning an object instance, will be transformed by the compiler into a new class implementing the appropriate interface.

===C++===
The C++ language makes wide use of iterators in its Standard Library and describes several categories of iterators differing in the repertoire of operations they allow. These include &quot;forward iterators&quot;, &quot;bidirectional iterators&quot;, and &quot;random access iterators&quot;, in order of increasing possibilities. All of the standard container template types provide iterators of one of these categories. Iterators generalize pointers to elements of an array (which indeed can be used as iterators), and their syntax is designed to resemble that of C pointer arithmetic, where the codice_18 and codice_19 operators are used to reference the element to which the iterator points and pointer arithmetic operators like codice_20 are used to modify iterators in the traversal of a container.

Traversal using iterators usually involves a single varying iterator, and two fixed iterators that serve to delimit a range to be traversed. The distance between the limiting iterators, in terms of the number of applications of the operator codice_20 needed to transform the lower limit into the upper one, equals the number of items in the designated range; the number of distinct iterator values involved is one more than that. By convention, the lower limiting iterator &quot;points to&quot; the first element in the range, while the upper limiting iterator does not point to any element in the range, but rather just beyond the end of the range.
For traversal of an entire container, the codice_22 method provides the lower limit, and codice_23 the upper limit. The latter does not reference any element of the container at all but is a valid iterator value that can be compared against.

The following example shows a typical use of an iterator.
std::vector&lt;int&gt; items;
items.push_back(5); // Append integer value &#x27;5&#x27; to vector &#x27;items&#x27;.
items.push_back(2); // Append integer value &#x27;2&#x27; to vector &#x27;items&#x27;.
items.push_back(9); // Append integer value &#x27;9&#x27; to vector &#x27;items&#x27;.

for (auto it = items.begin(), end = items.end(); it != end; ++it) { // Iterate through &#x27;items&#x27;.
 std::cout « *it; // And print value of &#x27;items&#x27; for current index.
// In C++11, the same can be done without using any iterators:
for (auto x : items) {
 std::cout « x; // Print value of each element &#x27;x&#x27; of &#x27;items&#x27;.

// Both of the for loops print &quot;529&quot;.
Iterator types are separate from the container types they are used with, though the two are often used in concert. The category of the iterator (and thus the operations defined for it) usually depends on the type of container, with for instance arrays or vectors providing random access iterators, but sets (which use a linked structure as implementation) only providing bidirectional iterators. One same container type can have more than one associated iterator type; for instance the codice_24 container type allows traversal either using (raw) pointers to its elements (of type codice_25), or values of a special type codice_26, and yet another type is provided for &quot;reverse iterators&quot;, whose operations are defined in such a way that an algorithm performing a usual (forward) traversal will actually do traversal in reverse order when called with reverse iterators. Most containers also provide a separate codice_27 type, for which operations that would allow changing the values pointed to are intentionally not defined.

Simple traversal of a container object or a range of its elements (including modification of those elements unless a codice_27 is used) can be done using iterators alone. But container types may also provide methods like codice_29 or codice_30 that modify the structure of the container itself; these are methods of the container class, but in addition require one or more iterator values to specify the desired operation. While it is possible to have multiple iterators pointing into the same container simultaneously, structure-modifying operations may invalidate certain iterator values (the standard specifies for each case whether this may be so); using an invalidated iterator is an error that will lead to undefined behavior, and such errors need not be signaled by the run time system.

Implicit iteration is also partially supported by C++ through the use of standard function templates, such as codice_31,
codice_32
and
codice_33.

When used they must be initialized with existing iterators, usually codice_34 and codice_35, that define the range over which iteration occurs. But no explicit iterator object is subsequently exposed as the iteration proceeds. This example shows the use of codice_36.
ContainerType&lt;ItemType&gt; c; // Any standard container type of ItemType elements.

void ProcessItem(const ItemType&amp; i) { // Function that will process each item of the collection.
 std::cout « i « std::endl;

std::for_each(c.begin(), c.end(), ProcessItem); // A for-each iteration loop.
The same can be achieved using codice_37, passing a codice_38 value as third iterator:
std::copy(c.begin(), c.end(), std::ostream_iterator&lt;ItemType&gt;(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;));

Since C++11, lambda function syntax can be used to specify to operation to be iterated inline, avoiding the need to define a named function. Here is an example of for-each iteration using a lambda function:
ContainerType&lt;ItemType&gt; c; // Any standard container type of ItemType elements.

// A for-each iteration loop with a lambda function.
std::for_each(c.begin(), c.end(), [](const ItemType&amp; i) { std::cout « i « std::endl; });
===Java===
Introduced in the Java JDK 1.2 release, the interface allows the iteration of container classes. Each codice_39 provides a and method, and may optionally support a method. Iterators are created by the corresponding container class, typically by a method named codice_40.

The codice_41 method advances the iterator and returns the value pointed to by the iterator. The first element is obtained upon the first call to codice_41. To determine when all the elements in the container have been visited the codice_43 test method is used. The following example shows a simple use of iterators:
Iterator iter = list.iterator();
// Iterator&lt;MyType&gt; iter = list.iterator(); // in J2SE 5.0
while (iter.hasNext()) {
 System.out.print(iter.next());
 if (iter.hasNext())
 System.out.print(&quot;, &quot;);


To show that codice_43 can be called repeatedly, we use it to insert commas between the elements but not after the last element.

This approach does not properly separate the advance operation from the actual data access. If the data element must be used more than once for each advance, it needs to be stored in a temporary variable. When an advance is needed without data access (i.e. to skip a given data element), the access is nonetheless performed, though the returned value is ignored in this case.

For collection types that support it, the codice_45 method of the iterator removes the most recently visited element from the container while keeping the iterator usable. Adding or removing elements by calling the methods of the container (also from the same thread) makes the iterator unusable. An attempt to get the next element throws the exception. An exception is also thrown if there are no more elements remaining (codice_43 has previously returned false).

Additionally, for there is a with a similar API but that allows forward and backward iteration, provides its current index in the list and allows setting of the list element at its position.

The J2SE 5.0 release of Java introduced the interface to support an enhanced codice_47 (foreach) loop for iterating over collections and arrays. codice_48 defines the method that returns an codice_39. Using the enhanced codice_47 loop, the preceding example can be rewritten as
for (MyType obj : list) {
 System.out.print(obj);


Some containers also use the older (since 1.0) codice_51 class. It provides codice_52 and codice_53 methods but has no methods to modify the container.

=== Scala ===
In Scala, iterators have a rich set of methods similar to collections, and can be used directly in for loops. Indeed, both iterators and collections inherit from a common base trait - codice_54. However, because of the rich set of methods available in the Scala collections library, such as codice_2, codice_56, codice_57 etc., it is often not necessary to deal with iterators directly when programming in Scala.

Java iterators and collections can be automatically converted into Scala iterators and collections, respectively, simply by adding the single line
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._
to the file. The codice_58 object provides implicit conversions to do this. Implicit conversions are a feature of Scala: methods that, when visible in the current scope, automatically insert calls to themselves into relevant expressions at the appropriate place to make them typecheck when they otherwise would not.

=== MATLAB ===
MATLAB supports both external and internal implicit iteration using either &quot;native&quot; arrays or codice_59 arrays. In the case of external iteration where the onus is on the user to advance the traversal and request next elements, one can define a set of elements within an array storage structure and traverse the elements using the codice_47-loop construct. For example,
% Define an array of integers
myArray = [1,3,5,7,11,13];

for n = myArray
 % ... do something with n
 disp(n) % Echo integer to Command Window
end
traverses an array of integers using the codice_47 keyword.

In the case of internal iteration where the user can supply an operation to the iterator to perform over every element of a collection, many built-in operators and MATLAB functions are overloaded to execute over every element of an array and return a corresponding output array implicitly. Furthermore, the codice_62 and codice_63 functions can be leveraged for performing custom or user defined operations over &quot;native&quot; arrays and codice_59 arrays respectively. For example,
function simpleFun
% Define an array of integers
myArray = [1,3,5,7,11,13];

% Perform a custom operation over each element 
myNewArray = arrayfun(@(a)myCustomFun(a),myArray);

% Echo resulting array to Command Window
myNewArray

function outScalar = myCustomFun(inScalar)
% Simply multiply by 2
outScalar = 2*inScalar;
defines a primary function codice_65 that implicitly applies custom subfunction codice_66 to each element of an array using built-in function codice_62.

Alternatively, it may be desirable to abstract the mechanisms of the array storage container from the user by defining a custom object-oriented MATLAB implementation of the Iterator Pattern. Such an implementation supporting external iteration is demonstrated in MATLAB Central File Exchange item Design Pattern: Iterator (Behavioral). This is written in the new class-definition syntax introduced with MATLAB software version 7.6 (R2008a) and features a one-dimensional codice_59 array realization of the List Abstract Data Type (ADT) as the mechanism for storing a heterogeneous (in data type) set of elements. It provides the functionality for explicit forward List traversal with the codice_43, codice_41 and codice_71 methods for use in a codice_72-loop.

=== PHP ===

PHP&#x27;s codice_73 loop was introduced in version 4.0 and made compatible with objects as values in 4.0 Beta 4. However, support for iterators was added in PHP 5 through the introduction of the internal codice_74 interface. The two main interfaces for implementation in PHP scripts that enable objects to be iterated via the codice_73 loop are codice_39 and codice_77. The latter does not require the implementing class to declare all required methods, instead it implements an accessor method (codice_78) that returns an instance of codice_74. The Standard PHP Library provides several classes to work with special iterators. PHP also supports Generators since 5.5.

The simplest implementation is by wrapping an array, this can be useful for type hinting and information hiding.
namespace Wikipedia\Iterator;

final class ArrayIterator extends \Iterator
 private array $array;

 public function __construct(array $array)
 $this-&gt;array = $array;

 public function rewind(): void
 echo &#x27;rewinding&#x27; , PHP_EOL;
 reset($this-&gt;array);

 public function current()
 $value = current($this-&gt;array);
 echo &quot;current: {$value}&quot;, PHP_EOL;
 return $value;

 public function key()
 $key = key($this-&gt;array);
 echo &quot;key: {$key}&quot;, PHP_EOL;
 return $key;

 public function next()
 $value = next($this-&gt;array);
 echo &quot;next: {$value}&quot;, PHP_EOL;
 return $value;

 public function valid(): bool
 $valid = $this-&gt;current() !== false;
 echo &#x27;valid: &#x27;, ($valid ? &#x27;true&#x27; : &#x27;false&#x27;), PHP_EOL;
 return $valid;
}
All methods of the example class are used during the execution of a complete foreach loop (codice_80). The iterator&#x27;s methods are executed in the following order:
# codice_81 ensures that the internal structure starts from the beginning.
# codice_82 returns &quot;true&quot; in this example.
# codice_83 returned value is stored in codice_84.
# codice_85 returned value is stored in codice_86.
# codice_87 advances to the next element in the internal structure.
# codice_82 returns &quot;false&quot; and the loop is aborted.

The next example illustrates a PHP class that implements the codice_74 interface, which could be wrapped in an codice_90 class to act upon the data before it is returned to the codice_73 loop. The usage together with the codice_92 constant allows PHP scripts to iterate result sets with billions of rows with very little memory usage. These features are not exclusive to PHP nor to its MySQL class implementations (e.g. the codice_93 class implements the codice_74 interface as well).
mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);
$mysqli = new \mysqli(&#x27;host.example.com&#x27;, &#x27;username&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;database_name&#x27;);

// The \mysqli_result class that is returned by the method call implements the internal Traversable interface.
foreach ($mysqli-&gt;query(&#x27;SELECT `a`, `b`, `c` FROM `table`&#x27;, MYSQLI_USE_RESULT) as $row) {
 // Act on the returned row, which is an associative array.


===Python===

Iterators in Python are a fundamental part of the language and in many cases go unseen as they are implicitly used in the codice_47 (foreach) statement, in list comprehensions, and in generator expressions. All of Python&#x27;s standard built-in collection types support iteration, as well as many classes that are part of the standard library. The following example shows typical implicit iteration over a sequence:
for value in sequence:
 print(value)
Python dictionaries (a form of associative array) can also be directly iterated over, when the dictionary keys are returned; or the codice_96 method of a dictionary can be iterated over where it yields corresponding key,value pairs as a tuple:
for key in dictionary:
 value = dictionary[key]
 print(key, value)

for key, value in dictionary.items():
 print(key, value)
Iterators however can be used and defined explicitly. For any iterable sequence type or class, the built-in function codice_97 is used to create an iterator object. The iterator object can then be iterated with the codice_41 function, which uses the codice_99 method internally, which returns the next element in the container. (The previous statement applies to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x, the codice_41 method is equivalent.) A codice_101 exception will be raised when no more elements are left. The following example shows an equivalent iteration over a sequence using explicit iterators:
it = iter(sequence)
while True:
 try:
 value = it.next() # in Python 2.x
 value = next(it) # in Python 3.x
 except StopIteration:
 break
 print(value)
Any user-defined class can support standard iteration (either implicit or explicit) by defining an codice_102 method that returns an iterator object. The iterator object then needs to define a codice_99 method that returns the next element.

Python&#x27;s generators implement this iteration protocol.

===Raku===

Iterators in Raku are a fundamental part of the language, although usually users do not have to care about iterators. Their usage is hidden behind iteration APIs such as the codice_47 statement, codice_2, codice_106, list indexing with codice_107, etc.

The following example shows typical implicit iteration over a collection of values:
my @values = 1, 2, 3;
for @values -&gt; $value {
 say $value
# OUTPUT:
# 1
# 2
# 3
Raku hashes can also be directly iterated over; this yields key-value codice_108 objects. The codice_109 method can be invoked on the hash to iterate over the key and values; the codice_110 method to iterate over the hash&#x27;s keys; and the codice_111 method to iterate over the hash&#x27;s values.
my %word-to-number = &#x27;one&#x27; =&gt; 1, &#x27;two&#x27; =&gt; 2, &#x27;three&#x27; =&gt; 3;
for %word-to-number -&gt; $pair {
 say $pair;
# OUTPUT:
# three =&gt; 3
# one =&gt; 1
# two =&gt; 2

for %word-to-number.kv -&gt; $key, $value {
 say &quot;$key: $value&quot; 
# OUTPUT:
# three: 3
# one: 1
# two: 2

for %word-to-number.keys -&gt; $key {
 say &quot;$key =&gt; &quot; ~ %word-to-number{$key};
# OUTPUT:
# three =&gt; 3
# one =&gt; 1
# two =&gt; 2
Iterators however can be used and defined explicitly. For any iterable type, there are several methods that control different aspects of the iteration process. For example, the codice_112 method is supposed to return an codice_39 object, and the codice_114 method is supposed to produce and return the next value if possible, or return the sentinel value codice_115 if no more values could be produced. The following example shows an equivalent iteration over a collection using explicit iterators:
my @values = 1, 2, 3;
my $it := @values.iterator; # grab iterator for @values

loop {
 my $value := $it.pull-one; # grab iteration&#x27;s next value
 last if $value =:= IterationEnd; # stop if we reached iteration&#x27;s end
 say $value;
# OUTPUT:
# 1
# 2
# 3
All iterable types in Raku compose the codice_48 role, codice_39 role, or both. The codice_48 is quite simple and only requires the codice_112 to be implemented by the composing class. The codice_39 is more complex and provides a series of methods such as codice_114, which allows for a finer operation of iteration in several contexts such as adding or eliminating items, or skipping over them to access other items. Thus, any user-defined class can support standard iteration by composing these roles and implementing the codice_112 and/or codice_114 methods.

The codice_124 class represents a DNA strand and implements the codice_112 by composing the codice_48 role. The DNA strand is split into a group of trinucleotides when iterated over:
subset Strand of Str where { .match(/^^ &lt;[ACGT]&gt;+ $$/) and .chars %% 3 };
class DNA does Iterable {
 has $.chain;
 method new(Strand:D $chain) {
 self.bless: :$chain
 
 method iterator(DNA:D:){ $.chain.comb.rotor(3).iterator }

for DNA.new(&#x27;GATTACATA&#x27;) {
 .say
# OUTPUT:
# (G A T)
# (T A C)
# (A T A)

say DNA.new(&#x27;GATTACATA&#x27;).map(*.join).join(&#x27;-&#x27;);
# OUTPUT:
# GAT-TAC-ATA
The codice_127 class composes both the codice_48 and codice_39 roles:
class Repeater does Iterable does Iterator {
 has Any $.item is required;
 has Int $.times is required;
 has Int $!count = 1;
 multi method new($item, $times) {
 self.bless: :$item, :$times;
 
 method iterator { self }
 method pull-one(--&gt; Mu){ 
 if $!count &lt;= $!times {
 $!count += 1;
 return $!item
 else {
 return IterationEnd
 }

for Repeater.new(&quot;Hello&quot;, 3) {
 .say

# OUTPUT:
# Hello
# Hello
# Hello
===Ruby===
Ruby implements iterators quite differently; all iterations are done by means of passing callback closures to container methods - this way Ruby not only implements basic iteration but also several patterns of iteration like function mapping, filters and reducing. Ruby also supports an alternative syntax for the basic iterating method codice_130, the following three examples are equivalent:
(0...42).each do |n|
 puts n
end
...and...
for n in 0...42
 puts n
end
or even shorter
42.times do |n|
 puts n
end
Ruby can also iterate over fixed lists by using codice_131s and either calling their codice_132 method or doing a for each on them, as above.

===Rust===
Rust makes use of external iterators throughout the standard library, including in its codice_47 loop, which implicitly calls the codice_41 method of an iterator until it is consumed. The most basic codice_47 loop for example iterates over a codice_136 type:
for i in 0..42 {
 println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
// Prints the numbers 0 to 41
Specifically, the codice_47 loop will call a value&#x27;s codice_138 method, which returns an iterator that in turn yields the elements to the loop. The codice_47 loop (or indeed, any method that consumes the iterator), proceeds until the codice_41 method returns a codice_141 value (iterations yielding elements return a codice_142 value, where codice_143 is the element type).

All collections provided by the standard library implement the codice_144 trait (meaning they define the codice_138 method). Iterators themselves implement the codice_39 trait, which requires defining the codice_41 method. Furthermore, any type implementing codice_39 is automatically provided an implementation for codice_144 that returns itself.

Iterators support various adapters (codice_150, codice_151, codice_152, codice_153, etc.) as methods provided automatically by the codice_39 trait.

Users can create custom iterators by creating a type implementing the codice_39 trait. Custom collections can implement the codice_144 trait and return an associated iterator type for their elements, enabling their use directly in codice_47 loops. Below, the codice_158 type implements a custom, unbounded iterator:

struct Fibonacci(u64, u64);

impl Fibonacci {
 pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
 Self(0, 1)
}

impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
 type Item = u64;

 fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
 let next = self.0;
 self.0 = self.1;
 self.1 = self.0 + next;

 Some(next)
}

let fib = Fibonacci::new();
for n in fib.skip(1).step_by(2).take(4) {
 println!(&quot;{n}&quot;);
// Prints 1, 2, 5, and 13

<text>In human biology, handedness is an individual&#x27;s preferential use of one hand, known as the dominant hand, due to it being stronger, faster or more dextrous. The other hand, comparatively often the weaker, less dextrous or simply less subjectively preferred, is called the non-dominant hand. In a study from 1975 on 7,688 children in US grades 1–6, left handers comprised 9.6% of the sample, with 10.5% of male children and 8.7% of female children being left-handed. Overall, around 90% of people are right-handed. Handedness is often defined by one&#x27;s writing hand, as it is fairly common for people to prefer to do a particular task with a particular hand. Ambidexterity (equal preference of either hand) does exist, but it is rare — most people prefer using one hand for most purposes. However, in some cultures, the use of the left hand can be considered disrespectful.

Most of the current research suggests that left-handedness has an epigenetic marker — a combination of genetics, biology and the environment.

Because the vast majority of the population is right-handed, many devices are designed for use by right-handed people, making their use by left-handed people more difficult. In many countries, left-handed people are or were required to write with their right hands. However, left-handed people have an advantage in sports that involve aiming at a target in an area of an opponent&#x27;s control, as their opponents are more accustomed to the right-handed majority. As a result, they are over-represented in baseball, tennis, fencing, cricket, boxing, and mixed martial arts.

== Types ==
* &quot;Right-handedness&quot; is the most common type. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands. Studies suggest that approximately 90% of people are right-handed.
* &quot;Left-handedness&quot; is less common. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of people are left-handed.
* &quot;Ambidexterity&quot; refers to having equal ability in both hands. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. This is uncommon, with about a 1% prevalence.
* &quot;Mixed-handedness&quot; or &quot;cross-dominance&quot; is the change of hand preference between different tasks. This is about as widespread as left-handedness. This is highly associated with the person&#x27;s childhood brain development.

== Measurement ==
Handedness may be measured behaviourally (performance measures) or through questionnaires (preference measures). The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory has been used since 1971 but contains some dated questions and is hard to score. Revisions have been published by Veale and by Williams. The longer Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire is not widely accessible. More recently, the Flinders Handedness Survey (FLANDERS) has been developed.

== Evolution ==
Some non-human primates have a preferred hand for tasks, but they do not display a strong right-biased preference like modern humans, with individuals equally split between right-handed and left-handed preferences. When exactly a right handed preference developed in the human lineage is unknown, though it is known through various means that Neanderthals had a right-handedness bias like modern humans. Attempts to determine handedness of early humans by analysing the morphology of lithic artefacts have been found to be unreliable.

== Causes ==
There are several theories of how handedness develops.

=== Genetic factors ===
Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) indicates that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%.

Two theoretical single-gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, by Marian Annett of the University of Leicester, and by Chris McManus of UCL.

However, growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus. From these studies, McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to the trait.

Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left-right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness. Brandler and Paracchini suggest the same mechanisms that determine left-right asymmetry in the body (e.g. nodal signaling and ciliogenesis) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry
(handedness being a reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).

In 2019, Wiberg et al. performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci, three of them in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development.

=== Prenatal hormone exposure ===
Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen-based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies &quot;suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance&quot;.

=== Ultrasound ===
Another theory is that ultrasound may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers receive ultrasound during pregnancy. Research suggests there may be a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check the healthy development of the fetus and mother) and left-handedness.

=== Epigenetic markers ===

Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, and environmental factors the remaining 75%. While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. (2017) found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries related to handedness.

=== Language dominance ===
One common handedness theory is the brain hemisphere division of labor. In most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking. The theory suggests it is more efficient for the brain to divide major tasks between the hemispheres—thus most people may use the non-speaking (right) hemisphere for perception and gross motor skills. As speech is a very complex motor control task, the specialised fine motor areas controlling speech are most efficiently used to also control fine motor movement in the dominant hand. As the right hand is controlled by the left hemisphere (and the left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere) most people are, therefore right-handed. The theory depends on left-handed people having a reversed organisation. However, the majority of left-handers have been found to have left-hemisphere language dominance—just like right-handers. Only around 30% of left-handers are not left-hemisphere dominant for language. Some of those have reversed brain organisation, where the verbal processing takes place in the right-hemisphere and visuospatial processing is dominant to the left hemisphere. Others have more ambiguous bilateral organisation, where both hemispheres do parts of typically lateralised functions. When tasks designed to investigate lateralisation (preference for handedness) are averaged across a group of left-handers, the overall effect is that left-handers show the same pattern of data as right-handers, but with a reduced asymmetry. This finding is likely due to the small proportion of left-handers who have atypical brain organisation. The majority of the evidence comes from literature assessing oral language production and comprehension. When it comes to writing, findings from recent studies were inconclusive for a difference in lateralization for writing between left-handers and right-handers. 

== Developmental timeline ==
Researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.

Infants have been observed to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks, especially in one- versus two-handed grasping. Between 36 and 48 months, there is a significant decline in variability between handedness in one-handed grasping; it can be seen earlier in two-handed manipulation. Children of 18–36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than with simple grasping.

The decrease in handedness variability in children of 36–48 months may be attributable to preschool or kindergarten attendance due to increased single-hand activities such as writing and coloring. Scharoun and Bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years.

== Correlation with other factors ==
The modern turn in handedness research has been towards emphasizing degree rather than direction of handedness as a critical variable.

=== Intelligence ===

In his book &quot;Right-Hand, Left-Hand&quot;, Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing, and that an above-average quota of high achievers have been left-handed. He says that left-handers&#x27; brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities, and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain&#x27;s language centers.

Writing in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, he states:
Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers&#x27; brains are structured differently from right-handers&#x27; in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.

Left-handers are overrepresented among those with lower cognitive skills and mental impairments, with those with intellectual disability being roughly twice as likely to be left-handed, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. Left-handers are nevertheless also overrepresented in high IQ societies, such as Mensa. A 2005 study found that &quot;approximately 20% of the members of Mensa are lefthanded, double the proportion in most general populations&quot;.

Ghayas &amp; Adil (2007) found that left-handers were significantly more likely to perform better on intelligence tests than right-handers and that right-handers also took more time to complete the tests. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Ntolka &amp; Papadatou-Pastou (2018) found that right-handers had higher IQ scores, but that difference was negligible (about 1.5 points).

The prevalence of &quot;difficulties&quot; in left-right discrimination was investigated in a cohort of 2,720 adult members of Mensa and Intertel by Storfer. According to the study, 7.2% of the men and 18.8% of the women evaluated their left-right directional sense as poor or below average; moreover participants who were relatively ambidextrous experienced problems more frequently than did those who were more strongly left- or right-handed. The study also revealed an effect of age, with younger participants reporting more problems.

==== Early childhood intelligence ====
Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18 to 24 months. They discovered that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess the subjects.

===Music===
In two studies, Diana Deutsch found that left-handers, particularly those with mixed-hand preference, performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks. There are also handedness differences in perception of musical patterns. Left-handers as a group differ from right-handers, and are more heterogeneous than right-handers, in perception of certain stereo illusions, such as the octave illusion, the scale illusion, and the glissando illusion.

===Health===
Studies have found a positive correlation between left-handedness and several specific physical and mental disorders and health problems, including:

*Lower birth weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handedness.
*A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and alcoholism have been associated with left- and mixed-handedness.
*A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, while another study demonstrated that left-handedness was associated with a 62% increased risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in women, but not in men. Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. 
*Left-handed women may have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater in post-menopausal women.
*At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease, and are more likely to have reduced longevity from cardiovascular causes.
*Left-handers may be more likely to suffer bone fractures.
*Left-handers have a lower prevalence of arthritis and ulcer.
*One systematic review concluded: &quot;Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system&quot;.

As handedness is a highly heritable trait associated with various medical conditions, and because many of these conditions could have presented a Darwinian fitness challenge in ancestral populations, this indicates left-handedness may have previously been rarer than it currently is, due to natural selection. However, on average, left-handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive, interactive sports, which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations.

=== Income ===
In 2006, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts.

In a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

=== Sports ===

Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing, about half the participants are left-handed. In tennis, 40% of the seeded players are left-handed. The term &quot;southpaw&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a left-handed individual, especially in baseball and boxing. Some studies suggest that right handed male athletes tend to be statistically taller and heavier than left handed ones.

Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:
* In cricket, the overall advantage of a bowler&#x27;s left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor (&quot;i.e.&quot;, even for a batter whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals their experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average (&quot;i.e.&quot;, right-handed) batter more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler&#x27;s delivery to an opposite-handed batter is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batter (see Wasim Akram).
* In baseball, a right-handed pitcher&#x27;s curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter (batting left or right does not indicate left or right handedness). While studies of handedness show that only 10% of the general population is left-handed, the proportion of left-handed MLB players is closer to 39% of hitters and 28% of pitchers, according to 2012 data. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. Fifteen of the top twenty career batting average leaders in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter&#x27;s box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. Perhaps more important, the follow through of a left-handed swing provides momentum in the direction of first base, while the right handed batter must overcome the swing momentum towards third base before beginning his run.
** Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pick off baserunners at first base.
** Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder. For the same reason, the other infielder&#x27;s positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states:

* In four wall handball, typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.
* In handball, left-handed players have an advantage on the right side of the field when attacking, getting a better angle, and that defenders might be unused to them. Since few people are left-handed, there is a demand for such players.
* In water polo, the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score. Left-handed drivers are usually on the right side of the field, because they can get better angles to pass the ball or shoot for goal.
* Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness.
* In American football, the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line. Tight ends, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback&#x27;s &quot;blind side&quot;, is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. Receivers also have to adapt to the opposite spin. While uncommon, there have been several notable left-handed quarterbacks.
* In bowling, the oil pattern used on the bowling lane breaks down faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball&#x27;s change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.

=== Sex ===
According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating that men are 23% more likely to be left-handed. For example, if the incidence of female left-handedness was 10%, then the incidence of male left-handedness would be approximately 12% (10% incidence of left-handedness among women multiplied by an odds ratio of 1:1.23 for women:men results in a 12.3% incidence of left-handedness among men).

=== Sexuality and gender identity ===

Some studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, though findings are mixed.

A 2001 study also found that people assigned male at birth whose gender identity did not align with their assigned sex, were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively).

Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found &quot;elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness&quot;. Greater rates of left-handedness have also been documented among pedophiles.

A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts.

=== Mortality rates in combat ===
A study at Durham University—which examined mortality data for cricketers whose handedness was a matter of public record—found that left-handed men were almost twice as likely to die in war as their right-handed contemporaries. The study theorised that this was because weapons and other equipment was designed for the right-handed. &quot;I can sympathise with all those left-handed cricketers who have gone to an early grave trying desperately to shoot straight with a right-handed Lee Enfield .303&quot;, wrote a journalist reviewing the study in the cricket press. The findings echo those of previous American studies, which found that left-handed US sailors were 34% more likely to have a serious accident than their right-handed counterparts.

===Episodic memory===
A high level of handedness (whether strongly favoring right or left) is associated with poorer episodic memory, and with poorer communication between brain hemispheres, which may give poorer emotional processing, although bilateral stimulation may reduce such effects.

=== Corpus callosum ===
A high level of handedness is associated with a smaller corpus callosum whereas low handedness with a larger one.

=== Divergent thinking ===
Left-handedness is associated with better divergent thinking.

==Products for left-handed use==
Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, &quot;For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers.&quot;

Many products for left-handed use are made by specialist producers, although not available from normal suppliers. Items as simple as a knife ground for use with the right hand are less convenient for left-handers. There is a multitude of examples: kitchen tools such as knives, corkscrews and scissors, garden tools, and so on. While not requiring a purpose-designed product, there are more appropriate ways for left-handers to tie shoelaces. There are companies that supply products designed specifically for left-handed use. One such is Anything Left-Handed, which in 1967 opened a shop in Soho, London; the shop closed in 2006, but the company continues to supply left-handed products worldwide by mail order.

Writing from left to right as in many languages, in particular, with the left hand covers and tends to smear (depending upon ink drying) what was just written. Left-handed writers have developed various ways of holding a pen for best results. For using a fountain pen, preferred by many left-handers, nibs ground to optimise left-handed use (pushing rather than pulling across the paper) without scratching are available.

== Bias against left-handers ==
McManus noted that, as the Industrial Revolution spread across Western Europe and the United States in the 19th century, workers needed to operate complex machines that were designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. Writing left-handed with a dip pen, in particular, was prone to blots and smearing.

===Negative connotations and discrimination===

Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many languages, including English, the word for the direction &quot;right&quot; also means &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;proper&quot;. Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil.

The Latin adjective means as well as , and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words &quot;sinister&quot; (meaning both &#x27;evil&#x27; and &#x27;on the bearer&#x27;s left on a coat of arms&#x27;) and &quot;ambisinister&quot; meaning &#x27;awkward or clumsy with both or either hand&#x27;.

There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase &quot;left-handed&quot;: clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A &quot;left-handed compliment&quot; is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In French, means both and or , while (cognate to English &quot;direct&quot; and related to &quot;adroit&quot;) means both and , as well as and the legal sense of . The name Dexter derives from the Latin for , as does the word &quot;dexterity&quot; meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.

Black magic is sometimes referred to as the &quot;left-hand path&quot;.

====Discrimination in education====
Before the development of fountain pens and other writing instruments, children were taught to write with a dip pen. While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. Even with more modern pens, writing from left to right, as in many languages, with the left hand covers and can smear what was just written when moving across the line.

Into the 20th and even the 21st century, left-handed children in Uganda were beaten by schoolteachers or parents for writing with their left hand, or had their left hands tied behind their backs to force them to write with their right hand. As a child, the future British king George VI (1895–1952) was naturally left-handed. He was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He was not expected to become king, so that was not a factor. 

Until very recently in Taiwan, left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order, developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. Because writing when moving one&#x27;s hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand. Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one&#x27;s own may not be straightforward.

In the Soviet school system, all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand.

=== International Left-Handers Day ===

International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, &quot;an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.&quot; It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world&#x27;s population. Thousands of left-handed people in today&#x27;s society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, &quot;in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 – including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide &#x27;Lefty Zones&#x27; where left-handers&#x27; creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment.&quot;

== In other animals ==
Kangaroos and other macropod marsupials show a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. &#x27;True&#x27; handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike placental mammals, they lack a corpus callosum. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (&quot;Macropus rufus&quot;) and the eastern gray kangaroo (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;). Red-necked (Bennett&#x27;s) wallabies (&quot;Macropus rufogriseus&quot;) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males tend to be left-handed.

<text>Lochgoilhead (, IPA:[ˈkʰʲaun̴̪ˈɫ̪ɔxˈkɤilə]) is a village in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is located within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. It stands at the head of Loch Goil.

== Location ==

The village is surrounded by several Corbetts in the Arrochar Alps, including Benn Donich, The Brack and Cnoc Coinnich and local waterways are the River Goil and the Donich Water.

The area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years, with the original name for the area being &#x27;Kil nam brathairan&#x27; from the Gaelic for &#x27;Church of the brothers&#x27;. There are Neolithic remains in the area, including nearby cup marks and a well-preserved corn kiln. The area is associated with the history of Clan Campbell, who drove the Lamonts from the area in the fourteenth century. Lochgoilhead used to be an important stop on the route between Glasgow and Inverary, as travellers would arrive by boat and continue by coach to St Catherine&#x27;s, where they would board a second boat to cross Loch Fyne.

Lochgoilhead is situated in the Cowal Peninsula and access to the village is either via the A83 with a turning off the &#x27;Rest and be Thankful&#x27;, or the A815 from Dunoon. Both roads are single track. Travel times from Glasgow, to the south east, are approximately 90 minutes.

The village has a population of about 400, with around a third of the houses being holiday rental properties or second homes. A large holiday village, Drimsynie Estate Holiday Village,nearly doubles the population of Lochgoilhead in high season. Employment in the area is largely related to agriculture, forestry and tourism, with rates of unemployment at approximately the national average. Rates of self-employment are twice the Scottish average.

The village has a Post Office/Shop and a small Costcutter supermarket. There is a church, a village hall which hosts a number of community events, a primary school and a doctor&#x27;s surgery. Drinks, meals and accommodation are available at the Goil Inn. Accommodation and many other amenities such as a gym, swimming pool and restaurants are available at Drimsynie Estate Holiday Village.

The area has many associations with outdoor activities, including the National Activity Centre for the Scouting Association and the Ardroy Outdoor Centre. There are many famous local walks including the Donich Circular and parts of the Cowal way (a view of Lochgoilhead can be seen on the home page for the Cowal Way website). The area is also incredibly rich in wildlife; red squirrel, pine marten, otters, red deer and badgers are common, as well as seals and porpoises in the loch and eagles and buzzards on the hills. Wildcats used to be common in the area but may now be extinct locally.

There are a number of books about local history available, including &#x27;Loch Goil – A slice out of paradise&#x27; (the name is a quote from the famous mountaineer WH Murray), &#x27;Loch Goil – looking back&#x27; by Iain Smart and Rod/Tricia Philips, and &#x27;The Lochgoil and Lochlong Steamboat Company&#x27; by Iain Smart. There is a community website and the local newspaper &#x27;The Wee Goil&#x27; is published monthly.

Parts of the film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; were filmed locally, and Sean Connery stayed at the Goil Inn (then the Lochgoilhead Hotel). &quot;Restless Natives&quot; also shows scenes near Lochgoilhead.

== Lochgoilhead Hum ==

A low frequency noise (LFN) was first reported by residents of the village late in 2015. The source of the noise has not been confirmed despite months of effort and investigation, earning the village a place on the World Hum Database. Similar reports of noise have been recorded on this database from Garelochhead and the out-skirts of Helensburgh - near the MOD facility at Faslane. Sound reports taken using specialized equipment (3rd Octave) in Lochgoilhead have measured high decibel, low frequency noise at three locations:

* MOD Noise Range - This range is operated on behalf of the MOD by QinetiQ, and includes a floating lab located in the middle of the loch, between The Lodge and Drimsynie Hotel. Until recently the lab was only occupied during trials, but as of late 2015 substantial new equipment was installed and the lab is now permanently occupied and frequently in use. The volume of MOD traffic on the loch has increased substantially over the last year - submarines and frigates have in fact been spotted/photographed on the loch recently. Sound reports taken on the shore near the lab when it is in use have shown LFN of up to 50 dB.
* Corrow Farm - This farm houses the Estate Office for Drimsynie Hotel and the Head Office for Drimsynie Construction. It is also a working farm, using new generating equipment which run almost constantly and generates LFN of up to 60 dB.
* Waste Water Treatment Works - This plant, operated by ScottishWater, is located at the edge of the village where it expels into the Donich River. When the plant pumps/turbines are in operation LFN of up to 60 dB has been recorded.

== Lochgoilhead Fever ==

An outbreak of non-pneumonic legionellosis due to Legionella micdadei in 1988 became known as Lochgoilhead fever (similar to Pontiac fever), the source of which was traced to a local hotel/spa. Two more minor outbreaks have occurred since - the most recent being in 2006, affecting only one resident and two visitors - following use the facilities at the same hotel/spa.

<text>Alfred Wainwright MBE (17 January 1907 – 20 January 1991), who preferred to be known as A. Wainwright or A.W., was a British fellwalker, guidebook author and illustrator. His seven-volume &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;, published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the fells of the English Lake District. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the Coast to Coast Walk, a long-distance footpath devised by Wainwright which remains popular today.

==Life==
Alfred Wainwright was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, into a family which was relatively poor, mostly because of his stonemason father&#x27;s alcoholism. He did very well at school (first in nearly every subject) although he left at the age of 13. While most of his classmates were obliged to find employment in the local mills, Wainwright started work as an office boy in Blackburn Borough Engineer&#x27;s Department. He spent several years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in accountancy which enabled him to further his career at Blackburn Borough Council. Even when a child Wainwright walked a great deal, up to at a time; he showed a great interest in drawing and cartography, producing his own maps of England and his local area.

In 1930, at the age of 23, Wainwright saved up for a week&#x27;s walking holiday in the Lake District with his cousin Eric Beardsall. They arrived in Windermere and climbed the nearby Orrest Head, where Wainwright saw his first view of the Lakeland fells. This moment marked the start of what he later described as his love affair with the Lake District. In 1931 he married his first wife, Ruth Holden, a mill worker, with whom he had a son, Peter. In 1941 Wainwright moved closer to the fells when he took a job (and a pay cut) at the Borough Treasurer&#x27;s office in Kendal, Westmorland. His first home in the town was 19 Castle Grove, which boasted a view of Kendal Castle from the front window. 

He lived and worked in the town for the rest of his life, serving as Borough Treasurer from 1948 until he retired in 1967. His first marriage ended when Ruth left three weeks before he retired (suspecting him of infidelity) and they divorced. In 1970 he married Betty McNally (1922–2008), a divorcée, who became his walking companion and who carried his ashes to Innominate Tarn at the top of Haystacks.

Wainwright was a lifelong Blackburn Rovers fan and a founder member of the Blackburn Rovers Supporters Club. He had no time for organised religion, and was agnostic. On &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, he described himself as having once been shy but having grown up to be antisocial and would avoid speaking to others, even lone walkers on fell tops.

Wainwright died in 1991 of a heart attack. According to his biographer, Hunter Davies, he left everything, including his house and royalty income, to Betty. His son Peter received nothing.

==Pictorial Guides==

Wainwright started work on the first page of his &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot; on 9 November 1952. He planned the precise scope and content of the seven volumes and worked conscientiously and meticulously on the series for the next 13 years at an average rate of one page per evening.

According to Wainwright, in his autobiography &quot;Fellwanderer&quot;, he initially planned the series for his own interest rather than for publication. When he published his first book it was privately, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher. His friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration, and his name appears as publisher on the early impressions. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd), agreed to print the books using Wainwright&#x27;s original manuscript, although the printing was done by the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot; in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot; became his publisher, and its name appears on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. Wainwright&#x27;s books were in turn taken over by Michael Joseph in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003, the rights were bought by Frances Lincoln.

Between 2005 and 2009, all the &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot; were updated for the first time, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions were made by Chris Jesty, and the publishers used an imitation font of Wainwright&#x27;s hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes were the inclusion of photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs on the front covers, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and footpaths shown in red on the maps. These revised versions are titled &#x27;Second Editions&#x27;. Revised editions of Wainwright&#x27;s other &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot;, &quot;A Coast to Coast Walk&quot;, &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot;, &quot;Pennine Way Companion&quot;, &quot;Walks in Limestone Country&quot; and &quot;Walks on the Howgill Fells&quot; were published by Frances Lincoln between 2010 and 2014, with the amendments again being made by Chris Jesty.

The publishers announced in 2014 that Clive Hutchby, the author of &quot;The Wainwright Companion&quot;, was working on the third edition of the &quot;Pictorial Guide&quot;, with the first volume, &quot;The Eastern Fells&quot;, published on 26 March 2015 followed by &quot;The Far Eastern Fells&quot; on 8 October 2015. These revised versions are titled &#x27;Walkers Editions&#x27;. Subsequent volumes in the series to have been revised are &quot;The Central Fells&quot; (published 2016), &quot;The Southern Fells&quot; (2017), &quot;The Northern Fells&quot; (2018); &quot;The North Western Fells&quot; (2019); and &quot;The Western Fells&quot; (2020).

==Later works==
Wainwright followed the &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot; in 1968 with the &quot;Pennine Way Companion&quot;, applying the same detailed approach to Britain&#x27;s first long-distance footpath. This was for many years a leading guide to the Pennine Way, rivalling the official guide book by Tom Stephenson. Wainwright&#x27;s book consists of a continuous strip map of the route with accompanying commentary, with an unusual quirk: because the route goes from south to north (bottom to top on a map), contrary to normal reading order, the map and commentary start at the bottom of the last page and work upwards and backwards towards the front of the book. The guide was prepared with the aid of four helpers (Harry Appleyard, Len Chadwick, Cyril Moore and Lawrence Smith) and its preparation was affected by the major outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in 1966 and 1967, which closed access to many of the moors.

In 1972 Wainwright devised the west–east Coast to Coast Walk, as an alternative to the north–south Pennine Way. The Coast to Coast, he declares in his guidebook, which follows the same format as the &quot;Pennine Way Companion&quot;, &quot;puts the Pennine Way to shame&quot; for scenic beauty, variety and interest. The route traverses the north of England from St. Bees to Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, passing through the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors national parks.

&quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot; (an idea he had previously rejected), published in 1974, was his last major guidebook. Thereafter he concentrated on sketchbooks of larger-size line drawings until his eyesight began to fail in the mid-1980s. His &quot;Ex-Fellwanderer&quot;, an autobiographical work published in 1987, was intended to be his last written work, but he continued to lend his name and some written commentary to a series of &quot;coffee table books&quot; featuring the photography of Derry Brabbs.

==Television and radio==
By the mid-1980s Wainwright was a TV personality; he featured in three television series for the BBC, presented by farmer and broadcaster Eric Robson and devised, directed and produced by Richard Else.

A BBC documentary about Wainwright&#x27;s life was broadcast on Sunday 25 February 2007 on BBC Four, before a four-part series of walks. This first series covered Blencathra by Sharp Edge, Castle Crag, Haystacks and Scafell Pike from Seathwaite.

The second series, broadcast in 2007, included Catbells, Crinkle Crags, Helm Crag, Helvellyn from Patterdale, High Street from Mardale and Pillar. A six-part series entitled &quot;Wainwright Walks: Coast to Coast&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four in April and May 2009 and on BBC2 from 21 July 2009, and presented by Julia Bradbury.

A Granada TV series &quot;Wainwright Country&quot; included Eagle Crag, Great Calva, Knott Rigg, Pike O&#x27;Blisco, Stybarrow Dodd, Thornthwaite Crag and Yewbarrow.

In 2010, Eric Robson presented a BBC Radio 4 documentary called &quot;The Man behind the Mountains&quot; (16 October 2010).

&quot;Wainwright Walks Series One&quot; was released on DVD in June 2007 and Series Two was released in January 2008. &quot;Wainwright Walks: Coast to Coast&quot; was released on DVD in June 2009.

==Influence==
Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot; have been in continuous publication since they were written and have sold more than two million copies. Although a number of more up-to-date guides are on the market, his books remain among the most popular for their depth, detail and unique style. His division of the Lake District into seven areas, and choice of fells to include, have been followed in whole or in part by subsequent writers such as Mark Richards. The Coast to Coast Walk is one of the most popular long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom despite its lack of official status, and has spawned various guidebooks by other authors. In 2003 it was voted the second best walk in the world in a survey of experts conducted by &quot;Country Walking&quot; magazine. The popularity of Wainwright&#x27;s books of drawings and large-format photographic books has not matched that of the guides.

The 214 fells described in the &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot; are now generally known as the Wainwrights, and visiting them all is a common form of peak bagging. The Long Distance Walkers Association maintains a register of walkers who have completed the Wainwrights; there were 674 people on the list, of whom 40 had completed more than once; by March 2023 the figure had risen to 898. Dave Hewitt estimates that the total number of completers could be over 50% higher than the LDWA&#x27;s figure. The Ramblers Association reported in 2008 that a boy of six years, four months and 27 days had become the youngest person to complete the Wainwrights. In April 2009 a boy aged five completed the round and became the third member of his family to do so after his older sisters held the &#x27;Youngest 214 Completer&#x27; previously. &quot;Wainwrights On The Air&quot; is a scheme whereby amateur radio enthusiasts aim to make contact with or from the Wainwright summits.

Wainwright was a supporter of animal rights and explained that the publisher of his books gave most of the profits from his books to animal charities. In 1972 he became chairman of Animal Rescue Cumbria, and donated enough money to enable the foundation in 1984 of Kapellan, a shelter for stray cats and dogs in Kendal. After his death the society was renamed &quot;Animal Rescue Cumbria – The Wainwright Shelter&quot;.

The Wainwright Society was inaugurated in 2002, with the aim of keeping alive the fellwalking traditions and ideas promoted by Alfred Wainwright through his guidebooks and other publications.

On 27 June 2008 a landmark road bridge, in Blackburn, was opened and named the Wainwright Bridge in his honour.

John Burland, a founding member of the Wainwright Society, wrote and devised a dramatic presentation of his life and works which was presented at the Wildman Theatre at Ilkley Playhouse as part of the Ilkley Literature Festival on 15 October 2009. During 2010 and 2011 a further 17 presentations were made.

In 2013, a memorial toposcope was unveiled on the hills near his home town of Blackburn.

A pedestrian area of Kendal, including the office of Wainwright&#x27;s first publisher the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot;, is named Wainwright&#x27;s Yard and features a display of pages from his books.

<text>The stratopause (formerly mesopeak) is the level of the atmosphere which is the boundary between two layers: the stratosphere and the mesosphere. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude, and the stratopause is the region where a maximum in the temperature occurs. This atmospheric feature is not exclusive to Earth, but also occurs on any other planet or moon with an atmosphere.
According to James Kasting, planets whose atmospheres do not absorb shortwave sunlight, such as Venus and Mars, do not have a Stratosphere and thus have no Stratopause.

On Earth, the stratopause is above sea level. The atmospheric pressure is around of the pressure at sea level. The temperature in the stratopause is .

<doc id="172655" wikidata="Q831462" url="?curid=172655" title="Galahad">
<text>Galahad (), sometimes referred to as Galeas () or Galath (), among other versions of his name, is a knight of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail in Arthurian legend. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot du Lac and Lady Elaine of Corbenic and is renowned for his gallantry and purity as the most perfect of all knights. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the Lancelot–Grail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works, such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In Arthurian literature, he replaced Percival as the hero in the quest for the Holy Grail.

==Origins==
The story of Galahad and his quest for the Holy Grail is a relatively late addition to the Arthurian legend. Galahad does not feature in any romance by Chrétien de Troyes, or in Robert de Boron&#x27;s Grail stories, or in any of the continuations of Chrétien&#x27;s story of the mysterious castle of the Fisher King. He first appears in a 13th-century Old French Arthurian epic, the interconnected set of romances of unknown authorship, known as the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) Cycle. His name could have been derived from the Welsh name Gwalchaved, meaning &quot;Falcon of Summer&quot;.

The original conception of Galahad, whose adult antics are first recounted in the fourth book of the Vulgate Cycle (Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;), may have come from the mystical Cistercian Order. According to some interpreters, the philosophical inspiration of the celibate, the otherworldly character of the monastic knight Galahad came from this monastic order set up by St. Bernard of Clairvaux. The Cistercian-Bernardine concept of Catholic warrior asceticism that so distinguishes the character of Galahad also informs St. Bernard&#x27;s projection of ideal chivalry in his work on the Knights Templar, the &quot;Liber ad milites templi de laude novae militiae&quot;. Significantly, in the narratives, Galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross, the very same emblem given to the Knights Templar by Pope Eugene III. 

==Medieval literature==
===Conception===
The circumstances surrounding Galahad&#x27;s conception derive from the earlier parts of Grail prose cycles. It takes place when King Arthur&#x27;s greatest knight, Lancelot, mistakes Princess Elaine of Corbenic (originally known as Heliabel or Amite in the Vulgate Cycle) for his secret mistress, Queen Guinevere. Lady Elaine&#x27;s father, King Pelles, has already received magical foreknowledge that Lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world, the knight chosen by God to discover the Holy Grail. Pelles also knows that Lancelot will only lie with his one true love, Guinevere. Destiny will have to be helped along a little; therefore, a conclusion which prompts Pelles to seek out &quot;one of the greatest enchantresses of the time,&quot; Dame Brusen, who gives Pelles a magic ring that makes Elaine take on the appearance of Guinevere and enables her to spend a night with Lancelot. On discovering the deception, Lancelot draws his sword on Elaine, but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together, he is immediately forgiving; however, he does not marry Elaine or even wish to be with her anymore and returns to Arthur&#x27;s court (albeit years later they eventually come to live together for a time, after Elaine cures him of his severe and long madness caused by both herself and Guinevere). Galahad is born and placed in the care of a great aunt, who is an abbess at a nunnery, to be raised there.

According to the 13th-century Old French Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; (part of the Vulgate Cycle), &quot;Galahad&quot; (actually written as &quot;Galaad&quot;, in some manuscripts also as &quot;Gaalaz&quot; or &quot;Galaaus&quot;) was Lancelot&#x27;s original name, but it was changed when he was a child. At his birth, therefore, Galahad is given his father&#x27;s own original name. Merlin prophesies that Galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the Holy Grail. Pelles, Galahad&#x27;s maternal grandfather, is portrayed as a descendant of Joseph of Arimathea&#x27;s brother-in-law Bron, also known as Galahad (Galaad), whose line had been entrusted with the Grail by Joseph.

===Grail Quest===
Upon reaching adulthood (in medieval definition) of 15 years old, Galahad is finally united with his father Lancelot, who had never met him before that (not even during the years of living with Elaine). Lancelot knights Galahad after having been bested by him in a duel, the first and only time that Lancelot ever lost in a fair fight to anyone. Galahad is then brought to King Arthur&#x27;s court at Camelot during Pentecost, where he is accompanied by a very old knight who immediately leads him over to the Round Table and unveils his seat at the Siege Perilous, an unused chair that has been kept vacant for the sole person who will succeed in the quest of the Holy Grail. For all others who have aspired to sit there, it has proved to be immediately fatal. Galahad survives this test, witnessed by Arthur who, upon realising the greatness of this new knight, leads him out to the river where a magic sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading &quot;Never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side I ought to hang; and he shall be the best knight of the world.&quot; (The embedding of a sword in a stone is also an element of the legends of Arthur&#x27;s original sword, the sword in the stone. In Malory&#x27;s version, this is the sword that had belonged to Balin.) Galahad accomplishes this test with ease, and Arthur swiftly proclaims him to be the greatest knight ever. Galahad is promptly invited to become a Knight of the Round Table, and soon afterwards, Arthur&#x27;s court witnesses an ethereal vision of the Grail. The quest to seek out this holy object is begun at once.

All of the Knights of the Round Table set out to find the Grail. It is Galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the Grail; the rest of the knights follow him. Arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus, for he discerns that many will never be seen again, dying in their quest. Arthur fears that it is the beginning of the end of the Round Table. This might be seen as a theological statement that concludes that earthly endeavours must take second place to the pursuit of the holiness. Galahad, in some ways, mirrors Arthur, drawing a sword from a stone in the way that Arthur did. In this manner, Galahad is declared to be the chosen one.

Further uniquely among the Round Table, Galahad is capable of performing miracles such as banishing demons and healing the sick. For the most part, he travels alone during the Grail Quest, smiting (and often sparing) his enemies, rescuing fellow knights including Percival and saving maidens in distress until he is finally reunited with Bors and Percival. Together, the three blessed virgin knights come across Percival&#x27;s sister, who leads them to the mystical Ship of Solomon. They use it to cross the sea to an island where Galahad finds King David&#x27;s sword. 

===Ascension===
After many adventures, Galahad and his companions find themselves in the mystical castle of Corbenic at the court of King Pelles and his son Eliazarr (Galahad does not reunite with his mother, who had died meanwhile). His grandfather and uncle bring Galahad into a room where he is finally allowed to see the Holy Grail. Galahad is asked to take the vessel to the holy island Sarras. After seeing the Grail, Galahad makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing. So it is that, while making his way back to Arthur&#x27;s court, Galahad is visited by the spirit of Joseph of Arimathea, and thus experiences such a glorious rapture that he makes his request to die. Galahad bids Percival and Bors farewell, after which angels appear to take him to Heaven. His ascension is witnessed by Bors and Percival. Depending on the telling, Galahad is either physically taken to paradise as he completely vanishes in a bright light or his mortal body is left behind and later buried. In the latter scenario, Galahad is usually laid to rest alongside the body of Percival&#x27;s sister and later joined in their grave by Percival himself.

Galahad&#x27;s success in the search for the Holy Grail was predicted before his birth, not only by Pelles but also by Merlin, who once had told Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the &quot;table of Joseph&quot;, but that he was not yet born. At first this knight was believed to be Percival, however it is later discovered to be Galahad. Galahad was conceived for the divine purpose of seeking the Holy Grail, but this happened under a cloak of deception, similarly to the conceptions of Arthur and Merlin. Despite this, Galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the Holy Grail. Galahad, in both the Lancelot-Grail cycle and in Malory&#x27;s retelling, is exalted above all the other knights: he is the one worthy enough to have the Grail revealed to him and to be taken into Heaven.

==Victorian portrayals==
===Tennyson===
In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Galahad&#x27;s incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the Holy Grail are traced back to his piety. According to the legend, only pure knights may achieve the Grail. While in a specific sense, this &quot;purity&quot; refers to chastity, Galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and as a result, he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him. This quality is reflected in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;:

Galahad is able to conquer all of his enemies because he is pure. In the next verse of this poem, Tennyson continues to glorify Galahad for remaining pure at heart, by putting these words into his mouth:

Galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course, sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal:

Tennyson&#x27;s poem follows Galahad&#x27;s journey to find the Holy Grail but ends while he is still riding, still seeking, still dreaming; as if to say that the quest for the Holy Grail is an ongoing task. Unlike many other portrayals of the legend of Sir Galahad, Tennyson has Sir Galahad speak in the first person, giving the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest, rather than just the details of his battles, as in Malory.

===William Morris===
Sir Galahad&#x27;s thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by William Morris in his poems &quot;The Chapel in Lyoness&quot;, published in 1856, and &quot;Sir Galahad, a Christmas Mystery&quot;, published in 1858. Unlike Malory and Tennyson&#x27;s pure hero, Morris creates a Galahad who is emotionally complex, conflicted, and palpably human. In &quot;A Christmas Mystery&quot;, written more than twenty years after Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, Galahad is &quot;fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human&quot;, and tries to reconcile his longing for earthly delights, such as the romantic exploits of Sir Palomydes and his father Sir Lancelot, and the &quot;more austere spiritual goal to which he has been called&quot;. In the companion piece &quot;The Chapel in Lyoness&quot;, a knight lies dying in winter &quot;in a bizarre realization of Galahad&#x27;s nightmare vision of his own fate&quot;. Galahad then &quot;saves&quot; the knight with a kiss before he finally expires. It is here that Galahad progresses from &quot;a somewhat self-centered figure&quot; to &quot;a savior capable of imparting grace&quot;. Morris&#x27; poems place this emotional conflict at centre stage, rather than concentrating upon Galahad&#x27;s prowess for defeating external enemies, and the cold and the frost of a Christmas period serve to reinforce his &quot;chilly isolation&quot;. The poem opens on midwinter&#x27;s night; Sir Galahad has been sitting for six hours in a chapel, staring at the floor. He muses to himself:

==Twentieth century and later==

===Literature===
* A poem by Thomas de Beverly published in 1925, &quot;The Birth of Sir Galahad&quot;, tells of the events leading up to the conception of Sir Galahad, his birth and a visit soon afterwards by Sir Bors, to see Elaine and the baby Galahad. Sir Bors sees a vision of the Holy Grail whilst in a chapel with the baby and his mother. Of the three knights who are untainted by sin – Sir Perceval, Sir Bors, and Sir Galahad – Galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honor of attaining the Holy Grail. This is similar to God declaring that King David had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the Jerusalem Temple, this honour falling only to his son King Solomon.
*Edmund Wilson&#x27;s story &quot;Galahad&quot;, published in 1927, presents a humorous story about the attempted seduction of a virginal high school student by a debutante.
* In John Erskine&#x27;s novel &quot;Galahad: Enough of His Life to Explain His Reputation&quot;, Galahad&#x27;s main tutor for his knightly training is Queen Guinevere. Erskine follows Malory&#x27;s text through Galahad&#x27;s childhood. Just as in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Galahad grows up in the court of his mother Elaine, and travels to King Arthur&#x27;s court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight. When Galahad arrives at the court, Guinevere is upset with Lancelot because he does not want to be her lover anymore, and she takes an interest in the young knight, persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties. At first Galahad seems content with just being an ordinary Knight of the Round Table, going out on quests and saving maidens in distress. Guinevere is the main contributor to Galahad&#x27;s destiny in this work. She says, &quot;You&#x27;ll waste your life if you don&#x27;t accomplish something new, something entirely your own.&quot; This is Galahad&#x27;s motivation to seek the Grail.
* Matt Cohen satirizes Galahad&#x27;s virtuous character in his 1972 comical short story &quot;Too Bad Galahad&quot;. Cohen describes Galahad as the perfect knight who does no harm. In part, &quot;Galahad&#x27;s virtue is a compensation for Lancelot&#x27;s indiscretion&quot;. However, Cohen, instead of glorifying Galahad&#x27;s virtuous character, makes it into a weakness. He writes that Galahad tried to &quot;swear and kill and wench with the rest of the knights but he could never really get into it.&quot; Cohen&#x27;s Galahad is not well-liked by the other knights because he is so perfect and seems unapproachable. Cohen pokes fun at Galahad&#x27;s &quot;calling&quot; by saying that his life would be wasted if he failed to remain pure and holy in order to be the bearer of the Holy Grail.
* Thomas Berger&#x27;s &quot;Arthur Rex&quot; portrays Galahad differently. In most works, Galahad is depicted as an emblem of perfection. Berger shows Galahad&#x27;s arrival to court in a more satirical light. Gawain comments that he cannot tell whether he is male or female. Berger shows that even though Galahad is in fact the greatest knight in the world, he does not appear to be. Appearance versus reality is a common theme throughout this novel. In most versions of the story of Sir Galahad, Galahad&#x27;s death comes about after his greatest achievement, that of the Holy Grail. In &quot;Arthur Rex&quot;, however, Galahad is killed in a battle where he mistakes his own father Lancelot for a Saxon. Galahad is too weak and sleeps through most of the battle and, when he does wake up, he kills his father as well as being killed himself. Just like the Grail, perfection is unattainable; only glimpses of the Grail and of perfection can be seen.
* In the &quot;Everworld&quot; fantasy novel series by K. A. Applegate, the character David Levin fights with the Sword of Galahad, after witnessing Sir Galahad&#x27;s death. David is the self-appointed leader of the protagonists and takes on all the burdens of the group, being troubled by his past in which he was cowardly and feeling he must prove himself to be a man.
*&quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, the final book of &quot;The Witcher&quot; saga by Andrzej Sapkowski, features King Arthur&#x27;s Knight Galaad of Caer Benic. At the very beginning of the story, as a denizen of a parallel world, he encounters the protagonist Ciri and calls her the Lady of the Lake.
*In Sam Selvon&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot;, central character Moses Aloesa meets fellow Trinidadian émigré Henry Oliver and nicknames him Galahad.
* In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s 1983 novel &#x27;The Mists of Avalon&#x27; Galahad is the son of Viviane, Our Lady of the Lake, and cousin of King Arthur. 
* Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Chivalry&quot; from &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot; includes Galahad in his quest for the Holy Grail.
* Galahad appears as a child toward the conclusion of British author Giles Kristian&#x27;s novel &quot;Lancelot&quot; (2018). The sequel, &quot;Camelot&quot; (2020), is set a decade later, with Galahad as the protagonist.
* Galahad is a major character in all three installments of the &quot;Warlord Chronicles&quot; trilogy of novels by Bernard Cornwell. He is first a prince of Benoic, who is forced to capitulate his kingdom&#x27;s capital at Ynys Trebes through the actions of his cowardly older brother Lancelot. He befriends Arthur and Derfel Cadarn and is an important figure in Britain&#x27;s transition from paganism to Christianity.

===Music===
* Joan Baez uses the legend metaphorically in her song &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot;, which is about the courtship of her sister.
* The band America mentions Galahad (&quot;... or the tropic of Sir Galahad&quot;) in the chorus for the song &quot;Tin Man&quot;.
* On his EP &quot;To the Yet Unknowing World&quot;, Josh Ritter has a song titled &quot;Galahad&quot;, which jokes about Galahad&#x27;s chastity and the &#x27;virtue&#x27; of his supposed purity.
* In Mili&#x27;s song &quot;Ga1ahad and Scientific Witchery&quot;, Galahad is portrayed as a robotic knight who was reanimated by a witch.
*Marty Stuart uses part of the last stanza in the outro of the concept album &quot;The Pilgrim&quot;. Johnny Cash speaks as God, describing the Pilgrim as a just and faithful knight, before singing the final line of the album.

===Film and television===
*&quot;Kid Galahad&quot;, a 1937 film about a Galahad-type boxer. It was remade twice, in 1941 and in 1962.
* Galahad is portrayed by George Reeves in the 1949 film serial &quot;Adventures of Sir Galahad&quot;.
* Galahad is portrayed by Michael Palin in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. The movie makes a satire of Galahad&#x27;s purity as his chastity is put to the test when he finds a castle full of sexually charged nuns. 
* In the 1998 miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot;, the title character meets Galahad and his parents while looking for a suitable regent for Camelot while Arthur searches for the Grail. Merlin brings Lancelot back with him, and after the sorrows that subsequently befall Camelot, the Lady of the Lake reveals that Merlin was meant to pick Galahad and that his mistake proves how human he truly is. 
* Galahad is portrayed by Hugh Dancy in the 2004 historical action-adventure film &quot;King Arthur&quot;.
* John Larroquette played an elderly yet immortal Galahad (now known as Jenkins) in the TV series &quot;The Librarians&quot;.
* Galahad is a robot piloted by the Knight of One, Bismarck Waldstein, in the anime &quot;Code Geass&quot;.
* In the film &quot;&quot; and its , Galahad is the code name of Colin Firth&#x27;s character Harry Hart, later assumed by Taron Egerton&#x27;s character, Gary &quot;Eggsy&quot; Unwin. It was used by Gemma Arterton&#x27;s character Polly Watkins in the prequel.

===Games===
* In the 2015 video game &quot;The Order: 1886&quot;, the main character is an heir to the title of Sir Galahad, and is referred to as such.
* The video game &quot;Hero Wars&quot; has a knight character named Galahad.
* In the video game &quot;Tainted Grail: Conquest&quot;, Galahad is a title held by Kamelot&#x27;s representative to the South. Its holder at the time the events of the game take place is known for being violent and ruthless.

<text>The Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo, or simply Floyd Rose, is a type of locking vibrato arm for a guitar. Floyd D. Rose invented the locking vibrato in 1976, the first of its kind, and it is now manufactured by a company of the same name. The Floyd Rose gained popularity in the 1980s through guitarists like Eddie Van Halen, Neal Schon, Brad Gillis, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Alex Lifeson, who used its ability to stay in tune even with extreme changes in pitch. Its tuning stability comes through the double-locking design that has been widely regarded as revolutionary; the design has been listed on &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s &quot;10 Most Earth Shaking Guitar Innovations&quot; and &quot;Guitar Player&quot;″s &quot;101 Greatest Moments in Guitar History 1979–1983.&quot;

==History==

Floyd D. Rose first started working on what became the Floyd Rose Tremolo in 1976. He was playing in a rock band at the time, inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Deep Purple. He frequently used the vibrato bar but could not make his guitars stay in tune using traditional approaches like lubricating the nut, or winding the strings as little as possible around the tuning pegs.

At the time, Rose made and sold jewelry, and so had the skills and tools to fabricate small metal parts. After noticing the strings moved freely with the regular nut design, he made a brass nut that locked the strings in place with three U-shaped clamps. He installed this nut in his 1957 Fender Stratocaster. Later he improved this design by using hardened steel—otherwise the strings wore the clamps down too quickly—and redesigned the bridge, which also locked the strings with clamps.

Rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts, which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time, such as Eddie Van Halen. Other well-known guitarists who picked it up early were Neal Schon, who purportedly got serial number 3, Brad Gillis (serial number 4), and Steve Vai.

The first patent was awarded in 1979, and shortly afterward, Rose made an agreement with Kramer Guitars because he could no longer keep up with demand manufacturing the bridges by hand. Kramer&#x27;s guitar models with the Floyd Rose bridge became very popular, leading them to drop the earlier Rockinger vibrato in favor of the Floyd Rose between June 1982 and January 1983. The Floyd Rose design&#x27;s popularity led to other companies making similar bridges, thus violating the patent. To combat this Floyd Rose and Kramer went on to make licensing agreements with other manufacturers, and there are now several different models available based on the double-locking design. Because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design, and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut. The licensed units made by other manufacturers were stamped &quot;Licensed Under Floyd Rose Patents&quot; or similar. By the mid 1980s OEM units were supplied directly, made exclusively by Schaller, GmbH, of Germany. The OEM unit, to this day, continues to be made in Germany, by Schaller, GmbH. A Korean model, designated, the Floyd Rose &quot;1000 Series&quot;, is based on the original Floyd Rose.

Original producer of the production tremolos Fernandes Guitars went on to produce their &quot;Headcrasher&quot; and subsequent &quot;FRT&quot;-series versions for their own brand of guitars until 1997. Takeuchi produced licensed tremolos for Japanese-built Ibanez, Jackson, Charvel, Yamaha, Fernandes, Aria Guitars, and Washburn guitars, among others, until the mid 2000s. They also made lower-cost units for Ibanez&#x27;s entry-level guitars up to 2010. Gotoh made their own licensed tremolo as a direct replacement for an Original Floyd Rose and also supplied theirs as an OEM unit to Aria Guitars and Ibanez for some of their models during the 1980s and for some Fernandes guitars after they stopped making their own in 1997. ESP made their &quot;ESP Synclear Tremolo&quot; for their Japanese-made guitars during the 1980s. Yamaha made their &quot;Rocking Magic&quot; series of tremolos until the early 1990s. Kahler produced the renowned &quot;Steeler,&quot; &quot;Killer,&quot; and &quot;Spyder&quot; variants during the 1980s while developing their own cam-based Kahler Tremolo System for which they are best known for today. Notably, courts found that the Kahler Tremolo System infringed on Floyd Rose&#x27;s patents, and awarded a judgment in excess of $100 million against Gary Kahler.

In January 1991, Kramer&#x27;s exclusive distribution agreement with Rose ended when Fender announced they would be the new exclusive distributor of Floyd Rose products. While Fender used Floyd Rose-licensed vibrato systems previously, this move allowed Fender to offer a few models with the original Floyd Rose Tremolo, such as the Richie Sambora Signature Strat in 1991, the Floyd Rose Classic Stratocaster in 1992 and the Set-Neck Floyd Rose Strat in 1993. Floyd Rose collaborated with Fender to design a Fender Deluxe Locking Tremolo, introduced in 1991 on the Strat Plus Deluxe, the USA Contemporary Stratocaster, and the Strat Ultra. Fender used the Floyd Rose-designed locking vibrato system on certain humbucker-equipped American Deluxe and Showmaster models until 2007.

In 2005, distribution of the Floyd Rose Original reverted to Floyd Rose, whereas the patented designs were licensed to other manufacturers to use.

==Principles==

Position I illustrates the normal position of an ideally tuned Floyd Rose bridge. The bridge (orange in the diagram) balances on a pivot point, being pulled counter-clockwise by the strings&#x27; tension and clockwise by typically one to five springs. Controlled by special tuning screws (purple in the diagram), these two forces are balanced such that the bridge&#x27;s surface is parallel to the guitar body (olive in the diagram). The strings are locked tightly with a special mechanism at the nut (green in the diagram) as well as at the bridge (turquoise in the diagram), hence &quot;double-locking&quot;.

Position II illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pushed down towards the guitar body. The bridge rotates around a pivot point counter-clockwise and the tension in each string decreases, lowering the pitch of each string. The sound of any notes being played becomes flat. While the tension of the strings decreases, the tension of the springs increases. It is the balance between string tension and spring tension, as well as the fact that the strings end at the bridge saddles and nut (eliminating &quot;play&quot; in the string, which would negatively affect tuning), that brings the strings reliably back into tune when force on the bar is removed.

Position III illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pulled up away from the guitar body. The bridge rotates clockwise, the tension in the strings increases, the pitch of the sound increases and so notes sound sharper than normal. Due to the limitations on the assembly&#x27;s movement imposed by the guitar&#x27;s body, the amount of available pitch change is much larger when the bar is depressed than when it is lifted.

Note that when using the vibrato bar, string action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard) is affected, and this can sometimes cause the strings to unintentionally touch the frets and create unwanted sounds on instruments set up with extremely low action and heavily recessed vibrato installations.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

The main advantage of the Floyd Rose vibrato system is its double-locking design. This makes the guitar stay in tune through large pitch changes, e.g., forcing the vibrato bar all the way down to the guitar body, or pulling up on the bar to raise the tone by as much as a fifth or a seventh.

A typical bridge set-up has it &quot;float&quot;—so the player can both raise and lower the pitch with the vibrato bar. However, if a string breaks, the balance of tensions on the bridge is disrupted, leaving the bridge out of position and therefore the guitar out of tune. Moreover, since the tension of one string affects the tension of all the others, it can take several iterations through the tuning process before the instrument is tuned.

Some players, including Eddie Van Halen, prefer to instead have a &quot;half-floating&quot; bridge, which allows only downwards motion. This means the cavity of the tremolo pocket is not fully milled away underneath—and if the tension of the rear springs is slightly stronger than the tension of the strings, the tremolo always rests flush with the body. In this set-up, a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings, as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string doesn&#x27;t make the bridge move, since it already presses against the body of the guitar. This also allows fitting a device to the bridge that can drop the low E-string down to D to extend the tonal variety of the guitar, even during live performance.
Bending, however, still affects the rest of the strings, which makes some double-stop (&#x27;diad&#x27;), techniques more difficult to achieve.

The bridge&#x27;s effect on the tone of the guitar is a topic of much disagreement. Some players find that the Floyd Rose bridge has a &quot;thin&quot; tone, which has led to the development of replacement sustain blocks. These blocks are generally larger in size than the standard block and may be constructed from a similar brass alloy or an alternative like titanium or copper. According to reviews this modification might lead to a preferable change in the tonal quality of the guitar.

==Models and varieties==



* Floyd Rose Original is the oldest model still in production. Since 1977, production models bearing this name are mostly the same as the first model, with only minor changes. Note that the name &quot;Floyd Rose Original&quot; is used to differentiate this system from &quot;Floyd Rose Licensed&quot;. The first Original Floyds were double locking, but had no fine tuners, so players had to unclamp the nut every time they retuned the guitar, and people who use these today (for example Guthrie Govan) use them without locking nuts. Currently made by Schaller in Germany.
* Floyd Rose II is a lower end version of the Original Floyd used mostly on import and mid-range instruments throughout the 1990s. Originally, Floyd IIs were single locking, locking only at the nut. Later versions were made double locking, but used weaker materials than the Original Floyd Rose, making them less dependable.
* Floyd Rose Pro is a low-profile version of &quot;Floyd Rose Original&quot;. The bridge and arm design is changed in such a way that the guitarist&#x27;s hand is generally closer to the strings while holding the vibrato arm. The bridge has a narrower string spacing (0.400 inches or 10.16 mm in this design versus 0.420 inches or 10.66 mm of the Floyd Rose Original).
* Floyd Rose SpeedLoader is a redesign developed in 1995–1999 and introduced around 2003 that combines &quot;Floyd Rose Original&quot; with the SpeedLoader system, and requires special strings and is manufactured under license of McCabe US Patents for &quot;macrotuners&quot;, ie. full-range tuners.
* Floyd Rose 1000 and Floyd Rose Special are made with the same design as the Original but manufactured in South Korea. The Floyd Rose 1000 is built with the same materials as the Original, however, the Floyd Rose Special utilizes substitute materials, such as zinc alloy saddles, zinc alloy string insert blocks, and zinc alloy fine-tuner screws instead of steel, and a zinc alloy sustain block instead of brass, which significantly decreases the cost of the Special model.
* Fender Deluxe Locking Tremolo. A specially designed system that was made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in 1991 in conjunction with Floyd Rose, utilizing locking tuners, a modified Fender 2-point synchronized vibrato with locking bridge saddles and a special low-friction LSR Roller Nut that lets strings slide during vibrato use. This is a double locking system, except the other locking point is at the tuner instead of nut.

===Well known Floyd Rose Licensed Models===

Previously, all similar double locking vibrato systems were produced under license from Floyd Rose, and marketed as such, but in 2003 the relevant patents expired.

* Gotoh GE1996T is an alternative made by Japanese guitar hardware company Gotoh. It shares the same materials as the Floyd Rose Original and adds new advancements to the design, including an Allen key adjustable push in arm and stud locks, which lock the studs to the body. The name comes from the fact that Gotoh got the license from Floyd Rose in 1996.
* Schaller, the current makers of the Floyd Rose Original, also makes their own bridges which share the design of the Floyd Rose, but with their own branding instead of the Floyd Rose branding. the Schaller Tremolo features a design similar to the Floyd Rose II but with the same materials as the Floyd Rose Original, while the Schaller LockMeister is a rebranded Floyd Rose Original which can also be ordered for different fretboard radii, unlike a Floyd Rose Original. Schaller also makes the Schaller Vintage Tremolo which is a non locking tremolo bridge designed to be retrofitted on guitars with Floyd Rose bridges.
* Yamaha Finger Clamp is a variety of Floyd Rose that have built-in levers, and thus when tuning, no allen keys are needed. Available on the RGX520DZ, RGX620DZ and CV820 Wes Borland signature model.
* Vigier Floyd Rose created by Vigier guitars at the beginning of the &#x27;90s, this system uses force-tolerant needle bearings for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced tuning stability. The ball-bearing and global tuner features are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe—see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841.
* Kahler 2700 Series (Killer, Steeler, and Spyder) made in the late 80s by Kahler, designed by David Petschulat, this system used a knife-edge fulcrum bridge (unlike the typical Kahler cam system). The string locks at the bridge were embossed FLOYD ROSE LIC.
* Ibanez Edge is Ibanez&#x27;s Floyd Rose variant. There are 4 primary versions: Edge, LoPro Edge, EdgePro, and EdgeZero with numbered variants denoting budget models of the main lines, and also &quot;Double&quot; variants of many of these, the moniker denoting the inclusion of Piezo pickups. The Edge and LoPro Edge were discontinued in 2003 but were subsequently reintroduced on the signature models of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. (Some special edition guitars used these trems prior to their reintroduction; however, the vibratos used were new old stock (NOS), rather than production runs.) These two vibratos, whether old or new, bear a mark of Floyd Rose Licensing, as they are produced using the same tooling, by Japanese guitar parts manufacturer Gotoh.
* Ibanez Zero Resistance uses a ball-bearing mechanic instead of knife-edge as the joint, and a stop-bar to help the guitar stay in tune after diving the vibrato. Ibanez claims this system improves tuning stability after breaking a string. These springs, including their orientation, are referred to as the ZPS system, with variants numbered 1 to 3, and are also present as part of the EdgeZero design. The ball-bearing and global tuner features are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe—see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841.
* Ibanez Fixed Edge, while it still uses the locking nut and locking bridge, was mounted on top of the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a familiar feel to vibrato users, and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar.

==Popular use==

The Floyd Rose Tremolo rose to popularity in the early 1980s. Many popular artists quickly adopted the device, making it difficult to measure how much each individual artist contributed to that popularity. Most sources consider Eddie Van Halen a pioneer of Floyd Rose usage. Other players frequently cited as influential Floyd Rose users are Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Kirk Hammett, Brad Gillis, Tom Morello, Allan Holdsworth, Dimebag Darrell and Synyster Gates.

<text>The Big Red One is a 1980 American epic war film written and directed by Samuel Fuller, and starring Lee Marvin alongside an ensemble supporting cast, including Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Siegfried Rauch, Bobby Di Cicco, and Kelly Ward.

Based on Fuller&#x27;s own experiences as a soldier in World War II, it was produced independently on a low budget, and shot on location in Israel as a cost-saving measure. It was heavily cut on its original release, but a restored version, &quot;The Big Red One: The Reconstruction&quot;, premièred at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, seven years after Fuller&#x27;s death. Fuller wrote a book with the same title, which was more a companion novel than a novelization of the film, although it features many of the scenes that were originally cut.

==Background==

Fuller was a World War II veteran and served with the 1st Infantry Division, which is nicknamed &quot;The Big Red One&quot; for the red numeral &quot;1&quot; on the division&#x27;s shoulder patch. He received the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during his service. He was present at the liberation of the Falkenau concentration camp.

==Plot==

World War I: In November 1918, a United States Army private kills a surrendering German Army soldier with his trench knife, thinking the surrender is a trick. When he returns to his company&#x27;s headquarters, the private is told that the war ended four hours earlier.

World War II: In November 1942, the US soldier, now a sergeant in the &quot;Big Red One&quot;, leads his squad of infantrymen through North Africa; they are initially fired on by a Vichy French general, who is then overpowered by his French troops, who are loyal to Free France. Over the next two years, the squad is part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, where they are given intelligence on the location of a Tiger I tank and are fed by grateful Sicilian women; the landing on Omaha Beach at the start of the Normandy campaign; the liberation of France, where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum; and the invasion of western Germany. The sergeant&#x27;s German Army counterpart, Schroeder, participates in many of these same battles, and at different times both he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers, but not murderers, though Schroeder also displays a ruthless loyalty to Hitler and Germany.

During the advance across northern France, the American squad crosses the former WWI battlefield on which the sergeant killed the surrendering German, where a memorial now stands to the earlier war. Schroeder has sprinkled his own living men among the German dead from a recent battle at this location, but the sergeant senses a trap and checks out the bodies in a burned-out tank. Noticing that the piping on the German uniforms is not consistent, he silently kills the living Germans in the tank. Feigning orders from his commander on the radio, the sergeant begins leading his men away, quietly telling them that living Germans are about. One of his new recruits sees a German move and shoots him, setting off a skirmish in which the Americans wipe out the Germans with only minor injuries in their own ranks. While the sergeant&#x27;s squad are patching up their wounded, a French couple arrives on a motorcycle and sidecar. The husband dies of his previous wounds, but not before begging the sergeant to help his pregnant wife. The squad clears the tank and puts the woman, who is in active labor, in the tank. After a somewhat comical series of attempts to help the mother give birth, a child is born. Schroeder takes advantage of all of this excitement to sneak away unharmed.

The squad&#x27;s final action in the war is the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, during which the American soldiers are shocked by what they witness. The sergeant befriends a young boy he finds in the concentration camp, but the boy dies that same afternoon. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night when Schroeder approaches him, attempting to surrender. The sergeant stabs Schroeder and then his squad arrives and informs him that the war in Europe ended four hours earlier. This time, as the squad walks away, Private Griff notices that Schroeder is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment. Private Zab, in voice-over, remarks that he and his fellow American troops have more in common with this Nazi soldier, because they have all been through the war and survived, than they do with all of the replacements they fought alongside, but who are dead.

==Production==
Warner Bros. was interested in filming &quot;The Big Red One&quot; in the late 1950s, sending Fuller on a trip to Europe to scout locations. Fuller directed &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot; as a dry run for the film. When Fuller argued with Jack L. Warner and his studio over cuts they made to &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, the plans for &quot;The Big Red One&quot; were dropped.

In the project&#x27;s early stages, at Jack L. Warner&#x27;s urging, John Wayne was lined up to play the sergeant, but Fuller felt that he was not right for the role.

Peter Bogdanovich helped set up the film at Paramount Pictures, which paid Fuller to write a script. When Paramount head Frank Yablans left the studio, though, the project was put in turnaround. It shifted over to Lorimar with Bogdanovich to produce (he says Fuller wanted him to play the Robert Carradine part), but then Bogdanovich pulled out and brought in Gene Corman to produce.

=== The Reconstruction ===
The restored version, dubbed &quot;the Reconstruction&quot; and completed in 2004, adds 47 minutes to the film&#x27;s running time, bringing it much closer to the form Fuller imagined before the studio took it away from him. Film critic Richard Schickel — who praised the 1980 version in &quot;Time&quot; when it was released — took the lead on the restoration, which relied on locating footage allegedly stashed in the Warner Bros. vault in Kansas City. He was aided by editor Bryan McKenzie and Bogdanovich.

==Release==
The film was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.

===Critical reception===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 90% approval rating with an average rating of 7.8/10, based on 48 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;The reconstruction of Samuel Fuller&#x27;s epic account of his days in North Africa in World War II elevates the film into the pantheon of great war movies.&quot; For &quot;the Reconstruction&quot; cut, Metacritic assigned a score of 77 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his review of the original, theatrical version of the film, Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, and wrote: While this is an expensive epic, he hasn&#x27;t fallen to the temptations of the epic form. He doesn&#x27;t give us a lot of phony meaning, as if to justify the scope of the production. There aren&#x27;t a lot of deep, significant speeches. In the ways that count, &quot;The Big Red One&quot; is still a B-movie – hard-boiled, filled with action, held together by male camaraderie, directed with a lean economy of action. It&#x27;s one of the most expensive B-pictures ever made, and I think that helps it fit the subject. &quot;A&quot; war movies are about war, but &quot;B&quot; war movies are about soldiers.

In November 2004, Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and added it to his list of &quot;great movies&quot;.

&quot;The Big Red One&quot; ranks 483rd on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. Terry Lawson of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; called it the greatest war movie of all time.

<doc id="172671" wikidata="Q104340" url="?curid=172671" title="Harold Lloyd">
<text>Harold Clayton Lloyd Sr. (April 20, 1893 – March 8, 1971) was an American actor, comedian, and stunt performer who appeared in many silent comedy films.

One of the most influential film comedians of the silent era, Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and talkies, from 1914 to 1947. His bespectacled &quot;glasses character&quot; was a resourceful, ambitious go-getter who reflected the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States.

His films frequently contained &quot;thrill sequences&quot; of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (dangerous, but risk exaggerated by camera angles) in &quot;Safety Last!&quot; (1923) is considered one of the more enduring images in cinema. Lloyd performed lesser stunts himself despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, and it was almost undetectable on the screen).

==Early life==
Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893, in Burchard, Nebraska, the son of James Darsie Lloyd and Sarah Elisabeth Fraser. His paternal great-grandparents were Welsh. In 1910, after his father had several business venture failures, Lloyd&#x27;s parents divorced. Lloyd and his father relocated to San Diego, California, where he attended San Diego High School.

Lloyd became interested in theater as a child, and worked in repertory companies. He often experimented with makeup to disguise his youthful appearance.

==Career==
===Silent shorts and features===
Lloyd worked with Thomas Edison&#x27;s motion picture company, and his first role was a small part as a Yaqui Indian in the production of &quot;The Old Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot;. At the age of 20, Lloyd moved to Los Angeles and took juvenile roles in several Keystone Film Company comedies.

He tried to find work at the Universal studio, but &quot;the gatekeeper was a crabby old soul who let me understand that it would be a great pleasure to keep me out&quot;, as Lloyd recalled in his 1928 memoir. He solved his problem with the ingenuity of his later screen character: &quot;The next morning I brought a makeup box. At noon I dodged behind a billboard, made up, mingled with the [extras] and returned with them through the gate without challenge.&quot;

Lloyd soon became friendly with aspiring filmmaker Hal Roach. Lloyd began collaborating with Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. Roach and Lloyd created &quot;Lonesome Luke&quot;, a comic character inspired by the success of Charlie Chaplin. Luke was a comic grotesque with loud clothes and a false moustache, similar to many early screen comics, but the young Lloyd gave the character great energy and enthusiasm. His antics won a popular following, and his one-reel, 10-minute comedies were soon expanded to two-reel, 20-minute comedies. Hal Roach hired Bebe Daniels to support Lloyd in 1914; Lloyd and Daniels became involved romantically and were known as &quot;The Boy&quot; and &quot;The Girl&quot;.

By late 1917, Lloyd had tired of Lonesome Luke and wanted to develop his screen presence beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. He envisioned an entirely new character, not a costumed clown but an everyday young man in street clothes who faced comic situations with resourcefulness. To make the look of the new character distinctive, he adopted a pair of lensless, horn-rimmed glasses.

Lloyd thought that Pathé, Roach&#x27;s distributor, would resist the new character because the Lonesome Luke films were proven moneymakers, and the company didn&#x27;t want to lose that revenue. &quot;Privately I believed that Pathé would conclude to hire another comedian and carry on with Lonesome Luke&quot;, wrote Lloyd. &quot;Roach, however, argued my case better than I could have done.&quot; Lloyd agreed to a compromise: He would continue to make Lonesome Luke two-reelers, but he would introduce his new &quot;Glass&quot; character in less expensive one-reel shorts. As the new character caught on, Lonesome Luke was phased out.

The &quot;Glass&quot; character (often named &quot;Harold&quot; in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. &quot;When I adopted the glasses&quot;, Lloyd recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, &quot;it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable.&quot;

Unlike most silent comedy personae, &quot;Harold&quot; was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character&#x27;s debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in &quot;From Hand to Mouth&quot; to a wealthy socialite in &quot;Captain Kidd&#x27;s Kids&quot;.
In 1919, Bebe Daniels declined to renew her contract with Hal Roach, leaving the Lloyd series to pursue her dramatic aspirations. Later that year, Lloyd replaced Daniels with Mildred Davis after being told by Roach to watch Davis in a movie. Reportedly, the more Lloyd watched Davis, the more he liked her. Lloyd&#x27;s first reaction in seeing her was that &quot;she looked like a big French doll&quot;. Lloyd and Davis married in 1923.

On August 24, 1919, while posing for some promotional still photographs in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he picked up what he thought was a prop bomb and lit it with a cigarette. It exploded and mangled his right hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was in the act of lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930: &quot;I thought I would surely be so disabled that I would never be able to work again. I didn&#x27;t suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, &#x27;Life is worth while. &quot;Just to be alive&quot;.″ I still think so.&quot;

Beginning in 1921, Roach and Lloyd moved from shorts to feature-length comedies. These included the acclaimed &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot;, which (along with Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Kid&quot;) pioneered the combination of complex character development and film comedy, the highly popular &quot;Safety Last!&quot; (1923), which cemented Lloyd&#x27;s stardom (and is the oldest film on the American Film Institute&#x27;s List of 100 Most Thrilling Movies), and &quot;Why Worry?&quot; (1923). Although Lloyd performed many athletic stunts in his films, Harvey Parry was his stunt double for the more dangerous sequences.

Lloyd and Roach parted ways in 1924, and Lloyd formed his own independent production company, the Harold Lloyd Film Corporation, He now made feature films exclusively, releasing them first through Pathé, then Paramount. These included his accomplished comedies &quot;Girl Shy&quot;, &quot;The Freshman&quot; (his highest-grossing silent feature), &quot;The Kid Brother&quot; and &quot;Speedy&quot;, his final silent film. All of these films were enormously successful and profitable, and Lloyd eventually became the highest-paid film performer of the 1920s.

===Talkies and transition===
In 1929, Lloyd had completed the silent feature &quot;Welcome Danger&quot;, but talking pictures had become a sensation. He decided to remake the entire film with sound, using a new, stage-trained supporting cast for the dialogue exchanges. The silent version was made available to theaters that had not yet converted to sound, but the talking version became the standard edition of the film. &quot;Welcome Danger&quot; was a huge financial success, with audiences eager to hear Lloyd&#x27;s voice on film.

Lloyd survived the transition to sound and made several talking comedies, including &quot;Feet First&quot;, with a similar scenario to &quot;Safety Last&quot;, which found him clinging to a skyscraper at the climax; &quot;Movie Crazy&quot; with Constance Cummings; &quot;The Cat&#x27;s-Paw&quot;, which was a dark political comedy and a big departure for Lloyd; and &quot;The Milky Way&quot;, which was Lloyd&#x27;s only attempt at the fashionable genre of the screwball comedy film.
To this point, the films had been produced by Lloyd&#x27;s company. However, his go-getting screen character was out of touch with Great Depression movie audiences of the 1930s. Lloyd&#x27;s rate of film releases, which had been one or two a year in the 1920s, slowed to about one every two years. As his absences from the screen increased, his popularity declined, as did the fortunes of his production company. His final film of the decade, &quot;Professor Beware&quot; (1938), was made by the Paramount staff, with Lloyd functioning only as actor and partial financier.

In 1931 he co-founded the 400-seat Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals. Gladys Lloyd Cassell (wife of Edward G. Robinson), Sam Hardy, and Lloyd&#x27;s mother raised funds for it.

On March 23, 1937, Lloyd sold the land of his studio, Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company, to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The location is now the site of the Los Angeles California Temple.

Lloyd produced a few comedies for RKO Radio Pictures in the early 1940s, including Lucille Ball&#x27;s &quot;A Girl, a Guy, and a Gob&quot; in 1941, but otherwise retired from the screen until 1947. He returned for an additional starring appearance in &quot;The Sin of Harold Diddlebock&quot;, an ill-fated homage to Lloyd&#x27;s career, directed by Preston Sturges and financed by Howard Hughes. This film had the inspired idea of following Harold&#x27;s Jazz Age, optimistic character from &quot;The Freshman&quot; into the Great Depression years. &quot;Diddlebock&quot; opened with footage from &quot;The Freshman&quot; (for which Lloyd was paid a royalty of $50,000, matching his actor&#x27;s fee) and Lloyd was sufficiently youthful-looking to match the older scenes quite well. Lloyd and Sturges had different conceptions of the material and fought frequently during the shoot; Lloyd was particularly concerned that, while Sturges had spent three to four months on the script of the first third of the film, &quot;the last two-thirds of it he wrote in a week or less.&quot; The finished film was released briefly in 1947, then shelved by producer Hughes. Hughes issued a recut version of the film in 1951 through RKO under the title &quot;Mad Wednesday&quot;. Such was Lloyd&#x27;s disdain that he sued Howard Hughes, the California Corporation, and RKO for damages to his reputation &quot;as an outstanding motion picture star and personality&quot;, eventually accepting a $30,000 settlement.

===Radio, nude photography and retirement===
In October 1944, Lloyd emerged as the director and host of &quot;The Old Gold Comedy Theater&quot;, an NBC radio anthology series, after Preston Sturges, who had turned the job down, recommended him for it. The show presented half-hour radio adaptations of recently successful film comedies, beginning with &quot;Palm Beach Story&quot; with Claudette Colbert and Robert Young.

Some saw &quot;The Old Gold Comedy Theater&quot; as being a lighter version of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, and it featured some of the best-known film and radio personalities of the day, including Fred Allen, June Allyson, Lucille Ball, Ralph Bellamy, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Herbert Marshall, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Jane Wyman and Alan Young. But the show&#x27;s half-hour format—which meant the material might have been truncated too severely—and Lloyd&#x27;s sounding somewhat ill at ease on the air for much of the season (though he spent weeks training himself to speak on radio prior to the show&#x27;s premiere, and seemed more relaxed toward the end of the series run) may have worked against it.

&quot;The Old Gold Comedy Theater&quot; ended in June 1945 with an adaptation of &quot;Tom, Dick and Harry&quot;, featuring June Allyson and Reginald Gardiner and was not renewed for the following season. Many years later, acetate discs of 29 of the shows were discovered in Lloyd&#x27;s home, and they now circulate among old-time radio collectors.

Lloyd remained involved in a number of other interests, including civic and charity work. Inspired by having overcome his own serious injuries and burns, he was very active as a Freemason and Shriner with the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. He was a Past Potentate of Al-Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles, and was eventually selected as Imperial Potentate of the Shriners of North America for the year 1949–50. At the installation ceremony for this position on July 25, 1949, 90,000 people were present at Soldier Field, including then sitting U.S. President Harry S Truman, also a 33° Scottish Rite Mason. In recognition of his services to the nation and Freemasonry, Lloyd was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour in 1955 and coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, 33°, in 1965.

He appeared as himself on several television shows during his retirement, first on Ed Sullivan&#x27;s variety show &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; June 5, 1949, and again on July 6, 1958. He appeared as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on April 26, 1953, and three times on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;: in 1954 for a tribute to Mack Sennett and another for Bebe Daniels, and in 1955, when he was surprised for his own tribute.

On November 6, 1956, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Career Will Be Filmed&quot;. It said, as the first step, Lloyd would write the story of his life for Simon and Schuster. Then, the movie would be produced by Jerry Wald for 20th Century-Fox, limiting the screenplay to Lloyd&#x27;s professional career. The tentative title for both was &quot;The Glass Character&quot;, based on the glasses which were Lloyd&#x27;s trademark. Neither project materialized.

Lloyd studied colors and microscopy, and he was very involved with photography, including 3D photography and color film experiments. Some of the earliest two-color Technicolor tests were shot at his Beverly Hills home (these are included as extra material in the &quot;Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection&quot; DVD Box Set). He became known for his nude photographs of models, such as Bettie Page and stripper Dixie Evans, for a number of men&#x27;s magazines. He also took photos of Marilyn Monroe lounging at his pool in a bathing suit, which were published after her death.

In 2004, his granddaughter Suzanne produced &quot;Harold Lloyd&#x27;s Hollywood Nudes in 3D!&quot;, a book of selections from his photographs.().

Lloyd also provided encouragement and support for a number of younger actors, such as Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner and particularly Jack Lemmon, whom Harold declared as his own choice to play him in a movie of his life and work.

===Renewed interest===
Lloyd kept copyright control of most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement.

Lloyd did not grant cinematic re-releases because most theaters could not accommodate an organist to play music for his films, and Lloyd did not wish his work to be accompanied by a pianist: &quot;I just don&#x27;t like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos.&quot; Similarly, his features never were shown on television as Lloyd&#x27;s price was high: &quot;I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That&#x27;s a high price, but if I don&#x27;t get it, I&#x27;m not going to show it. They&#x27;ve come close to it, but they haven&#x27;t come all the way up.&quot; As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work generally has been more widely distributed. Lloyd&#x27;s film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.

In the early 1960s, Lloyd produced two compilation films, &quot;Harold Lloyd&#x27;s World of Comedy&quot; and &quot;The Funny Side of Life&quot;, featuring scenes from his old comedies. The first film premiered at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, where Lloyd was fêted as a major rediscovery. In 1965 he was interviewed by the Social Security Administration.

The film was well received by most critics and audiences as a reminder of Lloyd&#x27;s creative output as the third (with Chaplin and Keaton) of the &quot;Big Three&quot; great silent comedy filmmakers.

The renewed interest in Lloyd helped restore his status among film historians. Throughout his later years, he screened his films for audiences at special charity and educational events, to great acclaim, and found a particularly receptive audience among college audiences: &quot;Their whole response was tremendous because they didn&#x27;t miss a gag; anything that was even a little subtle, they got it right away.&quot;
Following his death, and after extensive negotiations, most of his feature films were leased to Time-Life Films in 1974. As Tom Dardis confirms: &quot;Time-Life prepared horrendously edited musical-sound-track versions of the silent films, which are intended to be shown on TV at sound speed [24 frames per second], and which represent everything that Harold feared would happen to his best films&quot;. Time-Life released the films as half-hour television shows, with two clips per show. These were often near-complete versions of the early two-reelers, but also included extended sequences from features such as &quot;Safety Last!&quot; (terminating at the clock sequence) and &quot;Feet First&quot; (presented silent, but with Walter Scharf&#x27;s score from Lloyd&#x27;s own 1960s re-release). Time-Life released several of the feature films more or less intact, also using some of Scharf&#x27;s scores which had been commissioned by Lloyd. The Time-Life clips series included a narrator rather than intertitles. Various narrators were used internationally: the English-language series was narrated by Henry Corden.

The Time-Life series was frequently repeated by the BBC in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, and in 1990 the documentary &quot;Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius&quot; was produced by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, following two similar series based on Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Composer Carl Davis wrote a new score for &quot;Safety Last!&quot; which he performed live during a showing of the film with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra to great acclaim in 1993.

The Brownlow and Gill documentary was shown as part of the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot;, and created a renewed interest in Lloyd&#x27;s work in the United States, but the films were largely unavailable. In 2002, the Harold Lloyd Trust re-launched him with the publication of the book &quot;Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian&quot; by Jeffrey Vance and Suzanne Lloyd, and a series of feature films and short subjects called &quot;The Harold Lloyd Classic Comedies&quot; produced by Jeffrey Vance with executive producer Suzanne Lloyd and Harold Lloyd Entertainment. The new cable television and home video versions of Lloyd&#x27;s great silent features and many shorts were remastered with new orchestral scores by Robert Israel. These versions are frequently shown on the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) cable channel. A DVD collection of these restored or remastered versions of his feature films and important short subjects was released by New Line Cinema in partnership with the Harold Lloyd Trust in 2005, along with theatrical screenings in the United States, Canada and Europe.

Criterion Collection has acquired the home video rights to the Lloyd library and has released &quot;Safety Last!&quot;, The &quot;Freshman&quot; and &quot;Speedy&quot;.

In the June 2006, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program book for &quot;Safety Last!&quot;, film historian Jeffrey Vance stated that Robert A. Golden, Lloyd&#x27;s assistant director, routinely doubled for Harold Lloyd between 1921 and 1927. According to Vance, Golden doubled Lloyd in the bit with Harold shimmy shaking off the building&#x27;s ledge after a mouse crawls up his trousers.

==Personal life==

Lloyd married leading lady Mildred Davis on February 10, 1923, in Los Angeles. They had two children together: Gloria Lloyd (1924–2012) and Harold Clayton Lloyd Jr. (1931–1971). They also adopted Gloria Freeman (1924–1986) in September 1930, whom they renamed Marjorie Elizabeth Lloyd but was known as Peggy for most of her life. Lloyd discouraged Davis from continuing her acting career. He later relented, but by that time her career momentum was lost. On August 18, 1969, Davis died in St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California, from a heart attack two years before Lloyd&#x27;s death. Though her real age was a guarded secret, a family spokesperson at the time indicated she was 66 years old. Other sources claim she was 68 years old at the time of her death. Their son, Harold Clayton Lloyd Jr., who was also an actor, died from complications of a stroke three months after his father.
In 1925, at the height of his movie career, Lloyd became a Freemason at the Alexander Hamilton Lodge No. 535 of Hollywood, advancing quickly through both the York Rite and Scottish Rite, and then joined Al Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles. He took the degrees of the Royal Arch with his father. In 1926, he became a 32° Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Los Angeles, California. He was vested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honor (KCCH) and eventually with the Inspector General Honorary, 33rd degree.

Lloyd&#x27;s Beverly Hills home, Greenacres, was built in 1926–1929, with 44 rooms, 26 bathrooms, 12 fountains, 12 gardens and a nine-hole golf course. A portion of Lloyd&#x27;s personal inventory of his silent films (then estimated to be worth $2 million) was destroyed in August 1943 when his film vault caught fire. Seven firemen were overcome while inhaling chlorine gas from the blaze. Lloyd was saved by his wife, who dragged him to safety outdoors after he collapsed at the door of the film vault. The fire spared the main house and out-buildings. After attempting to maintain the home as a museum of film history, as Lloyd had wished, the Lloyd family sold it to a developer in 1975.
The grounds were subdivided but the main house and the estate&#x27;s principal gardens remain and are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films like &quot;Westworld&quot; and &quot;The Loved One&quot;. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Lloyd was a Republican who campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was also a founding member of the Hollywood Committee for Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

==Death==
Lloyd died of prostate cancer on March 8, 1971, at the age of 77 in his Greenacres home in Beverly Hills, California. He was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. His former co-star Bebe Daniels died eight days after him, and his son Harold Lloyd Jr. died three months after him.

== Honors ==
In 1927, his was the fourth concrete ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, preserving his handprints, footprints and autograph, along with the outline of his famed glasses (which were actually a pair of sunglasses with the lenses removed). The ceremony took place directly in front of the Hollywood Masonic Temple, which was the meeting place of the Masonic lodge to which he belonged.

In 1953, Lloyd received an Academy Honorary Award for being a &quot;master comedian and good citizen&quot;. The second citation was a snub to Chaplin, who at that point had fallen foul of McCarthyism and had his entry visa to the United States revoked. Regardless of the political overtones, Lloyd accepted the award in good spirit.

Lloyd was honored in 1960 for his contribution to motion pictures with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1503 Vine Street. In 1994, he was honored with his image on a United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.

Lloyd&#x27;s birthplace in Burchard, Nebraska is maintained as a museum and open by appointment.

<text>Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is a public research university in Richmond, Virginia, United States. VCU was founded in 1838 as the medical department of Hampden–Sydney College, becoming the Medical College of Virginia in 1854. In 1968, the Virginia General Assembly merged MCV with the Richmond Professional Institute, founded in 1917, to create Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2022, more than 28,000 students pursued 217 degree and certificate programs through VCU&#x27;s 11 schools and three colleges. The VCU Health System supports health care education, research, and patient care. It was the only school in the South to have graduated a class every year during the American Civil War.

VCU had a record $506 million in sponsored research funding in the fiscal year 2024 and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. VCU&#x27;s athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I and are collectively known as the VCU Rams. They are members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The VCU campus includes historic buildings such as the Ginter House, now used by the school&#x27;s provost.

==History==
VCU&#x27;s history began in 1838 when the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College opened in Richmond. In 1844, it moved into its first permanent home, the Egyptian Building. In 1854, the Medical Department of Hampden–Sydney College received an independent charter from the Virginia General Assembly and became the &quot;Medical College of Virginia&quot; (MCV). A few years later in 1860, MCV conveyed all its property to the Commonwealth of Virginia and becomes a state institution in exchange for $30,000.

As the Civil War began, Richmond became a focal point for battle and politics. After a long siege, Ulysses S. Grant captured Petersburg and Richmond in early April 1865. As the fall of Petersburg became imminent, on &quot;Evacuation Sunday&quot; (April 2), President Davis, his Cabinet, and the Confederate defenders abandoned Richmond and fled south. The retreating soldiers were under orders to set fire to bridges, the armory, and supply warehouses as they left. The fire in the largely abandoned city spread out of control, and along with Union shelling, large parts of Richmond, and virtually all MCV buildings, were destroyed. The city surrendered the next day; Union troops put out the raging fires in the city. Because of the worthless Confederate currency and high inflation, the medical school sold its ambulance horse for enough money to continue operation.

After the Civil War MCV participated significantly in medical advances, including in anesthesia and antisepsis. In 1893, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, later University College of Medicine, was established by Hunter Holmes McGuire, Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s friend and personal doctor who had amputated Jackson&#x27;s arm, just three blocks away from MCV. In 1912, McGuire Hall opened as the new home of the University College of Medicine. The following year, MCV and UCM merged through the efforts of George Ben Johnston and Stuart McGuire. MCV acquired the Memorial Hospital as a result of the merger.

Richmond Professional Institute traces its roots back to 1917, when it began as the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health. In 1925, it became the Richmond division of The College of William &amp; Mary. In 1939, this division became the Richmond Professional Institute of The College of William &amp; Mary (RPI). In 1947, the MCV Foundation was incorporated and in 1962 RPI separated from William &amp; Mary to become an independent state institution. Then in 1968, state legislation (Wayne Commission Report) merged MCV and RPI to become Virginia Commonwealth University. Descendant of Thomas Jefferson, Pulitzer Prize winner and editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Virginius Dabney was named the first Rector of VCU and went on to write &quot;Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History&quot;.

=== Expansion ===
Warren W. Brandt was the first president of VCU. During his tenure, 32 degree programs were added, and the School of Allied Health Professions and the School of Community Services were established. In addition, more than $20 million of new construction was completed or initiated on both campuses, including the James Branch Cabell Library, Rhoads Hall, the School of Business building, the Larrick Student Center and a large addition to Sanger Hall.

In the 1980s, and under the leadership of VCU President Edmund Ackell, a major overhaul of the university&#x27;s governance system and administrative structure was initiated. Ackell lead the administration in instituting a new system for both short-range and long-range university planning; establishing faculty convocation and a new set of faculty tenure and promotion guidelines; and establishing greater access to the community by supporting the use of the university&#x27;s research and educational resources to meet social needs.
Eugene Trani became the president of VCU in 1990. During his tenure VCU became one of the largest universities in Virginia, growing from an enrollment of 21,764 in 1990, to 32,284 at the time of his retirement. VCU was the state&#x27;s first university to enroll over 30,000 students. Under Trani&#x27;s leadership VCU and the VCU Health System undertook more than $2.2 billion in capital construction and renovation projects.

In 2013, VCU was awarded a $62 million federal grant to oversee a national research consortium of universities, hospitals and clinics to study what happens to service members and veterans who suffer mild traumatic brain injuries or concussions.

In 2010, VCU received a $20 million National Institutes of Health grant to join a nationwide consortium of research institutions working to turn laboratory discoveries into treatments for patients. The Clinical and Translational Science Award made VCU the only academic health center in Virginia to join the CTSA network. In 2011, the university&#x27;s Carnegie classification was changed to &quot;Very High Research Activity,&quot; with over 255 million in sponsored research.

In 2009, Michael Rao was appointed the fifth president of VCU. President Rao oversaw a major expansion in enrollment, funding and facilities at VCU. The construction of the Engineering Research and STEM buildings solidified VCU&#x27;s strategy of becoming a leading scientific university. In 2022, VCU received a $104 million gift, the largest in university history, to support a new Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health. The university surpassed $400 million in sponsored research funding. As a result, VCU was designated a top 50 university by the National Science Foundation for research expenditures. In 2018, a series of protests by adjunct faculty were held at VCU, over low pay and no benefits. Ahead of the 2018-19 budget, $4.2 million was allocated to increase adjunct faculty funding from $800 to $1,000 per credit hour, about $1,000 less than what the coalition was demanding. The administration implemented a campus plan which featured a campus green, arts building, dormitories, general student facilities, and renovations of the historic buildings on campus.

==Campuses==
 Virginia Commonwealth University has two main campuses in Richmond, Va.: the Monroe Park Campus, located west of downtown Richmond, and the MCV Campus in the urban center. Additionally, VCU has a branch campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, along with numerous regional facilities.

In 1940, the building was purchased by the City of Richmond, which converted much of its interior for municipal use. The Richmond Police Department occupied the theater&#x27;s basement, where they opened up office space, classrooms, a gymnasium, and a shooting range for the police academy. An underground swimming pool was maintained, initially for training purposes, until it was filled in with concrete during the 2014 renovation. Many are familiar with the basement of the Mosque as the location for VCU class registration, which occurred several times each year.

The theater was designed in Moorish Revival style by Marcellus E. Wright Sr. in association with Charles M. Robinson and Charles Custer Robinson circa 1925. J. R. Ray, of the Richmond Tile and Mosaic Works, was responsible for the widely used ornamental tile, and J. Frank Jones, of the Rambusch Decorating Company, oversaw the interior decoration. The building officially opened in 1927, and was dedicated by the Shriners in 1928.

Performers such as Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Bill Burr, Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, Frank Sinatra, Roy Buchanan, B. B. King, Widespread Panic and The Supremes held shows at this venue. Notable Broadway performances such as &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, and &quot;Cats&quot; have been past visitors of The Altria Theater.

====Recreational sports====
Recreational Sports offers facilities on both campuses. Opened in spring 2010, the newly renovated Cary Street Gym includes the 18,000-square-foot fitness center, a rock climbing wall, two pools, racquetball and basketball courts, a track and an aerobics mezzanine.

The MCV Campus Recreation and Aquatic Center provide space for basketball, volleyball, racquetball and other sports. A 25-meter, six-lane pool is available for lap swimming, water basketball and volleyball.

The VCU Outdoor Adventure Program provides a full schedule of day trips and weekend excursions focused on such outdoor activities as camping, kayaking, white-water rafting, canoeing and caving.

====Service learning====
Service learning at VCU is a course-based, credit-bearing educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets community-identified needs. More than 3,000 VCU students are enrolled in service learning at VCU.

====Greek system====
Virginia Commonwealth University hosts 36 international fraternities and sororities across four governing councils with over 1,700 students. Within the student body, a total of 6.3% of women join a sorority and 8% of men join a fraternity. VCU&#x27;s fraternity and sorority community has grown particularly rapidly in the last few years. .

===Security===
VCU&#x27;s police force consists of 99 sworn police officers and more than 200 security personnel. VCU also provides a free Security Escort service (RAM SAFE) to students and faculty to assist them in reaching their destination and have stationed more than 370 Emergency Reporting Telephone Systems in various areas throughout campus.

==Athletics==

Having competed at the NCAA Division I level for little more than 30 years, Virginia Commonwealth University has sponsored a broad-based program of intercollegiate athletics. The VCU Rams have won in excess of 30 conference championships, participated in numerous NCAA post-season championship events, including a run to the Final Four in men&#x27;s basketball in 2011, and had a number of All-Americans—both academic and athletic. VCU currently sponsors sixteen varsity teams in NCAA Division I play through the Atlantic 10 Conference (A10).
VCU Men&#x27;s tennis is one of the school&#x27;s most successful programs. The team is coached by Paul Kostin who is one of five Division I coaches to reach the 900-victory mark. The Men&#x27;s tennis team holds 12 CAA Championships, 18 NCAA tournament appearances, and 17 years of finishing in the top 25 rankings in the country. In 2000, VCU men&#x27;s tennis had its best season, finishing runner up to Stanford in the NCAA Finals Championship match. The team finished with a No. 9 ranking in the country.

Also under coach Paul Kostin, VCU&#x27;s women&#x27;s tennis team has 3 CAA championships, 12 NCAA appearances, and 8 years in the top 25.

VCU Baseball has won a total of 3 CAA Championships and has been to a total of 8 NCAA Regionals. Bradley LeCroy is VCU Baseball&#x27;s head coach, and the school plays its games at The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia).

Other intercollegiate sports include Men and Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men and Women&#x27;s Cross Country, Field Hockey, Golf, Men and Women&#x27;s Soccer (played at Sports Backers Stadium), Men and Women&#x27;s Track and Field, Volleyball, and Women&#x27;s Lacrosse.

VCU also has many student run club teams. These sports not sponsored by the university include coed &amp; all-girl cheerleading, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby union, ultimate, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, cycling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crew and dodgeball. Previous club sports have also included ice hockey, wrestling and tennis.

===Men’s basketball===


VCU reached the Final Four in the 2011 NCAA tournament. The team has won a total of 9 conference championships with the most recent coming in 2015, the team&#x27;s first A10 championship win. The VCU Rams currently play at the Stuart C. Siegel Center, where they hold the 11th highest Home Court winning percentage in Division I basketball with a winning percentage of .8579

In the 2011 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament, VCU qualified as an at-large bid, having to play in the newly formatted tournament&#x27;s &quot;First Four&quot; against USC. The decision to allow VCU to participate in the tournament was widely criticized among pundits and the media. VCU defeated USC 59–46 in the &quot;First Four&quot; play-in game. VCU then went on to upset Georgetown 74–56 in the round of 64. The 11th-seeded VCU Rams then upset third-seeded Purdue 94–76 to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history. In the sweet sixteen, VCU defeated tenth-seeded Florida State 72–71 on a last second bucket in overtime to advance to the Elite 8 for the first time in school history. VCU beat the No. 1 seed Kansas in the Southwest Regional final by a score of 71–61. It was the Rams&#x27; first trip to the Final Four. Against Butler in the Final Four, VCU lost 70–62. The 2010–11 VCU Rams men&#x27;s basketball team finished sixth in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll at the end of the season. This was the highest ranking in VCU&#x27;s history and the highest ranking of any team from the CAA.

=== Women&#x27;s basketball ===
The VCU Rams Women&#x27;s team enjoyed its most successful season in 2008–2009. Led by future WNBA Draft Pick Quanitra Hollingsworth, that team finished the season with a mark of 26–7 overall and a 15–3 conference record. Notably the team was a perfect 16–0 at home. After finishing second in the Colonial Athletic Association the team headed to their first ever NCAA tournament game as a 10 seed, where the No. 7 seeded Rutgers eliminated them 57–51 at the RAC in Piscataway, N.J. The 2009–10 squad also reached the Sweet 16 of the WNIT.

===Athletics rivals===
VCU&#x27;s main rival is Old Dominion University. The &quot;VCU-ODU basketball rivalry&quot; is often regarded as the best college basketball rivalry in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Rams&#x27; intra-city rivalry with University of Richmond (&quot;Black &amp; Blue Classic&quot;), is bound to heat up now that the two schools are playing in the same conference again for the first time since 2001.

===Rowdy Rams===
The Rowdy Rams is a student-run athletic support organization that focuses on VCU men&#x27;s basketball, while also attending and supporting the university&#x27;s 16 other varsity teams. The group began during the 2002–2003 basketball season when a group of VCU Pep Band members and other students began coordinating cheers together and taking road trips to away games. The following year, the Rowdy Rams procured funding from the SGA and sponsorship from VCU&#x27;s Athletic Department, solidifying themselves as an official organization. In May 2013, The Rowdy Rams won the annual Naismith Student Section of the Year award, which awards the most passionate student section in college basketball.

==Notable alumni==
VCU&#x27;s Alumni are distinguished in various fields, notably interdisciplinary ones. Patch Adams is a medical doctor, author, activist, and clown; Christopher Poole is an internet entrepreneur and founder of 4chan, which revolutionized internet communication; David Baldacci is a best-selling author and speaker; William Gifford is the CEO for Altria, the largest producer of tobacco products in the United States and partial owners of Juul.

<text>Walther Immanuel Funk (18 August 1890 – 31 May 1960) was a German economist and Nazi official who served as Reich Minister for Economic Affairs (1938–1945) and president of Reichsbank (1939–1945). During his incumbency, he oversaw the mobilization of the German economy for rearmament and arrangement of forced labor in concentration camps. After the war he was tried and convicted as a major war criminal by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. Sentenced to life in prison, he remained incarcerated until he was released on health grounds in 1957. He died three years later.

==Early life==
Funk was born into a merchant family in 1890 in Danzkehmen (present-day Sosnowka in the Nesterovsky District of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast) near Trakehnen in East Prussia. He was the only one of the Nuremberg defendants who was born in the former eastern territories of Germany. He was the son of Wiesenbaumeister Walther Funk the elder and his wife Sophie (née Urbschat). He studied law, economics, and philosophy at the University of Berlin and the University of Leipzig. In World War I, he joined the infantry, but was wounded and subsequently discharged as medically unfit for service in 1916. Following the end of the war, he worked as a journalist, and in 1924 he became the editor of the centre-right financial newspaper the &quot;Berliner Börsenzeitung&quot;. In 1920, Funk married Luise Schmidt-Sieben.

==Political life==

Funk, who was a nationalist and anti-Marxist, resigned from the newspaper in the summer of 1931 and joined the Nazi Party, becoming close to Gregor Strasser, who arranged his first meeting with Adolf Hitler. Partially because of his interest in economic policy, he was elected a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy in July 1932, and within the party, he was made chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy in December 1932, a post that he did not hold for long. After the Nazi Party came to power, he stepped down from his &quot;Reichstag&quot; position and was made &quot;Reich&quot; Chief Press Officer, a post which involved censorship of anything deemed critical of Nazi policies. His boss was Joseph Goebbels.

==Nazi Germany==
In March 1933, Funk was appointed as a State Secretary (&quot;Staatssekretär&quot;) at the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (&quot;Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda&quot;). In the summer of 1936 when Hitler commissioned Albert Speer for the rebuilding of central Berlin, it was Funk who proposed his new title of &quot;Inspector-General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Reich Capital&quot;. 

On 5 February 1938, Funk became General Plenipotentiary for Economics (&quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für die Wirtschaft&quot;), as well as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of Economics (&quot;Reichswirtschaftsminister&quot;) permanently replacing Hjalmar Schacht, who had resigned on 26 November 1937. Funk also succeeded Schacht as Prussian Minister of Economics and Labor (&quot;Preußischer Minister für Wirtschaft und Arbeit&quot;) and as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Prussian State Council. He would hold all these posts until the fall of the Nazi regime. Schacht had been engaged in a power struggle with &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, who wanted to tie the ministry more closely to his Four Year Plan Office and who briefly served as Schacht&#x27;s immediate successor between November 1937 and January 1938.

Between April 1938 and March 1939 Funk was also a Director of the Swiss-based multi-national Bank of International Settlements, and in January 1939, Hitler appointed Funk as President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot;. Funk recorded that by 1938 the German state had confiscated Jewish property worth two million marks, using decrees from Hitler and other top Nazis to force German Jews to leave their property and assets to the State if they emigrated, such as the Reich Flight Tax.

On 30 August, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Funk was appointed by Hitler to the six-person Council of Ministers for Defense of the Reich which was set up to operate as a &quot;war cabinet&quot;. Throughout the war years, Funk was present at a great many important meetings, including that held in the Great Hall of the [still extant] Air Ministry on 13 February 1942 chaired by Field-Marshal Erhard Milch about the four-year plan, which embraced the entire economy. 30 crucial people were present. Funk sat to the right of Milch, at his request. After much debate Albert Vogler said &quot;there must be one man able to make decisions. Industry did not care who it was.&quot; After further discussion Funk stood up and nominated Milch as that man. Speer whispered to Milch this was not a good idea and Milch declined. Five days later Hitler conferred the role on Speer. As he and Funk walked Hitler back to his apartment in the Chancery Funk promised Speer that he would place everything at his disposal and do all in his power to help him. Speer relates that Funk &quot;kept the promise, with minor exceptions.&quot; In September 1943, Funk was appointed as a fourth member of the Central Planning Board, which was charged with managing the raw materials and manpower for the entire war economy. He subsequently joined Robert Ley, Speer and Goebbels in the struggle against the influence on Hitler by Martin Bormann. Funk and Milch were again together for Goering&#x27;s birthday party on 12 January 1944 when Funk, as he did every year, delivered the birthday speech at the banquet.

Funk stayed in office until nearly the end of the Nazi regime and was named by Hitler in his political testament to continue as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; for the Economy in the cabinet of Joseph Goebbels. However, after Goebbels&#x27; suicide on 1 May 1945, Funk was not named to the cabinet formed by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk. Arrested by American forces on 11 May, he was sent to Camp Ashcan to await trial.

==Nuremberg==

Funk was tried with other Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg trials. He was accused by Allied prosecutors of having been closely involved in the State confiscation and disposal of the property of German Jews; and of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity. He argued that, despite his employment titles, he had very little power in the regime. He did however, admit to signing the laws that &quot;aryanized&quot; Jewish property and in that respect claimed to be &quot;morally guilty&quot;. At the Nuremberg trials American Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson labeled Funk as &quot;The Banker of Gold Teeth&quot;, referring to the practice of extracting gold teeth from Nazi concentration camp victims, and forwarding the teeth to the Reichsbank for melting down to yield bullion. Many other gold items were stolen from victims, such as jewellery, eyeglasses and finger rings. Other items stolen from the victims included their clothing, furniture, artwork and paintings, as well as any wealth in stocks, shares, businesses and companies. Such business assets were taken by aryanization with often large and profitable businesses sold for less than their true worth. The monetary proceeds of auctions of such assets as furniture were passed to the Reichsbank in Max Heiliger accounts for use by the Nazi state or the SS. Even the hair of the victims was taken by shaving either just before or just after their murder. When clothing was distributed after the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen, blood stains were often visible at and near the bullet holes.

Funk was clearly distressed during the proceedings and cried during presentation of evidence such as the murders carried out in the Nazi concentration camps, and needed sleeping pills at night. Hjalmar Schacht relates that he, Funk and von Papen formed a close intimate circle at Nuremberg. He felt Funk was unable to comprehend the serious nature of the duties which he had undertaken. Schacht believed that there were many matters of which Funk had no knowledge whatsoever and that he gave a poor performance in the witness-box. However Albert Speer gave a different version of events. He said that when he first came into contact with Funk at Nuremberg &quot;he looked extremely worn and downcast.&quot; But &quot;Funk reasoned skillfully and in a way that stirred my pity&quot; in the witness box.

Göring meanwhile described Funk as &quot;an insignificant subordinate&quot;, but documentary evidence and his wartime biography &quot;Walther Funk, A Life for the Economy&quot; were used against him during the trial, leading to his conviction on counts 2, 3 and 4 of the indictment and his sentence of life imprisonment.

Funk was held at Spandau Prison along with other senior Nazis. He was released on 16 May 1957 because of ill health. He made last-minute visits to Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer and Baldur von Schirach before leaving the prison. He died of diabetes three years later in Düsseldorf.

==Culture==
Schacht, who knew Funk well, said he was &quot;extraordinarily musical&quot; being &quot;a first-rate connoisseur of music whose personal preferences in life were decidedly for the artistic and literary.&quot; At a dinner when he sat next to Funk, the orchestra played a melody by Franz Lehár. Funk remarked &quot;Ah! Lehár – the Fuhrer is particularly fond of his music.&quot; Schacht replied, jokingly, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity that Lehár is married to a Jewess&quot;, to which Funk immediately responded, &quot;That&#x27;s something the Fuhrer must not know on any account!&quot; Speer relates how Hitler played for him a record of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Les Préludes&quot; and said &quot;This is going to be our victory fanfare for the Russian campaign. Funk chose it!&quot;

<text>Cheap Truth was a free series of one-page, double-sided newsletters (i.e., fanzine) published in the period between 1983 and 1986. Its headquarters was in Austin, Texas. It was not-copyrighted and explicitly encouraged &quot;xerox pirates&quot; to circulate the zine for their own monetary gain or otherwise. It was the unofficial organ of a loose group of authors. This group called themselves many things, including &quot;The Movement&quot; but was later known as the Cyberpunk movement.

The zine was edited by the American science fiction author Bruce Sterling under the alias Vincent Omniaveritas (as in &quot;vincit omnia veritas&quot;). There were several contributors such as &quot;Sue Denim&quot; (as in pseu-donym, in this case Lewis Shiner), but the real identities behind some aliases are still not commonly known. The newsletter was critical towards what its editors regarded, at the time, as the &quot;stagnant state of popular science fiction&quot;.

<text>InterBase is a relational database management system (RDBMS) currently developed and marketed by Embarcadero Technologies. InterBase runs on the Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris operating systems as well as iOS and Android.

==Technology==
InterBase is a SQL-92-compliant relational database and supports standard interfaces such as JDBC, ODBC, and ADO.NET. 

==History==
===Multiversion concurrency control before InterBase===
Multiversion concurrency control is described in some detail in sections 4.3 and 5.5 of the 1981 paper &quot;Concurrency Control in Distributed Database Systems&quot; by Philip Bernstein and Nathan Goodman while employed by the Computer Corporation of America. Bernstein and Goodman&#x27;s paper cites a 1978 dissertation by D.P. Reed, which describes MVCC and claims it as an original work.

===Early years===

Jim Starkey was working at DEC on their DATATRIEVE 4th generation language 4GL product when he came up with an idea for a system to manage concurrent changes by many users. The idea simplified the existing problems of &quot;locking&quot; which were proving to be a serious problem for the new relational database systems being developed at the time. 

Although InterBase&#x27;s implementation is much more similar to the system described by Reed in his MIT dissertation than any other database that existed at the time and Starkey knew Bernstein from his previous position at the Computer Corporation of America and later at DEC, Starkey claims that he arrived at the idea of multiversion concurrency control independently. According to his blog, Starkey says:

The inspiration for multi-generational concurrency control was a database system done by Prime that supported page level snapshots. The intention of the feature was to give a reader a consistent view of the database without blocking writers. The idea intrigued me as a very useful characteristic of a database system.

===Open source===
In early 2000, Borland announced that InterBase would be released under open-source, and began negotiations to spin off a separate company to manage the product. The source code for InterBase version 6 was released under a variant of the Mozilla Public License in mid-2000.

With the InterBase division at Borland under new management, the company released a proprietary version of InterBase version 6 and then 6.5. Borland released several updates to the open source code before announcing that it would no longer actively develop the open source project. Firebird, an open source fork of the InterBase 6 code, however, remains in active development.

In 2001, a backdoor was discovered in the software that had been present in all versions since 1994 and then resolved.
===CodeGear===
On May 7, 2008, Borland and Embarcadero Technologies announced that Embarcadero had &quot;signed a definitive asset purchase agreement to purchase CodeGear.&quot; The acquisition, for approximately $24.5 million, closed on 30 June 2008.

<text>Innerleithen () is a civil parish and a small town in the committee area of Tweeddale, in the Scottish Borders. It was formerly in the historic county of Peeblesshire or Tweeddale.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Innerleithen&quot; comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning &quot;confluence of the Leithen&quot;, because it is here that the river joins the Tweed. The prefix &quot;Inner-/Inver-&quot; (&quot;Inbhir-&quot;) is common in many Scottish placenames, such as Inverness and Inverurie. At this confluence, the Tweed flows approximately west-east, and the Leithen Water flows from the north.

==Layout==
The layout of the town is dominated by the surrounding hills. To the north the peaked hill of Lee Pen (502m), and its southerly spur Caerlee Hill (258m). To the east the rounded hill of Pirn Craig (363m) - locally known as &quot;Rocky&quot; - and its townward spur of Windy Knowe (155m), also known as &quot;Pirn Hill&quot;, and to the south, beyond the Tweed, the extended of ridge of Plora Craig rises sharply from the southerly bank. Thus the town has grown in an inverted &#x27;T&#x27; shape north up the valley of the Leithen and east-west along north bank flood plain of the Tweed.

==History==
The area occupied by the town has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. The remains of an Iron Age palisaded settlement, with seven circular houses are visible on the summit of Caerlee Hill. This is a scheduled Ancient Monument. Ditchworks are also visible on the hill of Windy Knowe and, whilst there is some local speculation that these belong to an unusual round Roman hill fort, they are in fact typical of an indigenous Iron Age hill fort. Crop marks from aerial photographs of the 1950s suggest the existence of a semi-permanent Roman marching camp on the flood plain by the river Tweed at Toll Wood (near Traquair) and at nearby Eshiels.

The town is said to have been founded by an itinerant pilgrim monk called St. Ronan in A.D.737, who came to Innerleithen via the River Tweed in a coracle. Monks would certainly have travelled the natural route of the Clyde and Tweed valleys on their way between the religious centres of Iona and Holy Island. A Celtic stone carved with cup and rings/channels, known as the Runic Cross (although there are neither runes on it, nor any evidence that it was a cross shaft) was found on the slopes of the Leithen valley suggesting that a church existed during the Early Middle Ages. The stone can be viewed in the courtyard of the parish church on Leithen Road.

In the local legend of the town&#x27;s founding &quot;St. Ronan Cleik&#x27;t the Deil by the hind leg and banished him&quot;, possibly a metaphor for the monks bringing Christian learning back into these regions.

The legend was actually formalised by Sir Walter Scott and was later instigated in a town festival called &quot;The Cleikum Ceremonies&quot; in 1901. This was seen as a way to prevent the legends and folktales of the region from dying out. Scott wrote about the town in his 1824 novel &quot;St. Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot;.

The Ceremonies continue to this day as part of St. Ronans Borders Games, also known as &#x27;Games Week&#x27; (although, in reality, this is a 10-day-long festival). The Border Games date from 1827 and are the oldest organised sports meeting in Scotland. These happen in the first and second week in July and draw significant local and tourist participation.

Accounts of Innerleithen date from the 12th century, when it was recorded as &quot;Inverlethane&quot;. It is said that a son of King Malcolm IV of Scotland (who was staying at Traquair House on a hunting trip), drowned accidentally in a deep pool at the confluence of the rivers Leithen and Tweed. The body was recovered by locals and taken to the church, in recognition of which the King bestowed the right of sanctuary to the land. The pool where the drowning is alleged to have taken place is still known locally as &quot;The Droont Pool&quot;. However, it should be borne in mind that Malcolm IV is reported to have died childless at the age of twenty five, so the tale is questionable.

Later written accounts of the town date from the 15th century when it is referred to as &quot;Henderleithen&quot;, and at this point it is recorded as a hamlet within the Parish of Traquair, which with its major baronial house was centre of the Parish.

The industrial revolution and wool milling saw Innerleithen outgrow Traquair and become the larger village. Innerleithen&#x27;s population rose from 1130 (1861 census) to its current level of over 2500. At one point it had five significant wool mills (or hosieries). Of these, only one, Caerlee Mills remained with a reduced workforce of 33 after its owners JJ &amp; HB Cashmere went into administration in 2010, finally closing in April 2013.

The industries which have supplanted the wool industry and allowed the town to keep growing have been primarily tourism, of which Mountain Biking plays a huge part, and secondly, timber and forestry. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population now commutes to work, including to Edinburgh some 30 miles north.
The town has a football team, Vale of Leithen, who were established in 1891 and play in the East of Scotland Football League. They play their games at the town&#x27;s Victoria Park.

==Tourism==
Tourist attractions within the town include Robert Smail&#x27;s Printing Works and St. Ronans Wells, and nearby Traquair House. Popular tourist activities in the area include golfing (the town has a 9-hole golf course), walking and mountain biking. The area is famous for fly fishing (both trout and salmon), and there is a fish ladder near the golf course, just outside the town boundary on Leithen Road. This proves a popular stopping point for locals and visitors to watch the autumn and winter runs of salmon.

The town has several small hotels including the Traquair Arms Hotel and the St. Ronans Hotel. There are also numerous private houses offering bed and breakfast, a camp site and a caravan site.

The town hosts the annual Innerleithen Music Festival in the Memorial Hall. In addition, it has an active amateur operatic society which stages an annual production.

To get to Innerleithen from Edinburgh, follow the A701, then A703 south from Edinburgh, and at Peebles turn east onto the A72. The town is also served by the First Bus no. 62 service which runs between Edinburgh and Melrose via Penicuik, Peebles, Innerleithen and Galashiels.

Innerleithen has several bookshops, the largest of which holds nearly 19,000 titles and is one of the largest in the Scottish Borders.

Innerleithen is also popular for mountain biking and, together with Glentress, forms one of Forestry and Land Scotland&#x27;s &quot;7 Stanes&quot;. It is very popular with downhill bikers and has hosted national events since the early 1990s. An uplift shuttle bus service provides access to the top of Plora Rig, ready for riders to plummet back down the trails. Current gems include the &quot;Matador&quot; and &quot;Make or Break&quot;. In recent years the &#x27;Golfie&#x27; trails in Caberston Forest have been widely developed and sanctioned, providing a unique network of rider managed technically demanding MTB descents. In addition to the downhill trails, there is a long cross-country loop that climbs to the top of the Minch Moor before descending through some excellent trails. The Innerleithen XC trails are more demanding than those found at Glentress.

Since 2003, the town has held a music festival every August. Acts that have played at the festival include Eddi Reader, Julie Fowlis, Dougie MacLean, Karine Polwart, Karen Matheson and Old Blind Dogs.

==Twinned communities==
The town of Innerleithen has been twinned with the community of Thondwe in Malawi since 2008. Both the local church and the Rotary Club are involved.

==General information==
In 1854, the King designated the market town of Kongsvinger as a kjøpstad, which gave it special rights. The designation included a small patch of land on both sides of the river Glomma with an area of approximately . Because of this designation, on 7 February 1855, the town was separated from the municipality of Vinger to form a separate municipality. Initially, the town had 472 residents and this left Vinger municipality with 10,947 residents. On 1 January 1876, the town was enlarged when an area of Vinger (population: 209) was transferred into Kongsvinger. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Kongsvinger (population: 2,345) and the surrounding municipalities of Vinger (population: 6,257) and Brandval (population: 4,384) were merged to form the new Kongsvinger Municipality. The new municipality of Kongsvinger (briefly) lost its status as an urban municipality () after this amalgamation due to merging with rural municipalities. One year later, on 1 January 1965, the government redesignated Kongsvinger as an urban municipality. On 1 January 1974, the unpopulated Lystad area was transferred from Grue Municipality to Kongsvinger Municipality. On 1 January 1986, the northern part of the Åbogen area (population: 14) was transferred from Kongsvinger to the neighboring municipality of Eidskog.

===Name===
The whole region where Kongsvinger is located was historically called &quot;Vinger&quot; (). This name could be related to the river Glomma which flows through the region. One could compare this to the English word swing (for the missing &quot;s&quot; see Indo-European s-mobile). The river Glomma passes through the center of the district where the south-flowing river takes a sharp northwestward turn. This can be compared to the similar Lithuanian word &quot;vìngis&quot; which means &quot;bend&quot;, &quot;bow&quot;, or &quot;turn&quot;. This old name used to represent this whole area. The first element of the name is the possessive form of (meaning &quot;the King&#x27;s&quot;) was added after the Kongsvinger Fortress was built in 1690. It was first applied only to the fortress (written as in old documents). Then, it was later given to the town that grew up around the fortress.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 25 June 1926. The design is a stylized representation of Kongsvinger Fortress towering high above the river Glomma. The river is rendered as a wavy bar in the bottom half of the design. The river and fortress have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if the arms are made out of metal, then silver is used. The lower part of the arms represent the land and the mountain on which the fortress sits. This area has a background in black to represent the local conifer forest. The curved upper part of the background is colored red to symbolize the sky. The color is taken from the Norwegian flag to mark the national historical importance of the fortress. A mural crown is often shown above the escutcheon to indicate that the town of Kongsvinger is located in the municipality. The arms were designed by J. W. Oftedal.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has three parishes () within the municipality of Kongsvinger. It is part of the Solør, Vinger og Odal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar.

==History==
The area was historically a part of the prestegjeld of Vinger. The village that later became Kongsvinger already existed as a trading center by the Middle Ages, due to the accessibility by natural waterways. Viking chieftains reached Sweden by boat from Kongsvinger. Kongsvinger Fortress was founded in 1669, and a star-shaped plan was laid out for the fortress. Work began in 1682 and it was finished in 1690 as part of a general upgrade to Norwegian fortresses. The building of the fortress formed the foundations for what was to become the town of Kongsvinger. The fortress was built as a defensive structure against the Swedes, and on numerous occasions there have been military engagements in the area around the fortress, but Kongsvinger fortress has never been taken in military combat. Below Kongsvinger fortress lies Øvrebyen, which literally translated means &quot;upper town&quot;. This is the oldest part of the town of Kongsvinger, and one can still find a number of the original houses built after the establishment of the fortress. Kongsvinger Museum is located here, together with a museum of female emancipation in a building called &quot;Rolighed&quot;, the home of Dagny Juel, the famous author once portrayed by Edvard Munch.

The rural, eastern parts of Kongsvinger and its neighboring municipalities to the north and south were populated at the end of the 17th century by Finnish emigrants who came across the Swedish border. The area is called Finnskogen which means &quot;&quot;The Finnish forest&quot;.&quot;

Kongsvinger played an important part in the Norwegian resistance force against the Nazis being a gateway to Sweden. Norway&#x27;s highest decorated citizen, Gunnar Sønsteby frequently passed through Kongsvinger in his work to sabotage the Nazis&#x27; installations in Norway. Some of the busiest escape routes for refugees also went through Kongsvinger to Sweden.

From 1983 to 1999, and again in 2010, Kongsvinger&#x27;s association football team KIL Toppfotball held a position in the Norwegian Premier League. It made some notable merits participating in the UEFA Cup and winning a silver medal during the 1992 season.

<text>Hazaragi (; ) is an eastern dialect and variety of the Persian language that is spoken by the Hazara people.

== Classification ==
Hazaragi is a member of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is an eastern variety of Persian and closely related to Dari, one of the two official Languages of Afghanistan. The primary differences between Dari and Hazaragi are the accents and Hazaragi&#x27;s greater array of many Turkic and Mongolic words and loanwords Despite these differences, the two dialects are mutually intelligible.

In Daykundi (former Uruzgan), Hazaragi has a significant admixture of Turkic influence in the language via Karluk.

== Geographic distribution and diaspora ==

Hazaragi is spoken by the Hazara people, who mainly live in Afghanistan (predominantly in the Hazarajat (Hazaristan) region, as well as other Hazara-populated areas of Afghanistan), with a significant population in Pakistan (particularly Quetta) and Iran (particularly Mashhad), and by Hazaras in eastern Uzbekistan, northern Tajikistan, the Americas, Europe, and Australia. The number of Hazaragi speakers in Iran increased significantly due to the influx of refugees from Afghanistan where there are an estimated 399,000 speakers in the country as of 2021.

In recent years, a substantial population of Hazara refugees has settled in Australia, prompting the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to move towards official recognition of the Hazaragi language. Currently, NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters) holds interpreting tests for Hazaragi as a distinct language, noting in test materials that Hazaragi varies by dialect, and that any dialect of Hazaragi may be used in interpreter testing as long as it would be understood by the average speaker. The test materials also note that Hazaragi in some locations has been significantly influenced by surrounding languages and that the use of non-Hazaragi words assimilated from neighboring languages would be penalized in testing.

== History ==
=== Persian and Islam ===

The Persian language became so much part of the religion of Islam that it almost went wherever Islam took roots. Persian entered, in this way, into the very faith and thought of the people embracing Islam throughout South Asia.

== Turkic and Mongolic influence ==
Over time, Turkic and Mongolic languages penetrated as living languages amongst Hazara people, and Hazaragi contains many Turkic and Mongolic words and loanwords.

== Grammatical structure ==
The grammatical structure of Hazaragi is practically identical to that of the Kabuli dialect of Persian.

=== Phonology ===

 can also approach the sound or .

As a group of eastern Persian varieties which are considered the more formal and classical varieties of Persian, Hazaragi retains the voiced fricative , and the bilabial articulation of has borrowed the (rare) retroflexes and ; as in &quot;buṭ&quot; (meaning &quot;boot&quot;) vs. &quot;but&quot; (meaning &quot;idol&quot;) (cf. Persian &quot;&quot;); and rarely articulates . The convergence of voiced uvular stop (ق) and voiced velar fricative (غ) in Western Persian (probably under the influence of Turkic languages) is still kept separate in Hazara.

Diphthongs include , , and (cf. Persian , , ). The vocalic system is typically eastern Persian, characterized by the loss of length distinction, the retention of mid vowels, and the rounding of and , alternating with its merger with , or (cf. Persian ). 

Stress is dynamic and similar to that in Dari and Tajik varieties of Persian, and not variable. It generally falls on the last syllable of a nominal form, including derivative suffixes and several morphological markers. Typical is the insertion of epenthetic vowels in consonant clusters (as in &quot;pašm&quot; to &quot;póšum&quot;; &quot;wool&quot;) and final devoicing (as in &quot;ḵût&quot;; &quot;self, own&quot;).

 only occurs infrequently and among more educated speakers. can be heard as either a trill or a tap . // can also range to uvular sounds [].

=== Nominal morphology ===
The most productive derivative marker is &quot;-i&quot;, and the plural markers are &quot;-o&quot; for the inanimate (as in &quot;kitab-o&quot;, meaning &quot;books&quot;; cf. Persian ) and &quot;-û&quot; for the animate (as in &quot;birar-û&quot;, meaning &quot;brothers&quot;; cf. Persian ). The emphatic vocative marker is &quot;û&quot; or &quot;-o&quot;, the indefinite marker is &quot;-i&quot;, and the specific object marker is &quot;-(r)a&quot;. The comparative marker is &quot;-tar&quot; (as in &quot;kalû-tar&quot;, meaning &quot;bigger&quot;). Dependent adjectives and nouns follow the head noun and are connected by &quot;-i&quot; (as in &quot;kitab-i mamud&quot;, meaning &quot;the book of Maḥmud&quot;). Topicalized possessors precede the head noun marked by the resumptive personal suffix (as in &quot;Zulmay ayê-ši&quot;, literally &quot;Zulmay her mother&quot;). Prepositions include, in addition to the standard Persian ones, &quot;ḵun(i)&quot; (meaning &quot;with, using&quot;, &quot;da&quot; (meaning &quot;in&quot;; cf. Persian ); the latter often replaces &quot;ba&quot; (meaning &quot;to&quot;) in dative function. Loaned postpositions include comitative &quot;-qati&quot; (meaning &quot;together with&quot;) and &quot;(az) -worî&quot; (meaning &quot;like&quot;). Interrogatives typically function also as indefinite (as in &quot;kudam&quot;, meaning &quot;which, someone&quot;).

The inflection (u,o) that Hazaras use to pluralize nouns is also found in Avesta, Yashts such as Aryo.

=== Particles, conjunctions, modals, and adverbials ===
These include &quot;atê/arê&quot;, meaning &quot;yes&quot;; &quot;amma&quot; or &quot;wali&quot;, meaning &quot;but&quot;; &quot;balki&quot;, meaning &quot;however&quot;; &quot;šaydi&quot;, meaning &quot;perhaps&quot;; &quot;ale&quot;, meaning &quot;now&quot;; and &quot;wuḵt-a&quot;, meaning &quot;then&quot;. These are also marked by distinctive initial stress.
=== Verb morphology ===
The imperfective marker is &quot;mi-&quot; (assimilated variants: &quot;m-&quot;, &quot;mu-&quot;, &quot;m-&quot;, &quot;mê-&quot;; as in &quot;mi-zan-um&quot;, &quot;I hit, I am hitting&quot;). The subjunctive and imperative marker is &quot;bi-&quot; (with similar assimilation). The negation is &quot;na-&quot; (as in &quot;na-mi-zad-um&quot;, &quot;I was not hitting&quot;). These usually attract stress.

=== Tenses ===
The tense, mood, and aspect system is typically quite different from Western Persian. The basic tense system is threefold: present-future, past, and remote (pluperfect). New modal paradigms developed in addition to the subjunctives:

* The non-seen/mirative that originates in the resultative-stative perfect (e.g., &quot;zad-ēm&quot;; cf. Persian ), which has largely lost its non-modal use;
* the potential, or assumptive, which is marked by the invariant &quot;ḵot&quot; (cf. Persian &quot;xāh-ad&quot; or &quot;xād&quot;, &quot;it wants, intends&quot;) combined with the indicate and subjunctive forms.

Moreover, all past and remote forms have developed imperfective forms marked by &quot;mi-&quot;. There are doubts about several of the less commonly found, or recorded, forms, in particular those with &quot;ḵot&quot;. However, the systematic arrangement of all forms according to their morphological, as well as semantic, function shows that those forms fit well within the overall pattern. The system may tentatively be shown as follows (all forms are 1st sing), leaving out complex compound forms such as &quot;zada ḵot mu-buda baš-um&quot;.

In the assumptive, the distinction appears to be not between present versus past, but indefinite versus definite. Also, similar to all Persian varieties, the imperfective forms in &quot;mi-&quot;, and past perfect forms, such as &quot;mi-zad-um&quot; and &quot;zada bud-um&quot;, are used in irreal conditional clauses and wishes; e.g., &quot;kaški zimi qulba kadagi mu-but&quot;, &quot;If the field would only be/have been plowed!&quot; Modal verbs, such as &quot;tan-&quot; (&quot;can&quot;), are constructed with the perfect participle; e.g., &quot;ma bû-r-um, da čaman rasid-a ḵot tanist-um&quot;, &quot;I shall go, and may be able to get to Čaman&quot;. Participial nominalization is typical, both with the perfect participle (e.g., &quot;kad-a&quot;, &quot;(having) done&quot;) and with the derived participle with passive meaning &quot;kad-ag-i&quot;, &quot;having been done&quot; (e.g., &quot;zimin-i qulba kada-ya&quot;, &quot;The field is ploughed&quot;; &quot;zamin-i qulba (na-)šuda-ra mi-ngar-um&quot;, &quot;I am looking at a plowed/unplowed field&quot;; &quot;imrûz [u ḵondagi] tikrar mu-kun-a&quot;, &quot;Today he repeats (reading) what he had read&quot;). The gerundive (e.g., &quot;kad-an-i&quot;, &quot;to be done&quot;) is likewise productive, as in &quot;yag čiz, ki uftadani baš-a, ma u-ra qad-dist-ḵu girift-um, tulḡa kad-um&quot;, &quot;One object, that was about to fall, I grabbed, and held it&quot;. The clitic &quot;-ku&quot; or &quot;-ḵu&quot; topicalizes parts of speech, &quot;-di&quot; the predicate; as in &quot;i-yši raft, ma-ḵu da ḵona mand-um&quot;, &quot;He himself left; I, though, I stayed&quot;.

<text>Altun Ha is the name given to the ruins of an ancient Maya city in Belize, located in the Belize District about north of Belize City and about west of the shore of the Caribbean Sea. The site covers an area of about .

Stones from the ruins of the ancient structures were reused for residential construction of the agricultural village of Rockstone Pond in modern times, but the ancient site did not come to the attention of archeologists until 1963. The Old Northern Highway connects Altun Ha to Belize&#x27;s Northern Highway, and the site is accessible for tourism. The largest of Altun Ha&#x27;s temple-pyramids, the &quot;Temple of the Masonry Altars&quot;, is high. A drawing of this structure is the logo of Belize&#x27;s leading brand of beer, &quot;Belikin&quot;.

==Etymology==

According to the Belize Institute of Archaeology, the site&#x27;s name means &quot;Rockstone Water,&quot; and is a Yucatec Mayan approximation of the name of the nearby village of Rockstone Pond. In Yucatec Mayan, &quot;haltun&quot; is a stone water deposit or cistern, and &quot;ha&quot; means water. An ancient emblem glyph for the site has been identified, but its phonetic reading is not currently known.

==Archaeological investigations and rediscovery==

In 1961, W.R. Bullard conducted excavations led by the Royal Ontario Museum, at Baking Pot and San Estevan, and although no excavations took place, the site was initially called “Rockstone Pond.” In 1963, quarrying activity by local villagers led to the recovery of a large, elaborately carved jade pendant. The current commissioner of archaeology, Hamilton Anderson, notified David M. Pendergast and a reconnaissance trip was made in 1963. Starting in 1964, an archaeological team led by Dr. David Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum began extensive excavations and restorations of the site, which continued through 1970. There was a total of 40 months of excavation with a field season in 1971 of ceramic and laboratory analysis.

==Setting==
Altun Ha lies on the north-central coastal plain of Belize, in a dry tropical zone. The site was very swampy during its pre-Columbian occupation, with very few recognizable water sources. Currently, the only recognizable natural water source is a creek beyond the northern limit of the mapped area. The water sources used during occupation were Gordon Pond, which is the main reservoir, and the Camp Aguada, which is located in the site center. The site may have contained two chultuns, but provenience is lost since they are used in modern times.

The site itself consists of a central precinct composed of Groups A and B. Groups A and B and Zones C, D, and E consist of the nucleated area, with Zones G, J, K, M, N making part of the suburban area. The site does not contain any stela, suggesting that stelae were not part of ceremonial procedures. There are two recorded causeways, one in Zone C and one connecting Zone E and Zone F. The Zone C causeway does not connect to any structures, but is probably related to Structure C13, and was perhaps used for ceremonial purposes. The other causeway connected the two zones where water sources were located, and was constructed for topographical reasons, specifically to traverse areas of swampy land; it may have been impassable without raised walkways.

==Occupational history==

Altun Ha was occupied for many centuries, from about 900 B.C. to A.D. 1000. Most of the information on Altun Ha comes from the Classic Period from about A.D. 400 to A.D. 900, when the city was at its largest.

===Preclassic===

The earliest structures found at Altun Ha, found in Zone C, are two round platforms that date to about BC 900−800, structures C13 and C17. Structure C13 contains remnants of postholes and several burials, while C17 has traces of burning, or fire. Structure C13 was an early religious building, with Zone C inhabitants being of relatively high status. The Late Preclassic had a population increase and large public structures were built. The first of these was structure F8 in AD 200. Although this structure was constructed at the end of the Preclassic, the majority of the archaeological evidence dates to the Early Classic. This structure has a two-element stair composed of small steps with stairside outsets that were perhaps devoted to innovation. F8 also had a three-stage development.

===Early Classic===

One of the most important finds in the Early Classic comes from structure F8, specifically tomb F8/1. The tomb was placed here about fifty years after the construction of the structure. It contained the remains of an adult male who was interred with a jade and shell necklace, a pair of jade earflares, two shell disks, a pair of pearls, five pottery vessels, and fifty-nine valves of &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells. Bib head beads in the necklace are associated with southern Mesoamerica. The ceramics for the most part reflect the pattern that was being established at other burials in Altun Ha. Above the burial, however, the roof showed association to the large Mexican site Teotihuacan. The burial was capped with over 8,000 pieces of chert debitage and 163 formal chert tools. The ritual offering, or cache, also contained jade beads, &quot;Spondylus&quot; valves, puma and dog teeth, slate laminae, and a large variety of shell artifacts. The clear association to Teotihuacan however, comes from the 248 Pachuca green obsidian objects and the 23 ceramic jars, bowls and dishes. The obsidian is of the Miccaotli or Early Tlamimilolpa phase, suggesting that this symbolism was still important and dominant at Teotihuacan. This offering may be of importance to Teotihuacan because of the associations that the ruler in the burial had with central Mexico or the association that the entire Altun Ha community had with Teotihuacan.

There is also evidence of contact and trading with the other side of Mesoamerica in the intermediate area. An offering in the central ceremonial precinct contained an undecorated lidded limestone vessel with jadeite objects, two pearls, laminae of crystalline hematite, &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell beads, and a tumbaga gold-copper alloy bead representing a jaguar claw. This deposit has been dated to about 500. Traditionally, it was not believed that the Maya had gold during the Classic period; gold was restricted to the Postclassic. This is in part because many believed that gold was not naturally occurring in the Maya area, but recent investigations have shown that placer gold can be found in the streams of the upland zone of western Belize. The Maya most likely did not use metallurgy because of a lack of techniques, which may have been due to the fact that yellow in Maya ideology represent dying plant life and crop failure. This artifact is also identical with other artifacts of the Cocle in central Panama. The Cocle had a sufficient amount of metalworking by 500, and surely played a role in trade relationships beyond Panama. This discovery also shows that important trade networks were set up much earlier than previously thought.

===Late Classic===

In general, the elite burials at Altun Ha during the Late Classic can be characterized by large amounts of jade. Over 800 pieces of jade have been recovered at the site. More than 60 of these pieces are carved. The beginning of the Late Classic at Altun Ha had one of the most interesting burials in the Maya lowlands. Structure B-4 has tombs with many jade artifacts, including a large jade plaque with a series of twenty glyphs in the phase six construction level. In the 1968 field season, after excavating many tombs in Structure B-4, also called the Temple of the Masonry Altars, the seventh phase of construction revealed the most elaborate tomb at the site nicknamed “The Sun God’s Tomb”.

====The Sun God&#x27;s Tomb====

The Sun God&#x27;s Tomb is in Structure B-4, also called the Temple of the Masonry Altars. Structure B-4 is in Group B, which is part of the central precinct at Altun Ha, and has a height of 16 meters. Phase VII, the level where this tomb is, is dated to about 600−650, which is at the beginning of the Late Classic period. The tomb is the seventh and earliest in B-4, which made the excavators designate this burial Tomb B-4/7.

Tomb B-4/7 contained the skeleton of an adult male with many offerings. The body was fully extended dorsally with the skull facing south-southwest. The person had a height of 170–171 cm, with the recovered skeletal materials consisting of a fragment of the skull, the mandible, long bones, five teeth, two vertebrae, five carpal bones, the patellas, and miscellaneous metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.

The bulk of the interpretations, research, and interest in this tomb have undoubtedly been on the artifacts that were contained in this particular burial. In the initial study, Pendergast classifies these artifacts between perishables and non-perishables.

The perishable artifacts that are in the burial that the researchers were able to recognize include a wooden platform that the body was placed on, felid skins, cloth, matting, cordage, rods, stuccoed objects, red pigment, and gray clay. Not all perishable objects have been interpreted for their original use in the burial, but some have clear associations. The entire tomb was covered in cloth, with textile impressions noted on the pottery. Red pigment was distributed throughout, with evidence of it on most of the jade.

The researchers documented 43 non-perishable artifacts. These include ceramic bowls; shell beads; jadeite anklets, bracelets and beads; pearls; pyrite and hematite artifacts; and, the most outstanding of all, a carved jade head of the Sun God, Kinich Ahau. The head has a height of 14.9 cm, a circumference of 45.9 cm and a weight of 4.42 kg. It was placed at the pelvis of the body, with the face of the jade boulder facing the skull.

The Sun God&#x27;s Tomb marks the starting point for tomb construction in Structure B-4 during the Late Classic period. The unusual form of this tomb shows the distinctive cultural aspects of Altun Ha and the Caribbean zone compared to the inland Classic Maya sites. Pendergast suggests that with so much jade found at the site, the jade head may have been carved at the site with imported jade. The giant jade head also suggests that this small site had a strong status as a trade or ceremonial center. Pendergast suggests that this tomb contained a priest that was associated with the Sun God and that Structure B-4 was dedicated to this deity, based on this one artifact.

More recent research, however, has shown that this interpretation may be incorrect: it suggests that this giant jade head is a Jester God. When drawing this figure spread out on a plane, the figure on this carving shows more of a resemblance to a bird deity with maize iconography, not Kinich Ahau. The Jester God is an early symbol of Maya rulership and is usually seen iconographically in the head, or in this case the jade head.

With so many artifacts associated with this tomb, it is clear that the male buried in here was of great importance. The Jester God argument is a better fit for what this person represented, which would also correlate with this being the first tomb constructed in Structure B-4.
====Terminal Classic====

By 700, modifications in the Central Precinct became rarer, and in Plaza B only Structures B4 and B6 were modified regularly, while Plaza A was still being modified extensively. By 850, structures B5 and A8 were completely abandoned. Gradual abandonment of the site began in 800, except for Zone E, which actually reached its peak usage and occupation between 700 and 800.

Structure D2 is located at the edge of the site&#x27;s Central Precinct and is dated to the Late-Terminal Classic. This structure in particular yielded a stemmed bifacial blade of Pachuca green obsidian in a post-abandonment offering. The form, size and manufacturing characteristics are very similar to those found in F8. Two possible explanations for the context of this artifact are that the blade could have been produced long after the decline of Teotihuacan, or was reused from an earlier time period.

===Postclassic===

In the Postclassic, Structures A1 and A5 were solely used for depositing the dead. By the beginning of the eleventh century, the site of Altun Ha was completely abandoned. During the Late Postclassic after 1225, however, there was a renewed limited occupation at Altun Ha which lasted probably until the fifteenth century. Lamanai-related Postclassic ceremonial vessels were excavated atop B-4.

==Diet at Altun Ha==

The diet at Altun Ha was a maize based (C-4) diet, but there was also a large marine component to their diet compared to other sites in the Maya area. The marine/reef resources were more important here than in other regions. Between the Preclassic and Early Classic, there was a dramatic increase of maize consumption, which researchers argue is an indication of a rise in intensive maize agriculture at the beginning of the Early Classic. The individuals with the highest recognized status during this time period also had the highest intake of maize. In the Late Classic, more maize was consumed in the central precinct than in the outer zones, and Zone C had a higher degree of reef resources than in other areas. In the Postclassic, a higher portion of terrestrial animals were consumed, possibly deer or dogs.

==Caches at Altun Ha==

Caches occur in two categories at Altun Ha. The largest class is in communally built structures that were dedicated to public ritual, the second occurs in residential structures with usually a single-family focus. The primary axis was the principal determinant of cache position in communally built structures. The primary axis functioned as the main avenue of communication with deities. In other public and domestic contexts, there are offerings that are away from the primary axis, and this is based on a matter of exclusion. Late Preclassic caches at Altun Ha can be defined by the round platform. Jade objects become significant in offerings by 450−300 BC. Classic Period caching practices at Altun Ha consisted of single, highly varied offerings in context with structural modification. The caches during this time period had a high scale of ceremonial value and made a forceful statement of the site&#x27;s prominence.

<doc id="172701" wikidata="Q230386" url="?curid=172701" title="Isma'ilism">
<text>Isma&#x27;ilism () is a branch of Shia Islam. The Isma&#x27;ili () get their name from their acceptance of Imam Isma&#x27;il ibn Jafar as the appointed spiritual successor (imām) to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, wherein they differ from the Twelver Shia, who accept Musa al-Kazim, the younger brother of Isma&#x27;il, as the true Imām.

After the death of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il in the 8th century CE, the teachings of Ismailism further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning () of the Islamic religion. With the eventual development of Usulism and Akhbarism into the more literalistic () oriented, Shia Islam developed into two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismaili, Alevi, Bektashi, Alian, and Alawite groups focusing on the mystical path and nature of God, along with the &quot;Imam of the Time&quot; representing the manifestation of esoteric truth and intelligible divine reality, with the more literalistic Usuli and Akhbari groups focusing on divine law (sharia) and the deeds and sayings (sunnah) of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams who were guides and a light to God.

Isma&#x27;ilism rose at one point to become the largest branch of Shia Islam, climaxing as a political power with the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th through 12th centuries. Ismailis believe in the oneness of God, as well as the closing of divine revelation with Muhammad, whom they see as &quot;the final Prophet and Messenger of God to all humanity&quot;. The Isma&#x27;ili and the Twelvers both accept the same six initial Imams; the Isma&#x27;ili accept Isma&#x27;il ibn Jafar as the seventh Imam. Isma&#x27;ili thought is heavily influenced by Neoplatonism.

The larger sect of Ismaili are the Nizaris, who recognize Aga Khan V as the 50th hereditary Imam, while other groups are known as the Tayyibi branch. The community with the highest percentage of Ismailis is Gorno-Badakhshan, but Isma&#x27;ilis can be found in Central Asia, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Yemen, Lebanon, Malaysia, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, East Africa, Angola, Bangladesh, and South Africa, and have in recent years emigrated to Europe, Russia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Trinidad and Tobago.

==History==
===Succession crisis===

Ismailism shares its beginnings with other early Shia sects that emerged during the succession crisis that spread throughout the early Muslim community. From the beginning, the Shia asserted the right of Ali, cousin of Muhammad, to have both political and spiritual control over the community. This also included his two sons, who were the grandsons of Muhammad through his daughter Fatima.

The conflict remained relatively peaceful between the partisans of Ali and those who asserted a semi-democratic system of electing caliphs, until the third Rashidun caliph (Uthman) was killed and Ali ascended to the caliphate with popular support.

Soon after his ascendancy, Aisha, the third of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, claimed along with Uthman&#x27;s tribe, the Umayyads, that Ali should take (blood for blood) from the people responsible for Uthman&#x27;s death. Ali voted against it, as he believed that the situation at the time demanded a peaceful resolution of the matter. Though both parties could rightfully defend their claims, due to escalated misunderstandings, the Battle of the Camel was fought and Aisha was defeated, but was respectfully escorted to Medina by Ali.

Following this battle, Mu&#x27;awiya I, the Umayyad governor of Syria, also staged a revolt under the same pretences. Ali led his forces against Mu&#x27;awiya until the side of Mu&#x27;awiya held copies of the Quran against their spears and demanded that the issue be decided by Islam&#x27;s holy book. Ali accepted this, and an arbitration was done which ended in his favor.

A group among Ali&#x27;s army believed that subjecting his legitimate authority to arbitration was tantamount to apostasy, and abandoned his forces. This group was known as the Khawarij and Ali wished to defeat their forces before they reached the cities, where they would be able to blend in with the rest of the population. While he was unable to do this, he nonetheless defeated their forces in subsequent battles.

Regardless of these defeats, the Kharijites survived and became a violently problematic group in Islamic history. After plotting assassinations against Ali, Mu&#x27;awiya, and the arbitrator of their conflict, a Kharijite successfully assassinated Ali in 661 CE. The Imāmate then passed on to his son Hasan and then later his son Husayn. According to the Nizari Isma&#x27;ili tradition, Hasan was &quot;an Entrusted Imam&quot; () Husayn was the &quot;Permanent Imam&quot; (). 

The Entrusted Imam is an Imam in the full sense except that the lineage of the Imamate must continue through the Permanent Imam. However, the political Caliphate was soon taken over by Mu&#x27;awiya, the only leader in the empire at that time with an army large enough to seize control.

Even some of Ali&#x27;s early followers regarded him as &quot;an absolute and divinely guided leader&quot;, whose demands of his followers were &quot;the same kind of loyalty that would have been expected for the Prophet&quot;. For example, one of Ali&#x27;s supporters who also was devoted to Muhammad said to him: &quot;our opinion is your opinion and we are in the palm of your right hand.&quot; The early followers of Ali seem to have taken his guidance as &quot;right guidance&quot; deriving from Divine support. In other words, Ali&#x27;s guidance was seen to be the expression of God&#x27;s will and the Quranic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of Ali was known as , and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams.

In the 1st century after Muhammad, the term was not specifically defined as &quot; of the Prophet&quot;, but was used in connection to Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and some Umayyad Caliphs. The idea of , or traditions ascribed to Muhammad, was not mainstream, nor was criticised. Even the earliest legal texts by Malik b. Anas and Abu Hanifa employ many methods including analogical reasoning and opinion and do not rely exclusively on . Only in the 2nd century does the Sunni jurist al-Shafi&#x27;i first argue that only the sunnah of Muhammad should be a source of law, and that this is embodied in s. It would take another one hundred years after al-Shafi&#x27;i for Sunni Muslim jurists to fully base their methodologies on prophetic s. Meanwhile, Imami Shia Muslims followed the Imams&#x27; interpretations of Islam as normative without any need for s and other sources of Sunni law such as analogy and opinion.

===Karbala and afterward===

====The Battle of Karbala====

After the death of Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn and his family were increasingly worried about the religious and political persecution that was becoming commonplace under the reign of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son, Yazid. Amidst this turmoil in 680, Husayn along with the women and children of his family, upon receiving invitational letters and gestures of support by Kufis, wished to go to Kufa and confront Yazid as an intercessor on part of the citizens of the empire. However, he was stopped by Yazid&#x27;s army in Karbala during the month of Muharram. His family was starved and deprived of water and supplies, until eventually the army came in on the tenth day and martyred Husayn and his companions, and enslaved the rest of the women and family, taking them to Kufa.

This battle would become extremely important to the Shia psyche. The Twelvers as well as Musta&#x27;li Isma&#x27;ili still mourn this event during an occasion known as Ashura.

The Nizari Isma&#x27;ili, however, do not mourn this in the same way because of the belief that the light of the Imam never dies but rather passes on to the succeeding Imām, making mourning arbitrary. However, during commemoration they do not have any celebrations in Jama&#x27;at Khana during Muharram and may have announcements or sessions regarding the tragic events of Karbala. Also, individuals may observe Muharram in a wide variety of ways. This respect for Muharram does not include self-flagellation and beating because they feel that harming one&#x27;s body is harming a gift from God.
====The beginnings of Ismāʿīlī Daʿwah====

After being set free by Yazid, Zaynab bint Ali, the daughter of Fatimah and Ali and the sister of Hasan and Husayn, started to spread the word of Karbala to the Muslim world, making speeches regarding the event. This was the first organized daʿwah of the Shia, which would later develop into an extremely spiritual institution for the Ismāʿīlīs.

After the poisoning of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin by Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 713, the first succession crisis of the Shia arose with Zayd ibn ʻAlī&#x27;s companions and the Zaydīs who claimed Zayd ibn ʻAlī as the Imām, whilst the rest of the Shia upheld Muhammad al-Baqir as the Imām. The Zaidis argued that any sayyid or &quot;descendant of Muhammad through Hasan or Husayn&quot; who rebelled against tyranny and the injustice of his age could be the Imām. The Zaidis created the first Shia states in Iran, Iraq, and Yemen.

In contrast to his predecessors, Muhammad al-Baqir focused on academic Islamic scholarship in Medina, where he promulgated his teachings to many Muslims, both Shia and non-Shia, in an extremely organized form of Daʿwah. In fact, the earliest text of the Ismaili school of thought is said to be the &quot;Umm al-kitab&quot; (The Archetypal Book), a conversation between Muhammad al-Baqir and three of his disciples.

This tradition would pass on to his son, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who inherited the Imāmate on his father&#x27;s death in 743. Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq excelled in the scholarship of the day and had many pupils, including three of the four founders of the Sunni madhhabs.

However, following al-Sadiq&#x27;s poisoning in 765, a fundamental split occurred in the community. Ismaʻil ibn Jafar, who at one point was appointed by his father as the next Imam, appeared to have predeceased his father in 755. While Twelvers argue that either he was never heir apparent or he truly predeceased his father and hence Musa al-Kadhim was the true heir to the Imamate, the Ismāʿīlīs argue that either the death of Ismaʻil was staged in order to protect him from Abbasid persecution or that the Imamate passed to Muhammad ibn Ismaʻil in lineal descent.

===Ascension of the Dais===

For some partisans of Isma&#x27;il, the Imamate ended with Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far. Most Ismailis recognized Muhammad ibn Ismaʻil as the next Imam and some saw him as the expected Mahdi that Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the Isma&#x27;ili Imams according to the Nizari and Mustaali found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded Abbasid Caliphate, which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 CE.

At this point, some of the Isma&#x27;ili community believed that Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il had gone into the Occultation and that he would one day return. A small group traced the Imamate among Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s lineal descendants. With the status and location of the Imams not known to the community, the concealed Isma&#x27;ili Imams began to propagate the faith through Da&#x27;iyyun from its base in Syria. This was the start of the spiritual beginnings of the Daʿwah that would later play important parts in the all Ismaili branches, especially the Nizaris and the Musta&#x27;lis.

The Da&#x27;i was not a missionary in the typical sense, and he was responsible for both the conversion of his student as well as the mental and spiritual well-being. The Da&#x27;i was a guide and light to the Imam. The teacher-student relationship of the Da&#x27;i and his student was much like the one that would develop in Sufism. The student desired God, and the Da&#x27;i could bring him to God by making him recognize the Imam, who possesses the knowledge of the Oneness of God. The Da&#x27;i and Imam were respectively the spiritual mother and spiritual father of the Isma&#x27;ili believers.

Ja&#x27;far bin Mansur al-Yaman&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Sage and Disciple&quot; is a classic of early Fatimid literature, documenting important aspects of the development of the Isma&#x27;ili da&#x27;wa in tenth-century Yemen. The book is also of considerable historical value for modern scholars of Arabic prose literature as well as those interested in the relationship of esoteric Shia with early Islamic mysticism. Likewise is the book an important source of information regarding the various movements within tenth-century Shīa leading to the spread of the Fatimid-Isma&#x27;ili da&#x27;wa throughout the medieval Islamicate world and the religious and philosophical history of post-Fatimid Musta&#x27;li branch of Isma&#x27;ilism in Yemen and India.

===The Qarmatians===

While many of the Isma&#x27;ili were content with the Da&#x27;i teachings, a group that mingled Persian nationalism and Zoroastrianism surfaced known as the Qarmatians. With their headquarters in Bahrain, they accepted a young Persian former prisoner by the name of Abu&#x27;l-Fadl al-Isfahani, who claimed to be the descendant of the Persian kings as their Mahdi, and rampaged across the Middle-East in the tenth century, climaxing their violent campaign by stealing the Black Stone from the Kaaba in Mecca in 930 under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi. Following the arrival of the Al-Isfahani, they changed their qibla from the Kaaba in Mecca to the Zoroastrian-influenced fire. After their return of the Black Stone in 951 and a defeat by the Abbasids in 976 the group slowly dwindled off and no longer has any adherents.

===The Fatimid Caliphate===

====Rise of the Fatimid Caliphate====

The political asceticism practiced by the Imāms during the period after Muhammad ibn Ismail was to be short-lived and finally concluded with the Imāmate of Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, who was born in 873. After decades of Ismāʿīlīs believing that Muhammad ibn Ismail was in the Occultation and would return to bring an age of justice, al-Mahdi taught that the Imāms had not been literally secluded, but rather had remained hidden to protect themselves and had been organizing the Da&#x27;i, and even acted as Da&#x27;i themselves.

After raising an army and successfully defeating the Aghlabids in North Africa and a number of other victories, al-Mahdi Billah successfully established a Shia political state ruled by the Imāmate in 910. This was the only time in history where the Shia Imamate and Caliphate were united after the first Imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib.

In parallel with the dynasty&#x27;s claim of descent from ʻAlī and Fāṭimah, the empire was named &quot;Fatimid&quot;. However, this was not without controversy, and recognizing the extent that Ismāʿīlī doctrine had spread, the Abbasid Caliphate assigned Sunni and Twelver scholars the task to disprove the lineage of the new dynasty. This became known as the Baghdad Manifesto, which tries to trace the lineage of the Fatimids to an alleged Jewish blacksmith.

====The Middle East under Fatimid rule====

The Fatimid Caliphate expanded quickly under the subsequent Imams. Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Yemen, Hejaz and the Tihamah. Under the Fatimids, Egypt flourished and developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages.

The Fatimids promoted ideas that were radical for that time. One was a promotion by merit rather than genealogy.

Also during this period, the three contemporary branches of Isma&#x27;ilism formed. The first branch (Druze) occurred with the al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Born in 985, he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. A religious group that began forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and refused to acknowledge his successor. Later to be known as the Druze, they believe Al-Hakim to be the manifestation of God and the prophesied Mahdi, who would one day return and bring justice to the world. The faith further split from Ismailism as it developed unique doctrines which often class it separately from both Ismailism and Islam.

Arwa al-Sulayhi was the Hujjah in Yemen from the time of Imam al Mustansir. She appointed Da&#x27;i in Yemen to run religious affairs. Ismaili missionaries Ahmed and Abadullah (in about 1067 CE (460 AH)) were also sent to India in that time. They sent Syedi Nuruddin to Dongaon to look after southern part and Syedi Fakhruddin to East Rajasthan, India.

The second split occurred following the death of al-Mustansir Billah in 1094 CE. His rule was the longest of any caliph in both the Fatimid and other Islamic empires. After he died, his sons Nizar, the older, and al-Musta&#x27;li, the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty. Nizar was defeated and jailed, but according to Nizari sources his son escaped to Alamut, where the Iranian Isma&#x27;ilis had accepted his claim.

The Musta&#x27;li line split again between the Taiyabi and the Hafizi, the former claiming that the 21st Imam and son of al-Amir bi-Ahkami&#x27;l-Lah went into occultation and appointed a Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq to guide the community, in a similar manner as the Isma&#x27;ili had lived after the death of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il. The latter claimed that the ruling Fatimid caliph was the Imām.

However, in the Mustaali branch, Dai came to have a similar but more important task. The term &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; () literally means &quot;the absolute or unrestricted missionary&quot;. This da&#x27;i was the only source of the Imam&#x27;s knowledge after the occultation of al-Qasim in Musta&#x27;li thought.

According to Taiyabi Ismaili tradition, after the death of Imam al-Amir, his infant son, at-Tayyib Abu&#x27;l-Qasim, about 2 years old, was protected by the most important woman in Musta&#x27;li history after Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatimah. She was Arwa al-Sulayhi, a queen in Yemen. She was promoted to the post of hujjah long before by Imām Mustansir at the death of her husband. She ran the da&#x27;wat from Yemen in the name of Imaam Tayyib. She was instructed and prepared by Imam Mustansir and ran the dawat from Yemen in the name of Imaam Tayyib, following Imams for the second period of Satr. It was going to be on her hands, that Imam Tayyib would go into seclusion, and she would institute the office of the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq. Zoeb bin Moosa was first to be instituted to this office. The office of da&#x27;i continued in Yemen up to 24th da&#x27;i Yusuf who shifted da&#x27;wat to India. . Before the shift of da&#x27;wat in India, the da&#x27;i&#x27;s representative were known as Wali-ul-Hind. Syedi Hasan Feer was one of the prominent Isma&#x27;ili wali of 14th century. The line of Tayyib Da&#x27;is that began in 1132 is still continuing under the main sect known as Dawoodi Bohra (see list of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra).

The Musta&#x27;li split several times over disputes regarding who was the rightful Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, the leader of the community within The Occultation.

After the 27th Da&#x27;i, Syedna Dawood bin Qutub Shah, there was another split; the ones following Syedna Dawood came to be called Dawoodi Bohra, and followers of Suleman were then called Sulaimani. Dawoodi Bohra&#x27;s present Da&#x27;i al Mutlaq, the 53rd, is Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, and he and his devout followers tread the same path, following the same tradition of the Aimmat Fatimiyyeen. The Sulaymani are mostly concentrated in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with some communities in the South Asia. The Dawoodi Bohra and Alavi Bohra are mostly exclusive to South Asia, after the migration of the da&#x27;wah from Yemen to India. Other groups include Atba-i-Malak and Hebtiahs Bohra. Mustaali beliefs and practices, unlike those of the Nizari and Druze, are regarded as compatible with mainstream Islam, representing a continuation of Fatimid tradition and fiqh.

====Decline of the Caliphate====
In the 1040s, the Zirid dynasty (governors of the Maghreb under the Fatimids) declared their independence and their conversion to Sunni Islam, which led to the devastating Banu Hilal invasions. After about 1070, the Fatimid hold on the Levant coast and parts of Syria was challenged by first Turkish invasions, then the First Crusade, so that Fatimid territory shrunk until it consisted only of Egypt. Damascus fell to the Seljuk Empire in 1076, leaving the Fatimids only in charge of Egypt and the Levantine coast up to Tyre and Sidon. Because of the vehement opposition to the Fatimids from the Seljuks, the Ismaili movement was only able to operate as a terrorist underground movement, much like the Assassins.

After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo had his general, Saladin, seize Egypt in 1169, forming the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty. This signaled the end of the Hafizi Mustaali branch of Ismailism as well as the Fatimid Caliphate.

===Alamut===
====Hassan-i Sabbah====

Very early in the empire&#x27;s life, the Fatimids sought to spread the Isma&#x27;ili faith, which in turn would spread loyalty to the Imamate in Egypt. One of their earliest attempts was taken by a missionary by the name of Hassan-i Sabbah.

Hassan-i Sabbah was born into a Twelver family living in the scholarly Persian city of Qom in 1056 CE. His family later relocated to the city of Tehran, which was an area with an extremely active Isma&#x27;ili Da&#x27;wah. He immersed himself in Ismāʿīlī thought; however, he did not choose to convert until he was overcome with an almost fatal illness and feared dying without knowing the Imām of his time.

Afterward, Hassan-i Sabbah became one of the most influential Da&#x27;is in Isma&#x27;ili history; he became important to the survival of the Nizari branch of Ismailism, which today is its largest branch.

Legend holds that he met with Imam al-Mustansir Billah and asked him who his successor would be, to which he responded that it would be his eldest son Nizar (Fatimid Imam).

Hassan-i Sabbah continued his missionary activities, which climaxed with his taking of the famous citadel of Alamut. Over the next two years, he converted most of the surrounding villages to Isma&#x27;ilism. Afterward, he converted most of the staff to Ismailism, took over the fortress, and presented Alamut&#x27;s king with payment for his fortress, which he had no choice but to accept. The king reluctantly abdicated his throne, and Hassan-i Sabbah turned Alamut into an outpost of Fatimid rule within Abbasid territory.

====The Hashasheen / Assassiyoon====
Surrounded by the Abbasids and other hostile powers and low in numbers, Hassan-i Sabbah devised a way to attack the Isma&#x27;ili enemies with minimal losses. Using the method of assassination, he ordered the murders of Sunni scholars and politicians who he felt threatened the Isma&#x27;ilis. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed on the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message to mean that he was marked for death. When an assassination was actually carried out, the Hashasheen would not be allowed to run away; instead, to strike further fear into the enemy, they would stand near the victim without showing any emotion and departed only when the body was discovered. This further increased the ruthless reputation of the Hashasheen throughout Sunni-controlled lands.

The English word &quot;assassins&quot; is said to have been derived from the Arabic word &quot;Hasaseen&quot; meaning annihilators as mentioned in Quran 3:152 or Hashasheen meaning both &quot;those who use hashish&quot; and &quot;throat slitters&quot; in Egyptian Arabic dialect, and one of the Shia Ismaili sects in the Syria of the eleventh century.

====Threshold of the Imāmate====
After the imprisonment of Nizar by his younger brother Ahmad al Mustaali, various sources indicate that Nizar&#x27;s son Ali Al-Hadi ibn Nizari survived and fled to Alamut. He was offered a safe place in Alamut, where Hassan-Al-Sabbah welcomed him. However, it is believed this was not announced to the public and the lineage was hidden until a few Imāms later to avoid further attacks hostility.

It was announced with the advent of Imam Hassan II. In a show of his Imamate and to emphasize the interior meaning (the batin) over the exterior meaning (the zahir), only two years after his accession, the Imām Hasan &#x27;Ala Zikrihi al-Salam conducted a ceremony known as &quot;qiyama&quot; (resurrection) at the grounds of the Alamut Castle, whereby the Imam would once again become visible to his community of followers in and outside of the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī state. Given Juwayni&#x27;s polemical aims, and the fact that he burned the Isma&#x27;ili libraries which may have offered much more reliable testimony about the history, scholars have been dubious about his narrative but are forced to rely on it given the absence of alternative sources. Fortunately, descriptions of this event are also preserved in Rashid al-Din&#x27;s narrative and recounted in the Haft Bab Baba-yi Sayyidna, written 60 years after the event, and the later Haft Bab-i Abi Ishaq, an Ismaili book of the 15th century AD. However, Rashid al-Din&#x27;s narrative is based on Juwayni, and the Nizari sources do not go into specific details. Since very few contemporary Nizari Ismaili accounts of the events have survived, and it is likely that scholars will never know the exact details of this event. However, there was no total abrogation of all law; only certain exoteric rituals like the Salah/Namaz, Fasting in Ramadan, Hajj to Makkah, and facing Makkah in prayer were abrogated; however, the Nizaris continued to perform rituals of worship, except these rituals were more esoteric and spiritually oriented. For example, the true prayer is to remember God at every moment; true fasting is to keep all of the body&#x27;s organs away from whatever is unethical and forbidden. Ethical conduct is enjoined at all times.

Afterward, his descendants ruled as the Imams at Alamut until its destruction by the Mongols.

====Destruction by the Mongols====

Through the 12th century, the Isma&#x27;ili continued to successfully ward off Sunni attempts to take Alamut, including by Saladin. The stronghold 
eventually met its destruction at the hands of the Khans in 1256. Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan led the devastating attack personally. As he would later do to the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, Hulagu destroyed Isma&#x27;ili as well as Islamic sacred and religious texts. The Imamate that was located in Alamut along with its few followers were forced to flee and take refuge elsewhere.

===Aftermath===
After the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate and its bases in Iran and Syria, the three currently living branches of Isma&#x27;ili generally developed geographically isolated from each other, with the exception of Syria (which has both Druze and Nizari) and Pakistan and the rest of South Asia (which had both Mustaali and Nizari).

The Musta&#x27;li progressed mainly under the Isma&#x27;ili-adhering Yemeni ruling class well into the 12th century, until the fall of the last Sulayhid dynasty, Hamdanids (Yemen) and Zurayids rump state in 1197 AD, then they shifted their da&#x27;wat to India under the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, working on behalf of their last Imam, Taiyyab, and are known as Bohra. From India, various groups spread mainly to south Asia and eventually to the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and America.

The Nizari have maintained large populations in Syria, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and they have smaller populations in China and Iran. This community is the only one with a living Imam, whose title is the Aga Khan. Badakhshan, which includes parts of northeastern Afghanistan and southeastern Tajikistan, is the only part of the world where Ismailis make up the majority of the population. This is due to Isma&#x27;ili scholar Nasir Khusraw, who spent as a hermit the last decades of his life in Badakhshan, gathering a considerable number of devoted adherents, who have handed down his doctrines to succeeding generations.

The Druze mainly settled in Syria and Lebanon and developed a community based upon the principles of reincarnation through their own descendants. Their leadership is based on community scholars, who are the only individuals allowed to read their holy texts. There is controversy over whether this group falls under the classification of Isma&#x27;ilism or Islam because of its unique beliefs.

The Tajiks of Xinjiang, being Isma&#x27;ili, were not subjected to being enslaved in China by Sunni Muslim Turkic peoples because the two peoples did not share a common geographical region. The Burusho people of Pakistan are also Nizaris. However, due to their isolation from the rest of the world, Islam reached the Hunza about 350 years ago. Ismailism has been practiced by the Hunza for the last 300 years. The Hunza have been ruled by the same family of kings for over 900 years. They were called Kanjuts. Sunni Islam never took root in this part of central Asia so even now, there are less than a few dozen Sunnis living among the Hunza.

===Ismaili historiography===
One of the most important texts in Ismaili historiography is the &quot;ʿUyun al-Akhbar&quot;, which is a reference source on the history of Ismailism that was composed in 7 books by the Tayyibi Mustaʻlian Ismaili &quot;daʻi&quot;-scholar, Idris Imad al-Din (born ca. 1392). This text presents the most comprehensive history of the Ismaili Imams and &quot;daʻwa&quot;, from the earliest period of Muslim history until the late Fatimid era. The author, Idris Imad al-Din, descended from the prominent al-Walid family of the Quraysh in Yemen, who led the Tayyibi Mustaʻlian Ismaili &quot;daʻwa&quot; for more than three centuries. This gave him access to the literary heritage of the Ismailis, including the majority of the extant Fatimid manuscripts transferred to Yemen. The &quot;ʻUyun al-Akhbar&quot; is being published in 7 volumes of annotated Arabic critical editions as part of an institutional collaboration between the Institut Français du Proche Orient (IFPO) in Damascus and The Institute of Ismaili Studies (IIS) in London. This voluminous text has been critically edited based on several old manuscripts from The Institute of Ismaili Studies&#x27; vast collection. These academic editions have been prepared by a team of Syrian and Egyptian scholars, including Dr Ayman F­ Sayyid, and this major publication project has been coordinated by Dr Nader El-Bizri (IIS) and Dr Sarab Atassi-Khattab (IFPO).

==Beliefs==

===View on the Quran===

In the Isma&#x27;ili belief, God&#x27;s Speech (&quot;kalam Allah&quot;) is the everlasting creative command that perpetuates all things and simultaneously embodies the essences of every existent being. This eternal commandment &quot;flows&quot; or &quot;emanates&quot; to prophets through a spiritual hierarchy that consists of the Universal Intellect, Universal Soul, and the angelic intermediaries of &quot;Jadd&quot;, &quot;Fath&quot;, and &quot;Khayal&quot; who are identified with the archangels Seraphiel, Michael (archangel), and Gabriel (&quot;Jibra&#x27;il&quot; in Arabic), respectively. As a result, the prophets receive revelations as divine, spiritual, and nonverbal &quot;inspiration&quot; (&quot;wahy&quot;) and &quot;support&quot; (&quot;taʾyīd&quot;), through the means of the Holy Spirit, Gabriel, which is a heavenly power that illuminates the souls of the prophets, just as the radiance of light reflects in a mirror. Accordingly, God illuminated Muhammad with a divine light (&quot;nur&quot;) that constituted the divine nonverbal revelation (through the medium of archangel Gabriel), and Muhammad, then, expressed the divine truths contained within this transmission in the Arabic terms that constitute the Quran. Consequently, the Isma&#x27;ilis believe that the Arabic Quran is God&#x27;s Speech in a secondary and subordinate sense, as it only verbally expresses the &quot;signs&quot; (&quot;āyāt&quot;) of God&#x27;s actual cosmic commandments.

According to the 14th Isma&#x27;ili Imam and fourth Fatimid Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah, &quot;[The Prophet] only conveyed the meanings of the inspiration [&quot;wahy&quot;] and the light – its obligations, rulings and allusions – by means of utterances composed with arranged, combined, intelligible, and audible letters&quot;.

The Isma&#x27;ili view on God&#x27;s Speech is therefore in contrast with the Hanbali view that it is eternal sounds and letters, the Mu&#x27;tazila view that it is a temporally created provision of sounds, and also the Ash&#x27;ari and Maturidi views that it is an everlasting nonverbal attribute contained in God&#x27;s essence. Even so, the Isma&#x27;ilis agree with most other Islamic schools of thought that the Quran is a miracle that is beyond imitation and without equal (&quot;mu&#x27;jiz&quot;), for its external linguistic form and presentiment of spiritual meanings transcends the limits of eminence of Arabic poetry, prose, and rhyming speech.

The Isma&#x27;ilis believe that Muhammad is the living embodiment of the Quran. For instance, the Isma&#x27;ili Da&#x27;i and poet Nasir-i Khusraw (Nasir Khusraw) believed that Muhammad&#x27;s soul expressed God&#x27;s nonverbal divine inspiration in the form of two symbolic oral discourses – the Quran and Prophetic guidance (Hadith). Therefore, on one hand, Muhammad constructed the verbal form of the Quran, and, on the other hand, through his existence, he embodied the living and speaking Quran: &quot;The cause of all existents [&quot;ʿillat al-aysiyyāt&quot;] is only the Word of God, ... [T]he Speaker Prophet is found to be a receptacle [&quot;mahāll&quot;] for the Word of God in the corporeal world and is designated by its names&quot;. As such, Muhammad is the &quot;locus of manifestation&quot; (&quot;mazhar&quot;) of God&#x27;s words, just as a reflective mirror to the radiance of light, and the Quran and Prophetic guidance (Hadith) are verbal manifestations of God&#x27;s words, which are reflections from this mirror.

The Isma&#x27;ili view of revelation also influences their perception of the meaning of the Quran. In this view, the Quran and prophetic guidance (Hadith) are encoded in symbols in parables that preserve a superior level of meaning. As such, the literal interpretation of the Quran is only the &quot;outward dimension&quot; (&quot;zāhir&quot;) of the divine revelations that Muhammad received, and beyond it lies the &quot;esoteric dimension&quot; (&quot;batin&quot;) of the religion that contains the divine truths (&quot;haqāʾiq&quot;). The Ismailis maintain that divine guidance is required to access the divine truths and superior meanings contained within the revelations.

The method of spiritual hermeneutics that is used to reveal this &quot;esoteric dimension&quot; or &quot;batin&quot; of the divine revelation is known as &quot;taʾwīl&quot;. According to Nasir Khusraw, &quot;taʾwīl&quot; is the process of &quot;returning&quot; something to its metaphysical source. In the context of ontology, &quot;taʾwīl&quot; is to discern an object in its original ontological domain as a symbol and parable that represents a reality in a higher ontological domain The opposite of &quot;taʾwīl&quot; is &quot;tanzīl&quot;, which is to encode divine realities in the form of symbols and parables that are interpretable to human beings in the material world.

The Isma&#x27;ilis believe that besides prophets, God&#x27;s Speech also illuminates the souls of the Legatees and Imams, through the medium of the Holy Spirit, which allows them to perform many of the spiritual functions of Muhammad. For example, in the Isma&#x27;ili hierarchical ranks (&quot;da&#x27;wa&quot;), Muhammad is the Messenger, Imam ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib (Ali) is his Legatee, and his successors from Imam Husayn ibn Ali to the Fatimid Caliphs (Fatimid Caliphate) are the Imams. As a result of being divinely inspired (&quot;muʾayyad&quot;), the Prophets, Legatees, and Imams can perform &quot;taʾwīl&quot; and disclose it as instruction (&quot;taʿlīm&quot;) to the lower ranks of the Ismaili &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot;, including regular people.

Unlike prophets, the Imams cannot compose a new &quot;tanzīl&quot;, instead they interpret the &quot;tanzīl&quot; (Quran) and prophetic guidance (Hadith) by reanalyzing them in the context of new circumstances, while retaining the underlying principled spirit, and help guide &quot;spiritual adepts&quot; to the divine truths by disclosing their inner meanings through the spiritual hermeneutics of &quot;taʾwīl&quot;. Every Imam provides this authoritative instruction (&quot;taʿlīm&quot;) to the community during their own time. As a consequence, the Isma&#x27;ili Imam acts as the &quot;speaking Quran&quot;, while the Arabic Quran, in its written or recitative form, is consigned the position of the &quot;silent Quran&quot;.

===The Ginans and Qasidas===

The Ginans are Nizari religious texts. They are written in the form of poetry by Pirs to interpret the meanings of Quranic ayat. In comparison to Ginans, Ismāʿīlīs of other origins, such as Persians, Arabs, and Central Asians, have qasidas () written in Persian by missionaries such as Nasir Khusraw and Hasan bin Sabah. As van-Skyhawk notes, an important link was established between the ginānic and qaṣā&#x27;id traditions when, in 1961, the 49th Ismāʿīlī Imām termed ʿAllāmah Naṣīr al-Dīn Hunzai&#x27;s Burushaskī qaṣā&#x27;id a &quot;ginān book in [the] Hunza language&quot;.

===Numerology===

Ismāʿīlīs believe numbers have religious meanings. The number seven plays a general role in the theology of the Ismā&#x27;īliyya, including mystical speculations that there are seven heavens, seven continents, seven orifices in the skull, seven days in a week, and so forth.

===Imamate===

For this sect, the Imām is the manifestation of truth, and hence he is their path of salvation to God.

Classical Ismāʿīlī doctrine holds that divine revelation had been given in six periods (daur) entrusted to six prophets, who they also call &quot;Natiq&quot; (Speaker), who were commissioned to preach a religion of law to their respective communities.

Whereas the Natiq was concerned with the rites and outward shape of religion, the inner meaning is entrusted to a &quot;Wasi&quot; (Representative). The Wasi would know the secret meaning of all rites and rules and would reveal them to small circles of initiates.

The Natiq and the Wasi are in turn succeeded by a line of seven Imāms, who guard what they received. The seventh and last Imām in any period becomes the Natiq of the next period. The last Imām of the sixth period, however, would not bring about a new religion of law but rather supersede all previous religions, abrogate the law and introduce &quot;din Adama al-awwal&quot; (&quot;the original religion of Adam&quot;) practised by Adam and the angels in paradise before the fall, which would be without ritual or law but consist merely in all creatures praising the creator and recognizing his unity. This final stage was called the Qiyamah.

===Pir and Dawah===

Just as the Imām is seen by Ismailis as the manifestation of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the relationship between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First, the student loved Dai, and from the Dai, he learned to love the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir. The Imam is the Pir in Nizari Ismailism.

===Zāhir===

In Ismailism, things have an exterior meaning, what is apparent. This is called &quot;zāhir.&quot;

A fundamental aspect of Ismailism is the co-existence of the physical and the spiritual, the &quot;zahir&quot; (exoteric) form and the &quot;batin&quot; (esoteric) essence. The esoteric is the source of the exoteric, and the exoteric is the manifestation of the esoteric. This concept is highlighted in the &quot;Epistle of the Right Path&quot;, a Persian-Ismaili prose text from the post-Mongol period of Ismaili history, by an anonymous author.

===Bātin===

In Ismailism, things have an interior meaning that is reserved for a special few who are in tune with the Imām or are the Imām himself. This is called &quot;bātin.&quot;

===&#x27;Aql===

As with other Shia, Ismāʿīlīs believe that the understanding of God is derived from the first light in the universe, the light of &#x27;Aql, which in Arabic roughly translates as &#x27;Intellect&#x27; or to &#x27;bind&#x27; (Latin: Intellectus). It is through this Universal Intellect (&#x27;aql al-kull) that all living and non-living entities know God, and all of humanity is dependent and united in this light. Contrastingly, in Twelver thought this includes the Prophets as well, especially Muhammad, who is the greatest of all the manifestations of &#x27;Aql.

God, in Ismaʻili metaphysics, is seen as above and beyond all conceptions, names, and descriptions. He transcends all positive and negative qualities, and knowledge of God as such is above all human comprehension.

For the Shia, the Light (&quot;nur&quot;) of the Imamate is the Universal Intellect, and consequently, the Imam on earth is the focus of manifestation (&quot;mazhar&quot;) of the Intellect.

==Acts of worship==
===Approach to the traditional five pillars of Islam===
 Isma&#x27;ilism has some difference. The Nizari Ismaili Muslims are strongly encouraged to pray what is known as the &quot;Du&#x27;a&quot; (a specific Nizari Ismaili prayer) three times a day. &quot;Salah&quot; in other forms are not obligatory, but Ismailis can offer them as well.

&quot;Zakat&quot; or charity in Isma&#x27;ilism resembles the Zakat of other Muslims. Along with zakat, Isma&#x27;ilis pay a tithe, a percentage of their asset to the Ismaili Imamate for use in development projects in the eastern world, to benefit Isma&#x27;ilis and have grown beyond that mission to encompass projects in areas where there are many faiths and ethnicities and where Ismailis do not live. The zakat rates historically differed depending on the asset type: 2.5% of animals, 5% of minerals, and 10% of crops. Among Khoja Ismailis, the zakat is 12.5% of cash income and among other Ismailis of Iran, Syria, Central Asia, and China, the zakat is 10% of cash income and other %s of non-cash assets like crops and livestock.

In terms of fasting (&quot;sawm&quot;) during Ramadan and at other times, the Nizari and Musta&#x27;ali sects believe in a metaphorical instead of literal meaning of fasting. The literal meaning is that one must fast as an obligation, such as during Ramadan, and the metaphorical meaning is seeking to attain the Divine Truth and striving to avoid worldly activities which may detract from this goal. In particular, Isma&#x27;ilis believe that the esoteric meaning of fasting involves a &quot;fasting of the soul&quot;, whereby they attempt to purify the soul simply by avoiding sinful acts and doing good deeds. In addition, the Nizari also fast on &quot;Shukravari Beej&quot; which falls on a Friday that coincides with the New Moon.

Many Ismaili sects do not ascribe to mainstream Islamic beliefs regarding the Hajj, considering it instead to metaphorically mean visiting the Imam himself, that being the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. Since the Druze do not follow shariah, they do not believe in a literal pilgrimage to the Kaaba in Mecca as other Muslims do, while the Mustaali (Bohras) still hold on to the literal meaning as well, performing hajj to the Ka&#x27;aba and also visiting the Imam (or in a secluded time, the Dai, who is the representative or vicegerent of the Imam) to be Hajj-e Haqiqi.

===Additional Isma&#x27;ili pillars===

Beyond the traditional five pillars of worship in Islam, Isma&#x27;ilis observe an additional two pillars, the first being &quot;taharah&quot;, which translates from Arabic as &quot;purity.&quot; Similar to the more general concept of ritual purity in Islam, &quot;taharah&quot; denotes a pure soul and includes bodily purity and cleanliness; without &quot;taharah&quot; of the body, clothes, and &quot;ma&#x27;salla&quot;, prayers are not believed to be accepted.

For the Isma&#x27;ilis, jihad is the last of the Seven Islamic Pillars, and for them it means a struggle against one&#x27;s own soul; striving toward righteousness.

===Walayah===

Another central act of worship for Ismailis is &quot;walayah&quot;, which translates from Arabic as &quot;guardianship&quot; and denotes &quot;Love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Aimmat and Imām uz Zaman, and Dai.&quot; It also denotes &quot;Ta&#x27;at&quot; (following every order without protest, but with one&#x27;s soul&#x27;s happiness, knowing that nothing is more important than a command from God and that the command of His vicegerents is His Word). In Ismāʿīlī doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and he manifests himself in the forms of Prophets and Imāms; to be guided to his path, one requires a messenger or a guide: a Dai. For the true &quot;mawali&quot; of the Imam and Dai, heaven is made obligatory. And only with this crucial &quot;walayat&quot;, they believe, will all the other pillars and acts ordained by Islam be judged or even looked at by God.

==Branches==
===Nizari===
The largest part of the Ismāʿīlī community, the Qasim-Shahi Nizari Ismāʿīlīs, today accept Prince Rahim Aga Khan V as their 50th Imām, who they claim is descended from Muḥammad through his daughter Fāṭimah az-Zahra and &#x27;Ali, Muḥammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law. The 46th Ismāʿīlī Imām, Aga Hassan ʻAlī Shah, fled Iran in the 1840s after being blamed for a failed coup against the Shah of the Qajar dynasty. Aga Hassan ʻAlī Shah settled in Mumbai in 1848.
====Islamic marriage contract reforms by the Aga Khan III====
===== History =====
The Nizari Ismaili Imams (known as the Aga Khans since the 18th century have used their power to institute reforms that affected personal lives of men and women in the community. Aga Khan III, the 48th Nizari Ismaili Imam, was passionate in this movement. He came into his role at an early age, due to his father&#x27;s early death, so his mother, Lady Ali Shah, played an influential role during his early years. The influence of women during his rule continued in his later years with his wife Umm Habiba. Imam Aga Khan III ruled from 1885 to 1957 and the 49th Imam, his grandson, Imam Aga Khan IV ruled from 1957 to 2025. A majority of Aga Khan III&#x27;s efforts sought to reform Ismaili marriage contract laws which have significantly impacted women within the Nizari Ismaili community.

===== Reforms (on marriage, divorce, segregation and education) =====
The focus of Imam Aga Khan III&#x27;s message was to promote the idea that women were free and independent. In a message to his followers in 1926, he proclaimed that:

&quot;&quot;I do not want Ismaili women dependent on anyone—their parents, husbands, or anyone except God...I have no doubt that the whole spirit and teaching of my ancestor the Holy Prophet encouraged the evolution of all legitimate freedom and legitimate equality before men and women&quot;.&quot;

The Aga Khan also played a pivotal role in promoting women&#x27;s participation in the affairs of the Ismaili community. He criticized practices such as veiling, gender segregation, and the acts of Pardah (masking oneself from the public) and zenana (restraint on women from leaving the home). In addition, the Ismaili community from various parts of the world worshipped jointly, often in multiple languages. This has led to a general absence of racial segregation. Women play are actively engaged in all aspects of ritual practice, reflecting the inclusive and egalitarian values espoused by the Imam.

Aga Khan III believed economic independence was key to achieving this equality and freedom. By becoming educated and earning their own livelihood, women would no longer be a burden on their parents or spouses. He proclaimed:

&quot;I am trying to guide our young women&#x27;s lives into entirely new channels. I want to see them able to earn their livings in trades and professions, so that they are not economically dependent on marriage, nor a burden on their fathers and brother[s]&quot;.

In effect, marriage would no longer be imposed on women due to economic necessity. The Aga Khan III realized that education was at the forefront of this reform and encouraged parents who only had enough money to send one child to school to send their daughters. And this advocacy for education was not limited to elementary literacy. To ensure girls had access to education, there was a minimum marriageable age instituted (for both boys and girls) and child marriage was banned. Moreover, marriage against the will of the bride was outlawed as brides were to sign their marriage contracts according to their choice. Other reforms in marriage laws included decisions on polygamy and divorce. In 1905, polygamy was permitted with the condition of the &quot;maintenance of the first wife&quot; and later that was changed to only be allowed for specific reasons. In 1962, polygamy was outlawed within the Nizari Ismaili community. Women were allowed to divorce their husbands and for a husband to divorce his wife, he was required to stand before a council which ultimately decided whether the divorce was granted or denied. Additionally, Aga Khan III took efforts to eliminate and mitigate the stigma around divorces and divorced women.

===== Barriers to realization of reforms =====
A discrepancy exists between the rights offered to women through these reforms and the actual realization of the practice of those rights. Cultural norms and views continue to guide many members of the community who criticize the reforms as being influenced from western values. The Aga Khan responded to this critique by claiming that:

&quot;&quot;While the words of the Koran remain the same, every generation, every century, every period must have a new and different interpretation of the past, otherwise Islam will die and will not survive the competition of some healthy less rigid competitors&quot;.&quot;
Additional barriers to practice of reforms include the fact that the councils implementing the forms are often majority male who may still adhere to patriarchal norms. The laws of the countries in which Ismaili women reside also impact the implementation of reforms. Sharia law, common in most Sunni majority countries, is often in contrast to the Ismaili reforms and so residents of these countries must adhere to the country&#x27;s rules and regulations. The situation of Ismaili women depends on factors including their government and its laws, economic ability, resource availability, and global conditions.

===Muhammad-Shahi Nizari/Mumini===
The offshoot of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis who follow the elder son of Shams al-Din (Nizari) Muḥammad d. 1310, the 28th Qasim-Shahi Imam, named ʻAlāʼ ad-Dīn Mumin Shāh d. 1337 (26th Imam of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis) and his son Muhammad Shah d 1404, the twenty-seventh Imam. They follow this line of Imams until the disappearance of the 40th Imam al-Amir Muhammad al-Baqir in 1796 when they lost contact with him while he resided in India. The bulk of this group joined the Qasim-Shahi Nizaris led by the Aga Khan in 1887. There are 15,000 followers of this line of Nizari Imams in Syria today, locally called the Jafariyah who follow the Shafi&#x27;i Fiqh in the absence of their Imam.

There is also a historical dispute as to whether Imam Qasim Shah was a brother or a paternal uncle to ʻAlāʼ ad-Dīn Mumin Shāh. The most famous Imam of this line of Nizari Imams was Shah Tahir bin Radi al-Din II al-Husayni ad-Dakkani, the 31st Imam who died in 1549. He was famous for converting the sultan of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate Burhan Nizam Shah I to Shia Islam. His father the 30th Imam Radi al-Din II bin Tahir who died in 1509, came from Sistan to Badakshan and established his rule of the region. He was killed and a regional Timurid dynasty ruler Mirza Khan established his rule over the region.

===Musta&#x27;ali===

In time, the seat for one chain of Dai was split between India and Yemen as the community split several times, each recognizing a different Dai. Today, the Dawoodi Bohras, which constitute the majority of the Mustaali Ismāʿīlī accept Mufaddal Saifuddin as the 53rd Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq. The Dawoodi Bohras are based in India, along with the Alavi Bohra. Minority groups of the Sulaymani, however, exist in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In recent years, there has been a rapprochement between the Sulaymani, Dawoodi, and Alavi Mustaali sub-sects.

The Mustaali sects are the most traditional of the three main groups of Ismāʿīlī, maintaining rituals such as prayer and fasting more consistently with the practices of other Shia sects. It is often said that they resemble Sunni Islam even more than Twelvers do, though this would hold true for matters of the exterior rituals (&quot;zahir&quot;) only, with little bearing on doctrinal or theological differences.

===Dawoodi Bohra===

The Dawoodi Bohras are a very close-knit community who seeks advice from Dai on spiritual and temporal matters.

Dawoodi Bohras is headed by the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq, who is appointed by his predecessor in office. The Dāʻī al-Mutlaq appoints two others to the subsidiary ranks of māzūn (Arabic Maʾḏūn مأذون) &quot;licentiate&quot; and Mukāsir (). These positions are followed by the rank of ra&#x27;sul hudood, bhaisaheb, miya-saheb, shaikh-saheb, and mulla-saheb, which are held by several of Bohras. The &#x27;Aamil or Saheb-e Raza who is granted the permission to perform the religious ceremonies of the believers by the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq and also leads the local congregation in religious, social, and community affairs, is sent to each town where a sizable population of believers exists. Such towns normally have a masjid (commonly known as a mosque) and an adjoining jamaa&#x27;at-khaana (assembly hall) where socio-religious functions are held. The local organizations which manage these properties and administer the social and religious activities of the local Bohras report directly to the central administration of the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq.

While the majority of Dawoodi Bohras have traditionally been traders, it is becoming increasingly common for them to become professionals. Some choose to become Doctors, consultants or analysts as well as a large contingent of medical professionals. Dawoodi Bohras are encouraged to educate themselves in both religious and secular knowledge, and as a result, the number of professionals in the community is rapidly increasing. Dawoodi Bohras believe that the education of women is equally important as that of men, and many Dawoodi Bohra women choose to enter the workforce. Al Jamea tus Saifiyah (The Arabic Academy) in Mumbai, Surat, Nairobi and Karachi is a sign to the educational importance in the Dawoodi community. The academy has an advanced curriculum that encompasses religious and secular education for both men and women.

Today there are approximately one million Dawoodi Bohra. The majority of these reside in India and Pakistan, but there is also a significant diaspora residing in the Middle East, East Africa, Europe, North America and the Far East.

The ordinary Bohra is highly conscious of his identity, and this is especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a &quot;topi&quot;), and women wear the &quot;rida&quot;, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida&#x27;s difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern, and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women&#x27;s faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the &#x27;pardi&#x27; that usually hangs on the back like the hood of a jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community&#x27;s values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate&#x27;s evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women&#x27;s chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.

They believe that straying away from the community implies straying away from Ma&#x27;ad – the ultimate objective of this life and the meaning of the teachings of Islam, which is to return to where all souls come from and re-unite with Allah. Besides, converting someone to Islam has high spiritual and religious significance as doctrines espouse that making someone a Muslim or Mu&#x27;min confers the Sawab (the reward of good deeds) equivalent to that of 40 Hajjs and 40 Umrahs (visiting Mecca and the Kaaba during days other than that of Hajj).

The position of Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq is currently disputed after the demise of the 52nd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Mohammed Burhanuddin. Two claimants emerged for the position of 53rd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, Mufaddal Saifuddin and Khuzaima Qutbuddin, and the Bombay High Court has ruled in the favour of Mufaddal Saifuddin as the righteous successor of the community. Qutbuddin has since died and appointed his son Taher Fakhruddin as his successor. 

Besides speaking the local languages, the Dawoodis have their own language called Lisānu l-Dāʻwat &quot;Tongue of the Dāʻwat&quot;. This is written in the Persian alphabet but is derived from Urdu, Gujarati, and Arabic and Persian.

===Sulaymani===
Founded in 1592, the Sulaymani are mostly concentrated in Yemen but are also found in Pakistan and India. The denomination is named after its 27th Daʻī, Sulayman bin Hassan. They are referred to and prefer to be referred to as Ahle-Haq Ismaʻilis and Sulaymanis and not with the Bohras suffix.

The total number of Sulaymanis currently are around 300,000, mainly living in the eastern district of Jabal Haraz in northwest Yemen and in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Beside the Banu Yam of Najran, the Sulaymanis are in Haraz, among the inhabitants of the Jabal Maghariba and in Hawzan, Lahab and Attara, as well as in the district of Hamadan and in the vicinity of Yarim.

In India there are between 3000 and 5000 Sulaymanis living mainly in Vadodara, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Surat. In Punjab, Pakistan, there is a well-established Sulaymani community in Sind. Some ten thousand Sulaymanis live in rural areas of Punjab known to the Sulaymani as &quot;Jazeera-e Sind&quot;; these Sulaymani communities have been in the Jazeera-e Sind from the time of Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah when he sent his Daʻīs to Jazeera-e Sind.

There are also some 900–1000 Sulaymanis mainly from South Asia scattered around the world, in the Persian Gulf States, United States, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom.

===Alavi Bohra===
The ʻAlavi Bohras, popularly and incorrectly known as Alya Bohras, follow a different line of succession of Duʼaat (&quot;missionaries&quot;) from the 29th daʼi onwards after the split from Daʼudi Bohras in Ahmedabad in 1621 CE. They believe the rightful daʼi was a grandson of the 28th daʼi named ʻAli Shams al-Din b. Ibrahim (d. 1046 AH/1637 CE). They are named after this ʻAli, calling themselves ʻAlavis, and their mission ad-Daʼwat ul-Haadiyat ul-ʻAlaviyah. Three daʼis later, in 1110 AH/1699 CE, the seat of the ʻAlavi Daʼwat was moved from Ahmedabad to Vadodara by 32nd daʼi, acting on the will of 31st daʼi (except for a brief interlude in Surat for 20 years 1158–1178 AH/1745–1764 CE). Since then Vadodara remains the headquarters of the ʻAlavis to this day. The ʻAlavi Bohras have a library of 450 Ismaʻili manuscripts, some up to 500 years old, at their centre in Vadodara.

Currently, ʻAlavi Bohras are a close-knit organized community numbering approximately 8000, with the majority of them settled in Vadodara, where they have their own locality. They have their own masjids and musafirkhanas in places like Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Nadiad in India. Some have migrated to the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, UAE and Europe. Like majority of Bohra communities, ʻAlavi Bohras are mostly traders and dominate the optical and furniture market in Vadodara. They are now increasingly venturing into professions such as law, medicine, engineering, business management, computer sciences. Beings Ismaʻili-Taiyebis they follow strictly Fatimid spiritual hierarchical set-up, law, dress code, customs, beliefs, eating habits, lifestyle, ethics and customary traditions, etc.

While lesser-known and smallest in number, Alavi Bohras have their spiritual and temporal head as the 45th dāʿī al-muṭlaq, Haatim Zakiyuddin. The doctrines of Alavi Bohras is centered on the recognition of the Imam. It continues to be the most important foundation among Bohras. In fact, &quot;dai al-mutlaq&quot; acts as a direct representative of the concealed Imam as he receives required guidance from him. During this time of the concealment of 21st Fatimid Imam at-Taiyeb and his progeny, the religious hierarchy of the Alavi Bohras is headed by the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq, who is appointed by his predecessor in office and similar as of Dawoodi Bohra.

===Hebtiahs Bohra===
The Hebtiahs Bohra are a branch of Mustaali Ismaili Shia Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 39th Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq in 1754.

===Atba-i-Malak===
The Atba-i Malak jamaat (community) are a branch of Mustaali Ismaili Shia Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 46th Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, under the leadership of Abdul Hussain Jivaji. They have further split into two more branches, the Atba-i-Malak Badar and Atba-i-Malak Vakil.

=== Progressive Dawoodi Bohra ===
The Progressive Dawoodi Bohra is a reformist sect within Musta&#x27;li Ismai&#x27;li Shia Islam that broke off circa 1977. They disagree with mainstream Dawoodi Bohra, as led by the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, on doctrinal, economic and social issues.

===Druze===

While on one view there is a historical nexus between the Druze and Ismāʿīlīs, any such links are purely historical and do not entail any modern similarities, given that one of the Druze&#x27;s central tenets is trans-migration of the soul (reincarnation) as well as other contrasting beliefs with Ismāʿīlīsm and Islam. Druze is an offshoot of Ismailism. Many historical links do trace back to Syria and particularly Masyaf. The Druze faith is often classified as a branch of Isma&#x27;ili; although according to various scholars Druze faith &quot;diverge substantially from Islam, both Sunni and Shia&quot;. The Druze faith further split from Isma&#x27;ilism as it developed its own unique doctrines, and finally separated from both Ismāʿīlīsm and Islam altogether; these include the belief that the Imam Al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh was God incarnate. 

Even though the faith originally developed out of Isma&#x27;ilism, most Druze no longer consider themselves Muslims, Druze also are not considered Muslims by those belonging to orthodox Islamic schools of thought (see Islam and Druze). Ibn Taymiyyah also pointed out that Druze were not Muslims, and neither &#x27;Ahl al-Kitāb (People of the Book) nor mushrikin, rather they were kuffār (Infidel).

===Satpanth===

Satpanth is a subgroup of Nizari Ismailism and Ismaili Sufism formed by conversions from Hinduism 700 years ago by Pir Sadardin (1290–1367) and 600 years ago in the 15th century by his grandson Pir Imam Shah (1430–1520), they differ slightly from the Nizari Khojas in that they reject the Aga Khan as their leader and are known more commonly as Imam-Shahi. There are villages in Gujarat which are totally &#x27;Satpanthi&#x27; such as Pirana near Ahmedabad where Imam Shah is buried. It is also the older form of Nizari Ismaili practice originating from the Kutch community of Gujarat. Pir Sadardin gave the first converts to Ismailism the name &#x27;Satpanth&#x27; because they were the followers of the &#x27;True Path.&#x27; They were then given the title of Khoja to replace their title of Thakkar.

===Extinct branches===

====Böszörmény====

According to the historian Yaqut al-Hamawi, the Böszörmény (&quot;Izmaelita&quot; or &quot;Ismaili&quot;/&quot;Nizari&quot;) denomination of the Muslims who lived in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 10–13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary. However following the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary their community was either Christianized or became crypto-Muslims by the end of the 13th century and later assimilated into the Bektashi Order following the Ottoman conquest of Hungary.

====Hafizi====

This branch held that whoever the political ruler (caliph) of the Fatimid Caliphate was, was also the Imam of the Time, after the reign of Al-Amir, Al-Hafiz was recognized as the Imam of the Time as well as his descendants. The Hafizi Ismaili sect had 26 Imams. The Hafizi sect lived on into the 14th century AD with adherents in Northern Egypt and Syria but had died out by the 15th century AD.

====Seveners====

A branch of the Ismāʿīlī known as the &quot;Sab&#x27;īyah&quot; &quot;Seveners&quot; hold that Ismāʿīl was the seventh and final Ismāʿīlī Imam, and that his son, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, would return from Occultation and bring about an age of justice as Mahdi. However, most scholars believe this group is either extremely small or non-existent today. The Qarmatians were the most active branch of the Seveners.

==Inclusion in Amman Message and Islamic Ummah==
The Amman Message, which was issued on 9 November 2004 (27th of Ramadan 1425 AH) by King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, called for tolerance and unity in the Muslim world. Subsequently, the &quot;Amman Message&quot; Conference took place in Amman, Jordan on 4–6 July 2005, and a three-point declaration was issued by 200 Muslim academics from over 50 countries focusing on the three issues of:

# Defining who is a Muslim;
# Excommunication from Islam (&quot;takfir&quot;); and
# Principles related to delivering religious edicts (&quot;fatāwa&quot;).

The three-point declaration (later known as &quot;The Three Points of the Amman Message&quot;) included both the Ja&#x27;fari and Zaydi Shia &quot;madhāhib&quot; (schools of jurisprudence) among the eight schools of jurisprudence that were listed as being in the Muslim fold and whose adherents were, therefore, to be considered as &quot;Muslim by definition&quot; and therefore cannot be excluded from the world community of Muslims.

The Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Nizari Ismailis, was invited to issue a religious edict for and on behalf of the Ismailis, which he did by a letter explicitly stating that the Ismailis adhered to the Ja&#x27;fari school as well as other schools of close affinity including the Sufi principles concerned with a personal search for God.

The summarization by Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad explicitly delineates on page 11 the place of the Ismailis as being &quot;within&quot; the Ja&#x27;fari school as stated by the Aga Khan.

==Ismailism amongst Shia Islam==
The Shia belief throughout its history split over the issue of the Imamate. The largest branch is the Twelvers, followed by the Ismailis then the Zaidis and Kaysanite. All the groups follow a different line of Imamate linked together as shown in the chart below.

<doc id="172703" wikidata="Q108223" url="?curid=172703" title="Belize City">
<text>Belize City is the largest city in Belize. It was once the capital of the former British Honduras. According to the 2022 census, Belize City has a population of 63,999 people. It is at the mouth of the Haulover Creek, which is a distributary of the Belize River. The Belize River empties into the Caribbean Sea from Belize City on the Philip Goldson Highway on the coast of the Caribbean. The city is the country&#x27;s principal port and its financial and industrial hub. Cruise ships drop anchor outside the port and are tendered by local citizens. The city was almost entirely destroyed in October 1961 when Hurricane Hattie swept ashore. It was the capital of British Honduras (as Belize was then named) until the government was moved to the new capital of Belmopan in 1970.

==History==
Belize City was founded as &quot;Belize Town&quot; in 1638 by English lumber harvesters. It had been a small Maya settlement called &quot;Holzuz&quot;. Belize Town was ideal for the English as a central post because it was on the sea and a natural outlet for local rivers and creeks down which the British shipped logwood and mahogany. Belize Town also became the home of the thousands of African slaves brought in by the English (later the British, beginning in 1707) to toil in the forestry industry. It was the coordination site for the 1798 Battle of St. George&#x27;s Caye, won by the British against would-be invaders, and the home of the local courts and government officials up to the 1970s. For this reason, historians often say that &quot;the capital was the colony&quot;, because the center of British control was here.

This sentiment remains true today. Even though people like Antonio Soberanis Gómez, George Price and Evan X Hyde all lobbied to take their movements outside, and other ethnic groups such as the Garifuna and Mestizos sprang up elsewhere in the country, people looked to Belize Town for guidance.

===Natural disasters===
Belize City has been directly struck by two hurricanes since 1900, the 1931 hurricane and the 1961 Hurricane Hattie, and at various times areas of the city have burnt down, the most recent being fires in the 1999 and 2004. The city was also hit hard by Hurricane Richard in 2010 and by the 2016 Hurricane Earl. Fires on the Northside and Southside have burnt out great stretches of housing, but the fire department was able to quench most of these. The city is also susceptible to flooding in the rainy season.

==Location and geographic setting==
Belize City spreads out Mile 6 on the Western Highway and Mile 5 on the Northern Highway, at the Haulover Bridge.
The city proper is usually divided into two areas: Northside, bounded by Haulover Creek and ending in the east at the Fort George area, and Southside, extending to the outskirts of the city and the port area including downtown. Politically, it is divided into ten constituencies.

===Cityscape===
Freetown, the westernmost constituency on Northside, is home to the Belama, Coral Grove, Buttonwood Bay and Vista Del Mar suburbs. Within the city proper it extends up to around the former Belize Technical College area.

Caribbean Shores includes Kings&#x27; Park, a small suburb north and west of Freetown Road, West Landivar, home to two of the University of Belize&#x27;s three city campuses, and residential University Heights.

Pickstock inhabits the banks of the Haulover Creek extending to Barrack Road. St. John&#x27;s Cathedral stands on the southern end of Albert Street. St. John&#x27;s is the oldest Anglican Church in Central America, and one of the oldest buildings in Belize. The orange bricks came to Belize aboard British ships as ballast. Construction began in 1812, and the church was completed in 1820. St. John&#x27;s is the only Anglican cathedral in the world outside England where the crowning of kings took place.

Fort George is perhaps the most colonial area in the city and contains Memorial Park, the Baron Bliss Grave and Baron Bliss Lighthouse and the Museum of Belize.

On the Southside, Lake Independence, Collet and Port Loyola are home to some of the city&#x27;s poorest residents. &quot;London bridges&quot;, rickety wooden pallets linking dwellings, and low-strung poles are not uncommon here. On the east side of Central American Boulevard are Mesopotamia, Queen&#x27;s Square and Albert, which are slightly better. Albert contains the downtown streets of Albert and Regent Streets.

===Bridges and other infrastructure===
The divisions of the city are linked by four bridges: the Swing Bridge, at Market Square and North Front Street; the Belchina Bascule Bridge at the Douglas Jones Street and Youth for the Future Drive junction; the Belcan Bridge linking Central American Boulevard and the roundabout leading to the Northern Highway and Caribbean Shores, and a recently built fourth bridge linking Fabers&#x27; Road and the southern Lake Independence/Port Loyola area to the Belama and northwest suburbs of the city. Numerous smaller bridges link individual streets.

The three main canals running in Belize City, are Haulover Creek, Burdon Canal and Collet Canal. All of them run through Southside.

==Climate==
Belize City features a tropical monsoon climate, with very warm to hot and humid conditions throughout the course of the year. The city has a lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. However, as is the characteristic of several cities with tropical monsoon climates, Belize City sees some precipitation during its dry season. March is Belize City&#x27;s driest month with only of rainfall observed, a somewhat unusual month for a city with this climate type. Typically the driest month for a city with a tropical monsoon climate is the month after the winter solstice, which in Belize City would be January. Average monthly temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from .

==Educational institutions==

Belize City has more educational institutions at every level than any other city in Belize. Most city children in Belize attend high school. The only three schools that are not coed are on the Northside: Saint John&#x27;s College (boys), Saint Catherine&#x27;s Academy (girls) and Pallotti High School (girls). One Southside school that was previously all girls, Sadie Vernon Technical (Belize Continuation), became coed in 2005.

There are three other private schools in Belize City: Belize Elementary School and its continuation Belize High School behind it, both on Princess Margret Drive, and the Hummingbird Elementary School.

==Culture==

Belize City&#x27;s culture is considered similar to that of Caribbean capital cities such as St. George&#x27;s, Grenada, or Georgetown, Guyana. Always busy in the daytime, the city has the hustle and bustle one would associate with a city of 70,800. Notable cultural events include Garifuna Settlement Day (November 19), Belize City Carnival (September), Baron Bliss Day (March 9).

Museums in the city include the Bliss Institute, Image Factory Art Foundation and Gallery, the Maritime Museum and the Museum of Belize. There is an annual Street Art Festival.

==Economy==

The majority of working Belizeans travel to work in downtown offices or else ply their trade on the street sides. Belize City is home to branches of all the major banks of Belize and the Central Bank, as well as nearly all insurance centers, marketplaces and the like. Belize City is the hub for both national and international air, sea and road travel.

===Port of Belize===
The city is home to the Port of Belize, the country&#x27;s main port facility.

==Government==

Belize City is operated by a mayor-council form of government. The Belize City Council is composed of 10 councillors (generally reflecting the ten constituencies of Belize City) and a mayor, all elected in municipal elections held every third year in March. After the most recent municipal elections in 2024, the mayor is Bernard Wagner of the People&#x27;s United Party.

The city is also home to the House of Culture, formerly the official residence of the Governor-General of Belize until 1984. The Supreme Court of Belize still sits in Belize City.

==Transportation==

Belize City will have railway lines southwestward to Spanish Lookout via Belmopan and northward to Orange Walk Town. Feasibility studies are being conducted by CRECG.

===Air travel===
The city is served by Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport, in Ladyville, northwest of Belize City, and by Belize City Municipal Airport, within the city itself.

<doc id="172705" wikidata="Q456413" url="?curid=172705" title="Clare Boothe Luce">
<text>Clare Boothe Luce (; March 10, 1903 – October 9, 1987) was an American writer, politician, diplomat, and public conservative figure. A versatile author, she is best known for her 1936 hit play &quot;The Women&quot;, which had an all-female cast. Her writings extended from drama and screen scenarios to fiction, journalism, and war reportage. She served as U.S. Ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, and as a U.S. Representative from Connecticut from 1943 to 1947. She was married to Henry Luce, publisher of &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

Politically, Luce was a leading conservative in later life and was well known for her anti-communism. In her youth, she briefly aligned herself with the liberalism of President Franklin Roosevelt as a protégé of Bernard Baruch but later became an outspoken critic of Roosevelt. Although she was a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance in World War II, she remained outspokenly critical of British colonialism in India.

Known as a charismatic and forceful public speaker, especially after her conversion to Catholicism in 1946, she campaigned for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie to Ronald Reagan.

==Early life==
Luce was born Ann Clare Boothe in New York City on March 10, 1903, the second child of Anna Clara Schneider (also known as Ann Snyder Murphy, Ann Boothe, and Ann Clare Austin) and William Franklin Boothe (also known as &quot;John J. Murphy&quot; and &quot;Jord Murfe&quot;). Her parents were not married and would separate in 1912. Her father, a sophisticated man and a brilliant violinist, instilled in his daughter a love of literature, if not of music, but had trouble holding a job and spent years as a traveling salesman. Parts of young Clare&#x27;s childhood were spent in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, Chicago, Illinois, and Union City, New Jersey as well as New York City. Clare Boothe had an elder brother, David Franklin Boothe.
She attended the cathedral schools in Garden City and Tarrytown, New York, graduating first in her class in 1919 at 16. Her ambitious mother&#x27;s initial plan for her was to become an actress. Clare understudied Mary Pickford on Broadway at age 10, and had her Broadway debut in Mrs. Henry B. Harris&#x27; production of &quot;The Dummy&quot; in 1914, a detective comedy. She then had a small part in Thomas Edison&#x27;s 1915 movie, &quot;The Heart of a Waif&quot;. After a tour of Europe with her mother and stepfather, Dr. Albert E. Austin, whom Ann Boothe married in 1919, she became interested in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, and she was hired by Alva Belmont to work for the National Woman&#x27;s Party in Washington, D.C. and Seneca Falls, New York.

She wed George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire heir to a New York clothing fortune, on August 10, 1923, at the age of 20. They had one daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw (1924–1944) who was killed in a car accident. According to Boothe, Brokaw was a hopeless alcoholic, and the marriage ended in divorce on May 20, 1929.

On November 23, 1935, she married Henry Luce, the publisher of &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Fortune&quot;. She thereafter called herself Clare Boothe Luce, a frequently misspelled name that was often confused with that of her exact contemporary Claire Luce, a stage and film actress. As a professional writer, Luce continued to use her maiden name.

In 1939 she commissioned Frida Kahlo to paint a portrait of the late Dorothy Hale. Kahlo produced &quot;The Suicide Of Dorothy Hale&quot;. Luce was appalled and almost destroyed it; however, Isamu Noguchi dissuaded her. Luce later anonymously donated the painting to the Phoenix Art Museum.

On January 11, 1944, her only child, Ann Clare Brokaw, a 19-year-old senior at Stanford University, was killed in an automobile accident. As a result of the tragedy, Luce explored psychotherapy and religion. After grief counseling with Bishop Fulton Sheen, she was received into the Catholic Church in 1946. She became an ardent essayist and lecturer in celebration of her faith, and she was ultimately honored by being named a Dame of Malta. As a memorial to her daughter, beginning in 1949 she funded the construction of a Catholic church in Palo Alto for use by the Stanford campus ministry. The new Saint Ann Chapel was dedicated in 1951. It was sold by the diocese in 1998 and in 2003 became a church of the Anglican Province of Christ the King.

==Marriage to Henry Luce==
The marriage between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was by any standard extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman&#x27;s discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife&#x27;s social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare&#x27;s years as managing editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of &quot;Life&quot; magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for &quot;Life&quot;, but the question of how much coverage she should be accorded in &quot;Time&quot;, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since he did not want to be accused of nepotism.

It has been reported that their marriage was sexually &quot;open&quot;. Clare Luce&#x27;s lovers included Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, Randolph Churchill, General Lucian Truscott, General Charles Willoughby, and Roald Dahl.

Joseph P. Kennedy was the father of several United States politicians. Clare Luce at times provided advice to the campaigns of John F. Kennedy, who became the 35th U.S. president.

Dahl, who became a very successful author after the war, was at the time a young RAF fighter pilot, temporarily assigned to Washington. He was part of a plan developed by spymaster Sir William Stephenson (code name &quot;Intrepid&quot;), intended to weaken American isolationist thinking by influencing, among others, American journalists and politicians. Dahl was

The very tall (6&#x27;6&quot;) and athletic Dahl later claimed he found his affair with Clare to be so physically demanding that he had begged the British ambassador to relieve him of the task, but the ambassador told him he must continue.

In the early 1960s, both Luces were friends of philosopher, author, and LSD advocate Gerald Heard. They tried LSD one time under his careful supervision. Although taking LSD never turned into a habit for either of the Luces, a friend (and biographer of Clare), Wilfred Sheed, wrote that Clare made use of it at least several times.

The Luces stayed together until Henry&#x27;s death from a heart attack in 1967. As one of the great &quot;power couples&quot; in American history, they were bonded by their mutual interests and complementary, if contrasting, characters. They treated each other with respect in public, never more so than when he willingly acted as his wife&#x27;s consort during her years as ambassador to Italy. She was never able to convert him to Catholicism (he was the son of a Presbyterian missionary) but he did not question the sincerity of her faith, often attended Mass with her, and defended her when she was criticized by his fellow Protestants.

In the early years of her widowhood, she retired to the luxurious beach house that she and her husband had planned in Honolulu, but boredom with life in what she called &quot;this fur-lined rut&quot; brought her back to Washington, D.C. for increasingly long periods. She made her final home there in 1983.

==Writing career==

Luce published &quot;Stuffed Shirts&quot;, a volume of short stories, in 1931. &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; compared the work to Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; for its bitter humor. &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it socially superficial, but praised its &quot;lovely festoons of epigrams&quot; and beguiling stylishness: &quot;What malice there may be in these pages has a felinity that is the purest Angoran.&quot; The book&#x27;s device of characters interlinked from story to story was borrowed from Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (1919), but it impressed Andre Maurois, who asked Luce&#x27;s permission to imitate it. Luce also published many magazine articles. She was also a playwright.

After the failure of her initial stage effort, the marital melodrama &quot;Abide With Me&quot; (1935), she rapidly followed up with a satirical comedy, &quot;The Women&quot;. Deploying a cast of no fewer than 40 actresses who discussed men in often scorching language, it became a Broadway smash in 1936 and, three years later, a successful Hollywood movie known for its exclusively female cast. Toward the end of her life, Luce claimed that for half a century, she had steadily received royalties from productions of &quot;The Women&quot; all around the world. Later in the 1930s, she wrote two more successful, but less durable plays, also both made into movies: &quot;Kiss the Boys Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Margin for Error&quot;. The latter work &quot;presented an all-out attack on the Nazis&#x27; racist philosophy&quot;. Its opening night in Princeton, New Jersey, on October 14, 1939, was attended by Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. Otto Preminger directed and starred in both the Broadway production and screen adaptation.

Much of Luce&#x27;s famously acid wit (&quot;No good deed goes unpunished&quot;, &quot;Widowhood is a fringe benefit of marriage&quot;, &quot;A hospital is no place to be sick&quot;) can be traced back to the days when, as a wealthy young divorcee in the early 1930s, she became a caption writer at &quot;Vogue&quot; and then, associate editor and managing editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. She not only edited the works of such humorists as P. G. Wodehouse and Corey Ford but also contributed many comic pieces of her own, signed and unsigned.
Another branch of Luce&#x27;s literary career was that of war journalism. &quot;Europe in the Spring&quot; was the result of a four-month tour of Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and France in 1939–1940 as a correspondent for &quot;Life&quot; magazine. She described the widening battleground of World War II as &quot;a world where men have decided to die together because they are unable to find a way to live together.&quot;

In 1941, Luce and her husband toured China and reported on the status of the country and its war with Japan. Her profile of General Douglas MacArthur was on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; on December 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. After the United States entered the war, Luce toured military installations in Africa, India, China, and Burma, compiling a further series of reports for &quot;Life&quot;. She published interviews with General Harold Alexander, commander of British troops in the Middle East, Chiang Kai-shek, Jawaharlal Nehru, and General Stilwell, commander of American troops in the China-Burma-India theater.

Being in the right place at the right time and easy access to key commanders made her an influential figure on both sides of the Atlantic. She endured bombing raids and other dangers in Europe and the Far East. She did not hesitate to criticize the unwarlike lifestyle of General Sir Claude Auchinleck&#x27;s Middle East Command. One draft article for &quot;Life&quot;, noting that the general lived far from the Egyptian front in a houseboat, and mocking RAF pilots as &quot;flying fairies&quot;, was discovered by British Customs when she passed through Trinidad in April 1942. It caused such Allied consternation that she briefly faced house arrest. Coincidentally or not, Auchinleck was fired a few months later by Winston Churchill. Her varied experiences in all the major war theaters qualified her for a seat the following year on the House Military Affairs Committee after she was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1942.

Luce never wrote an autobiography but willed her enormous archive of personal papers to the Library of Congress.

==Political career==

===House of Representatives===

In 1942, Luce won a seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican comprising the whole of Fairfield County, Connecticut, the 4th Congressional District. She based her platform on three goals: &quot;One, to win the war. Two, to prosecute that war as loyally and effectively as we can as Republicans. Three, to bring about a better world and a durable peace, with special attention to post-war security and employment here at home.&quot; She took up the seat formerly held by her late stepfather, Dr. Albert Austin. An outspoken critic of Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, Luce was supported by isolationists and conservatives in Congress, and she was appointed early to the prestigious House Military Affairs Committee. Although she was by no means the only female representative on the floor, her beauty, wealth, and penchant for slashing witticisms caused her to be treated patronizingly by colleagues of both sexes. She made a debut in her maiden speech, coining the phrase &quot;globaloney&quot; to disparage Vice President Henry Wallace&#x27;s recommendation for airlines of the world to be given free access to US airports. She called for repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, comparing its &quot;doctrine of race theology&quot; to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s, advocated aid for war victims abroad, and sided with the administration on issues such as infant-care and maternity appropriations for the wives of enlisted men. Nevertheless, Roosevelt took a dislike to her and campaigned in 1944 to attempt to prevent her re-election, publicly calling her &quot;a sharp-tongued glamor girl of forty.&quot; She retaliated by accusing Roosevelt of being &quot;the only American president who ever lied us into a war because he did not have the political courage to lead us into it.&quot;

During her second term, Luce was instrumental in the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission and, during the course of two tours of Allied battlefronts in Europe, she campaigned for more support of what she considered to be America&#x27;s forgotten army in Italy. She was present at the liberation of several Nazi concentration camps in April 1945, and after V-E Day, she began warning against the rise of international Communism as another form of totalitarianism, likely to lead to World War III.

In 1946, she was the co-author of the Luce–Celler Act of 1946, which permitted Indians and Filipinos to immigrate to the US, introducing a quota of 100 immigrants from each country, and allowed them ultimately to become naturalized citizens.

Luce did not run for re-election in 1946.

===Endorsements in the 1952 presidential election===
Luce returned to politics during the 1952 presidential election.

Boothe led a group of women delegates to the 1952 Republican National Convention who sought to nominate Margaret Chase Smith in the balloting for vice presidential nominee. Mrs. Smith, however, requested not to be proposed at the convention as a vice presidential delegate. Noting that presidential nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s supporters had coalesced around Richard Nixon for vice president, Luce withdrew her nomination of Smith for the convention&#x27;s vice presidential balloting.

During the general election, Boothe campaigned on behalf of the Eisenhower–Nixon ticket, giving more than 100 speeches on its behalf. Her anti-Communist speeches on the stump, radio, and television were effective in persuading a large number of traditionally Democratic-voting Catholics to switch parties and vote Eisenhower.

===Ambassador to Italy===

Eisenhower rewarded Luce for her contributions to his presidential campaign by appointing her as ambassador to Italy, a post that oversaw 1150 employees, 8 consulates, and 9 information centers. She was confirmed by the Senate in March 1953, the first American woman ever to hold such an important diplomatic post.

Italians reacted skeptically at first to the arrival of a female ambassador in Rome, but Luce soon convinced those of moderate and conservative temper that she favored their civilization and religion. &quot;Her admirers in Italy – and she had millions – fondly referred to her as la Signora, &#x27;the lady&#x27;.&quot; The country&#x27;s large Communist minority, however, regarded her as a foreign meddler in Italian affairs. Luce was pictured with Monsignor William A. Hemmick, the first American canon of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, in the biography of Hemmick, &quot;Patriot Priest&quot;.

She was no stranger to Pope Pius XII, who welcomed her as a friend and faithful acolyte. Over the course of several audiences since 1940, Luce had impressed Pius XII as one of the most effective secular preachers of Catholicism in America.

Her principal achievement as ambassador was to play a vital role in negotiating a peaceful solution to the Trieste Crisis of 1953–1954, a border dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia that she saw as potentially escalating into a war between East and West. Her sympathies throughout were with the Christian Democratic government of Giuseppe Pella, and she was influential on the Mediterranean policy of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, another anticommunist. Although Luce regarded the abatement of the acute phase of the crisis in December 1953 as a triumph for herself, the main work of settlement, finalized in October 1954, was undertaken by professional representatives of the five concerned powers (Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Yugoslavia) meeting in London.

As ambassador, Luce consistently overestimated the possibility that the Italian left would mount a governmental coup and turn the country communist unless the democratic center was buttressed with generous American aid. A United States Defense Department historical study declassified in 2016 revealed that during her time as ambassador, Luce oversaw a covert financial support program for centrist Italian governments aimed at weakening the Italian Communist Party&#x27;s hold on labor unions.

Nurturing an image of her own country as a haven of social peace and prosperity, she threatened to boycott the 1955 Venice Film Festival if the American juvenile delinquent film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; was shown. Around the same time, she fell seriously ill with arsenic poisoning. Sensational rumors circulated that the ambassador was the target of extermination by agents of the Soviet Union. Medical analysis eventually determined that the poisoning was caused by arsenate of lead in paint dust falling from the stucco that decorated her bedroom ceiling. The episode debilitated Luce physically and mentally, and she resigned her post in December 1956. Upon her departure, Rome&#x27;s &quot;Il Tempo&quot; concluded &quot;She has given a notable example of how well a woman can discharge a political post of grave responsibility.&quot;

In 1957, she was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.

A great appreciator of Italian haute couture, she was a frequent visitor and client of the ateliers Gattinoni, Ferdinandi, Schuberth, and Sorelle Fontana in Rome.

===Ambassador to Brazil nomination===

In April 1959, President Eisenhower nominated a recovered Luce to be the US Ambassador to Brazil. She began to learn enough of the Portuguese language in preparation for the job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband urged her to decline the appointment, noting that it would be difficult for her to work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers. Thus, as she had never left American soil, she never officially took office as ambassador.

===Political life after office===

After Fidel Castro led a revolution in Cuba in 1959, Luce and her husband began to sponsor anticommunist groups. This support included funding Cuban exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba in the early 1960s. Luce&#x27;s continuing anticommunism as well as her advocacy of conservatism led her to support Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona as the Republican candidate for president in 1964. She also considered but rejected a candidacy for the United States Senate from New York on the Conservative party ticket. That same year, which also saw the political emergence of future friend Ronald Reagan, marked the voluntary end of Henry Luce&#x27;s tenure as editor-in-chief of &quot;Time&quot;. The Luces retired together, establishing a winter home in Arizona and planning a final move to Hawaii. Her husband, Henry, died in 1967 before that dream could be realized, but she went ahead with construction of a luxurious beach house in Honolulu, and, for some years, she led an active life in Hawaii high society.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon named her to the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). She remained on the board until President Jimmy Carter succeeded President Gerald Ford in 1977. By then, she had put down roots in Washington, D.C., that would become permanent in her last years. In 1979, she was the first woman to be awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point.

President Reagan reappointed Luce to PFIAB. She served on the board until 1983.

In 1986, Luce was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom===
President Reagan awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983. She was the first female member of Congress to receive this award.

Upon presenting her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Reagan said this of Luce:
==Death==
Luce died of brain cancer on October 9, 1987, at age 84, at her Watergate apartment in Washington, D.C. She is buried at Mepkin Abbey, South Carolina, a plantation that she and Henry Luce had once owned and given to a community of Trappist monks. She lies in a grave adjoining her mother, daughter, and husband.

==Legacy==

===Feminism===

Revered in her later years as a heroine of the feminist movement, Luce had mixed feelings about the role of women in society. As a congresswoman in 1943, she was invited to co-sponsor a submission of the Equal Rights Amendment, offered by Representative Louis Ludlow of Indiana, but claimed that the invitation got lost in her mail. Luce never ceased to advise women to marry and provide supportive homes for their husbands. (During her ambassadorial years, at a dinner in Luxembourg attended by many European dignitaries, Luce was heard declaiming that all women wanted from men was &quot;babies and security&quot;.) Yet, her own professional career as a successful editor, writer, playwright, reporter, legislator, and diplomat showed how a woman of humble origins and no college education could raise herself to an escalating series of public heights. Luce bequeathed a large part of her personal fortune of some $50 million to an academic program, the Clare Boothe Luce Program, designed to encourage the entry of women into technological fields traditionally dominated by men. Because of her determination and unwillingness to let her gender stand in the way of her personal and professional achievements, Luce is considered to be an influential role model by many women. Starting from humble beginnings, Luce never allowed her initial poverty or her male counterparts&#x27; lack of respect to keep her from achieving as much as if not more than many of the men surrounding her. In 2017, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

===Clare Boothe Luce Program===

Since 1989, the Clare Boothe Luce Program (CBLP) has become a significant source of private funding support for women in science, mathematics, and engineering. All awards must be used exclusively in the United States (not applicable for travel or study abroad). Student recipients must be U.S. citizens and faculty recipients must be citizens or permanent residents. Thus far, the program has supported more than 1,500 women.

The terms of the bequest require the following criteria:
# at least fifty percent of the awards go to Roman Catholic colleges, universities, and one high school (Villanova Preparatory School)
# grants are made only to four-year degree-granting institutions, not directly to individuals

The program is divided into three distinct categories:
# undergraduate scholarships and research awards
# graduate and post-doctoral fellowships
# tenure-track appointment support at the assistant or associate professorship level

===Conservatism===

The Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute (CBLPI) was founded in 1993 by Michelle Easton. The non-profit think tank seeks to advance American women through conservative ideas and espouses much the same philosophy as that of Clare Boothe Luce, in terms of both foreign and domestic policy. The CBLPI sponsors a program that brings conservative speakers such as conservative commentator Ann Coulter to college campuses.

The Clare Boothe Luce Award, established in 1991, is The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s highest award for distinguished contributions to the conservative movement. Prominent recipients include Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and William F. Buckley Jr.

<text>Henry Robinson Luce (April 3, 1898 – February 28, 1967) was an American magazine magnate who founded &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazines. He has been called &quot;the most influential private citizen in the America of his day&quot;.

Born in Shandong, China, to parents from the United States who were serving as Presbyterian missionaries, Luce moved to the US at the age of 15 and later attended Yale University. He launched and closely supervised a stable of magazines that transformed journalism and the reading habits of millions of Americans. &quot;Time&quot; summarized and interpreted the week&#x27;s news; &quot;Life&quot; was a picture magazine of politics, culture, and society that dominated American visual perceptions in the era before television; &quot;Fortune&quot; reported on national and international business; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; explored the world of sports. 

Counting his radio projects and newsreels, Luce created the first multimedia corporation. He envisaged that the United States would achieve world hegemony, and in 1941 he declared the 20th century would be the &quot;American Century&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Luce was born in Tengchow, Shandong, China, now Penglai, on April 3, 1898, the son of Elizabeth Root Luce and Henry Winters Luce, who was a Presbyterian missionary.

At 15, he was sent to the U.S. to attend the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, where he tried hard to overcome his stuttering. As a scholarship student he was isolated from the upper-class boys. He was subsidized by an elderly Chicago heiress, Nancy Fowler McCormick, who favored sons of missionaries. Applying himself to study, Luce quickly became the top student. He was especially strong in languages, studying Greek, Latin, French, and German, and already knowing Chinese. He edited the &quot;Hotchkiss Literary Monthly&quot;. There, he first met Briton Hadden; they became best friends.

Hotchkiss was a feeder prep school for Yale University. After a summer spent working on a Springfield newspaper, Luce matriculated in the fall of 1916. He was the top freshman academically, but grades did not confer as much prestige as a staff role on the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. Only four freshmen were chosen by the &quot;News&quot;; they included Luce and Hadden. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, a third of the students joined the army; the rest, including Luce, joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) and attended class in uniform. 

Luce also joined Alpha Delta, a minor fraternity. His grades remained top-level, and every spare hour was devoted to newspaper work. Luce and Hadden were the two outstanding journalists; when the vote came in January 1918 for chairmanship of the &quot;News,&quot; Hadden beat Luce by one vote. Luce instead became managing editor and the two worked closely together and started planning their future. Meanwhile, the Army assigned them as ROTC leaders to train new recruits. The war ended before either was commissioned. 

In January 1919, Luce and Hadden returned to Yale University as juniors. In May 1919, they were both tapped into the prestigious Skull and Bones secret society. Luce tried, but failed, to win a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, but he was admitted to the university and paid his way. He spent the year travelling Europe, observing the post-World War I scene closely. He returned to the United States to take a newspaper job in Chicago as a junior reporter.

==Career==
Nightly discussions of the concept of a news magazine led Luce and Hadden, both age 23, to quit their jobs in 1922. Later that same year, they partnered with Robert Livingston Johnson and another Yale classmate to form Time Inc.

Luce, supported by editor-in-chief T. S. Matthews, appointed Whittaker Chambers as acting Foreign News editor in 1944, despite the feuds that Chambers had with reporters in the field.

Luce, who remained editor-in-chief of all his publications until 1964, maintained a position as an influential member of the Republican Party. An instrumental figure behind the so-called &quot;China Lobby&quot;, he played a large role in steering American foreign policy and popular sentiment in favor of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, in their war against the Japanese. (The Chiangs appeared in the cover of &quot;Time&quot; eleven times between 1927 and 1955.)

Luce authored an editorial for &quot;Life&quot; in 1941, titled &quot;The American Century&quot;, in which he defined the role of U.S. foreign policy for the remainder of the 20th century.

==Personal life==

Luce met his first wife, Lila Hotz, while he was studying at Yale University in 1919. They married in 1923 and had two children, Peter Paul and Henry Luce III, before divorcing in 1935. 

In 1935, he married his second wife, Clare Boothe Luce, who had an 11-year-old daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw, whom he raised as his own. 

Luce died of a coronary occlusion on February 28, 1967 in Phoenix, Arizona. He was 68. At his death, he was said to be worth $100 million in Time Inc. stock. Most of his fortune went to the Henry Luce Foundation.

==Legacy==
He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 32¢ Great Americans series (1980–2000) postage stamp. Luce was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame.

== Henry Luce Foundation ==
The Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. is a private, nonprofit organization incorporated in New York. It was established in 1936 by Henry Luce in his thirties. His son Henry III served as its chairman and chief executive for many years.

<text>The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) is a computer graphics library for OpenGL.

It consists of a number of functions that use the base OpenGL library to provide higher-level drawing routines from the more primitive routines that OpenGL provides. It is usually distributed with the base OpenGL package. GLU is not implemented in the embedded version of the OpenGL package, OpenGL ES.

Among these features are mapping between screen- and world-coordinates, generation of texture mipmaps, drawing of quadric surfaces, NURBS, tessellation of polygonal primitives, interpretation of OpenGL error codes, an extended range of transformation routines for setting up viewing volumes and simple positioning of the camera, generally in more human-friendly terms than the routines presented by OpenGL. It also provides additional primitives for use in OpenGL applications, including spheres, cylinders and disks.

All GLU functions start with the codice_1 prefix. An example function is codice_2 which defines a two dimensional orthographic projection matrix.

The GLU specification was last updated in 1998, and it depends on features which were deprecated with the release of OpenGL 3.1 in 2009. Specifications for GLU are still available here
