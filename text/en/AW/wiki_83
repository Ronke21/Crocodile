<text>Hawking radiation is black body radiation released outside a black hole&#x27;s event horizon due to quantum effects according to a model developed by Stephen Hawking in 1974. 
The radiation was not predicted by previous models which assumed that once electromagnetic radiation is inside the event horizon, it cannot escape. Hawking radiation is predicted to be extremely faint and is many orders of magnitude below the current best telescopes&#x27; detecting ability.

Hawking radiation would reduce the mass and rotational energy of black holes and consequently cause black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that do not gain mass through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. For all except the smallest black holes, this happens extremely slowly. The radiation temperature, called Hawking temperature, is inversely proportional to the black hole&#x27;s mass, so micro black holes are predicted to be larger emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should dissipate faster per their mass. Consequently, if small black holes exist, as permitted by the hypothesis of primordial black holes, they ought to lose mass more rapidly as they shrink, leading to a final cataclysm of high energy radiation alone. Such radiation bursts have not yet been detected.

== Background ==

Modern black holes were first predicted by Einstein&#x27;s 1915 theory of general relativity. Evidence of the astrophysical objects termed black holes began to mount half a century later, and these objects are of current interest primarily because of their compact size and immense gravitational attraction. Early research into black holes was done by individuals such as Karl Schwarzschild and John Wheeler, who modeled black holes as having zero entropy.

A black hole can form when enough matter or energy is compressed into a volume small enough that the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. Because nothing can travel that fast, nothing within a certain distance, proportional to the mass of the black hole, can escape beyond that distance. The region beyond which not even light can escape is the event horizon: an observer outside it cannot observe, become aware of, or be affected by events within the event horizon.
Alternatively, using a set of infalling coordinates in general relativity, one can conceptualize the event horizon as the region beyond which space is infalling faster than the speed of light. (Although nothing can travel &quot;through&quot; space faster than light, space itself can infall at any speed.) Once matter is inside the event horizon, all of the matter inside falls inevitably into a gravitational singularity, a place of infinite curvature and zero size, leaving behind a warped spacetime devoid of any matter; a classical black hole is pure empty spacetime, and the simplest (nonrotating and uncharged) is characterized just by its mass and event horizon.

== Discovery==

In 1971 Soviet scientists Yakov Zeldovich and Alexei Starobinsky proposed that rotating black holes ought to create and emit particles, reasoning by analogy with electromagnetic spinning metal spheres. In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein developed a theory and reported that the black holes should have an entropy proportional to their surface area. Initially Stephen Hawking argued against Bekenstein&#x27;s theory, viewing black holes as a simple object with no entropy.
After meeting Zeldovich in Moscow in 1973, Hawking put these two ideas together using his mixture of quantum field theory and general relativity.
In his 1974 paper Hawking showed that in theory, black holes radiate particles as if it were a blackbody. Particles escaping effectively drain energy from the black hole. 
Due to Bekenstein&#x27;s contribution to black hole entropy, it is also known as Bekenstein–Hawking radiation.

Hawking radiation derives from vacuum fluctuations. A quantum fluctuation in the electromagnetic field can result in a photon outside of the black hole horizon paired with one on the inside. The horizon allows one to escape in each direction.

==Emission process==
Hawking radiation is dependent on the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black-hole horizons. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of particles that pop out of the local acceleration horizon, turn around, and free-fall back in. The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies that some of these particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing Hawking radiation.

A Schwarzschild black hole has a metric
: formula_1

The black hole is the background spacetime for a quantum field theory.

The field theory is defined by a local path integral, so if the boundary conditions at the horizon are determined, the state of the field outside will be specified. To find the appropriate boundary conditions, consider a stationary observer just outside the horizon at position
: formula_2

The local metric to lowest order is
: formula_3
which is Rindler in terms of . The metric describes a frame that is accelerating to keep from falling into the black hole. The local acceleration, , diverges as .

The horizon is not a special boundary, and objects can fall in. So the local observer should feel accelerated in ordinary Minkowski space by the principle of equivalence. The near-horizon observer must see the field excited at a local temperature
: formula_4
which is the Unruh effect.

The gravitational redshift is given by the square root of the time component of the metric. So for the field theory state to consistently extend, there must be a thermal background everywhere with the local temperature redshift-matched to the near horizon temperature:

: formula_5

The inverse temperature redshifted to at infinity is

: formula_6

and is the near-horizon position, near , so this is really

: formula_7

Thus a field theory defined on a black-hole background is in a thermal state whose temperature at infinity is

: formula_8

From the black-hole temperature, it is straightforward to calculate the black-hole entropy . The change in entropy when a quantity of heat is added is

: formula_9

The heat energy that enters serves to increase the total mass, so

: formula_10

So the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area:

: formula_11

where, since the radius of the black hole is twice its mass, we have that the area A is given by 

: formula_12

Assuming that a small black hole has zero entropy, the integration constant is zero. Forming a black hole is the most efficient way to compress mass into a region, and this entropy is also a bound on the information content of any sphere in space time. The form of the result strongly suggests that the physical description of a gravitating theory can be somehow encoded onto a bounding surface.

==Black hole evaporation==

When particles escape, the black hole loses a small amount of its energy and therefore some of its mass (mass and energy are related by Einstein&#x27;s equation ). Consequently, an evaporating black hole will have a finite lifespan. By dimensional analysis, the life span of a black hole can be shown to scale as the cube of its initial mass, and Hawking estimated that any black hole formed in the early universe with a mass of less than approximately 1012 kg would have evaporated completely by the present day.

In 1976, Don Page refined this estimate by calculating the power produced, and the time to evaporation, for a non-rotating, non-charged Schwarzschild black hole of mass . The time for the event horizon or entropy of a black hole to halve is known as the Page time. The calculations are complicated by the fact that a black hole, being of finite size, is not a perfect black body; the absorption cross section goes down in a complicated, spin-dependent manner as frequency decreases, especially when the wavelength becomes comparable to the size of the event horizon. Page concluded that primordial black holes could survive to the present day only if their initial mass were roughly or larger. Writing in 1976, Page using the understanding of neutrinos at the time erroneously worked on the assumption that neutrinos have no mass and that only two neutrino flavors exist, and therefore his results of black hole lifetimes do not match the modern results which take into account 3 flavors of neutrinos with nonzero masses. A 2008 calculation using the particle content of the Standard Model and the WMAP figure for the age of the universe yielded a mass bound of .

Some pre-1998 calculations, using outdated assumptions about neutrinos, were as follows: If black holes evaporate under Hawking radiation, a solar mass black hole will evaporate over 1064 years which is vastly longer than the age of the universe. A supermassive black hole with a mass of 1011 (100 billion) will evaporate in around . Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps 1014 during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 2 × 10106 years. Post-1998 science modifies these results slightly; for example, the modern estimate of a solar-mass black hole lifetime is 1067 years.

The power emitted by a black hole in the form of Hawking radiation can be estimated for the simplest case of a nonrotating, non-charged Schwarzschild black hole of mass . Combining the formulas for the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole, the Stefan–Boltzmann law of blackbody radiation, the above formula for the temperature of the radiation, and the formula for the surface area of a sphere (the black hole&#x27;s event horizon), several equations can be derived.

The Hawking radiation temperature is:

:formula_13

The Bekenstein–Hawking luminosity of a black hole, under the assumption of pure photon emission (i.e. that no other particles are emitted) and under the assumption that the horizon is the radiating surface is:

:formula_14

where is the luminosity, i.e., the radiated power, is the reduced Planck constant, is the speed of light, is the gravitational constant and is the mass of the black hole. It is worth mentioning that the above formula has not yet been derived in the framework of semiclassical gravity.

The time that the black hole takes to dissipate is:

:formula_15

where and are the mass and (Schwarzschild) volume of the black hole, and are Planck mass and Planck time. A black hole of one solar mass ( = ) takes more than to evaporate—much longer than the current age of the universe at . But for a black hole of , the evaporation time is . This is why some astronomers are searching for signs of exploding primordial black holes.

However, since the universe contains the cosmic microwave background radiation, in order for the black hole to dissipate, the black hole must have a temperature greater than that of the present-day blackbody radiation of the universe of 2.7 K. A study suggests that must be less than 0.8% of the mass of the Earth – approximately the mass of the Moon.

Black hole evaporation has several significant consequences:
* Black hole evaporation produces a more consistent view of black hole thermodynamics by showing how black holes interact thermally with the rest of the universe.
* Unlike most objects, a black hole&#x27;s temperature increases as it radiates away mass. The rate of temperature increase is exponential, with the most likely endpoint being the dissolution of the black hole in a violent burst of gamma rays. A complete description of this dissolution requires a model of quantum gravity, however, as it occurs when the black hole&#x27;s mass approaches 1 Planck mass, its radius will also approach two Planck lengths.
* The simplest models of black hole evaporation lead to the black hole information paradox. The information content of a black hole appears to be lost when it dissipates, as under these models the Hawking radiation is random (it has no relation to the original information). A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed, including suggestions that Hawking radiation is perturbed to contain the missing information, that the Hawking evaporation leaves some form of remnant particle containing the missing information, and that information is allowed to be lost under these conditions.

== Problems and extensions ==
=== Trans-Planckian problem ===

The trans-Planckian problem is the issue that Hawking&#x27;s original calculation includes quantum particles where the wavelength becomes shorter than the Planck length near the black hole&#x27;s horizon. This is due to the peculiar behavior there, where time stops as measured from far away. A particle emitted from a black hole with a frequency, if traced back to the horizon, must have had an infinite frequency, and therefore a trans-Planckian wavelength.

The Unruh effect and the Hawking effect both talk about field modes in the superficially stationary spacetime that change frequency relative to other coordinates that are regular across the horizon. This is necessarily so, since to stay outside a horizon requires acceleration that constantly Doppler shifts the modes.

An outgoing photon of Hawking radiation, if the mode is traced back in time, has a frequency that diverges from that which it has at great distance, as it gets closer to the horizon, which requires the wavelength of the photon to &quot;scrunch up&quot; infinitely at the horizon of the black hole. In a maximally extended external Schwarzschild solution, that photon&#x27;s frequency stays regular only if the mode is extended back into the past region where no observer can go, so Hawking used a different black hole solution without a past region, one that forms at a finite time in the past. In that case, the source of all the outgoing photons can be identified: a microscopic point right at the moment that the black hole first formed.

The quantum fluctuations at that tiny point, in Hawking&#x27;s original calculation, contain all the outgoing radiation. The modes that eventually contain the outgoing radiation at long times are redshifted by such a huge amount by their long sojourn next to the event horizon that they start off as modes with a wavelength much shorter than the Planck length. Since the laws of physics at such short distances are unknown, some find Hawking&#x27;s original calculation unconvincing.

The trans-Planckian problem is nowadays mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a white hole solution. Matter that falls on the white hole accumulates on it, but has no future region into which it can go. Tracing the future of this matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the white hole evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes that end at the horizon from the point of view of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon.

There exist alternative physical pictures that give the Hawking radiation in which the trans-Planckian problem is addressed. The key point is that similar trans-Planckian problems occur when the modes occupied with Unruh radiation are traced back in time. In the Unruh effect, the magnitude of the temperature can be calculated from ordinary Minkowski field theory, and is not controversial.

===Large extra dimensions===
The formulas from the previous section are applicable only if the laws of gravity are approximately valid all the way down to the Planck scale. In particular, for black holes with masses below the Planck mass (~), they result in impossible lifetimes below the Planck time (~). This is normally seen as an indication that the Planck mass is the lower limit on the mass of a black hole.

In a model with large extra dimensions (10 or 11), the values of Planck constants can be radically different, and the formulas for Hawking radiation have to be modified as well. In particular, the lifetime of a micro black hole with a radius below the scale of the extra dimensions is given by equation 9 in Cheung (2002) and equations 25 and 26 in Carr (2005).

: formula_16

where is the low-energy scale, which could be as low as a few TeV, and is the number of large extra dimensions. This formula is now consistent with black holes as light as a few TeV, with lifetimes on the order of the &quot;new Planck time&quot; ~.

===In loop quantum gravity===
A detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole event horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity. Loop-quantization does not reproduce the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, unless the value of a free parameter is set to cancel out various constants such that the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula is reproduced. However, quantum gravitational corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes have been computed based on the theory.

Based on the fluctuations of the horizon area, a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the Hawking radiation spectrum that would be observable were X-rays from Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed. The quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of the Hawking spectrum.

==Experimental observation==

===Astronomical search===

In June 2008, NASA launched the Fermi space telescope, which is searching for the terminal gamma-ray flashes expected from evaporating primordial black holes. As of Jan 1st, 2024, none have been detected.

===Heavy-ion collider physics===

If speculative large extra dimension theories are correct, then CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider may be able to create micro black holes and observe their evaporation. No such micro black hole has been observed at CERN.

===Experimental===
Under experimentally achievable conditions for gravitational systems, this effect is too small to be observed directly. It was predicted that Hawking radiation could be studied by analogy using sonic black holes, in which sound perturbations are analogous to light in a gravitational black hole and the flow of an approximately perfect fluid is analogous to gravity (see &quot;Analog models of gravity&quot;). Observations of Hawking radiation were reported, in sonic black holes employing Bose–Einstein condensates.

In September 2010 an experimental set-up created a laboratory &quot;white hole event horizon&quot; that the experimenters claimed was shown to radiate an optical analog to Hawking radiation. However, the results remain unverified and debatable, and its status as a genuine confirmation remains in doubt.

<text>[[Salvador Sánchez]] vs. [[Wilfredo Gómez]], billed as The Battle of the Little Giants, was a professional boxing match contested on August 21, 1981, for the WBC featherweight championship.

==Background==
Contested at the Caesars Palace hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, it pitted Wilfredo Gómez, a Puerto Rican who had a record of 32 wins, 0 losses, 1 draw, and all his wins by knockout, and who was the world&#x27;s Jr. Featherweight champion, against the lesser known Salvador Sánchez, who hailed from Mexico with a record of 40 wins, 1 loss, 1 draw, and 30 wins by knockout. Salvador Sanchez was defending his WBC world Featherweight crown.

Gómez was the strong favorite at the betting windows due to his knockout win streak of 32 fights in a row and Sánchez&#x27;s relative obscurity. During the build-up to the fight, Gomez talked often of his intention to score an early knockout over Sanchez and the betting public seemed to be in agreement.

==The fight==
Sánchez began by surprising most fans and dropping Gómez 40 seconds into round one. Gómez got up but was battered around the ring by Sanchez for the remainder of the round, nearly going down again from an overhand right in Wilfredo&#x27;s own corner. Gomez began to recover in round three and had his moments over the next three rounds, continually going forward and throwing combinations in an effort to turn the fight. However, Gómez&#x27;s right eye started to swell by the third round and was nearly closed by the seventh. Sánchez started zeroing into that area and landed a number of hard punches that repeatedly rocked Gomez. In the seventh round, Gomez finally landed the combination he wanted, a right-left to the chin that partially lifted Sanchez off his feet; however, he was able to shake off the effects and move away from the corner without further trouble.

Round eight proved to be the final round. With Gómez almost blinded by his swollen eyes and the Mexican partisans shouting &quot;Ole!&quot; with every volley of punches, Sánchez landed a straight right hand that had Gomez teetering and badly hurt on the ropes, followed by a series of punches that almost sent Gómez off the ring. Although Gómez was able to beat the count, referee Carlos Padilla stepped in and stopped the fight, giving Sánchez an eighth-round technical knockout (TKO) win.

==Aftermath==
In Mexico, a new legend was born. Sánchez had, in their eyes, avenged the loss that Gómez had inflicted to Carlos Zarate some years before. He became recognized by many Mexicans and international fans as Mexico&#x27;s greatest world champion ever, but that moment of glory was short lived, because almost a year after his fight with Gómez, on August 12, 1982, Sánchez was killed in a car accident. Soon, Julio César Chávez would replace him in the hearts of many Mexican boxing fans as their greatest fighter ever.

In Puerto Rico, it was a moment to mourn for most boxing fans. Many businesses and stores were closed the day after, as Gómez was a national hero to most Puerto Ricans, and he was seen by many as invincible. It took, in the eyes of Puerto Rican boxing fans, 18 years to really avenge Gómez&#x27;s defeat against Sánchez, and that was when Félix Trinidad beat Oscar De La Hoya in 1999. Gómez went into a depression, but he roared back the next year and posted world title wins against many other boxers from there on until he retired in 1989. Among the fighters he would beat later were Lupe Pintor (who also is Mexican) at the Carnival of Champions, and Juan Laporte. Gómez joined the exclusive group of fighters to win titles in three different boxing divisions.

It could be said that Sánchez, in between the moment he beat Gómez and the moment he died almost a year later, warmed himself to the hearts of many Puerto Ricans. He granted interviews to many Puerto Rican television news shows, and was known for speaking well about Puerto Rico and its people. When Sánchez died, news of his death were heard across Latin America, and many people both in Mexico and Puerto Rico were saddened by his passing. His funeral was shown live in Mexico, and in Puerto Rico, a tribute show to him was aired by WAPA-TV five days after his death, featuring his past interviews with that network&#x27;s sportscasters, his story, and clips of his fights.

Gómez himself also became a dear person to the people of Mexico after this fight. Although they knew him as the &quot;Mexican beater&quot; because of the many other fights he won against Mexican boxers, Gómez showed no ill feelings towards the people of Mexico by offering Sánchez flowers after Sánchez died, and becoming a frequent visitor to the Sánchez family thereafter. On Sánchez&#x27;s small town, there is always a festival to commemorate Sánchez&#x27;s memory every year, around the week of August 12. Gómez has been named &quot;Grand Marischal&quot; of that festival three times already, and has been a guest of honor many of the times it has been celebrated after Sánchez&#x27;s passing.

There had always been talks of a rematch between the two before Sánchez died. What would have happened in a rematch will never be known, but the fact is that both Gómez and Sánchez are now together in a place far different from a boxing ring: They are both in the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

==Undercard==

==Broadcasting==
The fight was broadcast on closed-circuit television to all of the United States and through many Latin American countries.

<doc id="173728" wikidata="Q356351" url="?curid=173728" title="Gianni Agnelli">
<text>Giovanni &quot;Gianni&quot; Agnelli (; 12 March 192124 January 2003), nicknamed (&quot;The Lawyer&quot;), was an Italian industrialist and principal shareholder of Fiat. As the head of Fiat, he controlled 4.4% of Italy&#x27;s GDP, 3.1% of its industrial workforce, and 16.5% of its industrial investment in research. He was the richest man in modern Italian history.

Agnelli was regarded as having an impeccable and slightly eccentric fashion sense, which has influenced both Italian and international men&#x27;s fashion. Agnelli was awarded the decoration Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1967 and the Order of Merit for Labour (&quot;Cavaliere del lavoro&quot;) in 1977. Following his death in 2003, control of the firm was gradually passed to his grandson and chosen heir, John Elkann.
== Early life ==
Agnelli was born in Turin; he maintained strong ties with the village of Villar Perosa, near Turin in the Piedmont region, of which he served as mayor until 1980. His father was the prominent Italian industrialist Edoardo Agnelli. His maternal grandmother was American; his mother was Princess Virginia Bourbon del Monte, daughter of Carlo, 4th Prince of San Faustino, head of a noble family established in Perugia, who was married with the American heiress Jane Allen Campbell. Agnelli was named after his grandfather Giovanni Agnelli, the founder of the Italian car manufacturer Fiat. At the age of 14, his father was killed in a plane crash, and he was raised by his grandfather, who died on 16 December 1945, fifteen days after Agnelli&#x27;s mother, Virginia, died in a car crash.

Known as Gianni to differentiate from his grandfather, with whom he shared his first name, he inherited the command of Fiat and the Agnelli family assets in general in 1966, following a period in which Fiat was temporarily ruled by Vittorio Valletta while he was learning how his family&#x27;s company worked. Agnelli raised Fiat to become the most important company in Italy, and one of the major car-builders of Europe, amid the Italian economic miracle. He was considered the king of Italian business from the 1960s to the 1980s. He also developed an accessory business, with minor companies, such as Fiat Velivoli, operating in the military industry.
Agnelli was educated at Pinerolo Cavalry Academy, and studied law at the University of Turin, although he never practised law. He joined a tank regiment in June 1940 when Italy entered World War II on the side of the Axis powers. He fought on the Eastern Front, being wounded twice. He also served in a Fiat-built armoured-car division during the North African campaign, for which he received the War Cross of Military Valor. After the armistice of Cassibile, Agnelli became a liaison officer with the occupying American troops due to his fluency in English. His grandfather, who had manufactured vehicles for the Axis powers during the war, was forced to retire from Fiat but named Valletta to be his successor. His grandfather died, leaving him head of the family but Valletta running the company. After the pre-war Topolino, Italy&#x27;s first inexpensive mass-produced car, Fiat in the mid-fiftees made a bestseller with the Fiat 600.

Prior to his marriage on 19 November 1953 to Marella Caracciolo dei Principi di Castagneto, a half-American, half-Neapolitan noblewoman who made a small but significant name as a fabric designer and a bigger name as a tastemaker, Agnelli was a noted playboy whose mistresses included actresses, such Anita Ekberg, Rita Hayworth, Linda Christian, Danielle Darrieux, the socialite Pamela Harriman, and Jackie Kennedy. Although Agnelli continued to be involved with other women during his marriage, including Ekberg and the fashion designer Jackie Rogers, the Agnellis remained married until his death of prostate cancer in 2003 at the age of 81.

For most of his life, Agnelli was considered to be a man of exquisite taste. In 2002, he left his paintings to the city of Turin, which established the Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli. His only son, Edoardo Agnelli, was born in New York City on 9 June 1954, seven months after the couple&#x27;s wedding at the Château d&#x27;Osthoffen in France. He gave up trying to groom him to take over Fiat, seeing how the boy was more interested in mysticism than making cars; his son studied religion at Princeton University and took part in a world day of prayer in Assisi. His son, who seemed burdened by the mantle of his surname, committed suicide on 15 November 2000 by jumping off a bridge near Turin; Agnelli joined police at the scene. The Agnellis had one daughter, Countess Margherita Agnelli de Pahlen. She is the mother of John Elkann, Lapo Elkann, and Ginevra Elkann. She has five other children from her second marriage to Count Serge de Pahlen: Maria de Pahlen, Peter de Pahlen, Anna de Pahlen, and Tatiana de Pahlen. Into the 2020s, the de Pahlens remain involved in a dispute with the Elkanns over Agnelli&#x27;s inheritance.

== Head of Fiat ==

Agnelli became president of Fiat in 1966. He opened factories in many places, including the Soviet Union in the Russian city of Tolyatti, Spain, and South America, such as Automóveis in Brasil; he also started international alliances and joint-ventures like Iveco, which marked a new industrial mentality. During the international energy crisis of the 1970s, he sold part of the company to Lafico, a Libyan company owned by Muammar Gaddafi; Agnelli would later repurchase these shares. He was also closely connected with Juventus, the most renowned Italian football club, of which he was a fan and the direct owner.

In 1969 and 1970, Fiat was joined by Ferrari and Lancia. In the 1970s, which were marked by labour tensions, Fiat expanded to the east and agreements with Poland, Turkey, and Yugoslavia were strengthened. In 1974, he was elected president of Confindustria and came to terms with the labour unions by signing the agreement for the single point of contingency with the CGIL by Luciano Lama. The 1980s saw increased sales for Fiat under Vittorio Ghidella, with successes such as the Fiat Uno, the Fiat Croma, and the Lancia Thema. In 1986, after a failed agreement with Ford Motor Company, Agnelli bought Alfa Romeo from the Italian state. In the 1990s, as Fiat was unable to make inroads into the non-European automotive markets, Agnelli decided to form an alliance with General Motors. The agreement provided for General Motors to sell 5% of their shares in exchange for 20% of the Fiat Group&#x27;s package, with the possibility after two years and within the next eight years to buy the remaining 80% of Fiat if it was sold.

In 1991, Agnelli was named an Italian senator for life and joined the independent parliamentary group; he was later named a member of the Senate of the Republic&#x27;s defence commission. In 1997, he briefly acquired &quot;de facto&quot; control of Telecom Italia. In the early 2000s, Agnelli made overtures to General Motors resulting in an agreement under which General Motors progressively became involved in Fiat. The crisis of Fiat came when Agnelli was already fighting against cancer, and he could take little part in these events. Agnelli also encountered a number of difficulties with Mediobanca through Cesare Romiti, who caused Agnelli anxiety. Mediobanca made a policy of constantly supervising Fiat because of their financial interests in the company, often becoming significantly involved in executive decisions and important issues. Vincenzo Maranghi, who later became the CEO of the bank, eventually developed a close friendship with Agnelli, despite previous tensions. At the time of his death in 2003, Fiat was worth €3.3 billion; Agnelli&#x27;s inheritance was twenty-five times bigger by 2023.

Nicknamed &quot;L&#x27;Avvocato&quot; (&quot;The Lawyer&quot;) because he had a degree in law even though he was never admitted to the Order of Lawyers, Agnelli was the most important figure in Italian economy, the symbol of capitalism throughout the second half of 20th century, and regarded by many as the true &quot;King of Italy&quot;. A cultivated man of keen intelligence and a peculiar sense of humour, he was perhaps the most famous Italian abroad, particularly in the United States and New York, forming deep relationships with international bankers and politicians, largely through the Bilderberg Group, whose conferences he attended regularly since 1958. Some of the other Bilderberg regulars became close friends, among them Henry Kissinger. He was also close to John F. Kennedy, and was a friend of Truman Capote. Another longtime associate was David Rockefeller, who appointed him to the International Advisory Committee of Chase Manhattan Bank, of which Rockefeller was chairman; Agnelli sat on this committee for thirty years. He was also a member of a syndicate with Rockefeller that for a time in the 1980s owned Rockefeller Center. He was also an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, a position he held until his death, and was named in 2000 the committee honorary president for Torino 2006, of which he was an instrumental promoter.

== Later life and death ==
Agnelli stepped down in 1996 but stayed on as Fiat&#x27;s honorary chairman until his death. Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, the son of Gianni&#x27;s younger brother, Umberto Agnelli, died of a rare form of cancer in 1997 at age 33 while he was being groomed by his uncle to head the Fiat Group. John Elkann, the son of Gianni and Marella&#x27;s daughter, Margherita, was expected to take over Fiat after Gianni&#x27;s death. Instead, Umberto became chairman, taking over from Paolo Fresco. While Fresco had diversified the Fiat Group&#x27;s holdings, Umberto refocused its activities on its auto and mechanics division. He then brought in Giuseppe Morchio to mastermind a rescue strategy for the company. Morchio was expected to continue to run the Fiat Group as it attempted to claw its way out of its latest financial crisis.

Upon Umberto&#x27;s death, Ferrari chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named Fiat chairman, with Elkann as vice chairman; Morchio immediately offered his resignation. His successor was Sergio Marchionne, an expert of reorganisation who between 2002 and 2004 led the Swiss certification company Societé Générale de Surveillance; Elkann played a key role when he brought Marchionne to Fiat. Agnelli died in 2003 of prostate cancer at age 81 in Turin. Fiat-owned Scuderia Ferrari named their 2003 Formula One contender, the F2003-GA, in tribute to Agnelli. Juventus and the Italian Football Federation were also in mourning over his death. In 2021, to celebrate the centenary of Agnelli&#x27;s birth, a special postage stamp was issued.

== Sports ==
=== Juventus F.C. ===
==== 1940s–1990s ====

The figure of Agnelli was intimately linked to the history of Juventus, the association football team of Turin of which he was appointed president from 1947 to 1954. His activity had an impact within the club similar to that of his father, Edoardo Agnelli, twenty years earlier, acquiring important players, such as Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen, and Karl Aage Præst, who were decisive for the conquest of two Serie A leagues in 1950 and 1952, the first won by the club in fifteen years. Agnelli also had an impact on the transformation at the corporate level during his management from a private club belonging to the rival car manufacturer Cisitalia, chaired by Piero Dusio, to an independent company with private capital with limited liability that achieved further successes.

After his activity as president of the club, Agnelli remained linked to Juventus by carrying out various management activities as honorary president, with which he was able to maintain his influence on the club until 1994, the year in which he handed over these activities to his brother Umberto. Agnelli led Juventus to ten Italian football champion titles, four Italy Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, one European Cup, one Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, three UEFA Cups, and one UEFA Super Cup, for a total of 23 official trophies in 48 years, which made him one of the most important personalities in sports history. He daily called at 6 am Boniperti, such as when he convinced him to become Juventus chairman in 1971, and Juventus players to see how they were doing.

Agnelli liked footballers like Stanley Matthews and Garrincha, as well as Pelé, Diego Armando Maradona, Johan Cruijff, and Alfredo Di Stéfano, whom his club tried to sign. In 1958, Agnelli sought to purchase Pelé through Fiat&#x27;s shares. In a dinner in 1962, Santos F.C. was offered one million for Pelé by Umberto. In 1962, he sent Boniperti to Chile to sign Pelé with an offer of one hundred million, which the Brazilian Football Federation did not authorise for the transfer. He was instrumental in signing Michel Platini, of whom he said: &quot;We bought him for a piece of bread and he&#x27;s put foie gras on top of it.&quot; He gave several notable nicknames to footballers, such Zbigniew Boniek (&quot;bello di notte&quot;, or &quot;Beauty at night&quot;, which is a play on the title of Luis Buñuel&#x27;s movie &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;), Roberto Baggio (&quot;Raffaello&quot;, after an Italian Renaissance painter, best known as Raphael), and Alessandro Del Piero (&quot;Pinturicchio&quot;, after the nickname of another Italian Renaissance painter, Bernardino di Betto), and Ahead of the 1996 UEFA Champions League final won by Juventus against Ajax, he said: &quot;If they are a team of Flemish painters, we will be tough Piedmontese.&quot; His grandson, John Elkann, as well as his nephew, Andrea Agnelli, followed his footsteps at Juventus.

==== 1990s–2000s ====
In 1999, Juventus improved their own record of having won all five major UEFA competitions by winning the Intertoto Cup, the next year was voted the seventh best of the FIFA Club of the Century and in 2009 was placed by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics second in the European best club of the 20th-century ranking, the highest position for an Italian club in both; by the early 2000s, the club had the third best revenue in Europe at over €200 million. This all changed when, three years after his death, &quot;Calciopoli&quot; controversially hit the club, which was demoted to Serie B for the first time in its history despite the club being acquitted and the leagues were ruled to be regular; it was his nephew, Andrea Agnelli, who built the club back up in the 2010s. When Agnelli died in 2003, Juventus had won the 2001–02 Serie A at the last matchday, and a few months after his death had reached the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the club&#x27;s four UEFA Champions League final in seven years, three of which were achieved consecutively; those in 1997, against Borussia Dortmund, and in 1998, against Real Madrid, were lost out controversially. In the words of Fulvio Bianchi, early 2000s Juventus were &quot;stronger than all those that came after, and had €250 million in revenue, being at the top of Europe, and 100 sponsors. It took ten years to recover and return to the top Italians, not yet Europeans: now the club makes over €300 million, but in the meantime Real, Bayern, and the others have taken off.&quot;

Some observers allege that &quot;Calciopoli&quot; and its aftermath were a dispute within Juventus and between the club&#x27;s owners that came after the deaths of Gianni and Umberto Agnelli, including Franzo Grande Stevens, who was nicknamed by Agnelli &quot;the lawyer&#x27;s lawyer&quot;, and Gianluigi Gabetti who favoured Agnelli&#x27;s grandson, John Elkann, over his nephew as chairman, and wanted to get rid of Luciano Moggi, Antonio Giraudo, and Roberto Bettega, whose shares in the club increased. Whatever their intentions, it is argued they condemned Juventus: first when Carlo Zaccone, the club&#x27;s lawyer, agreed for relegation to Serie B and point-deduction, when he made that statement because Juventus were the only club risking more than one-division relegation (Serie C), and he meant for Juventus (the sole club to be ultimately demoted) to have equal treatment with the other clubs; and then when Luca Cordero di Montezemolo retired the club&#x27;s appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, which could have cleared the club&#x27;s name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the FIGC from international play, a renounce for which then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter was thankful.

Several observers, including former FIGC president Franco Carraro, argue that had Agnelli been alive, things would have been done differently, as the club and its directors would have been defended properly, which could have avoided relegation and cleared the club&#x27;s name much earlier than the Calciopoli trials of the 2010s. When &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; hit the country in the 1990s, Agnelli said: &quot;My men must be defended to the last degree of judgement.&quot; Moggi, one of the two Juventus directors involved in the scandal, was nicknamed by Agnelli as &quot;the king&#x27;s groom, who must know all horse thieves&quot;. Moggi discussed how &quot;Agnelli said that because during my time it was full of sons of bitches. And he wanted an expert, one who could stand up to these here. For me it&#x27;s a compliment.&quot; He added that &quot;Calciopoli&quot; only happened because &quot;&quot;l&#x27;Avvocato&quot; Agnelli and &quot;il Dottor&quot; Umberto died&quot;, and had the two Agnellis not died, &quot;nothing [of this farce] would have happened.&quot; According to observers, Juventus was weak after Agnelli&#x27;s death, with Moggi saying: &quot;The death of &quot;l&#x27;Avvocato&quot; Agnelli made us orphans and weak, it was easy to attack Juve and destroy them by making things up.&quot; According to critics, Juventus bothered because they won too much under Agnelli. Then-CONI president Gianni Petrucci said &quot;a team that wins too much is harmful to their sport&quot;.

=== Ferrari ===

Upon Fiat&#x27;s acquisition of Ferrari in 1969, Agnelli became associated with Formula One and Scuderia Ferrari, which achieved successes in the 1970s with Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. About his passion for Ferrari, he said: &quot;Not all Italians support the national team, while all Italians and fifty per cent of non-Italians support Ferrari.&quot; In 1996, upon the signing of Michael Schumacher, he said: &quot;Of course, if now they don&#x27;t win with Schumacher it&#x27;s their fault...&quot; In 1998, two years before Ferrari&#x27;s return to dominance of the early 2000s with Schumacher, he said: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t give up a Juve Scudetto for a Ferrari world championship.&quot; Upon his death in 2003, asked whether Agnelli loved more Juventus or Ferrari, Boniperti recalled: &quot;I think Juve. And he loved Turin very much, the city that has always been in his heart.&quot; About Schumacher, he was quoted as saying that &quot;this German is very dear to me, in the sense that he costs me dearly, but he is worth it.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Oggi&quot;, Agnelli&#x27;s grandson Lapo Elkann said: &quot;He saved the Prancing Horse, preventing it from being sold to the Americans. Then he chose the right people: [former Ferrari chairman] Luca di Montezemolo and Jean Todt. He loved Ferrari cars and he loved all the beautiful things in life. It&#x27;s not enough to be rich to appreciate beauty. Taste cannot be bought.&quot; About Agnelli&#x27;s favoured Formula One drivers, Elkann said: &quot;His favourite driver was the one who won. I think that&#x27;s why he loved Michael Schumacher. Then he liked Gilles Villeneuve, his way of driving. And Ayrton Senna, who, had he not died so tragically, would have come to Ferrari the following year. He loved talent and courage and also recognised them in his opponents. He was a true sportsman.&quot;

=== Yacht racing ===
Among his many passions, he was one of the promoters of Azzurra, an Italian boat entering the America&#x27;s Cup. When in sea, he often spent his time on the 1967 G-Cinquanta, one of his many boats.

== Style ==
Agnelli&#x27;s fashion sense and style inspired and influenced menswear throughout the years in Italy and around the world. In his retirement speech, Milanese fashion designer Nino Cerruti named Agnelli as one of his biggest inspirations along with James Bond and John F. Kennedy. &quot;Esquire&quot; named Agnelli as one of five best-dressed men in the history of the world.

Agnelli&#x27;s dress style featured a foundation of classic suits. He had a large number of bespoke Caraceni suits, which were of high quality and classic design. He was known for wearing his wristwatch over his cuff and was regarded as conveying &quot;sprezzatura&quot;, the Italian art of making the difficult look easy. Agnelli&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Rake of the Riviera&quot; inspired the classical menswear magazine &quot;The Rake&quot;.

== Politics ==
Politically, Agnelli did not join any party and remained an independent politician; nonetheless, he was close to the Italian Republican Party (PRI), and was described as the Republican monarch of the 20th century. He had amicable relations with the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) and Italian Socialist Party (PSI) leaders Giuseppe Saragat and Sandro Pertini, respectively, as well as with Francesco Cossiga of Christian Democracy (DC) and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Despite their political differences and conflicts like the &quot;&quot; in 1980, he also had relatively amicable relations with the Italian Communist Party (PCI), particularly during the leadership of Enrico Berlinguer; in 2013, Giorgio Napolitano, former PCI member and then president of Italy, described it as &quot;sincere cordiality and sympathy&quot;. Several notable PCI leaders, such as Palmiro Togliatti, Luciano Lama, and Berlinguer, and allegedly Antonio Gramsci, were supporters of Agnelli&#x27;s Juventus.

Like other family members, such as his grandfather, Agnelli sought to create a non-ideological, centrist political formation of Atlanticist and pro-European persuasion that sought a modernising, internationalist capitalism in contrast to the left and opposed to the populist, nationalist, or fascist right. He received his first public assignment in 1961 when, on the occasion of the celebrations for the first centenary of the unification of Italy, he was appointed president of the Expo 61. In the 1970s, there were talks of forming a secular bloc between the Italian Liberal Party, PSDI, and PRI, and take over the place of the DC. Ahead of the 1976 Italian general election, then PRI secretary Ugo La Malfa offered Agnelli a candidacy on the party lists; in turn, Agnelli offered his disponibility to be the Ambassador of the Italian Republic to the United States. The DC was ultimately able to not only have Agnelli retire his PRI candidacy, which could have cost them about one million votes, by raising the prospect of economic retaliations for Fiat but also convinced Umberto Agnelli, his younger brother, to join the DC. He turned down the invite by then president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to become Prime Minister of Italy after Ciampi.

In 1991, Agnelli was appointed senator for life by Cossiga, then president of the Italian Republic. He joined the For the Autonomies group and was admitted to the Defense Commission of the Senate. In 1994, he was among the three life senators (together with Giovanni Leone and Cossiga) to vote their confidence in the Berlusconi I Cabinet; it was the first time in the history of Italy that life senators were decisive for the confidence in an executive. When Berlusconi was about to enter politics, he said: &quot;If he wins, an entrepreneur will have won. If he loses, Berlusconi will have lost.&quot; When the Prodi I Cabinet fell in 1998 and Massimo D&#x27;Alema was appointed Prime Minister of Italy and became the first post-Communist to hold the office of a NATO country, as well as Italy&#x27;s only post-Communist prime minister, his vote in favour of confidence caused a sensation. He told the press that &quot;today in Italy a left-wing government is the only one that can make right-wing policies.&quot;

== Quotations ==

Agnelli is the author of many aphorisms and quotations. The most notable of them are related to what he described as &quot;the love of a lifetime&quot;, Juventus, about which he said &quot;they are my life&#x27;s companion, above all an emotion. It happens when I see those shirts enter the field. I even get excited when I read the letter J in some headline in the newspaper. Immediately I think of Juve.&quot; He also said: &quot;Juve is for me the love of a lifetime, a source of joy and pride, but also of disappointment and frustration, however strong emotions, as can give a true and infinite love story.&quot;

To the shouted cheering, in response to the question &quot;Will Juventus win or the best team win?&quot;, Agnelli replied with irony: &quot;I&#x27;m lucky, often the two things coincide&quot;. He described Juventus thusly: &quot;[Because] Juventus, after a century of history already, has become a legend. A legend that started off in a high school in Turin and finished up by gaining nine or ten million fans in Italy and, of course, the same number abroad with a jersey and colours that are known throughout the world.&quot; About Tommaso Buscetta, a member of Cosa Nostra who became a &quot;pentito&quot; and collaborator of justice, he was quoted as saying: &quot;He said he was obsessively a fan of Juventus? If you meet him, tell him it&#x27;s the only thing he won&#x27;t have to regret [a play on the word &quot;pentito&quot;, which comes from &quot;pentire&quot;, meaning in English &#x27;to regret&#x27;].&quot;

<text>Saint-Omer (; ; Picard: &quot;Saint-Onmé&quot;) is a commune and sub-prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais department in France.

It is west-northwest of Lille on the railway to Calais, and is located in the Artois province. The town is named after Saint Audomar, who brought Christianity to the area.

The canalised section of the river Aa begins at Saint-Omer, reaching the North Sea at Gravelines in northern France. Below its walls, the Aa connects with the Neufossé Canal, which ends at the river Lys.

==History==
Saint-Omer first appeared in the writings during the 7th century under the name of Sithiu (Sithieu or Sitdiu), around the Saint-Bertin abbey founded on the initiative of Audomar, (Odemaars or Omer).

Omer, bishop of Thérouanne, in the 7th century established the Abbey of Saint Bertin, from which that of Notre-Dame was an offshoot. Rivalry and dissension, which lasted till the French Revolution, soon sprang up between the two monasteries, becoming especially virulent when in 1559 St Omer became a bishopric and Notre-Dame was raised to the rank of cathedral.

In the 9th century, the village that grew up round the monasteries took the name of St Omer. The Normans laid the place to waste about 860 and 880. Ten years later the town and monastery had built fortified walls and were safe from their attack. Situated on the borders of territories frequently disputed by French, Flemish, English and Spaniards, St Omer for most of its history continued to be subject to sieges and military invasions.

In 932 Arnulf of Flanders conquered the County of Artois and Saint-Omer (&quot;Sint-Omaars&quot; in Dutch) became part of the County of Flanders for the next three centuries. In 1071 Philip I and the teenage Count Arnulf III of Flanders were defeated at St Omer by Arnulf&#x27;s uncle and former protector, Robert the Frisian, who subsequently became the Count of Flanders until his death in 1093.

Along with its textile industry, St-Omer flourished in the 12th and 13th century. In 1127 the town received a communal charter from the count, William Clito, becoming the first town in West Flanders with city rights. Later on the city lost its leading position in the textile industry to Bruges. After the mysterious death of Count Baldwin I, the County of Flanders was weakened. In 1212 Philip II of France captured Baldwin&#x27;s daughter Joan and her husband Ferdinand, Count of Flanders and forced them to sign the Treaty of Pont-à-Vendin, in which Artois was yielded to France. Ferdinand did not take this lying down, and allied with Emperor Otto IV and John, King of England, he battled Philip II at Bouvines, but was defeated. Despite the political separation for the next 170 years, the city remained part of the economic network of Flanders.

In 1340 a large battle was fought in the town&#x27;s suburbs between an Anglo-Flemish army and a French one under Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, in which the Anglo-Flemish force was forced to withdraw. From 1384, St-Omer was part of the Burgundian Netherlands, from 1482 of the Habsburg Netherlands and from 1581 to 1678 of the Spanish Netherlands. 
The French made futile attempts against the town between 1551 and 1596. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the French attacked in 1638 (under Cardinal Richelieu) and again in 1647. Finally in 1677, after a seventeen-day siege, Louis XIV forced the town to capitulate. The peace of Nijmegen signed in the fall of 1678 permanently confirmed the conquest and its annexation by France. In 1711, St-Omer was besieged by the Duke of Marlborough. With the town on the verge of surrendering because of famine, Jacqueline Robin risked her life to bring provisions into the town, in memory of which in 1884 a large statue of her was erected in front of the cathedral.

The College of Saint Omer was established in 1593 by Fr Robert Persons SJ, an English Jesuit, to educate English Roman Catholics. After the Protestant Reformation, England had established penal laws against Roman Catholic education in the country. The college operated in St Omer until 1762, when it migrated to Bruges and then to Liège in 1773. It finally moved to England in 1794, settling at Stonyhurst, Lancashire. Former students of the College of Saint Omer include John Carroll, his brother Daniel and his cousin Charles.

During World War I on 8 October 1914, the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) arrived in Saint-Omer and a headquarters was established at the aerodrome next to the local race course. For the following four years, Saint-Omer was a focal point for all RFC operations in the field. Although most squadrons only used Saint-Omer as a transit camp before moving on to other locations, the base grew in importance as it increased its logistic support to the RFC. Many Royal Air Force squadrons can trace their roots to formation at Saint-Omer during this period. Among which are No. IX Squadron RAF which was formed at Saint-Omer, 14 December 1914 and No. 16 Squadron RAF which was formed on 10 February 1915.

During World War II, the Luftwaffe used the airfield. When the RAF&#x27;s legless Battle of Britain ace, Douglas Bader, parachuted from his Spitfire during an aerial battle over France, he was initially treated at a Luftwaffe hospital at Saint-Omer. He had lost an artificial leg when bailing out, and the RAF dropped him another one during a bombing raid.

==Population==
==Main sites==

The fortifications (which had been improved by Vauban in the 17th century) were demolished during the last decade of the 19th century, and boulevards and new thoroughfares built in their place. A section of the ramparts remains intact on the western side of the town, converted into a park known as the &quot;jardin public&quot; (public garden). There are two harbours outside the city and another within its limits. Saint-Omer has wide streets and spacious squares.

The old cathedral was constructed almost entirely in the 13th, 14th and centuries. A heavy square tower finished in 1499 surmounts the west portal. The church contains Biblical paintings, a colossal statue of Christ seated between the Virgin Mary and St John (13th century, originally belonging to the cathedral of Thérouanne and presented by the emperor Charles V), the cenotaph of Saint Audomare (Omer) (13th century) and numerous &quot;ex-votos&quot;. The richly decorated chapel in the transept contains a wooden figure of the Virgin (12th century), the object of pilgrimages. Of St Bertin church, part of the abbey (built between 1326 and 1520 on the site of previous churches) where Childeric III retired to end his days, there remain some arches and a lofty tower, which serve to adorn a public garden. Several other churches or convent chapels are of interest, among them St Sepulchre (14th century), which has a stone spire and stained-glass windows. The cathedral has a huge Cavaillé-Coll organ, which is still playable.

A collection of records, a picture gallery, and a theatre are all situated in the town hall, built of the materials from the abbey of St Bertin. Several houses date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The Hôtel Colbert, once the royal lodging, is now occupied by an archaeological museum. The military hospital occupies the former English College, founded by the English Jesuits in 1593. It is now part of the Lycée Alexandre Ribot. Besides the Lycée, there are schools of music and of art.

The old episcopal palace adjoining the cathedral is used as a court-house. Saint-Omer is the seat of a court of assizes and tribunals, of a chamber of commerce, and of a board of trade arbitration.

Until 1942, the chief statue in the town was that of Jacqueline Robin, who, according to the mythology, had helped the town resist a siege by Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1711. However, the statue disappeared during the German occupation, taken to be melted down. Today, the remaining statues of people associated with the city:

* L&#x27;abbé Suger
* Pierre Alexandre Monsigny
* Prince Ferdinand-Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Orléans

==Economy==
Over the better part of the last century, the economy of Saint Omer had depended largely on one enterprise, that of the glass maker Arc International (situated in the neighbouring town of Arques). The economy of Saint Omer has diversified over the course of the past 50 years. Aside from the glass works at Arc International, major employers in the area include:

* Alphaglass
* Brasserie de Saint-Omer
* Les Fromageurs de Saint Omer
* La Societe des Eaux de Saint Omer
* Centre Hospitalier Région de Saint-Omer
* Bonduelle

The creation of new enterprises has seen a steady growth in the past 10 years with 2 147 enterprises as of 2020. In the town itself, there are a number of retail shops and services, as well as a large selection of restaurants, brasseries and cafés.

Historically, the economy of Saint Omer had also developed in the wetlands outside the city, known locally as &quot;le marais&quot;, which remains one of the last cultivated &quot;marais&quot; in France. The Marais Audomarois is currently listed as a UNESCO heritage site. The agricultural output from this area continues year-round, thanks to the mild climate and fertile soil. Among the specialties, cauliflower is a notable product and is exported throughout Europe. Other crops for which the area is known are carrots, endive, and watercress.

==Nearby areas==
At the end of the marshes, on the borders of the forest of Clairmarais, are the ruins of the abbey founded in 1140 by Thierry of Alsace. Thomas Becket sought refuge here in 1165. To the south of Saint-Omer, on a hill commanding the Aa, lies the camp of Helfaut, often called the camp of Saint-Omer.

On the Canal de Neufossé, near the town, is the &quot;Ascenseur des Fontinettes&quot;, a hydraulic lift which once raised and lowered canal boats to and from the Aa, over a height of 12m. This was replaced in 1967 by a large lock.

During the Second World War, the area was chosen as a launch site for the V-2 rocket. The nearby blockhouse at Éperlecques and underground complex of La Coupole were built for this purpose and are open to the public.

==Culture==

Saint-Omer is diverse in ethnic, linguistic and immigrant communities. Haut-Pont is a heavily West Flemish section of Saint-Omer which has Flemish/Belgian roots. In the Southeast of the cathedral is a newly formed Turkish neighborhood; the majority of the local Turks are members of the Christian faith (i.e. Greek Orthodox or of ethnic Greek origin, Eastern Rite and Catholic converts), who arrived in France after World War I to escape religious persecution. Genealogists have noted the many cultural influences in the area, including British, Dutch, German, Austrian, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak and Polish. It is believed the region&#x27;s mining and glass manufacturing industries contributed to a revived post-war (WWI and WWII era) population.

===Public library===
The public library of Saint-Omer holds, in its rare books section, one of the three French copies of the 42-line Gutenberg Bible, originally from the library of the Abbey of Saint Bertin. The other two copies are in Paris. In November 2014, a previously unknown Shakespeare First Folio was found in a public library in Saint-Omer. The book had lain undisturbed in the library for 200 years. The first 30 pages were missing. A number of experts assisted in authenticating the folio, which also had a name, &quot;Neville&quot;, written on the first surviving page, indicating that it may have once been owned by Edward Scarisbrick. Scarisbrick had fled England due to anti-Catholic repression and attended Saint-Omer College, a Jesuit institution. Confirmation of its authenticity came from a professor at the University of Nevada and one of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on Shakespeare, Eric Rasmussen, who happened to be in London at the time. The only other known copy of a First Folio in France is in the National Library in Paris.

===Sports===

St. Omer was the host of the 2022 Canoe Polo world championships.

<text>Interpedia was one of the first-proposed online encyclopedia which would allow anyone to contribute by writing articles and submitting them to the central catalogue of all Interpedia pages.

==History==
Interpedia was initiated by Rick Gates, who posted a message titled &quot;The Internet Encyclopedia&quot; on October 25, 1993 to the PACS-L (Public-Access Computer Systems Forum) Listserv. That message included the following musings:

In November 1993, discussions moved to a dedicated mailing list, supplemented later by Usenet newsgroup .

Several independent &quot;Seal-of-approval&quot; (SOAP) agencies were envisioned which would rate Interpedia articles based on criteria of their own choosing; users could then decide which agencies&#x27; recommendations to follow.

The project was actively discussed for around half a year, but never left the planning stages, perhaps partly due to the unprecedented growth of the World Wide Web.

<text>Sid Krofft (born July 30, 1929) and Marty Krofft (April 9, 1937 – November 25, 2023), known as The Krofft Brothers and born as Cydus and Moshopopoulos Yolas, were a Canadian sibling team of television creators, writers and puppeteers. Through their production company, Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Pictures, they made numerous children&#x27;s television and variety show programs in the U.S., particularly in the 1970s, including &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;, &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, and &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;. Their fantasy programs often featured large-headed puppets, high-concept plots, and extensive use of low-budget special effects.

==Early years==
The Krofft brothers, Sid and Marty, were both born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on July 30, 1929, and April 9, 1937 respectively. They are of Greek and Hungarian descent, with their original surname being Yolas. For years, they claimed to have been the fifth generation of puppeteers in their family but revealed in 2008 that this story had been invented by a publicist in the 1940s. Their father Peter was a clock salesman who moved from Canada to Providence, Rhode Island, and then to New York City. Sid Krofft became a popular puppeteer who worked in vaudeville and was a featured player with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. In the 1940s, Sid created a one-man puppet show regularly performed at burlesque shows as a teenager. A night club promoter from the Catskills was convinced by Sid to create a show he named from the name, Sydney Snitkovsk. Sid added an extra F due to its short length to &quot;The Unusual Artistry of Sid Krofft&quot;, that began to be performed throughout the world. His father joined him on tour in Paris while Marty stayed in New York, where he began using his older brother&#x27;s puppets to earn money by staging performances. By the 1950s, the Krofft brothers were working together, and in 1957, they developed &quot;Les Poupées de Paris&quot;, a puppet show with more mature themes. One of their early exposures to a television audience was the premiere episode of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; in 1965.

==Television productions==

After designing the characters and sets for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Banana Splits&quot; (NBC, 1968–1970), the Kroffts&#x27; producing career began in 1969 with the landmark children&#x27;s television series &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. The series introduced the team&#x27;s trademark style of large-scale, colourful design, puppetry, and special effects. Featuring a boy who has been lured into an alternate fantasy world and can never escape, the team also established a storytelling formula to which they would often return. Some people suggested that the Krofft brothers were influenced by marijuana and LSD, although they have always denied these claims. In a 2005 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Marty Krofft said, &quot;No drugs involved. You can&#x27;t do drugs when you&#x27;re making shows. Maybe after, but not during. We&#x27;re bizarre, that&#x27;s all.&quot; Referring to the alleged LSD use, Marty said in another interview, &quot;That was our look, those were the colours, everything we did had vivid colours, but there was no acid involved. That scared me. I&#x27;m no goody two-shoes, but you can&#x27;t create this stuff stoned.&quot;

The Kroffts favoured quirky superhero stories, often with children portraying the heroes or part of a hero team. Krofft productions have included &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; (1970), &quot;Lidsville&quot; (1971), &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot; (1973–1975), &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; (1974–1976), &quot;The Lost Saucer&quot; (1975), &quot;Electra Woman and Dyna Girl&quot; (1976), and &quot;Wonderbug&quot; (1976–1978).

==The World of Sid and Marty Krofft==

In 1976, a developer asked the Kroffts to develop an indoor amusement park for the new Omni International complex downtown Atlanta. The park, The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, closed after six months due to poor attendance. The Omni International building that contained it was renamed the CNN Center when the site was converted to the CNN headquarters.

==Achievements==
The Kroffts&#x27; children&#x27;s programs have developed a wide and enduring following, especially among adults who watched the shows as children. They were also responsible for a large number of prime-time music and variety programs. These shows also tended to employ a reliable formula featuring a celebrity host or team of hosts, weekly celebrity guest performers, flashy and colourful sets, and frequent interludes of scripted banter and gag-driven, &quot;corny,&quot; good-natured sketch comedy.

The Kroffts are often acknowledged for the vision and creativity of their projects. In addition to their colourful and hyper-kinetic programs, they often created children&#x27;s shows with complex stories, unusual protagonists, and uniquely modern sensibilities, or with darker or more action-themed tones than most children&#x27;s shows. Their &quot;camp&quot; popularity stems largely from their shows&#x27; low-budget production values, the often surrealistic feel of many of the programs, and the uniquely &quot;70s&quot; style of music and design.

==Later years==
The Kroffts have occasionally departed from their formula while making new programs, such as on &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; (1984) and the political puppet satire show &quot;D.C. Follies&quot; (1987). They have attempted to update some of their classic series for a younger generation, including new versions of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Electra Woman and Dyna Girl&quot;, &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; and &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;. A new original series, &quot;Mutt &amp; Stuff&quot;, aired on Nickelodeon from 2015 to 2017.

In 2018, the Kroffts received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Daytime Emmys.

In 2020, the Kroffts were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to television.

In May 2022, the Kroffts participated in the first Krofft Kon, a convention held in Orinda, California, where they were joined by some of the actors from their television series.

In January 2023, Sid Krofft sued his brother Marty, as well as the Krofft companies for allegedly being delinquent in paying nearly $500,000 owed to the plaintiff as part of a buyout of Sid&#x27;s business interests.

Marty Krofft died from kidney failure in Los Angeles, California, on November 25, 2023, at the age of 86.

<text>John Carroll University (JCU) is a private Jesuit university in University Heights, Ohio, United States. Located in a suburb of Cleveland, it is primarily an undergraduate, liberal arts institution composed of a college of arts and sciences and business school. It was founded in 1886 as St. Ignatius College and renamed in 1923 after John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the United States and founder of Georgetown University. The university enrolls approximately 3,000 undergraduate and graduate students as of fall 2024.

==History==

John Carroll University was founded in 1886 by the Society of Jesus under the title of St. Ignatius College, after Ignatius of Loyola, as a college for men. It has been in continuous operation as a degree-granting institution since that time. Founded as the 19th of 27 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. 

In 1923, the college was renamed John Carroll University, honoring the first archbishop of the Catholic Church in the United States, who founded Georgetown University. In 1935, it was moved from its original location on the west side of Cleveland to its present site in University Heights, a suburb east of downtown Cleveland. However, the high school section retained the original name and continues to operate on the original site in Cleveland. The city of University Heights had been renamed from &quot;Idlewood&quot; during the construction of the campus.

During World War II, John Carroll was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In September 1968, the university made the transition from full-time male enrollment to a fully coeducational institution, admitting women to the College of Arts and Sciences for the first time. In recent years, the university has undergone extensive reconstruction and expansion. In 2003, the university opened the $66 million, Dolan Center for Science and Technology, named after alumnus Charles Dolan, founder of Cablevision and HBO, and his wife Helen Dolan. The couple met while attending John Carroll. In 2011, the university completed the removal of the Bohannon Science building and celebrated the Hamlin Quad enhancement project.

===Jesuit tradition===
The university announced in December 2017 that its board of directors had named the school&#x27;s first non-Jesuit president, Michael D. Johnson. Johnson had been the provost at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He began his tenure on July 1, 2018, and was officially inaugurated on September 6, 2018.

==Campus==
More than twenty major buildings, predominantly Collegiate Gothic in architecture, and sixty landscaped acres make up the John Carroll campus. Saint Ignatius Hall, located in the center of campus and surmounted by the university&#x27;s landmark Grasselli Tower, bears clear resemblance to the English royal palace Hampton Court.

==Academics==

John Carroll University is organized into three colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Boler College of Business, and the College of Health. The university requires a comprehensive core curriculum for all undergraduate students. John Carroll University&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 80 distinct programs for undergraduate and graduate students. Some of the most popular undergraduate majors are communications, biology, psychology, education, exercise science, political science, sociology, criminology, chemistry, and English.
===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, John Carroll University accepted 82.4% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered difficult, applicant competition considered very low, and with those enrolled having an average 3.66 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores. If submitted, scores are considered. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1240 SAT score (18% submitting) or an average 27 ACT score (24% submitting).

===International programs===
John Carroll has several international programs in which eligible students are able to participate. The university operates several of their own programs and cooperates with other Jesuit universities in operating other programs. John Carroll University&#x27;s Exchange Programs include the International Student Exchange Program, and programs at Kansai Gaidai University, Nanzan University and Sophia University, all in Japan as well as the Technical University of Dortmund, Germany and University of Hull, England. These programs include the Belfast Institute in Peace Building and Conflict Transformation, the Boler School of Business Semester in London, Italian Studies at Vatican City, the London Liberal Arts Semester, the Jesuit Beijing Center, as well as Casa de la Solidaridad in El Salvador.

All international programs, including those for international students who study at John Carroll, are managed by the university&#x27;s Center for Global Education.

===Reputation and rankings===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, John Carroll University was ranked third out of 165 regional universities in the Midwest. The university has been ranked within the top ten of this category since 1988. The university was also ranked third (tied) for undergraduate teaching, third for &quot;most innovative&quot; schools, and 23rd as a &quot;best value&quot; school.

John Carroll was chosen as one of Forbes&#x27; Best Value Schools of 2016.

The John M. and Mary Jo Boler School of Business was ranked first nationwide in Bloomberg Businessweek&#x27;s 2016 “Best Undergraduate Business Schools” employer survey for the graduates best prepared for work in their fields. It was ranked 30th among all business schools.

==Student life==

John Carroll is a primarily residential campus, with over 60% of all students living on campus in one of seven residence halls; 90% of freshmen and sophomores live on campus. There are over 100 student-led organizations at John Carroll, many of which have the underlying goal of providing service to the community – be it the community of the local Cleveland area or the global community at large.

Fraternities and sororities are approved by the John Carroll University Office of Student Activities and governed by the rules of the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils.

Many John Carroll University students take advantage of service opportunities during their undergraduate studies.

==Athletics==
John Carroll offers 24 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity sports teams. The university&#x27;s official colors are blue and gold and teams compete under the nickname Blue Streaks. In 2025, John Carroll joined the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAA) Division III. The university was previously a member institution of the Ohio Athletic Conference since 1989.

The university plays football, lacrosse and soccer in Don Shula Stadium, named after the winningest coach in NFL history, who had studied at John Carroll between 1947 and 1951. Shula contributed to the stadium&#x27;s construction, as did former Washington Redskins star and JCU alumnus London Fletcher &#x27;98.

In 1974–75, the wrestling team won the NCAA Division III national championship. In addition, three teams have qualified for the national semifinals in team sporting events: the 2002 football team, the 2003–04 men&#x27;s basketball team, and the 2016 football team. On November 12, 2016, John Carroll defeated the University of Mount Union 31–28, snapping the program&#x27;s college football record of 112 straight regular season wins.

There have been 22 individual national champions: 16 in wrestling, two in men&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, one in men&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, one in women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, one in women&#x27;s diving, and one in men&#x27;s swimming.

== Student newspaper ==
The Carroll News is the student-run, weekly newspaper at John Carroll University. &quot;The Carroll News&quot; was first published in 1925 covering both John Carroll University and St. Ignatius High School. When the high school founded its own newspaper in 1927, &quot;The Carroll News&quot; limited coverage to the university.

<doc id="173749" wikidata="Q38415" url="?curid=173749" title="Ernie Pyle">
<text>Ernest Taylor Pyle (August 3, 1900 – April 18, 1945) was an American journalist and war correspondent who is best known for his stories about ordinary American soldiers during World War II. Pyle is also notable for the columns he wrote as a roving human-interest reporter from 1935 through 1941 for the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate that earned him wide acclaim for his simple accounts of ordinary people across North America. When the United States entered World War II, he lent the same distinctive, folksy style of his human-interest stories to his wartime reports from the European theater (1942–44) and Pacific theater (1945). Pyle won the Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for his newspaper accounts of &quot;dogface&quot; infantry soldiers from a first-person perspective. He was killed by enemy fire on Iejima (then known as Ie Shima) during the Battle of Okinawa.

At the time of his death in 1945, Pyle was among the best-known American war correspondents. His syndicated column was published in 400 daily and 300 weekly newspapers nationwide. President Harry Truman said of Pyle, &quot;No man in this war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American fighting men wanted it told. He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Ernest &quot;Ernie&quot; Taylor Pyle was born on August 3, 1900, on the Sam Elder farm near Dana, Indiana, in rural Vermillion County, Indiana. His parents were Maria (Taylor) and William Clyde Pyle. At the time of Pyle&#x27;s birth his father was a tenant farmer on the Elder property. Neither of Pyle&#x27;s parents attended school beyond the eighth grade.

Pyle, an only child, disliked farming and pursued a more adventurous life. After graduating from a local high school in Bono, Helt Township, Vermillion County, Indiana, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War I. Pyle began his training at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, but the war ended before he could be transferred to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station for additional training.

Pyle enrolled at Indiana University in 1919, aspiring to become a journalist. However, IU did not offer a degree in journalism at that time, so Pyle majored in economics and took as many journalism courses as he could. Pyle began studying journalism in his sophomore year, the same year he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and began working on the &quot;Indiana Daily Student&quot;, the student-written newspaper. During his junior year Pyle became the newspaper&#x27;s city editor and its news editor; he also worked on the &quot;Arbutus&quot;, the campus yearbook, although he did not enjoy the desk-bound work. Pyle&#x27;s simple, storytelling writing style, which he developed while a student at IU, later became his trademark style as a professional journalist and earned him millions of readers as a columnist for Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate.

In March 1922, during his junior year at IU, Pyle and three of his fraternity brothers dropped out of school for a semester to follow the IU baseball team on a trip to Japan. Pyle and his fraternity brothers found work aboard the S.S. &quot;Keystone State&quot;. During its voyage across the Pacific Ocean, the ship docked at ports such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, as well as in Japan before returning trip to the United States. Pyle&#x27;s interest in traveling and exploring the world continued in his later years as a reporter.

After his trip across the Pacific, Pyle returned to IU Bloomington, where he was named editor-in-chief of the &quot;Indiana Summer Student&quot;, the summer edition of the campus newspaper. During his senior year at IU, Pyle continued his work at the &quot;Daily Student&quot; and the &quot;Arbutus&quot;. He also joined Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism fraternity, and was active in other campus clubs. In addition, Pyle was selected as a senior manager of IU&#x27;s football team, making him a letterman along with the other members of the team in 1922.

Pyle left school in January 1923 with only a semester remaining and without graduating from IU.
He took a job as a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in La Porte, Indiana, earning $25 a week. Pyle worked at the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; for three months before moving to Washington, D.C., to join the staff of &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pyle met his future wife, Geraldine Elizabeth &quot;Jerry&quot; Siebolds (August 23, 1899 – November 23, 1945), a native of Minnesota, at a Halloween party in Washington, D.C., in 1923.
They married in July 1925. In the early years of their marriage the couple traveled the country together. In Pyle&#x27;s newspaper columns describing their trips, he often referred to her as &quot;That Girl who rides with me&quot;. In June 1940, Pyle purchased property about from downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had a modest, home built on the site. The residence served as the couple&#x27;s home base in the United States for the remainder of their lives.

Ernie and Jerry Pyle had a tempestuous relationship. He often complained of being ill, was a &quot;heavy abuser of alcohol at times,&quot; and suffered from bouts of depression, later made worse from the stress of his work as a war correspondent during World War II. His wife suffered from alcoholism and periods of mental illness (depression or bipolar disorder). She also made several suicide attempts. Although the couple divorced on April 14, 1942, they remarried by proxy in March 1943, while Pyle was covering the war in North Africa. They had no children. Newspapers reported that Jerry Pyle &quot;took the news [of her husband&#x27;s death] bravely&quot;, but her health declined rapidly in the months following his death on April 18, 1945, while he was covering operations of American troops on Ie Shima. Jerry Pyle died from complications of influenza at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on November 23, 1945.

==Career==
===Staff reporter and aviation columnist===
In 1923, Pyle moved to Washington, D.C., to join the staff as a reporter for the &quot;Washington Daily News&quot;, a new Scripps-Howard tabloid newspaper, and soon became a copy editor as well. Pyle was paid $30 a week for his services, beginning a career with Scripps-Howard that would continue for the remainder of his life. When Pyle joined the &quot;Daily News&quot; all the editors were young, including editor-in-chief John M. Gleissner, Lee G. Miller (who became a lifelong friend of Pyle)
Charles M. Egan, Willis &quot;June&quot; Thornton Jr., and Paul McCrea.

By 1926, Pyle and his wife, Geraldine &quot;Jerry&quot;, had quit their jobs. In ten weeks the couple traveled more than 9,000 miles across the United States in a Ford Model T roadster. After briefly working in New York City for the &quot;Evening World&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Pyle returned to the &quot;Daily News&quot; in December 1927 to begin work on one of the country&#x27;s first and its best-known aviation column, which he wrote for four years. Pyle&#x27;s column appeared in syndication for the Scripps-Howard newspapers from 1928 to 1932. Although he never became an aircraft pilot, Pyle flew about as a passenger. As Amelia Earhart later said, &quot;Any aviator who didn&#x27;t know Pyle was a nobody.&quot;

===Human-interest and columnist===
In 1932, at the age of thirty-one, Pyle was named managing editor at the &quot;Daily News&quot;, serving in the position for three years before taking on a new writing assignment. In December 1934 Pyle took an extended vacation in the western United States to recuperate from a severe bout of influenza. Upon his return to Washington, D.C., and while he filled in for the paper&#x27;s vacationing syndicated columnist Heywood Broun, Pyle wrote a series of eleven articles about his trip and the people he had met. The series proved popular with both readers and colleagues. G.B. (&quot;Deac&quot;) Parker, editor-in-chief of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, said he had found in Pyle&#x27;s vacation articles &quot;a sort of Mark Twain quality and they knocked my eyes right out&quot;.

In 1935, Pyle left his position as managing editor at the &quot;Daily News&quot; to write his own national column as a roving reporter of human-interest stories for the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate. Over the next six years, from 1935 until early 1942, Pyle and his wife, Jerry, whom Pyle identified in his columns as &quot;That Girl who rides with me,&quot; traveled the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as Central and South America, writing about the interesting places he saw and people he met. Pyle&#x27;s column, published under the title of the &quot;Hoosier Vagabond,&quot; appeared six days a week in Scripps-Howard newspapers. The articles became popular with readers, earning Pyle national recognition in the years preceding his even bigger fame as a war correspondent during World War II. Selected columns of Pyle&#x27;s human interest stories were later compiled in &quot;Home Country&quot; (1947),
published posthumously.

Despite his growing popularity, Pyle lacked confidence and was perpetually dissatisfied with his writing; however, he was pleased when others recognized the quality of his work. Pyle&#x27;s aviation and travel reports laid the groundwork for his life as a war correspondent. Pyle continued his daily travel column until 1942, but by that time he was also writing about American soldiers serving in World War II.

===World War II correspondent===
Pyle initially went to London in 1940 to cover the Battle of Britain, but returned to Europe in 1942 as a war correspondent for Scripps-Howard newspapers. Beginning in North Africa in late 1942, Pyle spent time with the U.S. military during the North African Campaign, the Italian campaign, and the Normandy landings. He returned to the United States in September 1944, spending several weeks recuperating from combat stress before reluctantly agreeing to travel to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater in January 1945. Pyle was covering the invasion of Okinawa when he was killed in April 1945.

====European theater====

Pyle volunteered to go to London in December 1940 to cover the Battle of Britain. He witnessed the German firebombing of the city and reported on the growing conflict in Europe. His recollections of his experiences from this period were published in his book, &quot;Ernie Pyle in England&quot; (1941). After returning to the United States in March 1941 and taking a three-month leave of absence from work to care for his wife, Pyle made a second trip to Great Britain in June 1942, when he accepted an assignment to become a war correspondent for Scripps-Howard newspapers. Pyle&#x27;s wartime columns usually described the war from the common man&#x27;s perspective as he rotated among the various branches of the U.S. military and reported from the front lines. Pyle joined American troops in North Africa and Europe (1942–44), and the Asiatic-Pacific Theater (1945). Collections of Pyle&#x27;s newspaper columns from the campaigns he covered in the European theater are included in &quot;Here is Your War&quot; (1943) and &quot;Brave Men&quot; (1944).

In his reports of the North African Campaign in late 1942 and early 1943, Pyle told stories of his early wartime experiences, which made interesting reading for Americans in the United States. Through his work, Pyle became friends of the enlisted men and officers, as well as those in leadership roles such as Generals Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Pyle wrote that he was especially fond of the infantry &quot;because they are the underdogs&quot;.

Pyle lived among the U.S. servicemen and was free to interview anyone he wanted. As a noncombatant Pyle could also leave the front when he wanted. He interrupted his reporting in September 1943 and in September 1944 to return home to recuperate from the stresses of combat and care for his wife when she was ill.

Reinforcing his status as the dogface G.I.&#x27;s best friend, Pyle wrote a column from Italy in 1944 proposing that soldiers in combat should get &quot;fight pay,&quot; just as airmen received &quot;flight pay&quot;. In May 1944 the U.S. Congress passed a law that became known as the Ernie Pyle bill. It authorized 50 percent extra pay for combat service. Pyle&#x27;s most famous column, &quot;The Death of Captain Waskow,&quot; written in Italy in December 1943, was published on January 10, 1944, when Allied forces were fighting at the Anzio beachhead in Italy. The notable story also marked the peak of Pyle&#x27;s writing career.

After the North African and Italian campaigns, Pyle left Italy in April 1944, relocating to England to cover preparations for the Allied landing at Normandy. Pyle was among the twenty-eight war correspondents chosen to accompany U.S. troops during the initial invasion in June 1944. He landed with American troops at Omaha Beach aboard a LST. On D-Day Pyle wrote:
The best way I can describe this vast armada and the frantic urgency of the traffic is to suggest that you visualize New York city on its busiest day of the year and then just enlarge that scene until it takes in all the ocean the human eye can reach clear around the horizon and over the horizon. There are dozens of times that many.

In July 1944, Pyle was nearly caught in the accidental bombing by the U.S. Army Air Forces at the onset of Operation Cobra near Saint-Lô in Normandy. A month after witnessing the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Pyle publicly apologized to his readers in a column on September 5, 1944, stating that &quot;my spirit is wobbly and my mind is confused&quot; and he said that if he &quot;heard one more shot or saw one more dead man, I would go off my nut&quot;. He later said he had &quot;lost track of the point of the war&quot; and that another two weeks of coverage would have seen him hospitalized with &quot;war neurosis&quot;. An exhausted Pyle wrote that he hoped that a rest at his home in New Mexico would restore his vigor to go &quot;warhorsing around the Pacific&quot;.

====Pacific theater====
Pyle reluctantly headed for the Pacific theater in January 1945 for what became his final writing assignment. While covering the U.S. Navy and Marine forces in the Pacific, Pyle challenged the Navy&#x27;s policy forbidding the use of the names of sailors in reporting the war. He won a partial but unsatisfying victory when the ban was lifted exclusively for him. Pyle travelled on board the aircraft carrier . He thought the naval crew had an easier life than the infantry in Europe, and wrote several unflattering portraits of the Navy. In response, fellow correspondents, newspaper editorialists and G.I.s criticized Pyle (who was a former member of the U.S. Naval Reserve) for his negative coverage of the Navy in his columns and for underestimating the difficulties of naval warfare in the Pacific. Pyle conceded that his heart was with the servicemen in Europe, but he persevered. After traveling to Guam and resuming his writing, Pyle went on to report on naval action during the Battle of Okinawa, the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific theater during World War II.

==Death==

On more than one occasion, Pyle was noted for having premonitions of his own death. Before landing he wrote letters to his friend Paige Cavanaugh, as well as playwright Robert E. Sherwood, predicting that he might not survive the war.

On April 17, 1945, Pyle came ashore with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 305th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division, on Ie Shima (now known as Iejima), a small island northwest of Okinawa that Allied forces had captured, but had not yet cleared of enemy soldiers. The following day, after local enemy opposition had supposedly been neutralized, Pyle was traveling by jeep with Lieutenant Colonel Joseph B. Coolidge, the commanding officer of the 305th and three additional officers toward Coolidge&#x27;s new command post when the vehicle came under fire from a Japanese machine gun. The men immediately took cover in a nearby ditch. &quot;A little later Pyle and I raised up to look around,&quot; Coolidge reported. &quot;Another burst hit the road over our heads ... I looked at Ernie and saw he had been hit.&quot; A machine-gun bullet had entered Pyle&#x27;s left temple just under his helmet, killing him instantly.
Pyle was buried wearing his helmet, among other battle casualties on Ie Shima, between an infantry private and a combat engineer. In tribute to their friend, the men of the 77th Infantry Division erected a monument that still stands at the site of his death. Its inscription reads: &quot;At this spot the 77th Infantry Division lost a buddy, Ernie Pyle, 18 April 1945.&quot; Echoing the sentiment of the men serving in the Pacific theater, General Eisenhower said: &quot;The GIs in Europe––and that means all of us––have lost one of our best and most understanding friends.&quot;

Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who frequently quoted Pyle&#x27;s war dispatches in her newspaper column, &quot;My Day&quot;, paid tribute to him in her column the day after his death: &quot;I shall never forget how much I enjoyed meeting him here in the White House last year,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and how much I admired this frail and modest man who could endure hardships because he loved his job and our men.&quot; President Harry S. Truman, who had been in office for less than a week following the death of Franklin Roosevelt on April 12, also paid tribute to Pyle: &quot;No man in this war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American fighting men wanted it told. He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.&quot;

After the war, Pyle&#x27;s remains were moved to a U.S. military cemetery on Okinawa. In 1949, his remains were some of the first to be interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii.

==Writing style==
Pyle&#x27;s signature storytelling style was developed at IU and during his early years as a human-interest reporter. As a war correspondent he generally wrote from the perspective of the common soldier, explaining how the war affected the men instead of recounting troop movements or the activities of generals. His descriptions of or reactions to an event in simple, informal stories are what set his writing apart and made him famous during the war.

Fellow journalists praised Pyle&#x27;s writing. Walter Morrow, editor of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, claimed that Pyle&#x27;s columns from his travels across the United States in the 1930s were &quot;the most widely read thing in the paper&quot;. During World War II Pyle continued to write about his experiences from the perspective of what he called &quot;the worm&#x27;s-eye view&quot;. In addition to publication of his columns in newspapers in the United States, Pyle&#x27;s writing was the only writing from a civilian correspondent to be regularly published in the U.S. armed forces newspaper, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.

Pyle&#x27;s &quot;everyman&quot; approach to his wartime reporting earned him the Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1944.

==Popularity==
Pyle was well known and popular among the American military. According to Sergeant Mack Morris, whose essay appeared in the U.S. army&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;Yank&quot;: &quot;The secret of Ernie&#x27;s tremendous success and popularity, if there is any secret about it, is his ability to report a war on a personal plane.&quot; Artist George Biddle wrote of how a battalion commander told him that Pyle was a poor writer, but was very popular because &quot;he writes about and writes to the great, anonymous American average. They ... are thirsty for recognition and publicity&quot;.

Pyle&#x27;s newspaper columns were popular in the United States with readers in a wide range of ages from older readers to high school and college students. In November 1942 Pyle&#x27;s columns were distributed to 42 newspapers, but the number had increased to 122 newspapers by April 1943. When he returned to the United States for a break during the war, reporters and photographers made increasing demands for his time. In 1943 Pyle also gave interviews on radio programs to help sell war bonds. At the time of Pyle&#x27;s death his columns appeared in 400 daily and 300 weekly newspapers.

==Legacy==

Pyle is described as &quot;the pre-eminent war correspondent of his era,&quot; who achieved worldwide fame and readership for his World War II battlefield reports that were published from 1942 to 1945. Present-day war correspondents, World War II veterans, and historians still recognize Pyle&#x27;s World War II dispatches as &quot;the standard to which every other war correspondent should strive to emulate.&quot; As &quot;Life&quot; magazine once described Pyle and his work: &quot;He now occupies a place in American journalistic letters which no other correspondent of this war has achieved. His smooth, friendly prose succeeded in bridging a gap between soldier and civilian where written words usually fail.&quot;

Pyle is best remembered for his World War II newspaper reports of the firsthand experiences of ordinary Americans, especially the G.I.s serving in the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe in particular. His legacy also lies in the stories of soldiers who would otherwise be unknown. &quot;The Death of Captain Waskow,&quot; published in January 1944, is considered Pyle&#x27;s most famous column. In describing the soldiers he had met, Pyle remarked:Their life consisted wholly and solely of war, for they were and always had been front-line infantrymen. They survived because the fates were kind to them, certainly – but also because they had become hard and immensely wise in animal-like ways of self-preservation.

In addition to his writing, Pyle&#x27;s legacy includes the Ernie Pyle bill, whose content he proposed in one of his columns in early 1944. Congress passed formal legislation in May 1944 to provide American soldiers with a 50 percent increase in pay for their combat service. The U.S. Army also adopted Pyle&#x27;s suggestion of providing overseas service bars on uniforms to designate six months of overseas service.

Pyle&#x27;s papers and other archival materials related to his life and work are held at the Lilly Library, Indiana University Bloomington; the Ernie Pyle World War II Museum, Dana, Indiana; the Indiana State Museum; and the Wisconsin State Historical Society. The Indiana Historical Society acquired Ernie and Jerry Pyle&#x27;s personal library from IU Bloomington&#x27;s School of Journalism in 2005 and moved the collection to its headquarters in Indianapolis.

==Tributes==

* The employees of Boeing-Wichita, through the 7th War Loan Drive, paid for and built a Boeing B-29 Superfortress named the &quot;Ernie Pyle,&quot; which was dedicated on May 1, 1945. Initially assigned to the Second Air Force at Kearney Air Force Base, the B-29 named in Pyle&#x27;s honor, Serial Number 44-70118, was sent to the Twentieth Air Force, Pacific Theater of Operations, on May 27, 1945. The plane was ferried to the Pacific theater by a crew under the command of Lieutenants Howard F. Lippincott and Robert H. Silver. The nose art was removed when the aircraft reached its intended operations base in the Pacific because the base commander thought it would become a prime target of the Japanese. The &quot;Ernie Pyle&quot; survived the war and was returned to the United States on October 22, 1945. It was stored at Pyote AAF, Texas, and disposed of as surplus on March 25, 1953.
*Shortly after his death, on Friday, April 27, 1945, the United States Maritime Commission announced (PR 2247) that a troop ship would be named after him SS Ernie Pyle. It was launched by Babette Johnson, his niece, in June 1945. It was used to transport refugees from Europe.

==Pyle historic sites==

* In 1947, the Albuquerque City Council accepted Pyle&#x27;s last home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a memorial to the late war correspondent. Since 1948 the former residence, known as the Ernie Pyle Library, has served as the first branch of the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System. The library branch houses a small collection of adult and children&#x27;s books, as well as Pyle memorabilia and archives. The Ernie Pyle House/Library was designated as a National Historic Landmark on September 20, 2006.
* The Ernie Pyle World War II Museum (Pyle&#x27;s restored birthplace) includes a farmhouse that was moved from its original location to Dana, Indiana. The museum, which is open to the public, became a state historic site in July 1976; however, it is no longer part of the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites system. Its present-day owners and operators are the Friends of Ernie Pyle. The museum&#x27;s visitor center, constructed from two World War II-era Quonset huts features displays, mostly of Pyle&#x27;s wartime career.

<text>The Nikon F camera, introduced in April 1959, was Nikon&#x27;s first SLR camera. It was one of the most advanced cameras of its day. Although many of the concepts had already been introduced elsewhere, it was revolutionary in that it was the first to combine them all in one camera. It was produced until October 1973 and was replaced by the Nikon F2. Aspects of its design remain in all of Nikon&#x27;s subsequent SLR cameras, through the current Nikon F6 film and Nikon D6 digital models (which still share its Nikon F-mount for lenses). The &quot;F&quot; in Nikon F was selected from the term &quot;re-f-lex&quot;, since the pronunciation of the first letter &quot;R&quot; is not available in many Asian languages. That tradition was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras decades later.

Specially modified Nikon F cameras were used in space in the early 1970s aboard the Skylab space station.

==History==

The Nikon F was the first 35 mm SLR system to be widely adopted by professional photographers, especially photojournalists covering the Vietnam War, as well as for use by NASA astronauts.

It was originally priced at US$186 with 50 mm f/2 lens; in November 1963 the US price was $233 for the body with a standard prism plus $90 for a 50 mm f/2 lens or $155 for a 50 mm f/1.4.

A combination of design elements made the Nikon F successful. It had interchangeable prisms and focusing screens; the camera had a depth-of-field preview button; the mirror had lock-up capability; it had a large bayonet mount and a large lens release button; a single-stroke ratcheted film advance lever; a titanium-foil focal plane shutter; various types of flash synchronization; a rapid rewind lever; a fully removable back. It was well-made, durable, and adhered closely to the successful design scheme of the Nikon rangefinder cameras. The camera was the first to use the F-mount bayonet lens mount system, which is still used as of 2024. Lead designer of the Nikon F was Yusaku Kamekura, the man behind the 1964 Summer Olympics logo.

The Nikon F evolved from a rangefinder camera, the Nikon SP. The prototype model, in particular, was an SP with a mirror box, pentaprism and larger lens mount grafted on.

The Nikon F revolutionized the photographic market, stealing the thunder of German manufacturers Leica and Zeiss. The F had a reputation for being extremely resilient to damage or mechanical failure, becoming known as &quot;the hockey puck.&quot;

In some markets, the camera was marketed as a &quot;Nikkor F&quot; due to trademark conflicts. In Germany, &quot;Nikon&quot; was seen as too similar to the Zeiss Ikon camera line. Nikkor F cameras have become collector&#x27;s items.

The Nikon F was succeeded in 1972 by the Nikon F2 series after a production total of 862,600 bodies. Subsequent &quot;single-digit&quot; F cameras continued as the top of Nikon&#x27;s professional line of film SLRs, through the Nikon F6 introduced in 2004. Since the introduction of the digital Nikon D1 in 1999, Nikon has continued to reserve single-digit model numbers for top-of-the-line cameras.

==Design==

The F was a modular system camera, with various assemblies such as viewfinders, focusing screens, and motor drives for 36-exposure and 250-exposure film cassettes. Third parties manufactured other film backs, such as two Speed Magny film backs—one using Polaroid 100 (later 600) type pack films, and another designed for 4x5 film accessories including Polaroid&#x27;s own 4x5 instant film back. Each of these assemblies could be fitted and removed, allowing the camera to adapt to almost any task. The F36 motor drive, one of the first popular motor drives for SLR cameras, was capable of firing up to 4 frames per second with the mirror locked up or 3 frames per second with full reflex viewing maintained.

===Lenses===
The Nikon F had a wide range of lenses, covering 21 mm to 1000 mm focal length by 1962. Nikon was among the first companies to manufacture Catadioptric system lens designs, combining mirrors and lenses to make more-compact lenses with longer focal lengths.

===Viewfinders===
The first Nikon F Photomic viewfinder, delivered since 1962, had an independent photocell. Then Nikon introduced the Photomic T (superseded by the Photomic Tn), which featured through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The final metering prism for the Nikon F, the Photomic FTn, introduced in 1968, provided 60% center-weighted TTL, which became the standard metering pattern for Nikon cameras for decades afterwards. Additional viewfinders included a waist-level viewer, a 6 power magnifying finder, and an &quot;action finder&quot; with a larger viewable area through which one could see the entire frame while wearing goggles and/or a helmet.

===Focusing screens===
Selection of G1/G2/G3/G4 and H1/H2/H3/H4 should be determined by the specific lens being used, but the following general observations can be made:
* G1 / H1: Use with focal lengths ≤ 50 mm for slower lenses (maximum aperture ≥ )
* G2 / H2: Use with focal lengths ≤ 200 mm
* G3 / H3: Use with focal lengths ≥ 180 mm
* G4 / H4: Use with focal lengths ≥ 600 mm

<text>The Norwegian Forest Cat ( or ), less commonly referred to simply as the Norwegian Forest, is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe. This landrace breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed&#x27;s ancestors may have been a landrace breed of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora.

During World War II, the Norwegian Forest Cat was nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club&#x27;s breeding program increased the cat&#x27;s number. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and France.

It is a large breed with a strong body, similar to the Siberian and Maine Coon cat breeds, with long legs, a bushy tail, and a sturdy body. It is very good at climbing, partly because of its strong claws.

==History and adaption==

The Norwegian Forest Cat is adapted to survive Norway&#x27;s cold weather. Its ancestors may include cold-adapted black and white British Shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain some time after 1000 AD by the Vikings, and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders around the 14th century. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest breed. The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed.

Norse legends refer to the as a &quot;mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage.&quot; Since the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very adept climber, author Claire Bessant believes that the folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern Norwegian Forest breed. The name &quot;Norse&quot; is used by some breeders and fancier organizations for the modern breed.

The ancestors of the Norwegian Forest Cat most likely served as ships&#x27; cats (mousers) on Viking ships. The original landrace lived in the Norwegian forests for many centuries, but were later prized for their hunting skills and were used on Norwegian farms, until they were discovered in the early 20th century by cat enthusiasts.

In 1938 the first organization devoted to the breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat Club, was formed in Oslo, Norway. The club&#x27;s movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing to cross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest Cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program. 

In the 1950s, King Olav V declared them the official cat of Norway. Since the cat did not leave Norway until the 1970s, it was not registered as a breed in the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), the pan-European federation of cat registries, until Carl-Fredrik Nordane, a Norwegian cat fancier, took notice of the breed, and made efforts to register it. The breed was registered in Europe by the 1970s, and in the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1994. In 1978, it was recognized in Sweden as an official breed, In 1989, they were accepted as a breed in the United Kingdom by the Norwegian Cat Club of Britain.

The Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway and Sweden. Since 2003, it has been the fifth most popular cat breed in France, where there are about 400 to 500 births per year.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Norwegian Forest Cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. Adult females weigh ; males, . The breed has a long, sturdy body; long legs; and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, thick, glossy, water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest, and head. The undercoat appears as a ruff. The profile of the breed is generally straight. Their water-resistant coat with a dense undercoat developed to help the cat survive in the harsh Scandinavian climate.

The head is long with an overall shape similar to an equilateral triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head is considered to be a defect. The eyes are almond-shaped and oblique, and may be of any color. The ears are large, wide at the base, and high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of the lynx.

All coat colors and divisions in the traditional, sepia, and mink categories are accepted. Since the cats have very strong claws, they are very good climbers, and can even climb rocks.

===Behaviour===

They are friendly, intelligent, and generally good with people. The Norwegian Forest Cat has a lot of energy. Fanciers note that these cats produce a variety of high-pitched &quot;chirping&quot; vocalizations.

Norwegian Forest Cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life.

A study comparing Norwegian Forest Cat kittens to Siamese, Oriental, and Abyssinian kittens found the Norwegian Forest Cat to be more likely to explore and try to escape.

==Health==
In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed&#x27;s Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. Glycogen storage disease type IV due to branching enzyme deficiency was found in an inbred family of Norwegian Forest Cats. 

The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.

An analysis of pedigree records of cats in England found evidence of hereditary cardiomyopathy. A 2005 study looking at 17 cases of eosinophilic granuloma complex in Norwegian Forest Cats found a link between the cats after reviewing pedigree analysis, suggesting a hereditary nature of the condition.

<doc id="173758" wikidata="Q7231" url="?curid=173758" title="Rosa Luxemburg">
<text>Rosa Luxemburg ( ; ; ; born Rozalia Luksenburg; 5 March 1871 – 15 January 1919) was a Polish and naturalised-German revolutionary and Marxist theorist. She was a key figure of the socialist movements in Poland and Germany in the early 20th century.

Born to a Jewish family in Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, Luxemburg became involved in radical politics at an early age via the Proletariat party, and fled to Switzerland in 1889. She helped found the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party in 1893, and in 1897 was awarded a Doctor of Law in political economy from the University of Zurich, becoming one of the first women in Europe to do so. In 1898, Luxemburg moved to Germany, and soon became a leading figure in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Her political activities included teaching Marxist economics at the party&#x27;s training school. Luxemburg was imprisoned several times, including in Germany and in Congress Poland during the 1905 Revolution.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the SPD supported the German war effort, after which Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht founded the anti-war Spartacus League, which became affiliated with the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) in 1917; the pair were arrested in 1916 for their activities and imprisoned until the November Revolution of 1918, after which they co-founded the Communist Party of Germany. In January 1919, Luxemburg participated in the Spartacist uprising in Berlin, an attempted communist overthrow of the SPD-ruled Weimar Republic. The ill-prepared uprising (considered a blunder by Luxemburg herself) was crushed by the government, which deployed anti-communist paramilitaries that captured, tortured, and summarily executed Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

Luxemburg argued against the reformist road to socialism advocated by Eduard Bernstein, defending the necessity of a socialist revolution. She also criticised Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s concept of a vanguard party, instead advocating spontaneous action by the workers, and in particular the mass strike, which she viewed as the supreme form of revolutionary action. In her analyses of the Russian Revolution of 1917, she criticised the controlling character of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Luxemburg saw the collapse of capitalism as inevitable after it had spread to all areas of the world through the process of imperialism.

Due to her pointed criticism of both the Leninist and the social democratic schools of Marxism, Luxemburg has always had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the political left. Nonetheless, she and Liebknecht were extensively idolised as martyrs by the ruling party of East Germany after World War II. Despite her strong ties and sentimentality towards Polish culture, opposition from the Polish Socialist Party and later criticism from Stalinists have made her a controversial historical figure in the political discourse of the Third Polish Republic.

== Life ==
=== Poland ===
==== Origins ====
Róża&#x27;s father Edward was born in Zamość on 17 December 1830, the eldest of ten siblings and heir to his father&#x27;s timber business. Edward Eliasz Luxenburg lost his mother at the age of 18. He met his wife Lina Löwenstein through his stepmother Amalia, who was Lina&#x27;s older sister. Lina and Amalia were daughters of the Rabbi of Meseritz, Isaak Ozer Löwenstein, and their brother was the reform Rabbi Isachar Dov Berish (Bernhard) Löwenstein of Lemberg. Lina and Edward married around 1853 and lived together in Zamość, where Edward worked with his father. Edward was a leading member of the Reform Jewish community in the city. When the January Uprising broke out, Edward delivered weapons to Polish partisans and organised fundraisers for the insurrection. After the fall of the uprising he became a target of the tsarist police and was forced into hiding in Warsaw, leaving his family behind in Zamość. During the 1860s and 1870s, Edward moved frequently and experienced financial difficulties; eventually the rest of the family, including two-year-old Rosa, joined him in Warsaw in 1873.

Róża Luksemburg, actual birth name Rozalia Luksenburg, was born on 5 March 1871 at 45 Ogrodowa Street (now 7a Kościuszko Street) in Zamość. The Luxemburg family were Polish Jews living in the Russian sector of Poland. She was the fifth and youngest child of Edward Eliasz Luxemburg and Lina Löwenstein. Her father Edward, like his father Abraham, supported the Jewish Reform movement. Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in liberal ideas to her while her mother was religious and well-read with books kept at home. As noted, the family moved to Warsaw in 1873. Polish and German were spoken at home; Luxemburg also learned Russian. Although over time she became fluent in Russian and French, Polish remained Róża&#x27;s first language with German also spoken fluently. Rosa was considered intelligent early on, writing letters to her family and impressing her relatives with recitals of poetry, including the Polish classic &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;.

Rory Castle writes: From her grandfather and father [Rosa] inherited the belief that she was a Pole first and a Jew second, with her emotional connection to the Polish language and culture and her passionate opposition to Tsarism being of central importance. Although her parents were religious, they did not consider themselves to be Jewish by nationality, rather &#x27;Poles of the Mosaic persuasion&#x27;. Castle also points out that more recent research into the Luxemburg family and her early years shows that Rosa Luxemburg gained a lot more from her family than has previously been understood by her biographers ... [not only] in terms of her education, financial support and assistance during her frequent incarcerations, but also in terms of her identity and politics. Her family was a closely knitted support network, even when its members were spread out across Europe. This solid foundation, which supported and encouraged her at every step, gave Luxemburg the intellectual and personal confidence to go out and attempt to change the world. From her private correspondence it is especially clear that she remained very close with her family throughout the years, despite being separated by borders and spread out across countries.

==== Education and activism ====
In 1884, she enrolled at an all-girls&#x27; gymnasium (secondary school) in Warsaw, which she attended until 1887. The Second Women&#x27;s Gymnasium was a school that only rarely accepted Polish applicants and acceptance of Jewish children was even more exceptional. At this school, the children were only permitted to speak Russian., but Róża attended secret circles in which the works of Polish poets and writers were studied; officially this was forbidden due to the policy of Russification against Poles being pursued in the Russian Empire at the time. Nonetheless, from 1886, Luxemburg belonged to the illegal Polish left-wing Proletariat Party which had been founded in 1882, anticipating the left-wing Russian parties by twenty years. She began political activities by organising a general strike, which ended with four of the Proletariat Party leaders being put to death and the party being disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her matura (secondary school examinations).

 Wanted by the tsarist police because of her activity in Proletariat, Rosa hid in the countryside, working as private tutor at a . In order to escape detention, she fled to Switzerland through the &quot;green border&quot; in 1889. She attended the University of Zurich (as did the socialists Anatoly Lunacharsky and Leo Jogiches), where she studied philosophy, history, politics, economics, zoology and mathematics. She specialised in (political science), economic and stock exchange crises, and the Middle Ages. The University of Zurich awarded her a Doctor of Law degree and her doctoral dissertation &quot;The Industrial Development of Poland&quot; () was officially presented in the spring of 1897 and was published by Duncker and Humblot in Leipzig in 1898. An oddity in Zurich, she was one of the first women in the world, and of course the first Polish woman, to be awarded a doctorate in political economy 

In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and Julian Marchlewski (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper (&quot;The Workers&#x27; Cause&quot;) which opposed the nationalist policies of the Polish Socialist Party. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against capitalism, not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of self-determination provoked a philosophic disagreement with Vladimir Lenin. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party, after merging in Congress Poland&#x27;s and Lithuania&#x27;s social democratic organisations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL) and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organiser. She remained sentimental towards Polish culture, her favourite poet was Adam Mickiewicz, and she vehemently opposed the Germanisation of Poles in the Prussian Partition; in 1900 she published a brochure against this in Poznań. Earlier, in 1893, she also wrote against the Russification of Poles by the Russian Empire&#x27;s absolutist government.

==== 1905 revolution ====

After the 1905 revolution broke out, against the advice of her Polish and German comrades, Luxemburg left for Warsaw. If she were to be recognised, tsarist authorities would imprison her, but the October/November political strike, part of the upheaval in Russia with particularly active elements in Congress Poland, convinced Róża that she was needed in Warsaw instead of Berlin. She arrived in Warsaw on 30 December, thanks to her German friend Anna Matschke&#x27;s passport, and joined Jogiches, who had returned to Warsaw a month earlier, also on a false passport. They lived together in a pension at the corner of Jasna and Świętokrzyska streets from where they wrote for the SDKPiL&#x27;s illegally published paper (The Red Banner). Luxemburg was one of the first writers to notice the 1905 revolution&#x27;s potential for democratisation within the Russian Empire. In the years 1905-1906 alone, she wrote in Polish and German over 100 articles, brochures, appeals, texts, and speeches about the revolution. Although only the closest friends and comrades of Jogiches and Luxemburg knew of their return to the country, the Okhrana, thanks to a mole recruited by the tsarist authorities within the senior SDKPiL leadership, came to arrest them on 4 March 1906.

They held her prisoner first at the ratusz jail, then at Pawiak prison and later at the Tenth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel. Luxemburg continued to write for the SDKPiL in secret while in custody, with her works smuggled out of the compound. After two officers of the Okhrana were bribed by her relatives, a temporary release on bail was secured for her on 28 June 1906 for health reasons until the court trial. In early August from Saint Petersburg, she left for Kuokkala, which was then part of the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. From there, in the middle of September, she managed to secretly flee to Germany.

=== Germany ===
Luxemburg wanted to move to Germany to be at the centre of the party struggle, but she had no way of obtaining permission to remain there indefinitely. Thus, in April 1897 she married the son of an old friend, Gustav Lübeck, in order to gain German citizenship. They never lived together, and they formally divorced five years later. She returned briefly to Paris, then moved permanently to Berlin to support Eduard Bernstein&#x27;s constitutional reform movement. Luxemburg disliked the middle-class culture of Berlin, which she considered stifling to revolution. She further disliked Prussian men and resented what she saw as the grip of urban capitalism on social democracy. In the Social Democratic Party of Germany&#x27;s women&#x27;s section, she met Clara Zetkin, whom she made a lifelong friend. Between 1907 and his conscription in 1915, she was involved in a love affair with Clara&#x27;s younger son, Kostja Zetkin, to which approximately 600 surviving letters (now mostly published) bear testimony. Luxemburg was a member of the uncompromising left wing of the SPD. Their clear position was that the objectives of liberation for the industrial working class and all minorities could be achieved by revolution only.

As Irene Gammel writes in a review of the English translation of the book in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;: &quot;The three decades covered by the 230 letters in this collection provide the context for her major contributions as a political activist, socialist theorist and writer.&quot; Her reputation was challenged and, for some, tarnished by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s cynicism in &quot;Questions Concerning the History of Bolshevism&quot;. In his rewriting of Russian events, he placed the blame for the theory of permanent revolution on Luxemburg&#x27;s shoulders, with faint praise for her attacks on Karl Kautsky which she commenced in 1910.

According to Gammel, In her controversial tome of 1913, &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot;, as well as through her work as a co-founder of the radical Spartacus League, Luxemburg helped to shape Germany&#x27;s young democracy by advancing an international, rather than a nationalist, outlook. This farsightedness partly explains her remarkable popularity as a socialist icon and its continued resonance in movies, novels and memorials dedicated to her life and oeuvre. Gammel also notes that for Luxemburg &quot;the revolution was a way of life&quot; but that the letters also challenge the stereotype of &quot;Red Rosa&quot; as a ruthless fighter. However, &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot; sparked angry accusations from the Communist Party of Germany. In 1923, Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow denounced the work as &quot;errors&quot;, a derivative work of economic miscalculation known as &quot;spontaneity&quot;.

Luxemburg continued to identify as Polish and disliked living in Germany, which she saw as a political necessity, making various negative comments about German culture during the German Empire in her private correspondence written in Polish. At the same time, she loved the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and showed an appreciation for German literature. However, she also preferred Switzerland to Berlin and greatly missed the Polish language and culture.

==== Before World War I ====
When Luxemburg moved to Germany in May 1898, she had settled in Berlin. She was active there in the left wing of the SPD in which she sharply defined the border between the views of her faction and the revisionism theory of Eduard Bernstein. She attacked him in her brochure &quot;Social Reform or Revolution?&quot;, released in September 1898. Luxemburg&#x27;s rhetorical skill made her a leading spokesperson in denouncing the SPD&#x27;s reformist parliamentary course. She argued that the critical difference between capital and labour could only be countered if the proletariat assumed power and effected revolutionary changes in methods of production. She wanted the revisionists ousted from the SPD. That did not occur, but Kautsky&#x27;s leadership retained a Marxist influence on its programme.

From 1900, Luxemburg published analyses of contemporary European socio-economic problems in newspapers. Foreseeing war, she vigorously attacked what she saw as German militarism and imperialism. Luxemburg wanted a general strike to rouse the workers to solidarity and prevent the coming war. However, the SPD leaders refused and she broke with Kautsky in 1910. Between 1904 and 1906, she was imprisoned for her political activities on three occasions in Barnimstrasse women&#x27;s prison. In 1907, she went to the Russian Social Democrats&#x27; Fifth Party Day in London, where she met Lenin. At the socialist Second International Congress in Stuttgart, her resolution demanding that all European workers&#x27; parties should unite in attempting to stop the war was accepted.

Luxemburg taught Marxism and economics at the SPD&#x27;s Berlin training centre. Her former student Friedrich Ebert became the SPD leader and later the Weimar Republic&#x27;s first President. In 1912, Luxemburg was the SPD representative at the European Socialists&#x27; congresses. With French socialist Jean Jaurès, Luxemburg argued that European workers&#x27; parties should organise a general strike when war broke out. In 1913, she told a large meeting: &quot;If they think we are going to lift the weapons of murder against our French and other brethren, then we shall shout: &#x27;We will not do it! However, when nationalist crises in the Balkans erupted into violence and then the war in 1914, there was no general strike and the SPD majority supported the war as did the French Socialists. The Reichstag unanimously agreed to finance the war. The SPD voted in favour of that and agreed to a truce () with the Imperial government and promised that SPD-controlled labour unions would refrain from strike action for the duration of the war. This led Luxemburg to contemplate suicide as the revisionism she had fought since 1899 had triumphed.

In response, Luxemburg organised anti-war demonstrations in Frankfurt, calling for conscientious objection to military conscription and the refusal of soldiers to follow orders. On that account, she was imprisoned for a year for &quot;inciting to disobedience against the authorities&#x27; law and order.&quot;

==== During the war ====
In August 1914, Luxemburg, along with Karl Liebknecht, Clara Zetkin, and Franz Mehring, founded the group (&quot;The International&quot;), which became the Spartacus League in January 1916. They wrote and distributed what had been made illegal anti-war pamphlets pseudonymously signed Spartacus, after the slave-liberating Thracian gladiator who led a slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Luxemburg&#x27;s pseudonym was Junius, after Lucius Junius Brutus, the founder of the Roman Republic. The Spartacus League vehemently rejected the SPD&#x27;s support in the Reichstag for funding the war and urged Germany&#x27;s labor unions to declare an anti-war general strike. As a result, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were imprisoned in June 1916 for two and a half years. During imprisonment, Luxemburg was twice relocated, first to Posen (now Poznań), then to Breslau (now Wrocław).

Luxemburg continued to write and friends secretly smuggled out and illegally published her articles. Among them was &quot;Die Russische Revolution&quot;, criticising the Bolsheviks and accusing them of seeking to impose a totalitarian single party state upon the Soviet Union. In that context, she wrote her famous pronouncement on freedom of expression, &quot;Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters,&quot; () in criticising Lenin and the Russian Revolution. She added: &quot;The public life of countries with limited freedom is so poverty-stricken, so miserable, so rigid, so unfruitful, precisely because, through the exclusion of democracy, it cuts off the living sources of all spiritual riches and progress.&quot; Another article written in April 1915 when in prison and published and distributed illegally in June 1916 originally under the pseudonym &quot;Junius&quot; was (&quot;The Crisis of Social Democracy&quot;), also known as the or &quot;The Junius Pamphlet&quot;.

In 1917, the Spartacus League was affiliated with the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), founded by Hugo Haase and made up of anti-war former SPD members.

According to Russian historian Edvard Radzinsky, &quot;The Bolshevik envoy in Berlin began secretly purchasing arms for the German revolutionaries. A little while ago the Germans had been assisting revolution in Russia. Now Lenin was reciprocating. The Bolshevik embassy became the headquarters of the German revolution.&quot;

In November 1918, the USPD and the SPD initially shared power in the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, the revolutionary government set up following the 9 November abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II. This took place during the early days of the German Revolution that began with the Kiel mutiny, which sparked the establishment of workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils across most of Germany to put an end to World War I and to the monarchy. The SPD leaders tried to prevent the establishment of a (council republic) like the soviets of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 by pushing for early elections to a constituent assembly to determine Germany&#x27;s future form of government. Only a small minority of the councils supported a soviet-style system.

==== German Revolution of 1918–1919 ====

Luxemburg was freed from prison in Breslau on 8 November 1918, three days before the armistice of 11 November 1918. One day later, Karl Liebknecht, who had also been freed from prison, proclaimed the Free Socialist Republic () in Berlin. He and Luxemburg reorganised the Spartacus League and founded &quot;The Red Flag&quot; () newspaper, demanding amnesty for all political prisoners and the abolition of capital punishment in the essay &quot;Against Capital Punishment&quot;. On 14 December 1918, they published the new programme of the Spartacus League.

Following the arrival of Soviet emissary and military advisor Karl Radek, between 29 and 31 December 1918 a joint congress of the League, independent socialists and the International Communists of Germany (IKD) took place with Radek&#x27;s involvement. During the conference, Luxemburg continued to denounce the Red Terror and censorship in the Soviet Russia. She also accused both Lenin and the Bolsheviks of having police state aspirations. She further expressed shame that her former colleague and friend, Felix Dzerzhinsky, had agreed to head the Cheka, the then Soviet security agency, and asked Radek to convey her opinions about all these matters to the Politburo in Moscow.

This same conference, however, ultimately led to the foundation on 1 January 1919 of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) under the leadership of Liebknecht and Luxemburg. Luxemburg supported the new KPD&#x27;s participation in the Weimar National Assembly that founded the Weimar Republic, but she was out-voted and the KPD boycotted the elections.

Leading up to the January 1919 struggle for power with the SPD, the improvised Spartacist Uprising began in Berlin. Luxemburg spoke at the founding conference of the German Communist Party on 31 December 1918:

The progress of large-scale capitalist development during seventy years has brought us so far that today we can seriously set about destroying capitalism once and for all. No, still more; today we are not only in a position to perform this task, its performance is not only a duty toward the proletariat, but its solution offers the only means of saving human society from destruction.

Like Liebknecht, Luxemburg supported the violent attempt. In a complete reversal of her previous demands for &quot;unrestricted freedom of the press&quot;, &quot;The Red Flag&quot; called for the KPD to violently occupy the editorial offices of the anti-Spartacist press and later, all other positions of power. On 8 January, Luxemburg&#x27;s &quot;Red Flag&quot; printed a public statement by her, in which she called for revolutionary violence and no negotiations with the revolution&#x27;s &quot;mortal enemies&quot;, the SPD-led Republican Government of Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann.

== Execution and aftermath ==
In response to the uprising, Luxemburg&#x27;s former student, German Chancellor and SPD leader Ebert ordered the to suppress the Soviet-backed attempt at revolution, which was successfully crushed by 11 January 1919. Meanwhile, Luxemburg&#x27;s &quot;Red Flag&quot; falsely claimed that the rebellion was spreading across Germany.

Luxemburg and Liebknecht were taken prisoner in Berlin on 15 January 1919 by the Guards Cavalry Rifle Division of the (). The unit&#x27;s officer commanding, Captain Waldemar Pabst, with Lieutenant Horst von Pflugk-Harttung, questioned them under torture and then, following an alleged telephone call to Defense Minister Gustav Noske, issued orders to summarily execute both prisoners. Luxemburg was first knocked down with a rifle butt by Private Otto Runge, then shot once, in the back of the head, either by Lieutenant Kurt Vogel or by Lieutenant Hermann Souchon. Her body was then dumped in Berlin&#x27;s Landwehr Canal. In what the militantly antisemitic Pabst later claimed was a gesture of grudging respect for his non-Jewish ancestry, Liebknecht was executed by firing squad in the Tiergarten. His body, without any identification, was then dumped outside the railings of the Berlin Zoo. According to historian Robert Service:

The symbolism was intentional. The enemies of the Spartacists looked on them as being less than human. Dogs were being given a dog&#x27;s death. The Spartacists leaders met their ends with courage and dignity. Of their leaders, only Thalheimer and Levi survived, and it was Levi who delivered the funeral oration for Luxemburg on 2 February. Radek went into hiding.Luxemburg&#x27;s last known words written on the evening of her execution were about her belief in the masses and what she saw as the inevitability of a triumphant revolution:

The executions of Luxemburg and Liebknecht were the beginning of a new wave of paramilitary warfare in Berlin and across Germany. Thousands of members of the KPD as well as other revolutionaries and civilians were killed, often as collateral damage. Finally, the People&#x27;s Navy Division () and workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; unions, which had moved to the political far left, were disbanded.

The last part of the German Revolution saw many instances of armed violence and strike action throughout Germany. Significant strikes occurred in Berlin, the Bremen Soviet Republic, Saxony, Saxe-Gotha, Hamburg, the Rhinelands and the Ruhr region. Last to strike was the Bavarian Soviet Republic which was suppressed on 2 May 1919.

More than four months after the murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht, on 1 June 1919, Luxemburg&#x27;s corpse was found and identified after an autopsy at the Charité hospital in Berlin.

For his part in Luxemburg&#x27;s murder, Private Runge was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment for attempted manslaughter and Lieutenant Vogel to two years and four months for failing to report a corpse. However, Vogel escaped after a brief period in custody, with the help of Wilhelm Canaris. Captain Pabst and Lieutenant Souchon were never prosecuted. The Nazis later compensated Private Runge for having been jailed, but he died in Berlin in NKVD custody after the end of World War II. The Nazis also later merged the into the SA. In an interview with German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1962 and again in his memoirs, Captain Pabst alleged that Defence Minister Noske and Weimar Republic Chancellor Ebert had both covertly approved of his actions, but his account has not been confirmed, nor has his case been examined by the Parliament or Courts of Germany. In 1993, Gietinger&#x27;s research on his access to the previously restricted papers of Pabst, held at the Federal Military Archives, found him as central to the planning of the murder of Luxemburg and the shielding of those who had acted under his orders from subsequent criminal prosecution.

According to Russian historian Edvard Radzinsky, in retaliation for Liebknecht and Luxemburg&#x27;s murder, Soviet Premier Lenin issued orders to Gregory Zinoviev for the immediate arrest and summary execution of four Grand Dukes from the recently deposed House of Romanov, all of whom were uncles of the Nicholas II, the last Tsar. Despite the pleas of Maxim Gorky on behalf of one of the condemned, the known progressive and noted historian Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich, all four men including Mikhailovich were shot on 30 January 1919 at the Peter and Paul Fortress in Petrograd. The other three men executed were the Grand Duke George Mikhailovich, the Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, and the Grand Duke Dmitri Constantinovich.

=== Reactions ===
Shortly after Luxemburg&#x27;s death, her fame was alluded to by Grigory Zinoviev at the Petrograd Soviet on 18 January 1919, supporting her assessment of Bolshevism.

Lenin posthumously praised Luxemburg as an &quot;eagle&quot; of the working class, and stated that her work would serve as an example to other socialist revolutionaries.

Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky also publicly mourned Luxemburg&#x27;s and Liebknecht&#x27;s deaths. In later years, Trotsky frequently defended Luxemburg, claiming that Joseph Stalin had vilified her. In the article &quot;Hands Off Rosa Luxemburg!&quot;, Trotsky criticised Stalin for this despite what Trotsky perceived as Luxemburg&#x27;s theoretical errors, writing: &quot;Yes, Stalin has sufficient cause to hate Rosa Luxemburg. But all the more imperious therefore becomes our duty to shield Rosa&#x27;s memory from Stalin&#x27;s calumny that has been caught by the hired functionaries of both hemispheres, and to pass on this truly beautiful, heroic, and tragic image to the young generations of the proletariat in all its grandeur and inspirational force.&quot;

===Annual demonstration===
In the city of Berlin a , shortened to , is organised annually in the month of January around the date of their death. This demonstration takes place on the second weekend of the month in Berlin-Friedrichshain, starting near the Frankfurter Tor and then to their graves in the central cemetery Friedrichsfelde, also known as the (Socialist Memorial). In East Germany, the event was widely considered to be a mere show for Socialist Unity Party of Germany politicians and celebrities, which was broadcast live on state television.

During the Peaceful Revolution, the annual parade in East Berlin honoring the deaths of Liebknecht and Luxemburg was used by East German dissidents as part of their campaign, &quot;to raise their unwelcome demands at embarrassing moments for the regime.&quot; On 17 January 1988, as Premier Erich Honecker was reviewing the parade, a group of dissidents broke through the ranks of the Free German Youth and unfurled banners bearing an infamous dictum from &quot;Die Russische Revolution&quot;, Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s book-length denunciation of both authoritarian socialism and censorship in the Soviet Union, &quot;Freiheit ist immer Freiheit der Andersdenkenden&quot; (&quot;Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters&quot;). Viewers of the parade were then subjected to the ironic sight of East German Stasi agents beating and arresting anyone who brandished the slogan.

In January 2019, the German left-wing parties commemorated the 100th anniversary of the summary execution of Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

== Thought ==
=== Revolutionary Socialist Democracy and Criticism of the October Revolution ===
Luxemburg initially professed a commitment to democracy and the necessity of revolution. Luxemburg&#x27;s idea of democracy which Stanley Aronowitz calls &quot;&quot;generalized&quot; democracy in an unarticulated form&quot; represents Luxemburg&#x27;s greatest break with &quot;mainstream communism&quot; since it effectively diminishes the role of the communist party, but it, similar to the views of Karl Marx, states that the working class must &quot;emancipate&quot; themselves without a higher authority.

Early on, Luxemburg attacked the totalitarian tendencies present in the Russian Revolution claiming that without democratic institutions and protections, &quot;life dies out in every public institution&quot; and further claimed that such a lack of freedoms would lead to a &quot;dictatorship of a handful of politicians&quot;.

Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of &quot;justice&quot; but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effectiveness vanishes when &quot;freedom&quot; becomes a special privilege. [...] But socialist democracy is not something which begins only in the promised land after the foundations of socialist economy are created; it does not come as some sort of Christmas present for the worthy people who, in the interim, have loyally supported a handful of socialist dictators. Socialist democracy begins simultaneously with the beginnings of the destruction of class rule and of the construction of socialism.

In an article published just before the October Revolution, Luxemburg characterised the Russian February Revolution of 1917 as a &quot;revolution of the proletariat&quot; and said that the &quot;liberal bourgeoisie&quot; were pushed to movement by the display of &quot;proletarian power&quot;. The task of the Russian proletariat, she explained, was now to end the &quot;imperialist&quot; world war in addition to struggling against the &quot;imperialist bourgeoisie&quot;. The world war made Russia ripe for a socialist revolution. Therefore, &quot;the German proletariat are also [...] posed a question of honour, and a very fateful question&quot;. However, in several works, including an essay written from jail and published posthumously by her last companion Paul Levi (publication of which precipitated his expulsion from the Third International), titled &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot;, Luxemburg sharply criticised some Bolshevik policies such as their suppression of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918 following the October Revolution and their policy of supporting the purported right of all national peoples to self-determination. According to Luxemburg, the Bolsheviks&#x27; strategic mistakes created tremendous dangers for the Revolution such as its bureaucratisation. She wrote that the shortcomings of the October Revolution reflected a period of &quot;complete failure of the international proletariat&quot;. Luxemburg further stated:The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the German, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies.Bolshevik theorists such as Lenin and Trotsky responded to this criticism by arguing that Luxemburg&#x27;s notions were classical Marxist ones, but they could not be applied to Russia of 1917. They stated that the lessons of actual experience such as the confrontation with the bourgeois parties had forced them to revise the Marxian strategy. As part of this argument, it was pointed out that after Luxemburg herself got out of jail, she was also forced to confront the National Assembly in Germany, a step they compared with their own conflict with the Russian Constituent Assembly.

Following her observation of the October Revolution, Luxemburg claimed that it was the &quot;historic responsibility&quot; of the German workers to carry out a revolution for themselves and thereby end the war. When the German Revolution began, Luxemburg immediately started to agitate for a social revolution which she claimed would mitigate the negative consequences of the Bolshevik revolution.

According to Aronowitz, the vagueness of &quot;Luxemburgian&quot; democracy is one reason for its initial difficulty in gaining widespread support. Luxemburg herself clarified her position on democracy in her writings regarding the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union.

=== &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot; ===
&quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot; was the only work Luxemburg officially published on economics during her lifetime. In the polemic, she argued that capitalism needs to constantly expand into non-capitalist areas in order to access new supply sources, markets for surplus value and reservoirs of labour. According to Luxemburg, Marx had made an error in in that the proletariat could not afford to buy the commodities they produced and by his own criteria it was impossible for capitalists to make a profit in a closed-capitalist system since the demand for commodities would be too low and therefore much of the value of commodities could not be transformed into money. According to Luxemburg, capitalists sought to realise profits through offloading surplus commodities onto non-capitalist economies, hence the phenomenon of imperialism as capitalist states sought to dominate weaker economies. However, this was leading to the destruction of non-capitalist economies as they were increasingly absorbed into the capitalist system. With the destruction of non-capitalist economies, there would be no more markets to offload surplus commodities onto and capitalism would break down.

&quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot; was harshly criticised by both Marxist and non-Marxist economists on the grounds that her logic was circular in proclaiming the impossibility of realising profits in a close-capitalist system and that her underconsumptionist theory was too crude. Her conclusion that the limits of the capitalist system drive it to imperialism and war led Luxemburg to a lifetime of campaigning against militarism and colonialism.

=== &quot;Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation&quot; ===
The &quot;Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation&quot; was the central feature of Luxemburg&#x27;s political philosophy, wherein spontaneity is a grassroots approach to organising a class struggle, and organisation is a top-down or vanguardist approach to organising a class struggle. She argued that spontaneity and organisation are not separable or separate activities, but different moments of one political process as one does not exist without the other. These beliefs arose from her view that class struggle evolves from an elementary, spontaneous state to a democratic organisation. Luxemburg developed the &quot;Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation&quot; under the influence of mass strikes in Europe, especially the Russian Revolution of 1905. Unlike the social democratic orthodoxy of the Second International, she regarded the organisation of a socialist movement as a temporary means to worker enlightenment:

Social democracy is simply the embodiment of the modern proletariat&#x27;s class struggle, a struggle which is driven by a consciousness of its own historic consequences. The masses are in reality their own leaders, dialectically creating their own development process. The more that social democracy develops, grows, and becomes stronger, the more the enlightened masses of workers will take their own destinies, the leadership of their movement, and the determination of its direction into their own hands.

She insisted on setting the class struggle in its historical context, writing &quot;the modern proletarian class does not carry out its struggle according to a plan set out in some book or theory; the modern workers&#x27; struggle is a part of history, a part of social progress.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Poland===
In spite of her own Polish nationality and strong ties to Polish culture, her opposition to the independence of the Second Polish Republic and later criticism from Stalinists have made her a controversial historical figure in the modern Third Polish Republic&#x27;s political discourse.

During the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, a manufacturing facility of electric lamps in the Wola district of Warsaw (Polish capital and the place where Luxemburg was raised and grew up), was established and named as the (pl). After the transformation and change of regime, the factory was privatised in 1991 and then split up into four different companies; the factory buildings were sold by 1993 and fell into disuse in 1994.

A street in Szprotawa used to be named after Luxemburg (&quot;&quot;) until it was changed to &quot;ulica Różana&quot; (Rose street) in September 2018. Many other streets and locations in Poland either used to be or still are named after her, such as those in Warsaw, Gliwice, Będzin, Szprotawa, Lublin, Polkowice, Łódź, etc.

Efforts to put up commemorative plaques in her memory have taken place in a number of Polish cities, such as Poznań and her birthplace Zamość. A 45-minute-long sightseeing tour around areas associated with the life of the Polish revolutionary was organised in Warsaw in 2019, where a statue of her by Alfred Jesion was also put on display at the Warsaw Citadel as part of the Gallery of Polish Sculpture of the 1950s.

The commemorative plaque in Poznań, on the building where she lived in during May 1903, was vandalised with paint in 2013. An official petition was started in 2021 to name a square in Wrocław after her, but the local government rejected the proposal.

==== Herbarium ====
Luxemburg collected plant specimens from 1913 up to her death. She had a lifelong interest in botany and the natural world. This was especially true when she was isolated during her imprisonments, during which time working on the herbarium was critical to her wellbeing, an escape from a harsh reality, and a connection to the outside world. Holger Politt, one of the editors of the 2016 book, &quot;Rosa Luxemburg: Herbarium,&quot; said, &quot;Collecting and identifying plants helped her hold on to sanity. It was therapeutic to her; she couldn&#x27;t have coped without it&quot;.

Luxemburg&#x27;s personal herbarium, which comprises 18 notebooks, is placed at the Archive of Modern Records in Warsaw, Poland. It contains 377 different plant specimens that she collected or that were sent to her by friends and acquaintances, and are mostly of cultivated and common species. Each sheet features one to three different plants, which are identified using German and Latin species names and family names, and often also have handwritten botanical descriptions, as well as the collection location and date. Luxemburg collected the plants from a range of places, including the Alps, the Sudety Mountains, and also in or near the prisons in Berlin, Wronki, and Wrocław (Breslau). The latter include plants from the prison vegetable garden or prison flowerbeds which she herself had planted. 

===Germany===


In 1919, Bertolt Brecht wrote the poetic memorial &quot;Epitaph&quot; honouring Luxemburg and Kurt Weill set it to music in &quot;The Berlin Requiem&quot; in 1928:

&lt;poem&gt;Red Rosa now has vanished too,
And where she lies is hid from view.
She told the poor what life&#x27;s about,
And so the rich have rubbed her out.
May she rest in peace.&lt;/poem&gt;

The famous Monument to Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, originally named Monument to the November Revolution () which was designed by pioneering modernist and later Bauhaus director Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and built in 1926 in Berlin-Lichtenberg and destroyed in 1935. The memorial took the form of a suprematist composition of brick masses. Van der Rohe said: &quot;As most of these people [Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and other fallen heroes of the Revolution] were shot in front of a brick wall, a brick wall would be what I would build as a monument&quot;. The commission came about through the offices of Eduard Fuchs, who showed a proposal featuring Doric columns and medallions of Liebknecht and Luxemburg, prompting Mies&#x27; laughter and the comment &quot;That would be a good monument for a banker&quot;. The monument was destroyed by the Nazis after they took power.

In 1951, Liebknecht and Luxemburg were honoured with symbolic graves at the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () in the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

In the former East Germany and East Berlin, various places were named for Luxemburg by the East German communist party. These include the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and a U-Bahn station which were located in East Berlin during the Cold War.

An engraving on the nearby pavement reads &quot;Ich war, ich bin, ich werde sein&quot; (&quot;I was, I am, I will be&quot;). The Volksbühne (People&#x27;s Theatre) is also on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz.

Following the 1989 Peaceful Revolution and German reunification, CDU delegates on the Berlin city council recommended renaming all streets and squares honoring Marx, August Bebel, Liebknecht, Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin. In a rare moment of agreement, both PDS and SPD delegates balked at this and the battle became so heated that an independent commission was appointed to advise on the question. The commission ultimately recommended the compromise, &quot;that Communists who had died too soon to help bring Weimar down, or the GDR up, should not be purged&quot;. For this reason, both streets and squares in the former East Berlin continue to bear Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s name.

Dresden has a street and streetcar stop named after Luxemburg. The names remained unchanged after German reunification.

At the edge of the Tiergarten on the which runs between the southern bank of the Landwehr Canal and the bordering (Zoological Garden), a memorial has been installed by a private initiative. On the memorial, the name Rosa Luxemburg appears in raised capital letters, marking the spot where her body was thrown into the canal by troops.

The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution notes that idolisation of Luxemburg and Liebknecht remains an important tradition of far-left extremism in the Federal Republic of Germany. During the Cold War, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were idolised as martyrs by East Germany&#x27;s ruling Party and continue to be idolised by its successor party: The Left.

Feminists, Trotskyists, and other leftists in Germany especially show interest in Luxemburg&#x27;s ideas. Distinguished modern Marxist thinkers such as Ernest Mandel, who has even been characterised as Luxemburgist, have seen Luxemburg&#x27;s thought as a corrective to traditional revolutionary theory. In 2002, ten thousand people marched in Berlin for Luxemburg and Liebknecht and another 90,000 people laid carnations on their graves.

===Russia===
Opponents and critics of the far-left have often had a very different interpretation of Luxemburg&#x27;s murder. Russian historian Edvard Radzinsky has gone on the record as a very harsh critic of the Soviet Government for spending so much money abroad to fund the efforts of those like Liebknecht and Luxemburg to covertly destabilise and overthrow the Weimar Republic and other Western Governments. In the Soviet Union during the same time, mass starvation was taking place as a result of the Russian Civil War (including the Russian famine of 1921). According to Radzinsky, &quot;Starving Moscow was feeding the Communist Parties of the whole world. People were swollen with hunger, but never mind, the world revolution was at hand.&quot; Conversely, Stalin denounced Luxemburg posthumously in 1932 as a &quot;Trotskyist&quot;.

As Alexander Kerensky and the former Tsarist officer corps had fatally failed to unite for long enough to stop Lenin from seizing power in 1917, anti-communist Russian refugees living in the Weimar Republic occasionally expressed envy for the success of the SPD and the in temporarily setting aside their political differences, even for just long enough to defeat the Spartacus Uprising, which was seen as an attempted German equivalent to the Bolshevik Revolution. In a 1922 conversation with Count Harry Kessler, one such refugee lamented:

Infamous, that fifteen thousand Russian officers should have let themselves be slaughtered by the Revolution without raising a hand in self-defense! Why didn&#x27;t they act like the Germans, who killed Rosa Luxemburg in such a way that not even a smell of her has remained?

== In popular culture and literature ==
Due to Luxemburg&#x27;s importance in the development of theories of Marxist humanist thought, the role of democracy and mass action to achieve international socialism as a pioneering advocate of workers&#x27; rights, gender equality, and as a martyr to her cause, she has become a minor iconic figure, celebrated with references in popular culture. The night of his death, Rainer Werner Fassbinder was working on a script about Luxemberg. 

* Bulgarian writer Hristo Smirnenski, who praised communist ideology, wrote the poem &quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot; in tribute to Luxemburg in 1923.
* &quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot; (1986), directed by Margarethe von Trotta. The film, which stars Barbara Sukowa as Luxemburg, was the winner of the Best Actress Award at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.
* In 1992, the Quebec painter Jean-Paul Riopelle realised a fresco composed of thirty paintings entitled &quot;Tribute to Rosa Luxemburg&quot;. It is on permanent display at the National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec in Quebec City.
* Luxemburg influences the lives of several characters in William T. Vollmann&#x27;s 2005 historical fiction &quot;Europe Central&quot;.
* &quot;Rosa&quot;, a novel by Jonathan Rabb (2005), gives a fictional account of the events leading to Luxemburg&#x27;s murder.
* The heroine in the novel &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1979) by Nadine Gordimer is named Rosa Burger in homage to Luxemburg.
* Simon Louvish&#x27;s 1994 alternate history novel &quot;The Resurrections&quot; (from Four Walls Eight Windows, a revision of &quot;Resurrections from the Dustbin of History: A Political Fantasy&quot;), had Luxemburg and Liebknecht avoid death, their revolution becoming reality in 1923 when a failed Reichstag coup by Gregor and Otto Strasser (plotted by the Black Reichswehr&#x27;s Bruno Ernst Buchrucker) killed Gustav Stresemann, Wilhelm Cuno, Hans von Seeckt and 17 deputies followed by the Marxists creating a Berlin commune whose squads executed the Strassers and any Nazis not already in exile, the Reichswehr then disarming the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and accepting a German Soviet Republic&#x27;s legitimacy, with Liebknecht as Minister of the Interior.
* A song on the 1997 album &quot;Morskaya&quot; of the Russian rock band Mumiy Troll is titled in her honor.-
* Luxemburg appears in &quot;Karl and Rosa&quot;, a novel by Alfred Döblin.-
* &quot;Red Rosa&quot; is a graphic novelisation by Kate Evans.
* German artist Max Beckmann in his post WWI lithograph Das Martyrium depicts Luxemburg&#x27;s murder as a sexual assault, her clothes torn, her underwear revealed, one soldier fondling her left breast; another smirking while aiming his rifle butt at her right breast, the hotel manager holding her legs apart. There is no historical justification for this depiction. Tellini in Woman&#x27;s Art Journal 1997 argues both the sensationalising aspect of graphic sexual assault as well as the artist&#x27;s misogyny were probably responsible.
* The feminist magazine &quot;Lux&quot;, which began in 2020, says that it is named for Rosa Luxemburg, describing her as &quot;one of the most creative minds to remake the socialist tradition&quot;.
* Canadian author Kyo Maclear wrote in her 2017 book &quot;Birds, Art, Life: A year of observation&quot; about the pleasure that Luxemburg took when she was in prison from hearing and seeing birds, based on Luxemburg&#x27;s letters from prison.

== Body identification controversy ==
On 29 May 2009, &quot;Spiegel Online&quot;, the internet branch of the news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, reported the recently considered possibility that someone else&#x27;s remains had mistakenly been identified as Luxemburg&#x27;s and buried as hers.

The forensic pathologist Michael Tsokos, head of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences at the Berlin Charité, discovered a preserved corpse lacking head, feet, or hands in the cellar of the Charité&#x27;s medical history museum. He found the corpse&#x27;s autopsy report suspicious and decided to perform a CT scan on the remains. The body showed signs of having been waterlogged at some point and the scans showed that it was the body of a woman of 40–50 years of age who suffered from osteoarthritis and had legs of differing length, as Luxemburg had. A laboratory in Kiel also tested the corpse using radiocarbon dating techniques and confirmed that it dated from the same period as Luxemburg&#x27;s murder.

The original autopsy, performed on 13 June 1919 on the body that was eventually buried at Friedrichsfelde, showed certain inconsistencies that supported Tsokos&#x27; hypothesis. The autopsy explicitly noted an absence of hip damage and stated that there was no evidence that the legs were of different lengths. Additionally, the autopsy showed no traces on the upper skull of the two blows by rifle butt inflicted upon Luxemburg. Finally, while the 1919 examiners noted a hole in the corpse&#x27;s head between the left eye and ear, they did not find an exit wound or the presence of a bullet within the skull.

Assistant pathologist Paul Fraenckel appeared to doubt at the time that the corpse he had examined was Luxemburg&#x27;s and in a signed addendum distanced himself from his colleague&#x27;s conclusions. This addendum and the inconsistencies between the autopsy report and the known facts persuaded Tsokos to examine the remains more closely. According to eyewitnesses, when Luxemburg&#x27;s body was thrown into the canal, weights were wired to her ankles and wrists. These could have slowly severed her extremities in the months her corpse spent in the water which would explain the missing hands and feet issue.

Tsokos realised that DNA testing was the best way to confirm or deny the identity of the body as Luxemburg&#x27;s. His team had initially hoped to find traces of the DNA on old postage stamps that Luxemburg had licked, but it transpired that Luxemburg had never done this, preferring to moisten stamps with a damp cloth. The examiners decided to look for a surviving blood relative and in July 2009 the German Sunday newspaper &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; reported that a great-niece of Luxemburg had been locateda 79-year-old woman named Irene Borde. She donated strands of her hair for DNA comparison.

In December 2009, Berlin authorities seized the corpse to perform an autopsy before burying it in Luxemburg&#x27;s grave. The Berlin Public Prosecutor&#x27;s office announced in late December 2009 that while there were indications that the corpse was Luxemburg&#x27;s, there was not enough evidence to provide conclusive proof. In particular, DNA extracted from the hair of Luxemburg&#x27;s niece did not match that belonging to the cadaver. Tsokos had earlier said that the chances of a match were only 40%. The remains were to be buried at an undisclosed location while testing was to continue on tissue samples.

<text>Sunglasses or sun glasses (informally called shades or sunnies; more names below) are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses).

Since the 1930s, sunglasses have been a popular fashion accessory, especially on the beach.

The American Optometric Association recommends wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation (UV) whenever a person is in the sunlight to protect the eyes from UV and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems. Their usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures, such as LASIK, and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas, when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK. Dark glasses that do not block UV radiation can be more damaging to the eyes than not wearing eye protection at all, because they tend to open the pupil and allow more UV rays into the eye.

== History ==

=== First precursors ===

Since the 13th century and until the spread of contemporary UV-shielding spectacles against snowblindness, Inuit made and wore snow goggles of flattened walrus or caribou ivory with narrow slits to look through to block almost all of the harmful reflected rays of the sun. In many different forms and with many different materials, the indigenous peoples of North America and northern Asia crafted highly efficient equipment to protect their eyes against the damaging effects of strong sunlight in icy circumstances.

=== Other precursors ===
Pliny the Elder claimed that the Roman emperor Nero liked to watch gladiator fights using cut emeralds. These, however, appear to have worked rather like mirrors.

The first sunglasses, made from flat panes of smoky quartz called &quot;Ai Tai,&quot; meaning &quot;dark clouds,&quot; which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare, were used in China in the 12th century or possibly earlier. Documents describe the use of such crystal sunglasses by judges in ancient Chinese courts to conceal their facial expressions while questioning witnesses.

In 1459, Nuno Fernandes made a request for a pair of spectacles to protect the eyes while horseriding in the snow against the glare coming from the snow, though no description of any actual spectacles is given.

King Louis XIV&#x27;s court watched the 1706 solar eclipse through a telescope with a smoky glass filter attached.

By the 18th century, tinted, mirror-like framed Murano glasses had been used as so-called &quot;gondola glasses&quot; (&quot;vetri da gondola&quot; and also &quot;da dama&quot;) by Venetian women and children, to shield their eyes from the glare from the water in the canals. The Doge and other well-off Venetians, such as possibly Goldoni, sported, in the late 18th century, so-called &quot;goldoni glasses,&quot; tinted pairs of spectacles with pieces of cloth as sun guards on the sides of the glasses.

James Ayscough began experimenting with tinted lenses in spectacles around 1752. These were not &quot;sunglasses&quot; as that term is now used; Ayscough believed that blue- or green-tinted glass could correct for specific vision impairments. Protection from the sun&#x27;s rays was not a concern for him.

One of the earliest surviving depictions of a person wearing sunglasses is one from 1772 of the scientist Antoine Lavoisier, who worked with amplified sunlight. By the 19th century, tinted spectacles were worn by railway travelers.

Popularly, it is claimed that yellow/amber and brown-tinted glasses had been used to alleviate symptoms of syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries, because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease, although no sources have been found that state prescription of such.

From the late 19th century, short references of sunglasses have been found in reports, such as one from 1866 by Walter Alden, who wrote of soldiers using, during the American Civil War (1861-1865), &quot;shell spectacles&quot; (&quot;verres de cocquille&quot;) to protect against sunlight on long marches, or by the British T. Longmore reporting in &quot;The Optical Manual&quot; (1885) of soldiers in Egypt being equipped with tinted glass &quot;eye protectors.&quot; By 1895, sunglasses were mentioned in advertisements, such as in &quot;The Sioux City Journal&quot;.

=== Modern developments ===
Jean-Marie-Théodore Fieuzal (1836-1888) was the first to argue for UV protection with (yellow) shaded glasses, and by 1899, Rodenstock GmbH produced possibly the first sunglasses intended for shielding eyes from UV light and not just glare.

In 1913, Crookes lenses were introduced, made from glass containing cerium, which completely blocked ultraviolet light. In the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among movie stars. Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk. By 1938, &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a &quot;new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S.&quot; It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937 but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes. At the same time, sunglasses started to be used as aids for pilots and even produced for the gaining aviation sector, eventually adding to sunglasses as cultural icons and to their popularity. Polarized sunglasses first became available in 1936 when Edwin H. Land began experimenting with making lenses with his patented Polaroid filter. In 1947, the Armorlite Company began producing lenses with CR-39 resin.

As of 2008, Xiamen, China was the world&#x27;s largest producer of sunglasses with its port exporting 120 million pairs each year.

== Functions ==
=== Visual clarity and comfort ===
Sunglasses can improve visual comfort and visual clarity by protecting the eye from glare.

The lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces, such as water. They allow wearers to see into water when only surface glare would otherwise be seen, and eliminate glare from a road surface when driving into the sun.

=== Protection ===

Sunglasses offer protection against excessive exposure to light, including its visible and invisible components.

The most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as photokeratitis (snow blindness), cataracts, pterygium, and various forms of eye cancer. Medical experts advise the public on the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV; for adequate protection, experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99% or more of UVA and UVB light, with wavelengths up to 400 nm. Sunglasses that meet this requirement are often labeled as &quot;UV400&quot;. This is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the European Union (see below), which requires that 95% of the radiation up to only 380 nm must be reflected or filtered out. Sunglasses are not sufficient to protect the eyes against permanent harm from looking directly at the Sun, even during a solar eclipse. Special eyewear known as solar viewers are required for direct viewing of the sun. This type of eyewear can filter out UV radiation harmful to the eyes.

More recently, high-energy visible light (HEV) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration; before, debates had already existed as to whether &quot;blue blocking&quot; or amber tinted lenses may have a protective effect. Some manufacturers already design glasses to block blue light; the insurance company Suva, which covers most Swiss employees, asked eye experts around Charlotte Remé (ETH Zürich) to develop norms for blue blocking, leading to a recommended minimum of 95% of the blue light. Sunglasses are especially important for children, as their ocular lenses are thought to transmit far more HEV light than adults (lenses &quot;yellow&quot; with age).

There has been some speculation that sunglasses actually promote skin cancer. This is due to the eyes being tricked into producing less melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the body.

==== Assessing protection ====
The only way to assess the protection of sunglasses is to have the lenses measured, either by the manufacturer or by a properly equipped optician. Several standards for sunglasses (see below) allow a general classification of the UV protection (but not the blue light protection), and manufacturers often indicate simply that the sunglasses meet the requirements of a specific standard rather than publish the exact figures.

One &quot;visible&quot; quality test for sunglasses is their fit. The lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little &quot;stray light&quot; can reach the eye from their sides, or from above or below, but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses. To protect against &quot;stray light&quot; from the sides, the lenses should fit close enough to the temples or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders. Another test is for lenses said to be polarising: having two such lenses, they should block all light when after each other with one pair turned 90°.

It is not possible to &quot;see&quot; the protection that sunglasses offer. Dark lenses do not automatically filter out more harmful UV radiation and blue light than light lenses. Inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses (or wearing no sunglasses at all) because they provoke the pupil to open wider. As a result, more unfiltered radiation enters the eye. Depending on the manufacturing technology, sufficiently protective lenses can block much or little light, resulting in dark or light lenses. The lens color is not a guarantee either. Lenses of various colors can offer sufficient (or insufficient) UV protection. Regarding blue light, the color gives at least a first indication: Blue blocking lenses are commonly yellow or brown, whereas blue or gray lenses cannot offer the necessary blue light protection. However, not every yellow or brown lens blocks sufficient blue light. In rare cases, lenses can filter out too much blue light (i.e., 100%), which affects color vision and can be dangerous in traffic when colored signals are not properly recognized.

High prices cannot guarantee sufficient protection as no correlation between high prices and increased UV protection has been demonstrated. A 1995 study reported that &quot;Expensive brands and polarizing sunglasses do not guarantee optimal UVA protection.&quot; The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission has also reported that &quot;[c]onsumers cannot rely on price as an indicator of quality&quot;. One survey even found that a $6.95 pair of generic glasses offered slightly better protection than expensive Salvatore Ferragamo shades.

=== Further functions ===
While non-tinted glasses are very rarely worn without the practical purpose of correcting eyesight or protecting one&#x27;s eyes, sunglasses have become popular for several further reasons, and are sometimes worn even indoors or at night.

Sunglasses can be worn to hide one&#x27;s eyes. They can make eye contact impossible, which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer&#x27;s detachment, which is considered desirable (or &quot;cool&quot;) in some circles. Eye contact can be avoided even more effectively by using mirrored sunglasses. Sunglasses can also be used to hide emotions; this can range from hiding blinking to hiding weeping and its resulting red eyes. In all cases, hiding one&#x27;s eyes has implications for nonverbal communication; this is useful in poker, and many professional poker players wear heavily tinted glasses indoors while playing, so that it is more difficult for opponents to read tells which involve eye movement and thus gain an advantage.

Fashion trends can be another reason for wearing sunglasses, particularly designer sunglasses from high-end fashion brands. Sunglasses of particular shapes may be in vogue as a fashion accessory. The relevance of sunglasses within the fashion industry has included prominent fashion editors&#x27; reviews of annual trends in sunglasses as well as runway fashion shows featuring sunglasses as a primary or secondary component of a look. Fashion trends can also draw on the &quot;cool&quot; image of sunglasses and association with a particular lifestyle, especially the close connection between sunglasses and beach life. In some cases, this connection serves as the core concept behind an entire brand.

People may also wear sunglasses to hide an abnormal appearance of their eyes. This can be true for people with severe visual impairment, such as the blind, who may wear sunglasses to avoid making others uncomfortable. The assumption is that it may be more comfortable for another person not to see the hidden eyes rather than see abnormal eyes or eyes which seem to look in the wrong direction. People may also wear sunglasses to hide dilated or contracted pupils, bloodshot eyes due to drug use, chronic dark circles or crow&#x27;s feet, recent physical abuse (such as a black eye), exophthalmos (bulging eyes), a cataract, or eyes which jerk uncontrollably (nystagmus).

Lawbreakers have been known to wear sunglasses during or after committing a crime as an aid to hiding their identities.

== Standards ==
The international standard for sunglasses is ISO 12312. It is divided into three parts, the first of them, about &quot;Sunglasses for general use&quot;, was first published in 2013 and then with a new edition in 2022. The second, about &quot;Filters for direct observation of the sun&quot;, was published in 2015 and the third &quot;Sunglasses for running, cycling and similar active lifestyles&quot; in 2022.

=== Australia ===
Australia introduced the world&#x27;s first national standards for sunglasses in 1971. They were updated and expanded in 1990 to &quot;AS 1067.1-1990 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles&quot; (incl. Part 1 Safety Requirements and Part 2 Performance Requirements), and replaced in 2003 by AS/NZS 1067:2003 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles. This aligned the Australian standard to the European standard opening the European market to Australian-made sunglasses. The Australian Standard AS-NZS 1067 defines standards for sunglasses with respect both to UVA (wavelengths between 315 nm and 400 nm) and UVB transmittance. The five ratings for transmittance (filter) under this standard are based on the amount of absorbed light, 0 to 4, with &quot;0&quot; providing some protection from UV radiation and sunglare, and &quot;4&quot; indicating a high level of protection, but not to be worn when driving.

=== Europe ===
The European standard EN 1836:2005 has four transmittance ratings: &quot;0&quot; for insufficient UV protection, &quot;2&quot; for sufficient UHV protection, &quot;6&quot; for good UHV protection and &quot;7&quot; for &quot;full&quot; UHVV protection, meaning that no more than 5% of the 380 nm rays are transmitted. Products which fulfill the standard receive a CE mark. There is no European rating for transmittance protection for radiation of up to 400 nm (&quot;UV400&quot;), as required in other countries (incl. the United States) and recommended by experts. The current European standard, EN 1836:2005, was preceded by the older standards EN 166:1995 (Personal eye protection – Specifications), EN167: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Optical test methods), and EN168: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Non-optical test methods), which in 2002 were republished as a revised standard under the name of EN 1836:1997 (which included two amendments). In addition to filtering, the standard also lists requirements for minimum robustness, labeling, materials (non-toxic for skin contact and not combustible) and lack of protrusions (to avoid harm when wearing them). Categories for the European standard, which are required to be marked on the frame:
* Category 0 – 80%-100% transmission – for fashion, indoor use, or cloudy days
* Category 1 – 43%-80% transmission – low sun exposure
* Category 2 – 18%-43% transmission – medium sun exposure
* Category 3 – 8%-18% transmission – strong brightness, light reflected of water or snow
* Category 4 – 3%-8% transmission – intense sunshine for high mountains, glaciers; not for use when driving or on the road.

=== United States ===
Sunglasses sold in the United States are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and are required to conform to safety standards. The U.S. standard is ANSI Z80.3-2001, which includes three transmittance categories. According to this standard, the lens should have a UVB (280 to 315 nm) transmittance of no more than one per cent and a UVA (315 to 380 nm) transmittance of no more than 0.3 times the visual light transmittance. The ANSI Z87.1-2003 standard includes requirements for basic impact and high impact protection. In the basic impact test, a 1 in (2.54 cm) steel ball is dropped on the lens from a height of 50 in (127 cm). In the high velocity test, a 1/4 in (6.35 mm) steel ball is shot at the lens at 150 ft/s (45.72 m/s). To pass both tests, no part of the lens may touch the eye.

== Special-use ==

=== Land vehicle driving ===
 When driving a vehicle, particularly at high speed, dazzling glare caused by a low Sun, or by lights reflecting off snow, puddles, other vehicles, or even the front of the vehicle, can be lethal. Sunglasses can protect against glare when driving. Two criteria must be met: vision must be clear, and the glasses must let sufficient light get to the eyes for the driving conditions. General-purpose sunglasses may be too dark, or otherwise unsuitable for driving.

The Automobile Association and the Federation of Manufacturing Opticians have produced guidance for selection of sunglasses for driving. Variable tint or photochromic lenses increase their optical density when exposed to UV light, reverting to their clear state when the UV brightness decreases. Car windscreens filter out UV light, slowing and limiting the reaction of the lenses and making them unsuitable for driving as they could become too dark or too light for the conditions. Some manufacturers produce special photochromic lenses that adapt to the varying light conditions when driving.

Lenses of fixed tint are graded according to the optical density of the tint; in the UK sunglasses must be labelled and show the filter category number. Lenses with light transmission less than 75% are unsuitable for night driving, and lenses with light transmission less than 8% (category 4) are unsuitable for driving at any time; they should by UK law be labelled &#x27;Not suitable for driving and road use&#x27;. Yellow tinted lenses are also not recommended for night use. Due to the light levels within the car, filter category 2 lenses which transmit between 18% and 43% of light are recommended for daytime driving. Polarised lenses normally have a fixed tint, and can reduce reflected glare more than non-polarised lenses of the same density, particularly on wet roads.

Graduated lenses, with the bottom part lighter than the top, can make it easier to see the controls within the car. All sunglasses should be marked as meeting the standard for the region where sold. An anti-reflection coating is recommended, and a hard coating to protect the lenses from scratches. Sunglasses with deep side arms can block side, or peripheral, vision and are not recommended for driving.

Even though some of these glasses are proven good enough for driving at night, it is strongly recommended not to do so, due to the changes in a wide variety of light intensities, especially while using yellow tinted protection glasses. The main purpose of these glasses are to protect the wearer from dust and smog particles entering into the eyes while driving at high speeds.

=== Aircraft piloting ===
Many of the criteria for sunglasses worn when piloting an aircraft are similar to those for land vehicles. Protection against UV radiation is more important, as its intensity increases with altitude. Polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised, intentionally or unintentionally, showing Moiré patterns on looking through the windscreen; and some LCDs used by instruments emit polarised light, and can dim or disappear when the pilot turns to look at them.

=== Sports ===
Like corrective glasses, sunglasses have to meet special requirements when worn for sports. They need shatterproof and impact-resistant lenses; a strap or other fixing is typically used to keep glasses in place during sporting activities, and they have a nose cushion.

For water sports, so-called water sunglasses (also: surf goggles or water eyewear) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water, such as the surf or whitewater. In addition to the features for sports glasses, water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off, and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging.

Mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection, because sunlight (including ultraviolet radiation) is more intense in higher altitudes, and snow and ice reflect additional light. Popular glasses for this use are a type called glacier glasses or glacier goggles. They typically have very dark round lenses and leather blinders at the sides, which protect the eyes by blocking the Sun&#x27;s rays around the edges of the lenses. What are Glacier Glasses?

Special shaded visors were once allowed in American football; Jim McMahon, quarterback for the Chicago Bears and San Diego Chargers, famously used a sun visor during his professional football career due to a childhood eye injury and almost always wears dark sunglasses when not wearing a football helmet. Darkened visors now require a doctor&#x27;s prescription at most levels of the game, mainly because concussion protocol requires officials to look a player in the eye, something made difficult by tinted visors.

=== Space ===
 Special protection is required for space travel because the sunlight is far more intense and harmful than on Earth, where it is always filtered through the atmosphere. Sun protection is needed against much higher UV radiation and even against harmful infrared radiation, both within and outside the spacecraft. Within the spacecraft, astronauts wear sunglasses with darker lenses and a thin protective gold coating. During space walks, the visor of the astronauts&#x27; helmets, which also has a thin gold coating for extra protection, functions as strong sunglasses. The frames of sunglasses and corrective glasses used in space must meet special requirements. They must be flexible and durable, and must fit firmly in zero-gravity. Reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits: once inside the spacesuit, slipped glasses cannot be touched to push them back into place, sometimes for up to ten hours. Frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles cannot become dislodged, then float and be inhaled. 90% of astronauts wear glasses in space, even if they do not require corrective glasses on Earth, because zero-gravity and pressure changes temporarily affect their vision.

The first sunglasses used in a Moon landing were the original pilot sunglasses produced by American Optical. In 1969 they were used aboard the &quot;Eagle&quot;, the Lunar Module of Apollo 11, the first crewed mission to land on the Moon. NASA research primarily by scientists James B. Stephens and Charles G. Miller at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) resulted in special lenses that protected against the light in space and during laser and welding work. The lenses used colored dyes and small particles of zinc oxide, which absorbs ultraviolet light and is also used in sunscreen lotions. The research was later broadened to further terrestrial applications, &quot;e.g.&quot;, deserts, mountains, and fluorescent-lighted offices, and the technology was commercially marketed by a U.S. company. Since 2002 NASA uses the frame of the designer model &quot;Titan Minimal Art&quot; of the Austrian company Silhouette, combined with specially dark lenses developed jointly by the company and &quot;the&quot; NASA optometrist Keith Manuel. The frame is very light at 1.8 grams, and does not have screws or hinges that could detach.

== Construction ==

=== Lens ===
 The color of the lens can vary depending on style, fashion, and purpose, but for general use, red, grey, green, or brown are recommended to avoid or minimize color distortion, which could affect safety when, for instance, driving a car or a school bus.
* Gray and green lenses are considered neutral because they maintain true colors.
* Brown lenses cause some color distortion, but also increase contrast.
* Turquoise lenses are good for medium and high light conditions, because they are good at enhancing contrast, but do not cause significant color distortion.
* Yellow is &quot;optimum for object definition, but creates a harsh visible light&quot;; amber &quot;allegedly makes distant objects appear more distinct, especially in snow or haze. These lenses are popular with skiers, hunters, boaters and pilots&quot;.
* Blue or purple lenses are popular with shooters as they increase the contrast of orange targets against green foliage or grass backdrops.
With the introduction of office computing, ergonomists may recommend mildly tinted glasses for use by display operators, in order to increase contrast.

While some blue blocking sunglasses (see above) are produced as regular sunglasses for exposure to bright sunlight, others—especially for macular degeneration patients—do not block light or other colors in order to function well in regular daylight and even dim sunlight. The latter allow the passage of enough light so normal evening activities can continue, while blocking the light that prevents production of the hormone melatonin. Blue-blocking tinted glasses, i.e. amber or yellow, are sometimes recommended to treat insomnia; they are worn in artificial lighting after dark, to reestablish the circadian rhythm and treat delayed sleep phase disorder.

Some models have polarized lenses, made of Polaroid polarized plastic sheeting, to reduce glare caused by light reflected from non-metallic surfaces such as water (see Brewster&#x27;s angle for how this works) as well as by polarized diffuse sky radiation (skylight). This can be especially useful to see beneath the surface of the water when fishing.

A mirrored coating can be applied to the lens. This mirrored coating deflects some of the light when it hits the lens so that it is not transmitted through the lens, making it useful in bright conditions; however, it does not necessarily reflect UV radiation as well. Mirrored coatings can be made any color by the manufacturer for styling and fashion purposes. The color of the mirrored surface is irrelevant to the color of the lens. For example, a gray lens can have a blue mirror coating, and a brown lens can have a silver coating. Sunglasses of this type are sometimes called mirrorshades. A mirror coating does not get hot in sunlight and it prevents scattering of rays in the lens bulk.

Sunglass lenses are made of either glass, plastic, or SR-91. Plastic lenses are typically made from acrylic, polycarbonate, CR-39 or polyurethane. Glass lenses have the best optical clarity and scratch resistance, but are heavier than plastic lenses. They can also shatter or break on impact. Plastic lenses are lighter and shatter-resistant, but are more prone to scratching. Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection. CR-39 is the most common plastic lens, due to low weight, high scratch resistance, and low transparency for ultraviolet and infrared radiation. SR-91 is a proprietary material that was introduced by Kaenon Polarized in 2001. Kaenon&#x27;s lens formulation was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing. Additionally, it was the first to combine this passing score with the highest marks for lens clarity. Jerry Garcia&#x27;s sunglasses had a which was &#x27;cutting edge&#x27; in 1995.

Any of the above features, color, polarization, gradation, mirroring, and materials, can be combined into the lens for a pair of sunglasses. Gradient glasses are darker at the top of the lens where the sky is viewed and transparent at the bottom. Corrective lenses or glasses can be manufactured with either tinting or darkened to serve as sunglasses. An alternative is to use the corrective glasses with a secondary lenses such as oversize sunglasses that fit over the regular glasses, clip-on lens that are placed in front of the glasses, and flip-up glasses which feature a dark lens that can be flipped up when not in use (see below). Photochromic lenses gradually darken when exposed to ultraviolet light.

=== Frames ===

 Frames are generally made of plastic, nylon, a metal or a metal alloy. Nylon frames are usually used in sports because they are lightweight and flexible. They are able to bend slightly and return to their original shape instead of breaking when pressure is applied to them. This flex can also help the glasses grip better on the wearer&#x27;s face. Metal frames are usually more rigid than nylon frames, thus they can be more easily damaged when the wearer participates in sport activities, but this is not to say that they cannot be used for such activities. Because metal frames are more rigid, some models have spring loaded hinges to help them grip the wearer&#x27;s face better. The end of the resting hook and the bridge over the nose can be textured or have rubber or plastic material to improve hold. The ends of the resting hook are usually curved so that they wrap around the ear; however, some models have straight resting hooks. Oakley, for example, has straight resting hooks on all their glasses, preferring to call them &quot;earstems&quot;.

In recent years, manufacturers have started to use various types of woods to make frames for sunglasses. Materials such as bamboo, ebony, rosewood, pear wood, walnut and zebrawood, are used making them non-toxic and nearly allergy free. The construction of a wooden frame involves laser-cutting from planks of wood. Already cut and ground to a uniform size, a buffing wheel is used to sand and buff every piece separately before they are assembled. The laser-cutouts of wood are then glued together by hand (mostly), layer on layer, to produce wooden frames. Some brands have experimented with recycled wood from objects like skateboards, whiskey barrels and baseball bats. Shwood, for example have experimented with these materials, they have even used recycled newspaper to manufacture frames.

Their final look can vary according to the color, type and finishing. With wooden sunglasses, various shades of brown, beige, burgundy or black are most common. Wooden sunglasses come in various designs and shapes. However, these sunglasses are usually more expensive than the conventional plastic, acetate or metal frames and require more care. They have been famously worn by the likes of Beyoncé, Snoop Dogg and Machine Gun Kelly.

Frames can be made to hold the lenses in several different ways. There are three common styles: full frame, half frame, and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around the lenses. Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach to the top of the lenses and on the side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses. There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses, and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side.

Some sports-optimized sunglasses have interchangeable lens options. Lenses can be easily removed and swapped for a different lens, usually of a different color. The purpose is to allow the wearer to easily change lenses when light conditions or activities change. The reasons are that the cost of a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses, and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses. It also allows easy replacement of a set of lenses if they are damaged. The most common type of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses has a single lens or shield that covers both eyes. Styles that use two lenses also exist, but are less common.

=== Nose bridge ===
Nose bridges provide support between the lens and the face. They also prevent pressure marks caused by the weight of the lens or frame on the cheeks. People with large noses may need a low nose bridge on their sunglasses. People with medium noses may need a low or medium nose bridge. People with small noses may need sunglasses with high nose bridges to allow clearance.

== Fashion (alphabetically) ==

The following types are not all mutually exclusive; glasses may be in Aviator style with mirrored lenses, for example.

=== Aviator ===

Aviator sunglasses feature oversize teardrop-shaped lenses and a thin metal frame with double or triple bridges. 
The design was introduced in 1936 by Bausch &amp; Lomb for issue to U.S. military aviators. As a fashion statement, &quot;aviator&quot; sunglasses are often made in mirrored, colored, and wrap-around styles.

The model first gained popularity in the 1940s when Douglas MacArthur was seen sporting a pair at the Pacific Theatre. However, it was in the late 1960s when the frames became widely used with the rise of the hippie counterculture, which preferred large metallic sunglasses. The brand became an icon of the 1970s, worn by Paul McCartney and Freddie Mercury among others, and was also used as prescription eyeglasses. Aviators&#x27; association with disco culture led to a decline in their popularity by 1980. The model saw more limited use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, aided by a 1982 product placement deal, featured most notably in &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;, with both films causing a 40% rise in 1986. Aviators became popular again around 2000, as the hippie movement experienced a brief revival, and was prominently featured in the MTV show &quot;Jackass&quot;.

=== Browline ===

Based on the eyeglass design of the same name, browline glasses have hard plastic or horn-rimmed arms and upper portions joined to a wire lower frame. A traditional, conservative style based on mid-20th century design, browlines were adapted into sunglasses form in the 1980s and rapidly became one of the most popular styles; it has ebbed and sprung in popularity in the decades that have followed.

=== Oversized ===
Oversized sunglasses, which were fashionable in the 1980s, are now often used for humorous purposes. They usually come in bright colors with colored lenses and can be purchased cheaply.

The singer Elton John sometimes wore oversized sunglasses on stage in the mid-1970s as part of his Captain Fantastic act.

Since the late 2000s, moderately oversized sunglasses have become a fashion trend. There are many variations, such as the &quot;Onassis&quot;, discussed below, and Dior white sunglasses.

Onassis glasses or &quot;Jackie O&#x27;s&quot; are very large sunglasses worn by women. This style of sunglasses is said to mimic the kind most famously worn by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 1960s. The glasses continue to be popular with women, and celebrities may use them, ostensibly to hide from paparazzi.

Oversized sunglasses, because of their larger frames and lenses, are useful for individuals who are trying to minimize the apparent size or arch of their nose. Oversized sunglasses also offer more protection from sunburn due to the larger areas of skin they cover, although sunblock should still be used.

=== Shutter shades ===

Shutter shades were invented in the late 1940s, became a fad in the early 1980s and have experienced a revival in the early-to-mid 2010s. Instead of tinted lenses, they decrease sun exposure by means of a set of parallel, horizontal shutters (like a small window shutter). Analogous to Inuit goggles (see above), the principle is not to filter light, but to decrease the amount of sun rays falling into the wearer&#x27;s eyes. To provide UV protection, shutter shades sometimes use lenses in addition to the shutters; if not, they provide very insufficient protection against ultraviolet radiation and blue light.

=== Teashades ===

&quot;Teashades&quot; (sometimes also called &quot;John Lennon glasses&quot;, &quot;Round Metal&quot;, or, occasionally, &quot;Granny Glasses&quot;) were a type of psychedelic art wire-rim sunglasses that were often worn, usually for purely aesthetic reasons, by members of the 1960s counterculture. Pop icons such as Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey, John Lennon, Jerry Garcia, Boy George, Liam Gallagher, Suggs, Ozzy Osbourne, Duckie (Jon Cryer) in &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; and Jodie Foster&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; all wore teashades. The original teashade design was made up of medium-sized, perfectly round lenses, supported by pads on the bridge of the nose and a thin wire frame. When teashades became popular in the late 1960s, they were often elaborated: Lenses were elaborately colored, mirrored, and produced in excessively large sizes, and with the wire earpieces exaggerated. A uniquely colored or darkened glass lens was usually preferred. Modern versions tend to have plastic lenses, as do many other sunglasses. Teashades are hard to find in shops today; however, they can still be found at many costume Web sites and in some countries.

The term has now fallen into disuse, although references can still be found in literature of the time. &quot;Teashades&quot; was also used to describe glasses worn to hide the effects of recreational drugs such as marijuana (conjunctival injection) or heroin (pupillary constriction) or just bloodshot eyes.

=== Wayfarer ===

The Ray-Ban Wayfarer is a (mostly) plastic-framed design for sunglasses produced by the Ray-Ban company. Introduced in 1952, the trapezoidal lenses are wider at the top than the bottom (inspired by the Browline eyeglasses popular at the time), and were famously worn by James Dean, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley, The Beatles and other actors and singers. The original frames were black; frames in many different colors were later introduced. There is often a silver piece on the corners as well. Since the early 1980s, makers have also developed variants of the model, most notably the Clubmaster model, introduced in 1982, essentially Browlines made of plastic.

These were mostly popular in the late 1950s and during the 1960s (being linked to the rock-and-roll/blues and Mod cultures), before plastic glasses were displaced by metallic rims popular among the counter-culture. In the late 1970s, the rise of New wave music, New Romanticism and the popularity of The Blues Brothers aside from 50s and 1960s nostalgia and the anti-disco backlash later on brought the model out of near-retirement, becoming the most sold model between 1980 and 1999 aided by a lucrative 1982 product placement deal, which put it on many movies and TV shows such as &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. 1980s nostalgia and the influence of the hipster subculture and the television series &quot;Mad Men&quot; boosted Wayfarers once again after a slump in the 1990s and 2000s, also aided by a 2000 redesign (New Wayfarer), surpassing Aviators since 2012.

=== Wrap-around ===
Wrap-arounds are a style of sunglasses characterized by being strongly curved, to wrap around the face. They may have a single curved semi-circular lens that covers both eyes and much of the same area of the face covered by protective goggles, usually with a minimal plastic frame and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepiece. Glasses described as wraparound may alternatively have two lenses, but again with a strongly curved frame.

These were first made in the 1960s as variants of the Aviator model, used by Yoko Ono and Clint Eastwood in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films. The modern variant surged in the mid-1980s, heavily based on the then-popular Wayfarer, but adapting it to a more futuristic look. As a backlash against 80s fashion occurred in the 1990s, wraparounds became one of the favorite frames of the decade.

== Variants ==

=== Clip-on ===

Clip-on glasses are a form of tinted glasses that can be clipped on to eyeglasses for protection from the sun. An alternative are flip-up glasses.

=== Gradient lenses ===
Gradient lenses go from a darker shade at the top to a lighter one at the bottom, so there will be more protection from sunlight the higher one looks through the lens, but the lower one looks through the lens, the less protection is offered. An advantage is that one can wear them indoors without fear of tripping over something and also allowing the user to see. Wearing sunglasses to nightclubs has become common in recent times, where the gradient lens comes in handy. Gradient lenses may also be advantageous for activities such as flying airplanes and driving automobiles, as they allow the operator a clear view of the instrument panel, low in his line of sight and usually hidden in shadow, while still reducing glare from the view out the windscreen. The Independent (London), has also referred to these style of sunglasses as the Murphy Lens.

Double gradient lenses are dark at the top, light in the middle and dark at the bottom.

Gradients should not be confused with bifocals and progressive lenses.

=== Flip-up ===
Flip-up sunglasses add the benefits of sunglasses to corrective eyeglasses, allowing the wearer to flip up the tinted lenses for indoor use. Alternatives include: clip-on glasses, and wrap around sunglasses that fit over the eyeglasses.

=== Mirrored ===

Mirrored lenses have a metallic, partially reflective coating on the outer surface combined with a tinted glass lens. Mirrored lenses of different colors can expand the range of fashion styles.

== Other names ==

There are various words referring to eyepieces with darkened lenses:

* Shades is a term used in North America.
* Glares is a term popular in India if the glass is dark.
* Glints is a term for glasses originating from the &quot;glint&quot; that is noticeable when somebody wearing glasses moves their head.
* Sun spectacles is a term used by some opticians.
* Spekkies is a term used predominantly in southern Australia.
* Sun specs (also sunspecs) is the shortened form of sun spectacles.
* Sunglass a monocle version.
* Sun-shades can also refer to the sun-shading eyepiece-type, although the term is not exclusive to these. Also in use is the derivative abbreviation, &quot;shades&quot;.
* Dark glasses (also preceded by pair of) — generic term in common usage.
* Sunnies is used in Australian, South African and New Zealand slang.
* Smoked spectacles usually refers to the darkened eyepieces worn by blind people.
* Solar shields Usually refers to models of sunglasses with large lenses.
* Stunna shades: Used as a slang term in the hyphy movement, usually referring to sunglasses with oversized lenses.
* Glecks is Scottish slang for glasses or sunglasses.
* Cooling glasses is a term used in Southern India (predominantly Kerala) and the Middle East for sunglasses.

== Producers ==
Most brands are produced by two producers:
* Luxottica Group (revenue €9 billion (2018))
* Safilo Group (revenue €1 billion (2018))

While other niche players are:

* Kaenon Polarized
* Maui Jim

<text>The Nebelung is a pedigree breed of domestic cat. Nebelungs have long bodies, wide-set green eyes, long and dense fur, and mild dispositions. The cat is related to the Russian Blue, but with longer, silkier hair, and is in fact sometimes called the Long-haired Russian Blue.

==Origin==
The American foundation of this cat breed was laid by the cats Siegfried (1984) and Brunhilde (1985). Cora Cobb, the owner of Siegfried and Brunhilde, was very impressed by the beauty of her blue-grey cats. Siegfried and Brunhilde looked like a Russian Blue but with a semi-long coat. To find out if it was possible to start a new breed with these cats, Cora got in touch with the geneticist of the American Cat Association. This geneticist, Solveig Pfleuger, said that the breed was best defined as semi-long haired Russian Blue. Supported by Pfleuger, Cobb wrote the breeding standard according to the Russian Blue, but with a difference: its coat length.

Russian Blue breeders from The International Cat Association (TICA), however, objected to this, and the breed standard was thus revised to describe a unique breed, resembling blue-grey cats that had been imported from Russia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

TICA was the first association to recognize the Nebelung and provides the breed standard. The goal of the Nebelung breeding program is to produce a blue cat with the same type as those early Russian imports and to combine this type with a thick shimmering coat of medium length. The body and tail are long, the ears large in proportion to the head, and the eyes range in color from yellowish green to green. Size is medium and the body well-muscled. The coat is medium long on the body and longer on the tail, with lighter colored guard hairs. The overall appearance is long, sturdy and well muscled. The name Nebelung is derived from the German translation for &quot;creature of the mist&quot; (see Nibelung).

==The Nebelung around the globe==
The Nebelung is a rather new breed, with breeders in America, Canada, Russia, and Europe. In addition to TICA, the Nebelung is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA), the World Cat Federation (WCF), Livre Officiel des Origines Félines (LOOF), Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), and independent cat associations in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. The breed&#x27;s availability is still rather limited.

==Characteristics==
=== Physical characteristics ===
Nebelung cats are characterized by a long, graceful neck and body, long legs, long or medium coat, and long tail. Slightly oval eyes are a vivid green color, or sometimes a yellow-green. Large, pointed ears sit atop a modified wedge-shaped head that is more pointed than rounded. The overall appearance is of a long, sturdy, well-muscled cat. The soft double coat feels fine and silky; it is gray in color and is tipped with silver. Males and, to a lesser extent, females have a ruff around the neck. The fur on the tail is longer than that on the body. Tufts of fur are found behind the ears and in between the toes, and the hind legs sport pantaloons. The adult coat reaches its full development when the cat is approximately two years old. The life span of a Nebelung is 16+ years. A Nebelung weighs between 3.5 kg (7.11 lbs) for females and 6.5 kg (14.5 lbs) for sterilized males.

===Behavioral characteristics===

Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent. The cat&#x27;s mild-mannered state and personality may not always reflect the relatively high level of intelligence often found in the breed. In spite of the fact that it is an active cat, it can live very well indoors. Nebelungs prefer their own families and often keep a distance from strangers. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and devoted throughout their lives. It is, however, a cat that gladly accepts company of its people or of another cat. Nebelungs are very good communicators and will remind their owners of problems. This happens often since Nebelungs can be very picky about things such as litter cleanliness and food type. 

Many owners of Nebelung cats say that they can act more like dogs at times, being extremely loyal to their owner and family. At times a Nebelung may choose or bond with a specific person within a family group more so than others. They will still enjoy the company of others within the social group but will tend to spend most of their time with said chosen person. They are also known for being easily leash trained with use of a proper harness. It enjoys sitting in a lap and being petted, and will follow its favorite person devotedly from room to room. The breed is also very playful and is known to learn to fetch and retrieve toys when thrown. This is a cat that likes routine, and may require a little time to adjust to changes in the household. Early socialization can help it become more adaptable.

==In popular culture==
The Nebelung was featured on the Animal Planet show &quot;Cats 101&quot;. 

The Nebelung is one of the animals which can be given as a Patronus in answer to the user&#x27;s personality test on Pottermore.

<doc id="173768" wikidata="Q1253844" url="?curid=173768" title="Dr. Dobb's Journal">
<text>Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal (often shortened to &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; or DDJ) was a monthly magazine published in the United States by UBM Technology Group, part of UBM. It covered topics aimed at computer programmers. When launched in 1976, DDJ was the first regular periodical focused on microcomputer software, rather than hardware. In its last years of publication, it was distributed as a PDF monthly, although the principal delivery of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; content was through the magazine&#x27;s website. Publication ceased at the end 
of 2014, with the archived website continuing to be available online.

==History==
Bob Albrecht edited an eccentric newspaper about computer games programmed in BASIC with the same name as the tiny nonprofit educational corporation that he had founded, &quot;People&#x27;s Computer Company&quot; (PCC). Dennis Allison was a longtime computer consultant on the San Francisco Peninsula and sometime instructor at Stanford University. The &quot;Dobbs&quot; title was based on a mashup of the first letters of their names: Dennis and Bob.

===First issues===
In the first three quarterly issues of the PCC newspaper published in 1975, Albrecht had published articles written by Allison, describing how to design and implement a stripped-down version of an interpreter for the BASIC language, with limited features to be easier to implement. He called it Tiny BASIC. At the end of the final part, Allison asked computer hobbyists who implemented it to send their implementations to PCC, and they would circulate copies of any implementations to anyone who sent a self-addressed stamped envelope. Allison said, &quot;Let us stand on each others&#x27; shoulders; not each others&#x27; toes.&quot;

The journal was originally intended to be a three-issue xerographed publication. Titled dr. dobb&#x27;s journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia (with the subtitle &quot;Running Light Without Overbyte&quot;) it was created to distribute the implementations of Tiny BASIC. The original title was created by Eric Bakalinsky, who did occasional paste-up work for PCC. &quot;Dobb&#x27;s&quot; was a contraction of &quot;Dennis&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot;. It was at a time when computer memory was very expensive, so compact coding was important. Microcomputer hobbyists needed to avoid using too many bytes of memory.

After the first photocopies were mailed to those who had sent stamped addressed envelopes, PCC was flooded with requests that the publication become an ongoing periodical devoted to general microcomputer software.

PCC agreed, and hired Jim Warren as its first editor. He immediately changed the title to Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal of Computer Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia prior to publishing the first issue in January 1976. The title refers to &quot;jumping through hoops&quot; (calisthenics) and &quot;pulling teeth&quot; (orthodontia).

===Early years===
Jim Warren was DDJ&#x27;s editor for about a year and a half. While he went on to make a splash with his series of West Coast Computer Faires, subsequent DDJ editors like Marlin Ouverson, Hank Harrison, Michael Swaine and Jonathan Erickson appear to have focused on the journalistic and social aspects of the young but growing microcomputer industry. Eventually PCC, the non-profit corporation, sold DDJ to a commercial publisher.

The newsletter&#x27;s content was originally pure enthusiast material. Initial interest circled around the Tiny BASIC interpreter, but Warren broadened that to include a variety of other programming topics, as well as a strong consumer bias, especially needed in the chaotic early days of microcomputing. All of the content came from volunteer contributors, with Steve Wozniak as one of the better known of them. Other contributors included Jef Raskin, later credited as a leader in the Macintosh development; Hal Hardenberg, the originator of DTACK Grounded an early newsletter for Motorola 68000 based software and hardware; and Gary Kildall, who had created CP/M, the first disk operating system for microcomputers which was not married to proprietary hardware.

Computer program source code published during the early years include:
* Tiny BASIC interpreter
* Palo Alto Tiny BASIC by Li-Chen Wang
* Small-C compiler by Ron Cain
* Music programs

There were also projects for computer speech synthesis and computer music systems. The March 1985 issue &quot;10(3)&quot; printed Richard Stallman&#x27;s &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; a call for participation in the then-new free software movement.

===Discontinuation of printed edition===

In later years, the magazine received contributions from developers all over the world working in application development and embedded systems across most programming languages and platforms. The magazine&#x27;s focus became more professional. Columnists included Michael Swaine, Allen Holub and Verity Stob, the pseudonymous British programmer.

The title was later shortened to &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, then changed to &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal of Software Tools&quot; as it became more popular. The magazine later reverted to &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; with the selling line, &quot;The World of Software Development&quot;, with the abbreviation DDJ also used for the corresponding website. In January 2009 Jonathan Erickson, the editor-in-chief, announced the magazine would cease monthly print publication, become a section of &quot;InformationWeek&quot; called &quot;Dr Dobb&#x27;s Report&quot;, a website and monthly digital PDF edition.

===Later history===
The primary Dr. Dobb&#x27;s content streams at the end were the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s website, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; (the monthly PDF magazine, which had different content from the website) and a weekly newsletter, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Update&quot;. In addition, Dr. Dobb&#x27;s continued to run the Jolt Awards and, since 1995, the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Excellence in Programming Award. Regular bloggers include Scott Ambler, Walter Bright, Andrew Koenig, and Al Williams. Adrian Bridgwater edited the news section beginning in 2010.

===End===
On December 16, 2014, an article by editor-in-chief Andrew Binstock announced that &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; would cease publication of new articles at the end of 2014. Archived articles are still available online. While no longer distributed, Dr. Dobb&#x27;s is widely considered an important and influential source for the history of the personal computer industry.

<doc id="173773" wikidata="Q1059564" url="?curid=173773" title="Cataclysmic variable star">
<text>In astronomy, cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are stars which irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state. They were initially called novae (), since ones with an outburst brightness visible to the naked eye and an invisible quiescent brightness appeared as new stars in the sky.

Cataclysmic variable stars are binary stars that consist of two components; a white dwarf primary, and a mass transferring secondary. The stars are so close to each other that the gravity of the white dwarf distorts the secondary, and the white dwarf accretes matter from the companion. Therefore, the secondary is often referred to as the &quot;donor star&quot;, and it is usually less massive than the primary. The infalling matter, which is usually rich in hydrogen, forms in most cases an accretion disk around the white dwarf. Strong UV and X-ray emission is often detected from the accretion disc, powered by the loss of gravitational potential energy from the infalling material. The shortest currently observed orbit in a hydrogen-rich system is 51 minutes in ZTF J1813+4251.

Material at the inner edge of disc falls onto the surface of the white dwarf primary. A classical nova outburst occurs when the density and temperature at the bottom of the accumulated hydrogen layer rise high enough to ignite runaway hydrogen fusion reactions, which rapidly convert the hydrogen layer to helium. If the accretion process continues long enough to bring the white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit, the increasing interior density may ignite runaway carbon fusion and trigger a Type Ia supernova explosion, which would completely destroy the white dwarf.

The accretion disc may be prone to an instability leading to dwarf nova outbursts, when the outer portion of the disc changes from a cool, dull mode to a hotter, brighter mode for a time, before reverting to the cool mode. Dwarf novae can recur on a timescale of days to decades.

== Classification ==
Cataclysmic variables are subdivided into several smaller groups, often named after a bright prototype star characteristic of the class. In some cases the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disk or even prevent disk formation altogether. Magnetic systems often show strong and variable polarization in their optical light, and are therefore sometimes called polars; these often exhibit small-amplitude brightness fluctuations at what is presumed to be the white dwarf&#x27;s period of rotation.

There are over 1600 known CV systems. The catalog was frozen as of 1 February 2006 though more are discovered each year.

==Discovery==

Cataclysmic variables are among the classes of astronomical objects most commonly found by amateurs, since a cataclysmic variable in its outburst phase is bright enough to be detectable with very modest instruments, and the only celestial objects easily confused with them are bright asteroids whose movement from night to night is clear.

Verifying that an object is a cataclysmic variable is also fairly straightforward: they are usually quite blue objects, they exhibit rapid and strong variability, and they tend to have peculiar emission lines. They emit in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges; they are expected also to emit gamma rays, from annihilation of positrons from proton-rich nuclei produced in the fusion explosion, but this has not yet been detected.

Around six galactic novae (i.e. in our own galaxy) are discovered each year, whilst models based on observations in other galaxies suggest that the rate of occurrence ought to be between 20 and 50; this discrepancy is due partly to obscuration by interstellar dust, and partly to a lack of observers in the southern hemisphere and to the difficulties of observing while the Sun is up and at full moon.

==Superhumps==

Some cataclysmic variables experience periodic brightenings caused by deformations of the accretion disk when its rotation is in resonance with the orbital period of the binary.

<text>De Gaulle is a 2020 French biographical historical drama film written and directed by Gabriel Le Bomin, starring Lambert Wilson and Isabelle Carré as Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle.

==Plot==
Paris, June 1940. The country is facing military and political collapse as the Battle of France rages. A married couple, Charles de Gaulle and his wife Yvonne, are trying to cope with the situation at hand. When de Gaulle goes to war as a brigadier general in the battle against the invading German army, his wife Yvonne remains at home and takes care of their three children: Elisabeth, Philippe and little Anne.

As the Germans activate &quot;Fall Rot&quot;, Paul Reynaud appoints de Gaulle as Defence Minister, under the command of Deputy Prime Minister Philippe Pétain whose body was responsible for collaboration with the British. While attending a cabinet meeting, de Gaulle is not met kindly by Pétain, General Maxime Weygand and Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel, who all feel that de Gaulle is not fit for office.

Following his visit to Weygand, who was aiming for a truce between French and the Germans, de Gaulle decides to fly to Britain to meet the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to discuss the evacuation of the French army to French North Africa. It&#x27;s only after that trip that Reynaud, Pétain, and Weygand change their view about de Gaulle. During the same month, de Gaulle attends a couple of Anglo-French Supreme War Council meetings where he meets Churchill and General Edward Spears on 11 June, and two days later meets the Earl of Halifax.

Following the successful meetings, de Gaulle offers his resignation, but the Interior Minister Georges Mandel urges him to stay. An escape from French North Africa with Edward Spears and Jean Laurent makes the German government suspicious and an arrest warrant is issued in de Gaulle&#x27;s name. De Gaulle ends up landing in Britain and goes directly to Churchill, who suggests he should work for BBC Radio on 17 June. The next day, de Gaulle issues an appeal to the French people not to be demoralized and to continue fighting against the German aggressors.

It was during this time that Yvonne and her children left Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, as German forces continue to advance throughout France. By 25 June 1940, de Gaulle becomes the leader of the Free French and eventually becomes the President of the Republic.

==Cast==
==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on critics, with an average rating of .

Sandra Hall of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote &quot;Wilson makes a very plausible de Gaulle. He has the height, the slimness and the posture and once he has the uniform on, it&#x27;s easy to overlook the fact that he&#x27;s much too handsome for the part&quot;.

Jordan Mintzer of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film &quot;A bland piece of hero worship&quot;.

<text> (; ; ; , &#x27;the Arya Expanse&#x27;) is considered in Zoroastrianism to be the homeland of the early Iranians and the place where Zarathustra received the religion from Ahura Mazda. The Avesta also names it as the first of the &quot;sixteen perfect lands&quot; that Ahura Mazda created for the Iranians.

Based on these descriptions, modern scholarship initially focused on &quot;Airyanem Vaejah&quot; in an attempt to determine the homeland of the Iranians or Indo-Iranians in general. Among these early attempts, the region of Khwarezm emerged as a likely locale. More recent scholarship, however, no longer agrees as to where &quot;Airyanem Vaejah&quot; might have been located or to what extent it is a mythological rather than a specific historical place.

==Etymology and related words==

The Avestan and the Middle Persian are compound terms, where the first part is the adjective or genitive plural of Arya (, ; , ), respectively. This term also appears in Vedic Sanskrit as the self designation of the people of the Vedas. Within the context of Iran, however, this term simply means Iranian. However, the exact meaning of the second part or is uncertain. Friedrich Carl Andreas derives it from a hypothetical Old Iranian *vyacah which he connects to Vedic Sanskrit &quot;territory, region&quot;. On the other hand, Émile Benveniste connects it to the Avestan term (brandish, throw (a weapon)) which would be cognate to Vedic Sanskrit (vehement movement, irruption, flow) and, therefore, would give the meaning of &quot;extent&quot; or &quot;expanse&quot;. It may also be related to Vedic Sanskrit (to move with a quick darting motion, speed, heave (said of waves)), suggesting the region of a fast-flowing river.

Zoroastrian tradition knows at least two other terms that associate the Iranian people with a geographical region. The first is found in the Avesta specifically in the Mihr Yasht. Vers Yt. 10.13 describes how Mithra reaches Mount Hara and overlooks the Airyoshayana (, &#x27;Iranian lands&#x27;). This term is usually interpreted to refer to the entire land inhabited by Iranians which would make it an umbrella term for the Iranian regions mentioned in the following verse Yt. 10.14. However, Gherardo Gnoli notes the ambiguity of the text, such that Airyoshayana, like Airyanem Vaejah, may only refer to a specific country, one that occupies a prominent place among the Iranian countries from verses Yt. 10.13–14. The second term is the Middle Persian () and (). This word is the origin of the modern Persian term Iran. However, a possible Old Iranian origin has not been established and the term may be an innovation of the Sassanians.

==In the Avesta==
The earliest mentions of Airyanem Vaejah are found in the Avesta, in particular in the Vendidad and several of the Yashts. In the Yashts, Airyanem Vaejah is most prominently named in the Aban Yasht as the place where both Ahura Mazda and Zarathustra sacrifice to Anahita:

The other verses in which Airyanem Vaejah occurs in the Yashts follow the same structure, differing only in the deity to whom the sacrifice is offered. While in Yt. 5.104, Zarathustra is sacrificing to Anahita, this is changed to Drvaspa in the Drvasp Yasht (Yt. 9.25), and to Ashi in the Ard Yasht (Yt. 17.45). In the Vendidad, however, Airyanem Vaejah appears as the first of the sixteen best lands and countries that Ahura Mazda had created for the Zoroastrian community:

This connection between Airyanem Vaejah and winter is further described in Vd. 2.20–23. In these verses, Ahura Mazda is meeting there with Yima and instructs him to build a shelter for the winter that Angra Mainyu would soon unleash upon the material world. The harsh description of Airyanem Vaejah in Vd. 1.3, however, seems to conflict with the positive assessment given in Vd. 1.1. This has led some to speculate that the third verse is a later insertion, while others think that it could be a fragment of an originally longer description, and the text in Vd. 1.3 refers only to the upper headwaters of the river Daitya.

== In Zoroastrian tradition ==
In middle Iranian sources, Airyanem Vaejah appears as Eranwez. The Bundahishn describes how Eranwez was the place where the first cattle was created (Bd. 13.4) and where Zarathustra first received the religion from Ahura Mazda (Bd. 35.54). The Bundahishn furthermore states that Eranwez is located near Adarbaygan (Bd. 29.12) and that it is connected by the river Daitya to a country called Gobadestan (Bd. 11A.7). The identity of Gobadestan is not known, but its name has been interpreted as a distortion of Sugdestan.
Likewise, the river Daitya is often identified in the literature with the Oxus. This apparent conflict between a western and an eastern localization in Greater Iran has been explained as a westward shift in geographic place names that may have taken place parallel to the rise of political power in the western regions, in particular Media and Persis.

==Modern scholarship==
When investigating the historical reality behind Airyanem Vaejah, modern scholarship is faced with the fact that many references appear in a clearly mythical context, while others may point to a specific historical location. Airyanem Vaejah has, therefore, been compared to Mount Hara, a mountain that both appears in Zoroastrian mythology and has been variously identified with real geographical locations. Modern scholarship is thus trying to distinguish between these mythical and historical elements in the Zoroastrian sources and to find out how the early Iranians conceived of their world in each respective context.

Since the Bundahishn (29.12) specifically places Airyanem Vaejah near Adarbaygan, it is clear that during Sassanian times Iranians believed it to be located in Western Iran. Some early modern scholars tended to accept this localisation, assuming that it also reflected the understanding of Iranians at the much earlier time of the Avesta, i.e., the time when the earliest sources were produced. However, this notion has been criticised due to the observation that all place names in the Avesta that can be reliably identified with modern places are found in the eastern and northeastern part of Greater Iran. As a result, more recent scholarship mostly favours an eastern localisation of Airyanem Vaejah.

One hypothesis that has attracted considerable interest identifies Airyanem Vaejah with Khwarezm. It was proposed early on by Wilhelm Geiger and Josef Markwart and a number of arguments have been voiced in its favor over the years. First, Airyanem Vaejah is described as having long and cold winters and Khwarezm is among the coldest regions of Greater Iran. Next, Airyanem Vaejah is described as the original homeland of the Iranians and Khwarezm has been proposed as an early center of Iranian civilization. This point has been widely discussed within the search for &quot;the traditional homeland&quot; or &quot;the ancient homeland&quot; of the Iranians, perpetuating interpretations of the Airyanem Vaejah as , of the Indo-Iranians or the . Another argument builds on a comparison between the list of Iranian countries in the Vendidad (Vd. 1.1.–1.19) and the Mihr Yasht (Yt. 10.13–14). As Christensen has argued, the place occupied by Khwarezm in the Mihr Yasht seems to be occupied by Airyanem Vaejah in the Vendidad. Taken together, these reasons have made the Khwarezm hypothesis very popular and scholars like Mary Boyce, Nasser Takmil Homayoun, and Elton L. Daniel have endorsed it more recently.

However, this hypothesis has also seen a number of criticisms and counter proposals. For instance, Vogelsang has noted that the notion of Khwarezm as an important center of early Iranian civilization is not substantiated by recent evidence and places Airyanem Vaejah in the general region of Transoxiania. Frantz Grenet has interpreted the cold of Airyanem Vaejah as referring to a mountainious rather than a northern region and places it in the upper course of the Oxus river at the pre-Pamirian highlands.

<text>Seyfert&#x27;s Sextet is a group of galaxies about 190 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens. The group appears to contain six members, but one of the galaxies, NGC 6027d, is a background object (700 million light years behind the group) and another &quot;galaxy,&quot; NGC 6027e, is actually a part of the tail from galaxy NGC 6027. The gravitational interaction among these galaxies should continue for hundreds of millions of years. Ultimately, the galaxies will merge to form a single giant elliptical galaxy.

==Discovery==
French astronomer Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6027 on 20 March 1882, but he was unable to resolve the individual galaxies in the group. The group members were discovered by Carl Keenan Seyfert using photographic plates made at the Barnard Observatory of Vanderbilt University. When these results were first published in 1951, this group was the most compact group ever identified.

<text>IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras, film formats, film projectors, and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio (approximately either 1.43:1 or 1.90:1) and steep stadium seating, with the 1.43:1 ratio format being available only in few selected locations.

Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation (founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation, Ltd.), and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada.

IMAX GT is the premium large format. The digital format uses dual laser projectors, which can show 1.43 digital content when combined with a 1.43 screen. The film format uses very large screens of and, unlike most conventional film projectors, the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock. It is called the 15/70 format. They can be purpose-built theaters and dome theaters, and many installations of this type limit themselves to a projection of high quality, short documentaries.

The dedicated buildings and projectors required high construction and maintenance costs, necessitating several compromises in the following years. To reduce costs, the IMAX SR and MPX systems were introduced in 1998 and 2004, respectively, to make IMAX available to multiplex and existing theaters. The SR system featured slightly smaller screens than GT theatres, though still in purpose-built auditoriums with a 1.43:1 aspect ratio. The MPX projectors were solely used to retrofit existing multiplex auditoriums, losing much of the quality of the GT experience.

Later came the introduction of the IMAX Digital 2K and IMAX with Laser 4K in 2008 and 2014 respectively, still limited in respect to the 70 megapixels of equivalent resolution of the original 15/70 film. Both technologies are purely digital and suitable to retrofit existing theaters. Since 2018, the Laser system has been employed to retrofit full dome installations, with limited results due to the large area of a dome screen.

==History==
===Multiscreen Corporation===
The single-projector/single-camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel &quot;Rolling Loop&quot; film-transport technology purchased from Peter Ronald Wright Jones, a machine shop worker from Brisbane, Australia. Film projectors do not continuously flow the film in front of the bulb, but instead &quot;stutter&quot; the film travel so that each frame can be illuminated in a momentarily-paused still image. This requires a mechanical apparatus to buffer the jerky travel of the film strip. The older technology of running 70 mm film vertically through the projector used only five sprocket perforations on the sides of each frame; however, the IMAX method used fifteen perforations per frame. The previous mechanism was inadequate to handle this intermittent mechanical movement that was three times longer, and so Jones&#x27;s invention was necessary for the novel IMAX projector method with its horizontal film feed. As it became clear that a single, large-screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction, Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX. Co-founder Graeme Ferguson explained how the name IMAX originated:

... the incorporation date [of the company was] September 1967. ... [The name change] came a year or two later. We first called the company Multiscreen Corporation because that, in fact, was what people knew us as. ... After about a year, our attorney informed us that we could never copyright or trademark Multivision. It was too generic. It was a descriptive word. The words that you can copyright are words like Kleenex or Xerox or Coca-Cola. If the name is descriptive, you can&#x27;t trademark it so you have to make up a word. So we were sitting at lunch one day in a Hungarian restaurant in Montreal and we worked out a name on a placemat on which we wrote all the possible names we could think of. We kept working with the idea of maximum image. We turned it around and came up with IMAX.

The name change actually happened more than two years later, because a key patent filed on January 16, 1970, was assigned under the original name Multiscreen Corporation, Limited. IMAX Chief Administration Officer Mary Ruby was quoted as saying, &quot;Although many people may think &#x27;IMAX&#x27; is an acronym, it is, in fact, a made-up word.&quot;

=== IMAX Corporation ===

&quot;Tiger Child&quot;, the first IMAX film, was demonstrated at Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, Japan. The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the Cinesphere theatre at Ontario Place in Toronto. It debuted in May 1971, showing the film &quot;North of Superior&quot;. The installation remained in place during Ontario Place&#x27;s hiatus for redevelopment. The Cinesphere was renovated while Ontario Place was closed and re-opened on November 3, 2017, with IMAX 70 mm and IMAX with laser illumination.

During Expo &#x27;74 in Spokane, Washington, an IMAX screen that measured was featured in the &#x27;Environmental Theater&#x27; of the US Pavilion, the largest structure in the expo; at the time, it was the largest movie screen in the world. It became the first IMAX Theatre to not be partnered with any other brand of movie theatres. About five million visitors viewed the short film &quot;Man Belongs to the Earth&quot;. Because the screen covered the viewer&#x27;s total visual field when looking directly forward, most felt a sensation of motion and some experienced motion sickness.

The large pavilion screen was torn down after the exposition closed and was replaced by a nearby permanent IMAX theater which opened in 1978 and was demolished in 2018; however, its screen size is less than half. Due to protests, the City of Spokane officials decided to work with the IMAX Corporation to demolish the 1978 theatre, under the condition they renovate the former US Pavilion itself into IMAX&#x27;s first permanent &quot;outdoor&quot; giant-screen theatre. The plan was to use material on the inside of the structure similar to that used when first constructed. However, it was expected to last only five years, due to weather conditions destroying previous materials. Concept art has been released in videos featured on Spokane&#x27;s renovation site, and its budget revealed that seating is planned for more than 2,000.

The first permanent IMAX Dome installation, the Eugene Heikoff and Marilyn Jacobs Heikoff Dome Theatre at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, opened in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park in 1973. It doubles as a planetarium theater. The first permanent IMAX 3D theatre was built in Vancouver, British Columbia, for &quot;Transitions&quot; at Expo &#x27;86, and was in use until September 30, 2009. It was located at the tip of Canada Place, a Vancouver landmark.

=== Digital projection ===

In 2008, IMAX extended its brand into traditional theaters with the introduction of Digital IMAX, a lower-cost system that uses two 2K digital projectors to project on a 1.90:1 aspect ratio screen. This lower-cost option, which allowed for the conversion of existing multiplex theater auditoriums, helped IMAX to grow from 299 screens worldwide at the end of 2007 to over 1,000 screens by the end of 2015. , there were 1,302 IMAX theatres located in 75 countries, of which 1,203 were in commercial multiplexes.

The switch to digital projection came at a steep cost in image quality, with 2K projectors having roughly an order of magnitude less resolution than traditional IMAX film projectors. Maintaining the same 7-story screen size would only make this loss more noticeable, so many new theaters were instead built with significantly smaller screens. These newer theaters with much lower resolution and much smaller screens soon began to be referred to by the derogatory name &quot;LieMAX&quot;, particularly because the company still marketed the new screens similarly to the old ones, without making the major differences clear to the public, going so far as to market the smallest &quot;IMAX&quot; screen, having 10 times less area, similarly to the largest while persisting with the same brand name.

Since 2002, some feature films have been converted into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres, and some have also been (partially) shot in IMAX. By late 2017, 1,302 IMAX theatre systems were installed in 1,203 commercial multiplexes, 13 commercial destinations, and 86 institutional settings in 75 countries, with less than a quarter of those having the capability to show 70mm film at the resolution of the large format as originally conceived.

==Technical aspects==
===Camera===
==== Film cameras ====

The IMAX cinema process increases the image resolution by using a larger film frame; in relative terms, a frame of IMAX format film has three times the theoretical horizontal resolution of a frame of 35 mm film. To achieve such increased image resolution, which IMAX estimates at approximately 12,000 lines (6,000 line pair modulations) of horizontal resolution (18K), 65 mm film stock passes horizontally through the IMAX movie camera, 15 perforations at a time. At 24 frames per second, this means that the film moves through the camera at per minute (just over 6 km/h). In a conventional 65 mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or per minute. In comparison, in a conventional 35 mm camera, 35 mm film passes vertically through the camera, at four (smaller) perforations at a time, which translates to per minute.

In the Todd-AO 70 mm-format of widescreen cinema, the image area of a 65 mm film-frame is ; in the IMAX-format of widescreen cinema, the film-frame dimensions are . To match the standard image resolution of the moving image produced with the film-speed of 24 frames per second, an IMAX film requires three times the length of (negative) film stock required for a 65 mm film of comparable scope and cinematic technique.

In March 2022, IMAX announced a new initiative in cooperation with Kodak, Panavision, and FotoKem to develop &quot;a new fleet of next generation IMAX film cameras&quot;, with a goal to deploy the first four units in the next two years. Christopher Nolan and Jordan Peele are among a group of advisors, made up of filmmakers and cinematographers, assisting in identifying new specs and features for the prototype development phase.

In a May 2024 interview with Collider, IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond revealed that there will be four new identical cameras that will be 30% quieter than the existing cameras. The Wall Street Journal revealed that the new cameras will be made out of carbon fiber and titanium, and they will feature a five inch color display along with wireless capability.

====Phantom 65 IMAX 3D digital camera====
In 2011, IMAX announced a 4K 3D digital camera. The camera was developed alongside Vision Research and AbelCine, integrating two Phantom 65 engines. A prototype camera was used for the documentary &quot;Born to be Wild&quot;, in which approximately 10% of the finished film was shot with the system. The company has said they have no intention of replacing the higher resolution film cameras with the new digital camera, but the latter can be used in scenes that require a lightweight or relatively small 3D camera. While IMAX has completed the production camera and has placed it in service on several films, they have no plans to produce an IMAX film solely with the new digital system. &quot;&quot; is the first feature film partially filmed with the Phantom 65 IMAX 3D camera.

====ARRI Alexa IMAX digital camera====
In 2015, IMAX announced a 2D digital camera that was developed alongside Arri, the camera being based on the latter company&#x27;s Arri Alexa 65 technology. The first production to use the camera was &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. The Russo brothers have stated that they solely used the Arri Alexa IMAX on &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

For &quot;&quot;, two ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras were combined in a rig to provide native 3D, with the film containing 98% of IMAX footage.

==== IMAX certified cameras ====
In September 2020, IMAX launched the &quot;Filmed for IMAX&quot; program, which certifies high-quality digital cameras that can be used to create IMAX-format films. As the scope of certified cameras expands, it will be easier for filmmakers to create films to meet the projection needs of the IMAX giant screen theater.

&quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice) and &quot;Dune&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF) were among the first films that used IMAX-certified cameras. Other films between 2021 and 2023 that captured with this program are &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (shot with the Red Ranger Monstro and Komodo), &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF), &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin&quot; and &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin II&quot; (shot with the Red Ranger Monstro), &quot;Eternals&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF), &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (shot with Panavision Millennium DXL2), &quot;&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF), &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (shot with the Red V-Raptor), &quot;The Marvels&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF) and &quot;&quot; (shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF).

=== Film stock ===

The IMAX format is generically called &quot;15/70&quot; film, the name referring to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film&#x27;s bulk and weight require horizontal platters, rather than conventional vertically mounted film reels. IMAX film is fed through the projector horizontally, and the film is drawn from the inner circumference of the platter, not from the outer circumference like in conventional film reels. A system is in place to keep the film in the outer circumference from flying outwards due to centrifugal force while the platter is spinning. IMAX film is shipped to theaters in several small reels that are spliced into one continuous length that is then wound into a platter, a process that may take hours to complete. Films may be several kilometers in length: &quot;Avatar&quot;, which was 2:45 hours in duration, was close to long. Platters are handled using special forklifts. IMAX platters range from diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh . IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX&#x27;s pin registration system (&quot;especially that of the camera mechanism&quot;) does not tolerate either sprocket-hole or film-thickness variations, but the film can still swell or shrink under varying temperature and humidity. This requires projection booths to be kept at a temperature of between 20 and 23.8 °C and a humidity of 50%. The film is too large to be moved using its sprockets, so they are instead used for registration, to aid in aligning the film. A feature film platter can cost to print. The camera negative is actually 65 mm film stock, but it runs horizontally and with 15 perforations per frame. The camera, like the projector, has a vacuum system; this makes the camera noisy, forbidding the sync-sound recording of quiet scenes. The camera has enough film for three minutes of shooting. The large frame of the film also imposes optical limitations such as an extremely shallow depth of field when shooting with an open aperture.

=== Soundtrack – double-system ===

To use more of the image area, IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack. Instead, the IMAX system specifies a separate six-channel magnetic film, recorded and played back on a film follower locked to picture, just as Vitaphone had been (utilizing 16-inch 33 1/3 RPM electrical transcription discs) in the early 20th century, and was the same technology used to provide the 7-channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the Cinerama process in the mid-1950s. By the early 1990s, a separate DTS-based 6-track digital sound system was used, similarly locked to the projector by a SMPTE time code synchronization apparatus, the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded CD-ROM discs. In the late 1990s, IMAX upgraded this system to use a hard drive that carries a single uncompressed audio file. These are converted directly to analogue rather than processed through a decoding method such as DTS. The new generation of IMAX with Laser Projectors use IMAX 12-channel sound while 15/70 and Xenon Projectors use IMAX 6-channel.

Like conventional theatres, IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically transparent screen, and around the theatre to create a &quot;surround sound&quot; effect. IMAX also provides a &quot;top center&quot; speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres. This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen&#x27;s greater height.

==Projectors==
Transporting the large film stock through the optical system presented challenges for both the camera and the projector. Conventional 70 mm systems were not steady enough for the 586× magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent (no. 291,375) for film transport called the &quot;rolling loop&quot; by adding a compressed air &quot;puffer&quot; to accelerate the film, and put a cylindrical lens in the projector&#x27;s &quot;aperture block&quot;. The rolling loop mechanism is used to move the film in projectors and cameras; the sprockets in the film are only used for registration as the film is too large to be moved with sprockets at the necessary speeds for projection and filming without damage.

The projector uses a vacuum to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the &quot;field flattener&quot; flattens the image field. The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a pneumatic piston so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to a clean portion of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has &quot;wiper bars&quot; made of a felt or brush-like material that wipes dust off the lens as it moves up or down. The projector uses a vacuum to keep the film flat and oriented correctly for projection. The shutter of an IMAX projector is also kept open for longer than a 35 mm projector shutter to increase image brightness.

IMAX projectors are pin-stabilized; this means that four registration pins engage the perforations at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added cam-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame &quot;settled&quot; onto the registration pins. The projector&#x27;s shutter is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment, and the light source is brighter. The xenon short-arc lamps are made with a thin envelope of fused quartz and contain xenon gas at a pressure of about 25 atmospheres (). Because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective body armor when changing or handling the lamp in case it breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying quartz shards propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within; this applies to all projection xenon lamps. An IMAX xenon lamp runs on DC power, lasts for 1,000 hours and requires its own pump and water cooler. The projector&#x27;s optics also require compressed air cooling. An IMAX projector weighs up to 1.8 tonnes (2 short tons) and is over tall and long. The projector is raised and locked into position before each screening.

IMAX Corporation has released four projector types that use its 15-perforation, 70 mm film format: GT (Grand Theatre), GT 3D (dual rotor), SR (Small Rotor), and MPX, which was designed for retrofitted theatres. In July 2008, the company introduced a digital projection system, which it has not given a distinct name or brand, designed for multiplex theatres with screens no wider than . All IMAX projectors, except the standard GT system, can project 3D images. GT 3D projectors require two separate lamps and polarized projection optics.

==Digital projection==
The digital cinema IMAX projection system, debuted in 2008, is designed for use with shorter 1.90:1 aspect ratio screens. The system uses two 2K projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format (IDF; which in itself is a superset of DCI). IDF initially used 2K-resolution Christie xenon projectors, with a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP) engine, but in 2012 IMAX announced that they would be switching to Barco as their primary supplier. The two 2K images are projected superimposed on each other with a half-pixel offset, using super-resolution imaging to increase the perceived resolution to approximately 2.9K.

For 3D presentations, one projector is used to display the image for each eye, while 2D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter 75 cd/m2 image. The Digital IMAX projection system includes a proprietary IMAX Image Enhancer that modifies the output of the digital media server based on feedback from cameras and microphones in the auditorium, and maintains alignment with sub-pixel accuracy.

Mainly because the system facilitates inexpensive distribution of IMAX features, the company announced in February 2012 that they were renovating specially selected locations around the world to present both 70 mm analog as well as digital presentations. To do so, IMAX developed a rail system that moves the projectors in and out to accommodate either a full-frame film print or a digital-only release. These theaters were prepared in time for the release of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; in July 2012.

== Laser projection ==
In April 2012, IMAX began testing a new 4K laser projection system, based on patents licensed from Eastman Kodak. Like the 3D film and digital systems, it used two projectors, but it improved over the smaller digital screens by retaining the traditional IMAX aspect ratio and let films be shown on screens wide or more. In December 2014, IMAX began rolling out its new dual 4K laser projector system, dubbed &quot;IMAX with Laser&quot; and known as IMAX GT, with the first installation occurring at the Cineplex Scotiabank Theatre in Toronto. The system allows digital projection of the 1.43:1 aspect ratio surface of a traditional IMAX screen, but can also be used on other screens such as the 1.90:1-aspect-ratio TCL Chinese Theater.

The system replaces the xenon arc lamp of a traditional digital projector with a laser light source, and is capable of 60 fps with &quot;50 percent greater&quot; brightness than the Digital Cinema Initiatives spec, a contrast ratio &quot;double&quot; that of IMAX 15/70 mm film projection and &quot;higher&quot; than the 2,500:1 contrast ratio of IMAX&#x27;s xenon lamp-based projection systems, and displaying the full Rec. 2020 color gamut. The system also features a new 12-channel surround sound system, which adds an additional speaker on either side of the theater as well as four new overhead speakers.

While still not matching the theoretical resolution of traditional IMAX film, which is estimated at up to 12,000 lines of horizontal resolution on the 65 mm camera negative (12K) and approximately 6,000 on a 35 mm release print (6K), the new laser system features dual-4K resolution projectors, each capable of displaying four times the detail of one Digital IMAX projector. Like Digital IMAX, images from the two projectors are projected superimposed on each other with a half-pixel offset, using super-resolution imaging, which makes the perceived resolution greater than 4K. In-theater cameras and microphones are used to automatically calibrate the projectors and sound system between showings. For 3D presentations, one projector is used to display the image for each eye, while 2D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter image. For 3D presentations, IMAX with Laser systems use dichroic filter glasses, similar to those used by Dolby 3D, as opposed to the linear polarization glasses used in Digital IMAX theaters.

On April 24, 2018, IMAX announced that they would begin rolling out a new single-unit version of their laser projector system later that year, with this iteration designed to replace the IMAX Xenon digital projection system for 1.90:1 screens.

== Theatres ==
IMAX theatres are described as either &quot;Classic Design&quot; (purpose-built structures), or &quot;Multiplex Design&quot; (retrofitted auditoriums). Classic IMAX theatre construction differs significantly from conventional theatres. The increased resolution lets the audience be much closer to the screen. Typically all rows are within one screen height – conventional theatre seating runs 8 to 12-screen heights. Also, the rows of seats are set at a steep angle (up to 30° in some domed theatres) so that the audience is facing the screen directly.

The world&#x27;s largest IMAX screen currently stands in Leonberg near Stuttgart, Germany and measures . Until the Leonberg IMAX opened in 2021, the largest operating IMAX screen was in IMAX Melbourne, located within the Melbourne Museum in Melbourne, Australia, measuring . Until its demolition in 2016, the world&#x27;s largest IMAX screen had been in IMAX Sydney in Darling Harbour, Sydney, Australia, measuring . It reopened on 12 October 2023, with a screen measuring 693 square meters within The Ribbon building, after years of extensive redevelopment, making it the world&#x27;s third-largest screen.

==Variations==

===Dome and Omnimax===



In the late-1960s, the San Diego Hall of Science (later known as the San Diego Space and Science Foundation) began searching North America for a large-format film system to project on the dome of their planned tilted dome planetarium. The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a tall lamp house on top. IMAX Corporation redesigned its system, adding an elevator to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below. Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller, lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector. In 1970, Ernst Leitz Canada, Ltd. (now ELCAN Optical Technologies) won a contract to develop and manufacture a fisheye lens projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen.

The dome system, which the San Diego Hall of Science called &quot;Omnimax&quot;, uses films shot with a camera equipped with a fisheye lens that squeezes a highly distorted anamorphic 180° field of view onto the 65 mm IMAX film. The lens is aligned below the center of the frame, and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film. The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked. When filming, the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome. When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome, the original panoramic view is recreated. Omnimax wraps 180° horizontally, 100° above the horizon and 22° below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome. Omnimax premiered in 1973, showing &quot;Voyage to the Outer Planets&quot; (produced by Graphic Films) and &quot;Garden Isle&quot; (by Roger Tilton Films) on a double bill. Later in the 70s a successful Omnimax center was built at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, and ran strongly through the 80s and 90s, eventually being closed and rebuilt.

IMAX has since renamed its Omnimax system &quot;IMAX Dome&quot;, but some theaters (primarily those opened before the 2000s) continue to call it &quot;Omnimax&quot;.

IMAX Dome theatres are used in theme parks and many North American museums, particularly those with a scientific focus, where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing of the equipment in operation, and it is often accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. For some theaters, before the show begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it.

The screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the Museum of Science and Industry (Henry Crown Space Center) in Chicago, Illinois; the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History; the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the St. Louis Science Center; Boston&#x27;s Museum of Science; Richmond&#x27;s Science Museum of Virginia; the Charlotte Observer IMAX Dome Theatre at Discovery Place, Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s McWane Science Center; US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama; the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal; the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, Ohio; the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Ontario; and Science World in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Alternatively, the dome may be lowered and raised as needed, such as at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the former installation at the Canadian Museum of History (where it shared an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen, all replaced with a Barco CINE+ digital theatre system in 2016). The entire dome could be raised to show flat-screen features, and repositioned for immersive features.

While the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions entertainment films are also shown, such as &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. The largest screen in North America is at the Science World in Vancouver, British Columbia, which has a dome screen in size.

Due to the age of the IMAX Dome format as well as its entirely analogue nature, some theatres may opt to replace their existing IMAX Dome systems with newer, more versatile digital systems. Examples of former IMAX Dome theatres that have had their IMAX equipment replaced with newer equipment include Tietomaa Science Centre in Oulu, Finland (which replaced its IMAX 8/70 equipment from 1988 with a Barco DP4K-32B 4K projection system in 2013), the Omni-Theatre at Science Centre Singapore, the National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung, Taiwan (which both had their original IMAX Dome 1570 projection systems installed respectively in 1987 and 1985 replaced with Evans &amp; Sutherland Digistar 5 8K digital systems in 2015), and the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey, which replaced its IMAX Dome 1570 projection system from 1993 (when built was the largest IMAX Dome/OMNIMAX theatre in the world) with an Evans &amp; Sutherland Digistar 6 &quot;True8K&quot; digital system in 2017.

In November 2018, the Hackworth IMAX dome in The Tech Museum (now The Tech Interactive) replaced its 70 mm IMAX projector with a 4K IMAX Laser projector. It became the first digital IMAX Laser dome theater in the world.

=== 3D ===

To create the illusion of depth, the IMAX 3D process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes. The lenses are separated by a distance of , the average distance between a human&#x27;s eyes. Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce. The IMAX 3D camera weighs over . By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye, viewers see a 3D image on a 2D screen. One method is to use polarizing filters to oppositely polarize the light used in projecting each image. The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters, so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye. In another method, the two projections rapidly alternate. While one image is being shown, the projection of its mate is blocked. Each frame is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker. The viewer wears shutter glasses with liquid crystal shutters that block or transmit light in sync with the projectors, so each eye sees only the images meant for it.

Several of the early films that had been produced in digital 3D for release in conventional theaters were also presented in IMAX 3D, including &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. The first full-color IMAX 3D film was the 1986 short documentary &quot;Transitions&quot;, produced for Expo 86 in Vancouver.

===HD===
Variations on IMAX included the 48 frames per second IMAX HD process, which sought to produce smoother, more lifelike motion, while also reducing the blurring of moving objects, by doubling the normal film rate. The IMAX HD system was tested in 1992 at the Canada Pavilion of the Seville Expo &#x27;92 with the film &quot;Momentum&quot;. Higher production costs, and the high &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; on the prints and projectors, doomed the IMAX HD system, but, not before many theatres had been retrofitted to project at 48 frames, especially in Canada, in order to play &quot;Momentum&quot;. In the 1990s theme parks in Thailand, Germany, and Las Vegas used IMAX HD for their Motion Simulator rides. The Disney parks attraction Soarin&#x27; Over California features a modification of both IMAX HD and IMAX Dome, projecting in 48 frames per second.

=== Digital ===

Because 70 mm film and projectors are costly, difficult to produce en masse, and the size of auditoriums that house full-size IMAX screens make them expensive to construct, IMAX debuted a digital projection system in 2008 to use with shorter 1.89:1 aspect ratio screens. It uses two 2K-resolution projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format (IDF; which in itself is a superset of DCI). The digital installations have caused some controversy, as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors. The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose-built auditoriums of the original 15/70 IMAX format, and are limited to the 1.89:1 aspect ratio. Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX. The technology has a maximum perceived resolution of 2.9K, compared to traditional IMAX 70 mm projection, which has an estimated resolution of 12K. Some reviewers have also noted that many non-IMAX theaters are projecting films at 4K resolution through competing brands such as Dolby Cinema and UltraAVX.

IMAX has held to a uniform branding of &quot;The IMAX Experience&quot; across various underlying technologies and screen sizes. Some have criticized the company&#x27;s marketing approach, with the format being dubbed &quot;Lie-MAX&quot;. The company has defended the format by saying it has a bigger screen, brighter picture and better sound than standard theatres. Despite the differences with digital IMAX, the cost-effective format has aided in the company&#x27;s worldwide growth, especially in Russia and China.

===IMAXShift===
In May 2016, IMAX announced the test launch of IMAXShift, a multimedia indoor cycling concept, but decided to discontinue it June 4, 2017.

===Virtual reality===
On September 2, 2016, IMAX announced plans to include virtual reality (VR) into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles that would use a new StarVR headset created by Acer. The VR experience was intended for short but interactive videos. IMAX opened a total of seven IMAX VR centers and established a fund for the creation of VR content, as well as partnering with Google for the production of IMAX VR cameras. However, , all seven IMAX VR centers have closed.

=== Entertainment ===
In the US, IMAX has mostly been used for specialty applications. The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately 40 minutes shorter running times than conventional films. Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and science centers. IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the Earth, climbing Mount Everest, exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and visiting the Antarctic. A film about the Mars Exploration Rovers, titled &quot;Roving Mars&quot; (2006), used exclusive data from the rovers.

An early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX format was &quot;The Rolling Stones: Live at the Max&quot; (1991), an 85-minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the rock band&#x27;s 1990 Steel Wheels tour, edited to give the impression of a single concert. In the 1990s, more entertainment short films were created, notably &quot;T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Haunted Castle&quot; in 2001 (both in 3D). In 1995, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud directed &quot;Wings of Courage&quot;, the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX. In 1998 and 1999, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; became the first short films produced using the IMAX format; both earned Academy Award nominations, with &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; becoming the only IMAX film to win an Oscar. In 2000, Disney produced &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, the first full-length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format.

=== Use in Hollywood productions ===
Before the end of the 1990s, theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in IMAX venues at the time, as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to run around two hours. Originally, IMAX and Pixar considered releasing &quot;Toy Story&quot; in IMAX 3D, but test results showed that the render resolution could not match the size of the IMAX image. DreamWorks in the early 2000s wanted to re-release &quot;Shrek&quot; in IMAX 3D, but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio. These failed attempts at re-releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer animation in their theaters. Their compilation &quot;CyberWorld&quot; was the result, which contained new original animation and IMAX-presented versions of computer-animated tests and music videos. &quot;Cyberworld&quot; even presented open-matte 3D versions of the bar sequence from &quot;Antz&quot; and the &quot;Homer3&quot; segment from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; both coincidentally were animated at Pacific Data Images.

Walt Disney Pictures became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process. Released on New Year&#x27;s Day in 2000, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was the studio&#x27;s first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature presented in IMAX theaters. It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release, but in agreeing with the company to release the film, the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi-channel and multi-layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack, similar to the Fantasound system Walt Disney had envisioned for the original film in 1940. The company agreed to Disney&#x27;s terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film. These included a limited engagement of four months (from January 1 to April 30) and 50% of the box office receipts. Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney&#x27;s terms to present the film; however, following the IMAX release, a standard 35 mm run followed in June at regular theaters.

Although &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; had a lukewarm financial run, the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant-screen format in the pipeline. In 2002, IMAX re-issues of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year. New digital masters were created from the original CAPS production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives. &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously. But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big-screen re-releases, including &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

With the unveiling of the DMR process (see below), Warner Bros. Pictures especially embraced the format beginning in 2003 with the two &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot;. Since &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; in 2004, Warner Bros. began releasing the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film franchise in IMAX to strong financial success. Also in 2004 the studio released Robert Zemeckis&#x27; motion-capture film &quot;The Polar Express&quot; in IMAX 3D. &quot;Polar Express&quot; became the most successful film released in IMAX theaters, producing at least a quarter of the film&#x27;s gross of $302 million from fewer than 100 IMAX screens. Success for Warner Bros. and IMAX followed in later years with &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it. In May 2009, J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; was released in IMAX venues for the initial two weeks of its theatrical run and opened to $8.3 million. The IMAX opening weekends of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; have since grossed $15 million.

Though they were not filmed with IMAX cameras, &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released. Both movies were filmed in high-resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame. &quot;Skyfall&quot; increased the visual information of the entire film while &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; optimized the finale battle with the Lizard. When James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; was restored and re-released in theaters there was also specially made an open-matte version for IMAX. In 2010 after years of successful IMAX DMR releases, Warner Bros. signed a deal to release up to 20 feature films in IMAX up to 2013, including educational documentaries that were in production.

In May 2015, Marvel Studios announced that its next two &quot;Avengers&quot; films – &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2019) – would be filmed entirely in IMAX, the first Hollywood feature films to do so, using a modified version of Arri&#x27;s Alexa 65 digital camera. The camera was used first to film select sequences in another Marvel production, 2016&#x27;s &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;.

===DMR (Digital Media Remastering)===

IMAX&#x27;s proprietary DMR (Digital Media Remastering) process up-converts conventional films to IMAX format. This special digital intermediate technology let IMAX venues show films shot on 35mm for conventional theaters. In 2002, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of projection limitations at the time, the studios had to edit &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; to have a shorter playing time. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters provide a run time of up to 175 minutes. Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in 35mm. But some filmmakers, such as producer Frank Marshall, point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70 mm 15 perf IMAX format, and that directors Ron Howard and George Lucas expected better. They note that the decline of Cinerama coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler, cheaper, technically inferior version, and view DMR with alarm. IMAX originally reserved the phrase &quot;the IMAX experience&quot; for true 70 mm productions, but now allows its use on DMR productions as well.

After &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 2003, no Hollywood studio engaged in re-releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until 2012 although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number. James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; underwent both 3D conversion and DMR conversion to 3D in 2012 as did &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;. In August 2012 IMAX and Paramount Pictures announced a one-week exclusive re-release of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; on September 7, 2012, to promote the release of the Blu-Ray collection. The film, before it underwent DMR, was already restored in a 4K digital intermediate with 7.1 surround sound from the original negative. The process for IMAX theaters, like with the complete restoration, was supervised by Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know if the 1981 print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer, so I came expecting a sort of grainy, muddy, and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago&quot;, Spielberg said. &quot;I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago.&quot;

===Feature films===
Many recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes; however, before 2018 no full-length feature film was shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format – the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras and the noise they produced made dialogue recording difficult. The 15/70 cameras have short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. However, these issues have been minimized thanks to the digital Arri Alexa IMAX camera, with two films having been shot entirely with the camera.

&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; features six sequences (a total of 28 minutes) shot using IMAX. According to the film&#x27;s press notes, this was the &quot;first time ever that a major feature film has been even partially shot using IMAX cameras&quot;. Even before &quot;Dark Knight&quot;, Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format, and he also used it for quiet scenes that it would make pictorially interesting. Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: &quot;if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie.&quot; Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative to eliminate generation loss, while scenes that were digitally mastered were scanned and printed out at 8 thousand lines of horizontal resolution (8K). When the film opened in 94 IMAX venues in 2008, all of them were sold out for the opening weekend.

A year later, director Michael Bay was inspired by IMAX&#x27;s use in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; to feature big-screen sequences in &quot;&quot;. The film&#x27;s co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an &quot;old school&quot; filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the two and a half-hour film. Bay later partially filmed the third &quot;Transformers&quot; film, &quot;&quot; in 3D but without IMAX. Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film, &quot;&quot;, in 2014. It was the first feature film shot using digital IMAX 3D cameras. He again used IMAX 3D cameras while shooting the fifth film, &quot;&quot;, filming 98% of the film with 2 Alexa/IMAX cameras attached together to a special mount.

Two years later, Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; filmed select sequences using IMAX cameras, and often used natural light. The film used a mix of 35mm film and regular 65mm and the IMAX 15/70 mm format. The set of guidelines they fine-tuned for this film included an edict to achieve maximum resolution whenever possible. &quot;We would have preferred to shoot the entire movie in IMAX,&quot; says cinematographer of the film Emmanuel Lubezki. &quot;When the 65mm and IMAX scenes do appear in the movie, they give you a jolt. It&#x27;s a feeling of enhancement and majesty. It&#x27;s almost as if someone cleaned off the window you were looking through&quot;. However the film wasn&#x27;t screened on any IMAX screen.

After &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, Brad Bird&#x27;s &quot;&quot; included 25 minutes of footage shot using IMAX cameras. Bird believed that using IMAX format would bring back &quot;a level of showmanship&quot; to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing &quot;first runs&quot; in favor of wider initial releases. He also added that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion than digital 3D due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses. &quot;Ghost Protocol&quot; opened on December 16, 2011, in almost 500 IMAX venues worldwide a week before its wide release where it earned third place in the box office and $12 million.

As with &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Christopher Nolan decided to film sequences of the sequel, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, in 15/70mm IMAX. Nolan elected not to film in 3D and stated that he intends to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. In a then-Hollywood record, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; featured 72 minutes of footage shot in 70mm IMAX (roughly 2.5 times that of &quot;The Dark Knight&#x27;s&quot; 28 minutes, however, this record was later overtaken by another Nolan film, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, which featured 79 minutes of IMAX) Because of the considerable noise IMAX cameras make, they used standard 35mm cameras to shoot dialogue scenes, and dubbed dialogue in scenes shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX plans to run the film in its theaters for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks in some theaters.

J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Francis Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;, Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;Lucy&quot;, and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar&quot; are films that were released between 2013 and 2014 that had sequences filmed with 15/70 IMAX cameras.

On July 9, 2014, Bad Robot (J. J. Abrams&#x27;s production company) confirmed via a picture uploaded to Twitter that one sequence in Disney and Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; would be captured with the IMAX 15/70 perf film camera, in addition to the standard 35 mm film cameras that Abrams and his cinematographer Dan Mindel have employed for shooting the movie. The next installment in the franchise Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, released in December 2017, also included sequences shot with 15/70mm IMAX cameras.

Adele&#x27;s music video &quot;Hello&quot;, released in 2015, became the first music video that was partially filmed with IMAX cameras.

In April 2015, Marvel Studios announced that Russo brothers&#x27; &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; would be the first film to use the new ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D digital camera, which was used to shoot approximately 15 minutes of the film. In May 2015, the Russo brothers announced that their films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, released in 2018 and 2019, the first Hollywood feature films shot entirely in IMAX, albeit using ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras instead of 15/70 perf film.

Rihanna&#x27;s music video &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, released in 2016, was the second music video to use the new ARRI Alexa IMAX camera.

Other films between 2016 and 2021 that captured with IMAX cameras were Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Sully&quot;, Damien Chazelle&#x27;s &quot;First Man&quot;, Jon Favreau&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King, &quot;Patty Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; and Cary Joji Fukunaga&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. &quot;Sully&quot; was filmed with ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras for almost the entire film and &quot;The Lion King&quot; for select sequences. The rest had sequences that were filmed with 15/70 mm IMAX cameras.

Five Chinese titles have been captured with IMAX digital cameras (including two with IMAX-certified cameras); selected scenes in Jiang Wen&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Bullets&quot; in 2014, the entirety of Guan Hu&#x27;s &quot;The Eight Hundred&quot; in 2020, almost all of Chen Sicheng&#x27;s &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; in 2021 and the entirety of Chen Kaige, Tsui Hark and Dante Lam&#x27;s &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin&quot; and &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin II&quot; with IMAX-certified Red Ranger Monstro cameras in 2020 and 2022.

Christopher Nolan used 15/70 IMAX cameras again on his next film, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;. However, unlike the previous films, where he used the cameras for select sequences, Nolan used IMAX as the primary shooting format, with 75% (about 79 minutes) of the 106-minute film featuring footage shot in 70 mm IMAX (breaking the aforementioned record that a previous Nolan film, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, held). This was possible due to the sparsity of dialogue in the film, as 15/70 mm IMAX cameras are notoriously noisy (a few dialogue-heavy scenes were shot with regular 70 mm film cameras from Panavision). IMAX cameras were also used hand-held for the first time, as Nolan was advised by both Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard that it was the best way to shoot on vessels. &quot;Dunkirk&quot; received the widest release on 70mm IMAX since his last film, &quot;Interstellar&quot;, with the film being released on the format in 37 theaters around the world. The director&#x27;s 2020 film, &quot;Tenet&quot; filmed 76 minutes with 15/70 mm IMAX cameras, the rest of the film was shot with regular 70 mm film cameras from Panavision. The film&#x27;s six-minute opening sequence was shown before IMAX screenings of &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. Tenet was shown over 13 theaters globally in 70mm IMAX.

In September 2020, IMAX announced a new program called &#x27;Filmed in IMAX&#x27;, a new partnership with camera manufacturers to meet filmmaker demand for the format. Through the program, IMAX will certify digital cameras with brands including ARRI, Panavision, Red Digital Cinema and Sony to work in the IMAX format when paired with its post-production process. The new program certifies the ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF, Panavision Millennium DXL2, Red Ranger Monstro and Komodo and Sony&#x27;s CineAlta Venice cameras along with the ARRI Alexa IMAX camera previously announced with ARRI Rental. As part of the program, IMAX will also certify independent camera rental houses that can supply certified cameras worldwide, starting with Panavision, ARRI and Keslow Camera. IMAX will select only a limited number of films to participate in the program each year. James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (shot with the Red Ranger Monstro and Komodo), Colin Tilley&#x27;s &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have Love, I Want Power&quot; (shot with the ARRI Alexa IMAX), Destin Daniel Cretton&#x27;s &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;, Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, Chloé Zhao&#x27;s &quot;Eternals&quot; (all three titles shot with the ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF) and Joseph Kosinski&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice) are among the first releases certified as &#x27;Filmed in IMAX&#x27; through the new program.

Other films between 2022 and 2024 that are captured with IMAX-certified cameras are Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (Shot with the Panavision Millennium DXL2), Taika Waititi&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (shot with ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF), Ryan Coogler&#x27;s &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice), Peyton Reed&#x27;s &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (Shot with the ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF), Michael B. Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Creed III&quot; (shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice), James Wan&#x27;s &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot; (Shot with the Panavision Millennium DXL2), James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (Shot with the Red V-Raptor), Christopher McQuarrie&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (Shot with ARRI Alexa LF, Mini LF and Sony CineAlta Venice), Nia DaCosta&#x27;s &quot;The Marvels&quot; (Shot with the ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF), Angel Manuel Soto&#x27;s &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;, Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (shot with ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF).

In March 2022, IMAX plans to develop new 15/70 cameras that would be created with input from filmmakers such as Jordan Peele and Christopher Nolan. The work will be done in collaboration with Kodak, camera maker Panavision, and post-production company and film lab FotoKem. The large format company is also consulting with leading cinematographers including Linus Sandgren (&quot;No Time to Die&quot;), Rachel Morrison (&quot;Black Panther&quot;), Bradford Young (&quot;Arrival&quot;), Dan Mindel (&quot;Star Trek&quot;) and Nolan&#x27;s go-to DP, Hoyte van Hoytema. Peele&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;Nope&quot; was filmed with the current generation of 15/70 IMAX cameras and Kodak 65mm film. IMAX intends to add at least four new 15/70mm cameras to its offing over the next two years, with the first new camera expected to be put into use by late 2023.

In April 2022, it was announced that the 2022 Pixar animated film &quot;Lightyear&quot; to have created a virtual IMAX camera in its production and the first &#x27;animated&#x27; film to captured it. &quot;We created a virtual IMAX camera with 1.43:1 aspect ratio and developed a pipeline to allow us to simultaneously shoot the film for IMAX, and then crop down for our standard 2.39:1 format,&quot; Jane Yen, Lightyear visual effects supervisor, revealed during a press conference. One of the two director&#x27;s of photography Jeremy Lasky later said &quot;I think this is the first that has been made for IMAX in this way. There&#x27;s about a third of the film that was shot for IMAX. And the easy answer is that we have a set of lenses. And when I say lenses, I mean CG made&quot;. A set of lenses that recreate the look of an anamorphic lens, which is your typical wide screen. You&#x27;ll notice things out of focus in the background instead of being round are like stretched a little bit. There&#x27;s like that blue lens flare that you see. It&#x27;s anamorphic lenses where the way to shoot wide screen in the sixties, seventies, and then later got phased out a little bit, but they&#x27;re still used today. But those effects call to a period of sci-fi that we were looking at, which is why those same lenses or versions of those lenses were used on &quot;WALL-E&quot;&quot;. Later he recommend &quot;So for the 30 or so minutes of the movie in IMAX, we shot with those lenses opened up to the 1.43 aspect ratio and composed for that while keeping the composition as clear and as solid for a 2.39 crop from the center. So the wide screen image is pulled out of the IMAX image. Which all sounds really technical, but all it really means is, when you&#x27;re watching it an IMAX screen, we were thinking about those scenes as IMAX. And it wasn&#x27;t just some after the film was done, blow up of the movie&quot;.

In December 2022, it was announced that IMAX have certified the Red V-Raptor as a new certified camera and that James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; will be the first film to shoot with the cameras instead of the Red Ranger Monstro.

Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; was also filmed with the current generation of 15/70mm IMAX cameras and Kodak 65 mm film. It is also the first film to shoot sections in IMAX black and white analog photography.

=== In space exploration ===
IMAX cameras have flown in space on 17 occasions, NASA astronauts have used handheld IMAX cameras to document missions, and an IMAX camera has also been mounted in the payload bay of the Shuttle. Space shuttle mission STS-41-C filmed the deployment of the LDEF (Long duration exposure facility) and the repair of the Solar Max satellite. This footage was included in the 1985 IMAX movie &quot;The Dream Is Alive&quot;. Kennedy Space Center in Florida has two IMAX 3D theaters. These show space movies, including footage shot on missions and narrated by celebrities. Two of the IMAX cameras used by NASA are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.

== Awards ==
In 1996, IMAX was awarded the Oscar for Scientific and Technical Achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The award cited IMAX&#x27;s innovations in creating and developing a method of filming and exhibiting large-format, wide-angle motion pictures.

To date, ten native-format IMAX format films have received Academy Awards nomination, with one winner. While on technical aspects and the usage of the IMAX system, only Hoyte van Hoytema&#x27;s cinematography on &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; has won, while Wally Pfister&#x27;s cinematography on &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and Hoytema’s cinematography on &quot;Dunkirk&quot; have also earned nominations.

Many IMAX films have been remastered into HDTV format (cropped to fit into HDTV&#x27;s 16:9 aspect ratio) for the MOJO HD, HDNet and HD Theatre networks and release on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. In July 2005, the BFI IMAX Cinema in London became the first to host live music concerts, using a digital non-IMAX projector. The Science Museum London and BFI IMAX Cinema have also hosted computer game tournaments using digital projectors. Several amusement park attractions have integrated IMAX film segments, including Back to the Future: The Ride formerly at Universal Studios in Florida and California, Horizons formerly at Epcot and Soarin’ Over California at Disney California Adventure and Epcot.

<doc id="173790" wikidata="Q728360" url="?curid=173790" title="Wayne Wang">
<text>Wayne Wang (; born January 12, 1949) is a Hong Kong-American film director, producer, and screenwriter. Considered a pioneer of Asian-American cinema, he was one of the first Chinese-American filmmakers to gain a major foothold in Hollywood. His films, often independently produced, deal with issues of contemporary Asian-American culture and domestic life.

His best known works include &quot;Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart&quot; (1985), &quot;Eat a Bowl of Tea&quot; (1989), the Amy Tan literary adaptation &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1993), &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997), and &quot;A Thousand Years of Good Prayers&quot; (2007). Other films include the Harvey Keitel and William Hurt–starring comedy &quot;Smoke&quot; (1995), the family film &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot; (2005), the romantic comedies &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002) and &quot;Last Holiday&quot; (2006), and the controversial erotic drama &quot;The Center of the World&quot; (2001).

He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including a Bodil Award, a Silver Bear, two Golden Shells, with BAFTA Award, Sundance Grand Jury, Golden Lion, and César Award nominations.

==Biography==
Wang was born and raised in Hong Kong, and named after his father&#x27;s favorite movie star, John Wayne. When he was 17, his parents arranged for him to move to the United States to study, to prepare for medical school. Wang, however, soon put this plan aside when his &quot;eyes were completely opened&quot; by new experience, and as he turned to the arts, studying film and television at California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland.

After graduating from film school, Wang taught English to new immigrants in Chinatown.

&quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; (1982), &quot;Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart&quot; (1985), and &quot;Eat a Bowl of Tea&quot; (1989) established his reputation. He is best known for &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1993), &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), and the independent features &quot;Smoke&quot; (1995) and &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot; (1999). At the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, Wang premiered two feature films, &quot;A Thousand Years of Good Prayers&quot; and &quot;The Princess of Nebraska&quot;, as well as appearing in the Arthur Dong documentary film &quot;Hollywood Chinese&quot;.

He won the Golden Shell at the San Sebastian Film Festival in September 2007 for &quot;A Thousand Years of Good Prayers&quot;.

In 2016, he won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the San Diego Asian Film Festival.

==Personal life==
He is married to former Miss Hong Kong and actress Cora Miao, and lives in San Francisco and New York City.

<doc id="173794" wikidata="Q19896779" url="?curid=173794" title="Great Patriotic War (term)">
<text>The Great Patriotic War () is a term used in Russia and some other former republics of the Soviet Union to describe the conflict fought during the period from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945 along the many fronts of the Eastern Front of World War II, primarily between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. For some legal purposes, this period may be extended to 11 May 1945 to include the end of the Prague offensive.

== History ==
The term &quot;Patriotic War&quot; refers to the Russian resistance to the French invasion of Russia under Napoleon I, which became known as the &quot;Patriotic War of 1812&quot;. In Russian, the term originally referred to a war on one&#x27;s own territory ( means &quot;the fatherland&quot;), as opposed to a campaign abroad (), and later was reinterpreted as a war the fatherland, i.e. a defensive war for one&#x27;s homeland. Sometimes the Patriotic War of 1812 was also referred to as the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; (); the phrase first appeared in 1844 and became popular on the eve of the centenary of the Patriotic War of 1812.

After 1914, the phrase was applied to World War I. It was the name of a special war-time appendix to the magazine &quot;Theater and Life&quot; () in Saint Petersburg, and referred to the Eastern Front of World War I, where Russia fought against the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The phrases &quot;Second Patriotic War&quot; () and &quot;Great World Patriotic War&quot; () were also used during World War I in Russia.

The term &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; re-appeared in the official newspaper of the CPSU, &quot;Pravda&quot;, on 23 June 1941, just a day after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. It was found in the title of &quot;The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet People&quot; (), a long article by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, a member of Pravda editors&#x27; collegium. The phrase was intended to motivate the population to defend the Soviet fatherland and to expel the invader, and a reference to the Patriotic War of 1812 was seen as a great morale booster. During the Soviet period, historians engaged in huge distortions to make history fit with Communist ideology, with Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov and Prince Pyotr Bagration transformed into peasant generals, Alexander I alternatively ignored or vilified, and the war becoming a massive &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot; fought by the ordinary people of Russia with almost no involvement on the part of the government. The invasion by Germany was called the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; by the Soviet government to evoke comparisons with the victory by Tsar Alexander I over Napoleon&#x27;s invading army.

The term (Patriotic War or Fatherland War) was officially recognized by establishment of the Order of the Patriotic War on 20 May 1942, awarded for heroic deeds.

== Usage ==

The term is not generally used outside the former Soviet Union, and the closest term is the Eastern Front of World War II (1941–1945). Neither term covers the initial phase of World War II in Eastern Europe, during which the USSR, then still in a non-aggression pact with Germany, invaded eastern Poland (1939), the Baltic states (1940), Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (1940) and Finland (1939–1940). The term also does not cover the Soviet–Japanese War (1945).

In Russia and some other post-Soviet countries, the term is given great significance; it is accepted as a representation of the most important part of World War II. Until 2014, Uzbekistan was the only nation in the Commonwealth of Independent States that had not recognized the term, referring to it as World War II on the state holiday – the Day of Remembrance and Honour.

On 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian parliament replaced the term &quot;Great Patriotic War (1941–1945)&quot; (&quot;Velyka vitchyzniana viina&quot;) in the country&#x27;s law with the &quot;Second World War (1939–1945)&quot; (&quot;Druha svitova viina&quot;), as part of a set of decommunization laws. Also in 2015, Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;Victory Day over Nazism in World War II&quot; was established as a national holiday in accordance with the law of &quot;On Perpetuation of Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939–1945&quot;. The new holiday was celebrated on May 9 and replaced the Soviet-Russian Victory Day, which is also celebrated on May 9. These laws were adopted by the Ukrainian parliament within the package of laws on decommunization. In 2023 Ukraine abolished the 2015 9 May &quot;Victory Day over Nazism&quot; holiday and replaced it with the new public holiday &quot;Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939 – 1945&quot; which is celebrated on 8 May annually.

<text>Jilin is one of the three provinces of Northeast China. Its capital and largest city is Changchun. Jilin borders North Korea (Rasŏn, North Hamgyong, Ryanggang and Chagang) and Russia (Primorsky Krai) to the east, Heilongjiang to the north, Liaoning to the south, and Inner Mongolia to the west.

Along with the rest of Northeast China, Jilin underwent an early period of industrialization. However, Jilin&#x27;s economy, characterized by heavy industry, has been facing economic difficulties with privatization. This prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called &quot;Revitalize the Northeast&quot;. The region contains large deposits of oil shale.

==Name==

The name &quot;Jilin&quot; originates from &quot;girin ula&quot;, a Manchu phrase meaning &quot;along the river&quot;, shortened to Kirin in English. This Manchu term was transcribed into &quot;jilin wula&quot; ( ,  ) in Chinese characters and shortened the first two characters, which are transcribed in English as Chi-lin (Wade-Giles) and later &quot;Jilin&quot; (Hanyu Pinyin).

== History ==

In ancient times, Jilin was inhabited by the Xianbei, Sushen, the Mohe, Jurchens, and the Wùjí (). The kingdoms of Buyeo and Goguryeo ruled parts of this area.

The region then fell successively under the domination of the Xiongnu, Xianbei state, Goguryeo, Balhae, Khitan Liao Dynasty, the Jurchen Jin Dynasty, and the Mongol Yuan dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, much of the area was under the control of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiyūn), whose area of control extended to encompass much of what is Russia&#x27;s Primorsky Krai today.

After the Primorsky Krai area was ceded to Russia in 1860, the government began to open the area up to Han Chinese migrants, most of whom came from Shandong. By the beginning of the 20th century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into Manchukuo, a puppet state set up by Japan. Changchun (then called Xinjing), capital of Jilin today, was made the capital of Manchukuo. After the defeat of Japan in 1945, the Red Army captured Jilin after Operation August Storm. The region, with the rest of northeastern China, was ceded to the Communists by the Soviet Union. Manchuria was the staging ground from which the communists eventually conquered the rest of China in the Chinese Civil War.

In 1949, Jilin province was smaller, encompassing only the environs of Changchun and Jilin City, and the capital was at Jilin City, while Changchun was a municipality independent from the province. In the 1950s, Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the Cultural Revolution, Jilin was expanded again to include a part of Inner Mongolia, giving it a border with the independent state of Mongolia, though this was later reversed.

In recent times Jilin has, with the rest of heavy industry-based Northeast China, been facing economic difficulties with privatization. This prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called &quot;Revitalize the Northeast&quot;.

<text>Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin (; 8 July 1838 – 8 March 1917) was a German general and later inventor of the Zeppelin rigid airships. His name became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s. He founded the company Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.

==Family and personal life==

Ferdinand was the scion of a . Zepelin, the family&#x27;s eponymous hometown, is a small community outside the town of Bützow, in Mecklenburg.

Ferdinand was the son of Württemberg Minister and Hofmarschall Friedrich Jerôme Wilhelm Karl Graf von Zeppelin (1807–1886) and his wife Amélie Françoise Pauline (born Macaire d&#x27;Hogguer) (1816–1852). Ferdinand spent his childhood with his sister and brother at their Girsberg manor near Konstanz, where he was educated by private tutors. Ferdinand married Isabella Freiin von Wolff in Berlin. She was from the house of Alt-Schwanenburg (located in the present-day town of Gulbene in Latvia, then part of Livonia). They had a daughter, Helene (Hella) von Zeppelin (1879–1967) who in 1909 married Graf Alexander von Brandenstein-Zeppelin (1881–1949).

Ferdinand had a nephew , who volunteered at the start of the First World War, after he was past military age, to become general staff officer assigned to the military airship LZ 12 Sachsen.

==Army career==
In 1853, Count Zeppelin left to attend the polytechnic at Stuttgart, and in 1855 he became a cadet of the military school at Ludwigsburg and then started his career as an army officer in the army of Württemberg.

By 1858, Zeppelin had been promoted to lieutenant, and that year he was given leave to study science, engineering and chemistry at Tübingen. Würtemberg&#x27;s mobilising for the Austro-Sardinian War interrupted this study in 1859 when he was called up to the &quot;&quot; (Würtemberg engineering corps) at Ulm.

In 1863, Zeppelin took leave to act as an observer for the Union&#x27;s Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War in Virginia. Later, he travelled to the Upper Midwest with a party that probably included two Russians. Led by Native American (probably Ojibwe) guides, they canoed and portaged from the western end of Lake Superior up the St. Louis River and across to Crow Wing, Minnesota, on the Upper Mississippi River. On reaching Saint Paul, Minnesota (via stagecoach and hired carriage), Zeppelin encountered German-born itinerant balloonist John Steiner and made his first aerial ascent with him from a site near the International Hotel in downtown St. Paul on 19 August. Many years later he attributed the beginning of his thinking about dirigible lighter-than-air craft to this experience.

In 1865, Zeppelin was appointed adjutant of the King of Württemberg and as general staff officer participated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He was awarded the &quot;Ritterkreuz&quot; (Knight&#x27;s Cross) of the Military Merit Order of Württemberg. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, during which he narrowly avoided capture, made him famous among many Germans.

From 1882 to 1885, Zeppelin was commander of the 19th Uhlans in Ulm, and was then appointed to be the envoy of Württemberg in Berlin. In 1890, he gave up the post to return to army service and was given command of a Prussian cavalry brigade. His handling of this at the 1890 autumn manoeuvres was severely criticised, and he was forced to retire from the Army, albeit with the rank of .

==Airships==
Ferdinand von Zeppelin served as an official observer with the Union Army during the American Civil War. During the Peninsular Campaign, he visited the balloon camp of Thaddeus S. C. Lowe shortly after Lowe&#x27;s services were terminated by the Army. Zeppelin then travelled to St. Paul, where the German-born former Army balloonist John Steiner offered tethered flights. His first ascent in a balloon is said to have been the inspiration of his later interest in aeronautics.

Zeppelin&#x27;s ideas for large airships were first expressed in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874. Inspired by a recent lecture given by Heinrich von Stephan on the subject of &quot;World Postal Services and Air Travel&quot;, he outlined the basic principle of his later craft: a large rigidly-framed outer envelope containing a number of separate gasbags. In 1887, the success of Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs&#x27; 1884 airship &quot;La France&quot; prompted him to send a letter to the King of Württemberg about the military necessity for dirigibles and the lack of German development in this field.

After his resignation from the army in 1891 at age 52, Zeppelin devoted his full attention to airships. He hired the engineer Theodor Gross to make tests of possible materials and to assess available engines for both fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio. He also had air propellers tested and strove to obtain higher purity hydrogen gas from suppliers. Zeppelin was so confident of his concept that in June 1891 he wrote to the King of Württemberg&#x27;s secretary, announcing he was to start building, and shortly after requested a review from the Prussian Army&#x27;s Chief of General Staff. The next day Zeppelin almost gave up as he realized he had underestimated air resistance, but resumed work on hearing that Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld made light but powerful engines, information soon shown to be overoptimistic. Whereupon Zeppelin urged his supporter Max von Duttenhofer to press Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft for more efficient engines so as not to fall behind the French. Duttenhofer wrote to Gross threatening to withdraw support, and Zeppelin shortly afterwards sacked Gross, citing Gross&#x27;s lack of support and writing that he was &quot;an obstacle in my path&quot;.

Despite those setbacks, Zeppelin&#x27;s organization had refined his idea: a rigid aluminium framework covered in a fabric envelope; separate multiple internal gas cells, each free to expand and contract thus obviating the need for ballonets; a modular frame allowing addition of sections and gas cells; and the controls, engines and gondola rigidly attached. After publishing the idea in March 1892 he hired the engineer Theodor Kober who started work testing and further refining the design. Zeppelin submitted Kober&#x27;s 1893 detailed designs to the Prussian Airship Service, whose committee reviewed it in 1894. In June 1895 this committee recommended minimum funds be granted, but withdrew this offer and rejected the design in July.

One month later, in August 1895, Zeppelin received a patent for Kober&#x27;s design and described as an &quot;airship-train&quot; (&quot;&quot; [Steerable airship-train with several carrier structures arranged one behind another].) The patent describes an airship consisting of three rigid sections flexibly connected. The front section, intended to contain the crew and engines, was long with a gas capacity of 9514 cu m (336,000 cu ft): the middle section was long with an intended useful load of and the rear section long with an intended load of 

In early 1896, Zeppelin&#x27;s lecture on steerable airship designs given to the Association of German Engineers (VDI) so impressed them that the VDI launched a public appeal for financial support for him. This led to a first contact with Carl Berg who supplied aluminium alloys which Zeppelin had tested, and by May 1898 they, together with Philipp Holzmann, Daimler, Max von Eyth, Carl von Linde, and Friedrich Voith, had formed the joint stock company &quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Luftschiffahrt&quot;. Zeppelin invested 441,000 Marks, over half the total capital. Actual construction then started of what was to be the first successful rigid airship, the Zeppelin LZ1.

Berg&#x27;s involvement with the project later led to allegations that Zeppelin had used the patent and designs of David Schwarz&#x27;s airship of 1897. Berg had signed a contract with Schwartz under the terms of which he undertook not to supply aluminium to any other airship manufacturer. He later made a payment to Schwartz&#x27;s widow as compensation for dissolving this arrangement. Claims that Zeppelin had been influenced by Schwartz were denied by Eckener in 1938 and also rejected by later historians. Zeppelin&#x27;s design was &quot;radically different&quot; in both its scale and its framework from that of Schwarz.
On 2 July 1900, Zeppelin made the first flight with the LZ 1 over Lake Constance near Friedrichshafen in southern Germany. The airship rose from the ground and remained in the air for 20 minutes, but was damaged on landing. After repairs and some modifications two further flights were made by LZ 1 in October 1900, However the airship was not considered successful enough to justify investment by the government, and since the experiments had exhausted Count Zeppelin&#x27;s funds, he was forced to suspend his work.

Zeppelin still enjoyed the support of the King of Württemberg, who authorised a state lottery which raised 124,000 marks. A contribution of 50,000 marks was received from Prussia, and Zeppelin raised the remainder of the necessary money by mortgaging his wife&#x27;s estates. Still supported by Daimler and Carl Berg, construction of his second airship, the LZ 2, was started in April 1905. It was completed by 30 November, when it was first taken out of its hangar, but a ground-handling mishap caused the bows to be pulled into the water, damaging the forward control surfaces. Repairs were completed by 17 January 1906, when LZ 2 made its only flight. Too much ballast was jettisoned on takeoff, causing the airship to rise to an altitude of . Here a stiff breeze was encountered, and although the airship was at first able to overcome this, the failure of the forward engine due to cooling problems followed by the failure of the other due to a broken clutch-spring left the airship at the mercy of the wind. It was brought down near Kisslegg in the Allgäu mountains, with some damage caused by the stern&#x27;s striking some trees during mooring, but was more severely damaged by high winds the following night, and had to be dismantled.
In May 1906, work started on a third airship, LZ 3. This was the same size and configuration as LZ 2, but had a greater gas capacity. Finished by the end of the year, it made two successful flights at a speed of , and in 1907 attained a speed of . The success of LZ 3 produced a change in the official attitude to his work, and the Reichstag voted that he should be awarded 500,000 marks to continue his work. However the purchase by the Government of an airship was made conditional on the successful completion of a 24‑hour trial flight. Knowing that this was beyond the capabilities of LZ 3, work was started on a larger airship, the LZ 4. This first flew on 20 June 1908. The final financial breakthrough only came after the Zeppelin LZ 4 was destroyed by fire at Echterdingen after breaking free of its moorings during a storm. The airship&#x27;s earlier flights had excited public interest in the development of the airships, and a subsequent collection campaign raised over 6 million German marks. The money was used to create the &#x27;Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin GmbH&#x27; and the Zeppelin foundation (&quot;Zeppelin Stiftung&quot;).

Following the destruction of LZ 4, LZ 3, which had been damaged when the floating hangar broke free of its mooring during a storm, was repaired: at the same time it was lengthened by 8 m. It was re-inflated on 21 October 1908 and after a series of short test flights a flight lasting 5 hours 55 minutes took place on 27 October with the Kaiser&#x27;s brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board. On 7 November, with Crown Prince William as a passenger,
it flew to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ 3 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which a short demonstration flight over Lake Constance was made and Zeppelin awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.

Although a replacement for LZ 4, the LZ 5 was built and accepted into Army service as L II, Zeppelin&#x27;s relationship with the military authorities continued to be poor, and deteriorated considerably due to his criticism of the Army following the loss of L II, which was carried away from its moorings and wrecked on 25 April 1910. However, the business director of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, Alfred Colsman, came up with a scheme to capitalise on the public enthusiasm for Zeppelin&#x27;s airships by establishing a passenger-carrying business.

Until 1914, the German Aviation Association (&quot;Deutsche Luftschiffahrtsgesellschaft&quot; or DELAG) transported 37,250 people on over 1,600 flights without an incident. Within a few years the zeppelin revolution began creating the age of air transportation. During the First World War, Imperial Germany decided to deploy Zeppelins as long-distance bombers and launched numerous attacks upon Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.

==Family==
Count Everhard von Zeppelin, Second Lieutenant in the German Lancers, married November 1895,
Mary &quot;Mamie&quot; McGarvey, daughter of Canadian magnate William Henry McGarvey, owner of the oil wells of Galicia and his wife, Helena J. Weslowska.
A former Count von Zeppelin married a granddaughter of the 1st Earl of Ranfurly.

==Legacy==

Count Zeppelin died early in 1917, before the end of the First World War. He did not live to witness either the provisional shutdown of the Zeppelin project by the Treaty of Versailles or the second resurgence of the Zeppelins under his successor Hugo Eckener.

The unfinished Second World War German aircraft carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, and two rigid airships (the world-circling LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, and LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot;, twin to the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;) were named after him.

In 1975, Zeppelin was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

==Cultural references==
The name of the British rock group Led Zeppelin derives from his airships. His granddaughter Countess Eva von Zeppelin once threatened to sue them for illegal use of their family name while they were performing in Copenhagen.

A 1974 episode of Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus (Series 4, Episode 1, &quot;The Golden Age Of Ballooning&quot;) features a skit in which Count Zeppelin (Graham Chapman) has taken various members of the government up in his ship for a promotional flight, only to get angry and throw each guest out of the ship&#x27;s gondola while it is still in the air over the perceived insult of everyone referring to the craft as a &quot;balloon&quot; instead of his preferred &quot;airship&quot; or &quot;Zeppelin&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
* Honorary citizen of the cities of Friedrichshafen (1907), Konstanz, Worms and Stuttgart (1908), Munich and Lindau (1909), Baden-Baden (1910), and Ulm (1912)
* Honorary doctorates from the Universities of Leipzig, Tübingen (1908) and Dresden

<text>In music theory, the wolf fifth (sometimes also called Procrustean fifth,
or imperfect fifth)
is a particularly dissonant musical interval spanning seven semitones. Strictly, the term refers to an interval produced by a specific tuning system, widely used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: the quarter-comma meantone temperament. More broadly, it is also used to refer to similar intervals (of close, but variable magnitudes) produced by other tuning systems, including Pythagorean and most meantone temperaments.

When the twelve notes within the octave of a chromatic scale are tuned using the quarter-comma meantone systems of temperament, one of the twelve intervals apparently spanning seven semitones is actually a diminished sixth, which turns out to be much wider than the in-tune genuine fifths,
In mean-tone systems, this interval is usually from C to A or from G to E but can be moved in either direction to favor certain groups of keys.
The eleven perfect fifths sound almost perfectly consonant. Conversely, the diminished sixth used as a substitute is severely dissonant: It sounds like the howl of a wolf, because of a phenomenon called beating. Since the diminished sixth is &quot;nominally&quot; enharmonically equivalent to a perfect fifth, but in meantone temperament, enharmonic notes are only nearby (within about sharp or flat); the discordance of substituted interval is called the &quot;wolf fifth&quot;.

Besides the above-mentioned quarter comma meantone, other tuning systems may produce severely dissonant diminished sixths. Conversely, in 12 tone equal temperament (12-TET), which is currently the most commonly used tuning system, the diminished sixth is not a wolf fifth, as it has exactly the same size as a perfect fifth.

By extension, any interval which is perceived as severely dissonant and regarded as &quot;howling like a wolf&quot; is called a wolf interval. For instance, in quarter comma meantone, the augmented second, augmented third, augmented fifth, diminished fourth, and diminished seventh may be called wolf intervals, as their frequency ratio significantly deviates from the ratio of the corresponding justly tuned interval (see Size of quarter-comma meantone intervals).

== Temperament and the wolf ==
The reason for &quot;wolf&quot; tones in meantone tunings is the bad practice of performers pressing the key for an enharmonic note as a substitute for a note that has not been tuned on the keyboard; e.g. pressing the black key tuned to G when the music calls for A. In all meantone tuning systems, sharps and flats are not equivalent; a relic of which, that persists in modern musical practice, is to fastidiously distinguish the musical notation for two notes which are the same pitch in equal temperament (&quot;enharmonic&quot;) and played with the same key on an equal tempered keyboard (such as C and D, or E and F), despite the fact that they are the same in all but theory.

In order to close the circle of fifths in 12 note scales, twelve fifths must average out to .
Each of the first eleven fifths (starting with the fifth &quot;below&quot; the tonic, the subdominant: F in the key of C, when each black key is tuned to a meantone sharp / no flats) has a value of , where is some small number of cents that all fifths are detuned by.
In meantone temperament tuning systems, the twelfth and last fifth does not exist in the 12 note octave on the keyboard. The actual note available is really a diminished sixth: The interval is , and is not a correct meantone fifth, which would be The difference of between the available pitch and the intended pitch is the source of the &quot;wolf&quot;. The &quot;wolf&quot; effect is particularly grating for values of that approach .
A simplistic reaction to the problem is: &quot;Of it sounds awful: You&#x27;re playing the wrong note!&quot;

With only 12 notes available in a conventional keyboard&#x27;s octave, in meantone tunings there must always be omitted notes. For example, one choice for tuning an instrument in meantone, to play music in the key of C, would be
with this set of chosen notes in bold face, and some of the omitted notes shown in grey.

This limitation on the set meantone notes and their sharps and flats that can be tuned on a keyboard at any one time, was the main reason that Baroque period keyboard and orchestral harp performers were obliged to retune their instruments in mid-performance breaks, in order to make available all the accidentals called for by the next piece of music.
Some music that modulates too far between keys cannot be played on a single keyboard or single harp, no matter how it is tuned: In the example tuning above, music that modulates from C major into both A major (which needs G for the seventh note) and C minor (which needs A for its sixth note) is not possible, since each of the two meantone notes, G and A, both require the same string in each octave on the instrument to be tuned to their different pitches.

For expediency, keyboard players substitute the wrong diminished sixth interval for a genuine meantone fifth (or neglect retuning their instrument). Though not available, a genuine meantone fifth &quot;would&quot; be consonant, but in meantone tuning systems (where isn&#x27;t zero) the sharp of any note is &quot;always&quot; different from the flat of the note above it. A meantone keyboard that allowed unlimited modulation theoretically would require an infinite number of separate sharp and flat keys, and then double sharps and double flats, and so on: There must inevitably be missing pitches on a standard keyboard with only 12 notes in an octave. The value of changes depending on the tuning system. In other tuning systems (such as Pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone), each of the eleven fifths may have a size of thus the diminished sixth is If their difference is very large, as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system, the diminished sixth is used as a substitute for a fifth, it is called a &quot;wolf fifth&quot;.

In terms of frequency ratios, in order to close the circle of fifths, the product of the fifths&#x27; ratios must be (since the twelve fifths, if closed in a circle, span seven octaves exactly; an octave is and and if is the size of a fifth, or will be the size of the wolf.

We likewise find varied tunings for the thirds: Major thirds must average and to each pair of thirds of size we have a third (or diminished fourth) of leading to eight thirds narrower or wider, and four diminished fourths wider or narrower than average. Three of these diminished fourths form major triads with perfect fifths, but one of them forms a major triad substituting the diminished sixth for a real fifth. If the diminished sixth is a wolf interval, this triad is called the wolf major triad.

Similarly, we obtain nine minor thirds of and three minor thirds (or augmented seconds) of 

=== Quarter comma meantone ===
In quarter-comma meantone, the frequency ratio for the fifth is , which is about flatter than an equal tempered (or exactly one twelfth of a diesis) and so the wolf is about or sharper than a perfect fifth of ratio exactly and this is the original &quot;howling&quot; wolf fifth.

The flat minor thirds are only about sharper than a subminor third of ratio , and the sharp major thirds, of ratio exactly are about flatter than the supermajor third of Meantone tunings with slightly flatter fifths produce even closer approximations to the subminor and supermajor thirds and corresponding triads. These thirds therefore hardly deserve the appellation of wolf, and in fact historically have not been given that name.

The wolf fifth of quarter-comma meantone can be approximated by the 7-limit just interval , which has a size of 

=== Pythagorean tuning ===
In Pythagorean tuning, there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than by about (or exactly one twelfth of a Pythagorean comma), and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that, which is (one Pythagorean comma) flatter than a just fifth. A fifth this flat can also be regarded as &quot;howling like a wolf.&quot; There are also now eight sharp and four flat major thirds.

=== Five-limit tuning ===
Five-limit tuning was designed to maximize the number of pure intervals, but even in this system several intervals are markedly impure. 5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to Pythagorean tuning, which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning. Namely, while Pythagorean tuning determines only 2 wolf intervals (a fifth and a fourth), the 5-limit symmetric scales produce 12 of them, and the asymmetric scale 14. It is also important to note that the two fifths, three minor thirds, and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables (ratio and ; or G↓, E↓, and A↑), even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals, deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount (1 syntonic comma, i.e., or about ) large enough to be clearly perceived as dissonant.

Five-limit tuning determines one diminished sixth of size (about i.e. sharper than the Pythagorean perfect fifth). Whether this interval should be considered dissonant enough to be called a wolf fifth is a controversial matter.

Five-limit tuning also creates two &quot;impure&quot; perfect fifths of size .
Five-limit fifths are about less &quot;pure&quot; than the Pythagorean and/or just 
They are not diminished sixths, but relative to the Pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant (about flatter) and hence, they might be considered to be wolf fifths. The corresponding inversion is an &quot;impure&quot; perfect fourth(also called Acute Fourth) of size (about ). For instance, in the C major diatonic scale, an impure perfect fifth arises between D and A, and its inversion arises between A and D.

Since in this context the term &quot;perfect&quot; is interpreted to mean &#x27;perfectly consonant&#x27;, the impure perfect fourth and perfect fifth are sometimes simply called &quot;the imperfect&quot; fourth and fifth. However, the widely adopted standard naming convention for musical intervals classifies them as &quot;perfect&quot; intervals, together with the octave and unison. This is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant or ratios (for instance, those tuned using 12 tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament). Conversely, the expressions &quot;imperfect fourth&quot; and &quot;imperfect fifth&quot; do not conflict with the standard naming convention when they refer to a dissonant augmented third or diminished sixth (e.g. the wolf fourth and fifth in Pythagorean tuning).

== &quot;Taming the wolf&quot; ==
Wolf intervals are a consequence of mapping a two-dimensional temperament to a one-dimensional keyboard.
The only solution is to make the number of dimensions match. That is, either:

* Keep the (one-dimensional) piano keyboard, and shift to a one-dimensional temperament (e.g., equal temperament), or
* Keep the two-dimensional temperament, and shift to a two-dimensional keyboard.

=== Keep the piano keyboard ===
When the perfect fifth is tempered to be exactly wide (that is, tempered by about of a syntonic comma, or precisely of a Pythagorean comma) then the tuning is identical to the now-standard 12 tone equal temperament.

Because of the compromises (and wolf intervals) forced on meantone tunings by the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, well temperaments and eventually 12-tone equal temperament became more popular.

A fifth of the size Mozart favored, at or near the 55 equal temperament fifth of 698.182 cents, will have a wolf of sharper than a justly tuned fifth. This howls far less acutely, but is still noticeable.

The wolf can be &quot;tamed&quot; by adopting equal temperament or a well temperament. The very intrepid may simply want to treat it as a xenharmonic music interval; depending on the size of the meantone fifth, the wolf fifth can be tuned to more complex just ratios 20:13, 26:17, 17:11, 32:21, or 49:32.

With a more extreme meantone temperament, like 19 equal temperament, the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth, and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth.

=== Keep the two-dimensional tuning system ===
A lesser-known alternative method that allows the use of multi-dimensional temperaments without wolf intervals is to use a two-dimensional keyboard that is &quot;isomorphic&quot; with that temperament. A keyboard and temperament are isomorphic if they are generated by the same intervals. For example, the Wicki keyboard shown in Figure 1 is generated by the same musical intervals as the syntonic temperament—that is, by the octave and tempered perfect fifth—so they are isomorphic.

On an isomorphic keyboard, any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears—in any octave, key, and tuning—except at the edges. For example, on Wicki&#x27;s keyboard, from any given note, the note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher is always up-and-rightwardly adjacent to the given note. There are no wolf intervals within the note-span of this keyboard. The only problem is at the edge, on the note E. The note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher than E is B, which is not included on the keyboard shown (although it could be included in a larger keyboard, placed just to the right of A, hence maintaining the keyboard&#x27;s consistent note-pattern). Because there is no B button, when playing an E power chord, one must choose some other note that is close in pitch to B, such as C, to play instead of the missing B. That is, the interval from E to C would be a &quot;wolf interval&quot; on this keyboard. In 19-TET, the interval from E to C would be (enharmonic to) a perfect fifth.

However, such edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has enharmonically distinct notes. For example, the isomorphic keyboard in Figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave, so the above-cited edge condition, from E to C, is &quot;not&quot; a wolf interval in 12-TET, 17-TET, or 19-TET; however, it &quot;is&quot; a wolf interval in 26-TET, 31-TET, and 53-TET. In these latter tunings, using electronic transposition could keep the current key&#x27;s notes centered on the isomorphic keyboard, in which case these wolf intervals would very rarely be encountered in tonal music, despite modulation to exotic keys.

A keyboard that is isomorphic with the syntonic temperament, such as Wicki&#x27;s keyboard above, retains its isomorphism in any tuning within the tuning continuum of the syntonic temperament, even when changing tuning dynamically among such tunings. Plamondon, Milne &amp; Sethares (2009), Figure 2, shows the valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament.

<doc id="173813" wikidata="Q103114" url="?curid=173813" title="Michel Houellebecq">
<text>Michel Houellebecq (; born Michel Thomas on 26 February 1956) is a French author of novels, poems, and essays, as well as an occasional actor, filmmaker, and singer. His first book was a biographical essay on the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Houellebecq published his first novel, &quot;Whatever&quot;, in 1994. His next novel, &quot;Atomised&quot;, published in 1998, brought him international fame as well as controversy. &quot;Platform&quot; followed in 2001. He has published several books of poetry, including &quot;The Art of Struggle&quot; in 1996.

An offhand remark about Islam during a publicity tour for his 2001 novel &quot;Platform&quot; led to Houellebecq being taken to court for inciting racial hatred (he was eventually cleared of all charges). He subsequently moved to Ireland for several years, before moving back to France, where he currently resides. He was described in 2015 as &quot;France’s biggest literary export and, some say, greatest living writer.&quot; In a 2017 DW article, he is dubbed the &quot;undisputed star, and enfant terrible, of modern French literature&quot;.

In 2010, he published &quot;The Map and the Territory&quot;, which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt. In 2015, his next novel, &quot;Submission&quot;, sparked another controversy for its depiction of Islam. He was also recently accused of plagiarism concerning &quot;Submission&quot;. &quot;Annihilation&quot; was published in 2022.

==Personal life==
Houellebecq was born Michel Thomas on the French island of Réunion, the son of Lucie Ceccaldi, a French physician born in Algeria of Corsican descent, and René Thomas, a ski instructor and mountain guide. Houellebecq&#x27;s official date of birth is 26 February 1956, although he has sometimes stated that he may have actually been born in 1958.

He lived in Algeria from the age of five months until 1961, with his maternal grandmother. In a lengthy autobiographical article published on his website (now defunct), he states that his parents &quot;lost interest in [his] existence pretty quickly&quot;, and at the age of six, he was sent to France to live with his paternal grandmother, a communist, while his mother left to live a hippie lifestyle in Brazil with her recent boyfriend. His grandmother&#x27;s maiden name was Houellebecq, which he took as his pen name. Later, he went to Lycée Henri Moissan, a high school at Meaux north-east of Paris, as a boarder. He then went to Lycée Chaptal in Paris to follow preparation courses in order to qualify for &quot;grandes écoles&quot; (elite schools). He began attending the Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon in 1975. He started a literary review called &quot;Karamazov&quot; (named after Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s last novel) and wrote poetry. He graduated in 1980, married and had a son; then he divorced, and became depressed.

He married his second wife, Marie-Pierre Gauthier, in 1998. They divorced in 2010.

His third marriage was in September 2018 to Qianyun Lysis Li, a Chinese woman 34 years his junior, and a student of his works.

==Works and rise to fame==

Houellebecq&#x27;s first poems appeared in 1985 in the magazine &quot;La Nouvelle Revue&quot;. Six years later, in 1991, he published a biographical essay on the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, a teenage passion, with the programmatic subtitle &quot;Against the World, Against Life&quot;. A short poetical essay named &quot;Rester vivant : méthode&quot; (&quot;To Stay Alive&quot;) appeared the same year, dealing with the art of writing as a way of life – or rather, a &quot;way of not-dying&quot; and being able to write in spite of apathy and disgust for life (a film adaptation was made in 2016). It was followed by his first collection of poetry, &quot;La poursuite du bonheur&quot; (&quot;The pursuit of happiness&quot;). Meanwhile, he worked as a computer administrator in Paris, including at the French National Assembly, before he became the so-called &quot;pop star of the single generation&quot;, starting to gain fame in 1994 with his debut novel &quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot;, published by Maurice Nadeau (translated in English by Paul Hammond and published as &quot;Whatever&quot;). It reads as a first-person narrative, alternating between realistic accounts of the (unnamed) protagonist&#x27;s bleak and solitary life as a computer programmer, and his idiosyncratic musings about society, some of which are presented in the form of &quot;animal fictions&quot;; he teams up with an even more desperate colleague (he is a virgin at the age of 28) who later gets killed in a car accident, which triggers the narrator&#x27;s mental breakdown and eventual admission in a psychiatric hospital; even there, he theorizes about his condition being the direct result of the contemporary social configuration, rather than a personal failure or mental illness.

Throughout the 1990s, Houellebecq published several books of poetry, including &quot;Le sens du combat&quot; in 1996 (translated as &quot;The Art of Struggle&quot;, which, in a 2005 video interview for the magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, he cited as his most accomplished book to date, the one he would usually choose if compelled to read whatever he wanted among his published works), and articles in magazines (such as &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;) or more confidential literary publications (such as &quot;L&#x27;Infini&quot; edited by Philippe Sollers). Most of those texts were later collected in &quot;Interventions&quot; (1998, expanded in 2009 and 2020). At that time, he lived at the same address as fellow writer Marc-Édouard Nabe, at 103, rue de la Convention in Paris. Nabe wrote about this proximity in &quot;Le Vingt-Septième Livre&quot; (2006), comparing both neighbours&#x27; careers and the way their writings were met by critics and audiences.

His second novel, &quot;Les Particules Élémentaires&quot; (translated by Frank Wynne and published in the English-speaking world as &quot;Atomised&quot; in the UK, or &quot;The Elementary Particles&quot; in the US) was a breakthrough, bringing him national and soon international fame and controversy for its intricate mix of brutally honest social commentary and pornographic depictions (two years earlier, in 1996, while working on that novel, being interviewed by Andrew Hussey, he had presciently said: &quot;It will either destroy me or make me famous.&quot;) It narrates the fate of two half brothers who grew up in the troubled 1960s: Michel Djerzinski, who became a prominent biologist, highly successful as a scientist but utterly withdrawn and depressed, and Bruno Clément, a French teacher, deeply disturbed and obsessed by sex; Djerzinski eventually triggers what is labelled as the &quot;third metaphysical mutation&quot; by retro-engineering the human species into immortal neo-humans. The book won the 1998 Prix Novembre (which was renamed Prix Décembre, following the resignation of its founder who disapproved of the prize being given to Houellebecq), missing the more prestigious Prix Goncourt for which it was the favourite. The novel became an instant &quot;nihilistic classic&quot; and was mostly praised for the boldness of its ideas and thought-provoking qualities, although it was also heavily criticized for its relentless bleakness and vivid depictions of racism, paedophilia, and torture, as well as for being an apology for eugenics. (Michiko Kakutani described it in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a deeply repugnant read&quot;.) The novel won Houellebecq (along with his translator, Frank Wynne) the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002.

In 2000, Houellebecq published the short fiction &quot;Lanzarote&quot; (published in France with a volume of his photographs), in which he explores a number of the themes he would develop in later novels, including sex tourism and fringe religions. His subsequent novel, &quot;Plateforme&quot; (&quot;Platform&quot;, 2001), was another critical and commercial success. A first-person romance narrated by a 40-year-old male arts administrator named Michel, who shares many real-life characteristics with the author, including his apathy and low self-esteem, it includes a depiction of life as hopeless, as well as numerous sex scenes, some of which display an approving attitude towards prostitution and sex tourism.

The novel&#x27;s explicit criticism of Islam—the story ends with the depiction of a terrorist attack on a sex tourism venue, later compared to the Bali bombings which happened the following year—together with an interview its author gave to the magazine &quot;Lire&quot; in which he described Islam as &quot;the dumbest religion,&quot; which remark led to accusations of incitement to ethnic or racial hatred against Houellebecq by several organisations, including France&#x27;s Human Rights League, the Mecca-based World Islamic League as well as the mosques of Paris and Lyon. Charges were brought to trial, but a panel of three judges, delivering their verdict to a packed Paris courtroom, acquitted the author of having provoked &#x27;racial&#x27; hatred, ascribing Houellebecq&#x27;s opinions to the legitimate right of criticizing religions. The huge controversy in the media subsided following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

His next novel, &quot;La Possibilité d&#x27;une île&quot; (&quot;The Possibility of an Island&quot;, 2005), cycles between three characters&#x27; narratives: Daniel 1, a contemporary stand-up comedian and movie maker renowned for his extreme causticity, alternating with Daniel 24 and then Daniel 25, neo-human clones of Daniel 1 in a far future; Daniel 1 witnesses dramatic events by which a sect named the Elohimites (based on Raëlism) changes the course of history, and his autobiography constitutes a canonical account that his clones are compelled to study, both in order to acquaint themselves with their model / ancestor&#x27;s troubled character (since the Elohimites&#x27; chief scientist&#x27;s purported project of mind uploading turned out to be a failure) and to distance themselves from the flaws of humans. Houellebecq later adapted and directed a movie based on this novel, which was a critical and commercial failure.

In 2008, Flammarion published &quot;Public Enemies: Dueling Writers Take on Each Other and the World&quot; (&quot;Ennemis publics&quot;), a conversation via e-mail between Houellebecq and Bernard-Henri Lévy, in which both reflected on their controversial reception by the mainstream media, and elaborated on their tastes and influences in literature, among other topics.

Houellebecq has also released three music albums on which he recites or sings selected excerpts from his poetry. Two of them were recorded with composer Jean-Jacques Birgé: &quot;Le sens du combat&quot; (1996, Radio France) and &quot;Établissement d&#x27;un ciel d&#x27;alternance&quot; (2007, Grrr Records, which Houellebecq considers the best of his recording endeavours, as handwritten in the libretto). &quot;Présence humaine&quot; (released in 2000 on Bertrand Burgalat&#x27;s Tricatel label, and featuring musical arrangements by Burgalat himself), has a rock band backing him, and has been compared to the works of Serge Gainsbourg in the 1970s; it was re-released in 2016 with two additional tracks arranged by Jean-Claude Vannier (who famously worked on &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot;) and a booklet featuring notes by Mishka Assayas and texts by Fernando Arrabal.

A recurrent theme in Houellebecq&#x27;s novels is the intrusion of free-market economics into human relationships and sexuality. The original French title of &quot;Whatever&quot;, &quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot; (literally &quot;broadening of the field of struggle&quot;), alludes to economic competition extending into the search for relationships. As the book says, a free market has absolute winners and absolute losers, and the same applies to relationships in a society that does not value monogamy but rather exhorts people to seek the happiness that always eludes them through the path of sexual consumerism, in pursuit of narcissistic satisfaction. Similarly, &quot;Platform&quot; carries to its logical conclusion the touristic phenomenon, where Westerners of both sexes go on organized trips to developing countries in search of exotic locations and climates. In the novel, a similar popular demand arises for sex tourism, organized and sold in a corporate and professional fashion. Sex tourists are willing to sacrifice financially to experience the instinctual expression of sexuality, which has been better preserved in poor countries whose people are focused on the struggle for survival.

Although Houellebecq&#x27;s work is often credited with building on conservative, if not reactionary, ideas, his critical depiction of the hippie movement, New Age ideology and the May 1968 generation, especially in &quot;Atomised&quot;, echoes the thesis of Marxist sociologist Michel Clouscard.

His novel &quot;La Carte et le Territoire&quot; (&quot;The Map and the Territory&quot;) was released in September 2010 by Flammarion and finally won its author the prestigious Prix Goncourt. This is the tale of an accidental art star and is full of insights into the contemporary art scene. &quot;Slate&quot; magazine accused him of plagiarising some passages of this book from French Wikipedia. Houellebecq denied the accusation of plagiarism, stating that &quot;taking passages word for word was not stealing so long as the motives were to recycle them for artistic purposes,&quot; evoking the influence of Georges Perec, Lautreamont or Jorge Luis Borges, and advocated the use of all sorts of raw materials in literature, including advertising, recipes or mathematics problems.

On 7 January 2015, the date of the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting, the novel &quot;Submission&quot; was published. The book describes a future situation in France, set in 2022, when a Muslim party, following a victory against the National Front, is ruling the country according to Islamic law, which again generated heated controversy and accusations of Islamophobia. On the same date, a cartoon of Houellebecq appeared on the cover page of &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; with the caption &quot;The Predictions of Wizard Houellebecq,&quot; eerily ironic in retrospect. For the second time, his fictional work appeared to echo real events involving Islamic terrorism, although &quot;Submission&quot; does not feature acts of terrorism and eventually presents conversion to Islam as an attractive choice for the protagonist, a typically &quot;houellebecquian&quot; middle-aged man with a fixation for young women. A friend of his, Bernard Maris, was killed in that shooting. In an interview with Antoine de Caunes after the shooting, Houellebecq stated he was unwell and had cancelled the promotional tour for &quot;Submission&quot;.

In January 2019, Houellebecq was made a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. His novel &quot;Sérotonine&quot; was published (translated as &quot;Serotonin&quot;) in the same month. This time, one of the novel&#x27;s main themes, a violent revolt from desperate farmers, appeared to echo the Yellow Vests movement.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot; has been adapted into a film with the same title by Philippe Harel, and later adapted as a play in Danish by Jens Albinus for the Royal Danish Theatre.

The English translation of his novel &quot;Platform&quot; was adapted as a play by the theatre company Carnal Acts for the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London in December 2004. A Spanish adaptation of the novel by Calixto Bieito, performed by Companyia Teatre Romea, premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival. Houellebecq and Bieito appeared together that same year in a TV program named &quot;Au cœur de la nuit&quot; / &quot;Durch die Nacht&quot; (&quot;Through the night&quot;) for the French-German channel Arte.

Along with Loo Hui Phang, Houellebecq wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Monde extérieur&quot; (2002) by David Rault and David Warren.

&quot;Atomised&quot; has been made into a German film, &quot;Elementarteilchen&quot;, directed by Oskar Roehler, starring Moritz Bleibtreu and Franka Potente. The film premiered in 2006 at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival. It was poorly received and generally considered a watered-down take on the novel&#x27;s bleakness and thought-provoking ideas.

The film &quot;La Possibilité d&#x27;une île&quot;, directed by Houellebecq himself and based on his novel, premiered in France on 10 September 2008. It was a critical and commercial failure, sometimes even considered one of the worst films ever made in France, alongside Bernard Henri Levy&#x27;s &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot;, although some authors found him intriguing and recognized redeeming qualities.

American rock singer and &quot;godfather of punk&quot; Iggy Pop released in 2009 the unusually quiet album &quot;Préliminaires&quot;, which he described as influenced by his reading of Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s novel &quot;The Possibility of an Island&quot; (one track &#x27;A Machine for Loving&#x27; even consists in the singer merely reading a passage from the book over a musical accompaniment.). The author considered it a great honour, as he was himself deeply affected as a teenager by Iggy Pop&#x27;s music with The Stooges, even going so far as to say that he was, for once, &quot;completely happy&quot;.

In 2016 he participated, together with Iggy Pop and several others, in Erik Lieshout&#x27;s documentary &quot;To Stay Alive: A Method&quot;, based on his 1991 essay.

==Views on politics and religion==

In 2014, Houellebecq drew up a &quot;project for a new constitution&quot; based on direct democracy which would render the president of the republic elected for life, but instantly revocable by a simple popular referendum, and would permit the people to elect judges. During his 21 June 2016 appearance on &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, Houellebecq said that he voted for the Socialist Party ticket headed by Anne Hidalgo and Jérôme Coumet in the 2014 Paris municipal election. In 2017, Houellebecq explained that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in an ideological vote, but a vote based on class&quot; and that &quot;there is a class which votes for Le Pen, a class which votes for Mélenchon, a class which votes for Macron, and a class which votes for Fillon. I am part of the France which votes for Macron, because I am too rich to vote for Le Pen or Mélenchon.&quot;

In 2002, during an interview about his book &quot;Platform&quot; published in the literary magazine &quot;Lire&quot;, Houellebecq remarked:

Islam is a dangerous religion, and has been from the moment it appeared. Fortunately, it is doomed. On one hand, because God does not exist, and even if someone is an idiot, he will eventually realize that. In the long run, the truth will triumph. On the other hand, Islam is undermined from the inside by capitalism. We can only hope that it will triumph rapidly. Materialism is a lesser evil. Its values are contemptible, but nevertheless less destructive, less cruel than those of Islam.

He faced trial on charges of racial hatred after calling Islam &quot;the dumbest religion&quot; (&quot;la religion la plus con&quot;) in the same interview. He told a court in Paris that his words had been twisted, saying: &quot;I have never displayed the least contempt for Muslims [but] I have as much contempt as ever for Islam.&quot; The court acquitted him. He was sued by a civil-rights group for hate speech and won on the grounds of freedom of expression. Houellebecq extended his critique to monotheistic religions in general: &quot;The fundamental monotheistic texts preach neither peace nor love nor tolerance. From the start, they were texts of hatred.&quot; In what he has said will be his last novel, &quot;Aneantir&quot;, Houellebecq has seemingly softened his view on Christianity, though by no means seems to be a convert.

He has been critical of attempts to legalise euthanasia in France and Europe, writing in April 2021 in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;:

[W]hen a country — a society, a civilisation — gets to the point of legalising euthanasia, it loses in my eyes all right to respect. It becomes henceforth not only legitimate, but desirable, to destroy it; so that something else — another country, another society, another civilisation — might have a chance to arise.

In an interview with &quot;Front Populaire&quot; magazine in November 2022, he stated: &quot;The &#x27;Great Replacement&#x27; is not a theory, it is a fact. There is no conspiracy orchestrated by the elite but there is a &#x27;transfer&#x27; of people from poor countries, where the birth rate is high ... What we can already see is that people are arming themselves. There will be acts of resistance, reverse Bataclans, attacks aimed at mosques as well as cafés popular with Muslims ... The objective of the local French population is not for Muslims to assimilate, but for them to stop robbing and attacking them or another possibility, that they go away.&quot; He also blamed the US for importing &quot;woke&quot; culture into France. He went on to add: &quot;Our only chance of survival would be for white supremacy to become trendy in the United States.&quot;

== Reception ==
Literary critics have labelled Houellebecq&#x27;s novels &quot;vulgar&quot;, &quot;pamphlet literature&quot; and &quot;pornography&quot;; he has been accused of obscenity, racism, misogyny and Islamophobia. His works, particularly &quot;Atomised&quot;, have received high praise from the French literary intelligentsia, with generally positive international critical response, though there have been poor reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Michiko Kakutani and Anthony Quinn, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; by Perry Anderson, as well as mixed reviews from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. However, without ignoring the book&#x27;s grotesqueries, Lorin Stein from &quot;Salon&quot;, later editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, made a spirited defense:

Ten years later, Houellebecq responded to critical reviews:

According to the Austrian feature-writer Anne-Catherine Simon, Houellebecq&#x27;s oeuvre shows &quot;great continuity: as a long story of western decadence&quot;.

In an interview with Agathe Novak-Lechevalier Houellebecq characterised himself as &quot;the author of a nihilistic era and the suffering that goes along with nihilism&quot;.

Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi has criticised Houellebecq&#x27;s stance on Lovecraft. An essay by Todd Spaulding makes the case for why Houellebecq portrayed Lovecraft as an &quot;obsolete reactionary&quot; whose work was based largely on &quot;racial hatred.&quot;

However, Christopher Caldwell defends Houellebecq for his overall depictions of technological loneliness and cultural alienation:

Houellebecq&#x27;s novels are often classified as satire.

<text>Pears&#x27; Cyclopaedia was a one-volume encyclopaedia published in the United Kingdom. Pears&#x27; Soap launched the original &quot;Pears&#x27; Shilling Cyclopaedia&quot; in December 1897, the year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

The first edition contained an English dictionary, a medical dictionary, a gazetteer and atlas, desk information and a compendium of general knowledge entitled &quot;A Mass of Curious and Useful Information and Things that everyone ought to know in Commerce, History, Science, Religion, Literature and the other Topics of Ordinary Conversation&quot;.
==Background==
Each edition traditionally featured an atlas, a gazetteer, a chronological list of events, a list of prominent people (past and present), a miniature encyclopaedia of general information and around a dozen or more other sections on various subjects such as , classical mythology, current events, wine, astronomy, ideas and beliefs, gardening, medicine, etc. The selection of subjects varied slightly over the years, and in later years the world atlas section was dropped, leaving a world and European map inside the front and rear covers and with the Gazetteer limited to the British Isles.

From 1953, it was published annually. It was published by Pelham Books from 1959 to 1988, and from then until the final, 2017 edition by Penguin Books. Dr. Chris Cook was the editor from 1977 until the final edition.

During the 1950s, Pears&#x27; awarded the Silver Pears&#x27; Trophy annually to a prominent person for &quot;outstanding British achievement in any field.&quot;

The 2017–2018 edition, released on 31 August 2017, was subtitled &quot;The Final Edition&quot;. The publisher confirmed it is the last: 

According to &quot;The Bookseller&quot;, &quot;Statistics from Nielsen BookScan have also revealed volume sales of the work have sharply declined in recent years: the 2001/02 edition sold 24,229 copies whereas the 2016/17 edition sold only 2,854.&quot; Over its history, Pears&#x27; had &quot;produced sales over 3 million copies by the 1930s and at least as many since&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s article on the final edition cites total sales over the last decade (2007–2017) of &quot;more than 120,000&quot;, adding that, &quot;according to Penguin, it did particularly well in election years&quot;.

Sam Leith wrote in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;: &quot;Now, rendered quite redundant in that respect by Wikipedia (among many, many other things), &quot;Pears&quot;″ is more a curiosity than a serious reference resource.&quot; But he continues: &quot;You’re more likely, as I did, to open this &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; to see whether something’s in it than in the hopes of finding out about that something. Which said, on that level it is full of interest. To the very great credit of Dr. Chris Cook, who has been annually (and manually) updating the Cyclopaedia since 1977, it has done a semi-successful job of its madly quixotic project of keeping up with the times.&quot;

The final page of the final edition summarizes &quot;The Story of Pears, 1897–2017&quot; and concludes:

<text>Guizhou is an inland province in Southwestern China. Its capital and largest city is Guiyang, in the center of the province. Guizhou borders the autonomous region of Guangxi to the south, Yunnan to the west, Sichuan to the northwest, the municipality of Chongqing to the north, and Hunan to the east. Guizhou has a humid subtropical climate. It covers a total area of 176,200 square kilometers and consists of six prefecture-level cities and three autonomous prefectures. The population of Guizhou stands at 38.5 million, ranking 18th among the provinces in China.

The Dian Kingdom, which inhabited the present-day area of Guizhou, was annexed by the Han dynasty in 106 BC. Guizhou was formally made a province in 1413 during the Ming dynasty. After the overthrow of the Qing in 1911 and following the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party took refuge in Guizhou during the Long March between 1934 and 1935. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mao Zedong promoted the relocation of heavy industry into inland provinces such as Guizhou, to better protect them from potential foreign attacks.

Located in the hinterland of the southwestern inland region, Guizhou is a transportation hub in the southwest area and an important part of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. It is the country&#x27;s first national-level comprehensive pilot zone for big data, a mountain tourism destination and a major mountain tourism province, a national ecological civilization pilot zone, and an inland open economic pilot zone.

The representative historical culture is &quot;Qian Gui culture&quot;(黔贵文化). In addition, Guizhou is also one of the birthplaces of ancient Chinese humans and ancient Chinese culture, with ancient humans living on this land since about half a million years ago.

Guizhou is rich in natural, cultural and environmental resources. Its natural industry includes timber and forestry, and the energy and mining industries constitute an important part of its economy. Notwithstanding, Guizhou is considered a relatively undeveloped province, with the fourth-lowest GDP per capita in China as of 2020. However, it is also one of China&#x27;s fastest-growing economies. The Chinese government is looking to develop Guizhou as a data hub.

Guizhou is a mountainous province, with its higher altitudes in the west and centre. It lies at the eastern end of the Yungui Plateau. Demographically, it is one of China&#x27;s most diverse provinces. Minority groups account for more than 37% of the population, including sizable populations of the Miao, Bouyei, Dong, Tujia and Yi peoples, all of whom speak languages distinct from Chinese. The main language spoken in Guizhou is Southwestern Mandarin, a variety of Mandarin.

==Name==
The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou (), pronounced &quot;Kjú-jyuw&quot; in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, the character (&quot;ju&quot;, &quot;carpenter&#x27;s square&quot;) was changed to the more refined (&quot;gui&quot;, &quot;precious or expensive&quot;). The region formally became a province in 1413; the capital of the province was originally called &quot;Guizhou&quot;, but it is currently known as Guiyang.

== History ==

Evidence of settlement by humans during the Middle Palaeolithic is indicated by stone artefacts, including Levallois pieces, found during archaeological excavations at Guanyindong Cave. These artefacts have been dated to approximately 170,000–80,000 years ago using optically stimulated luminescence methods.

From around 1046 BC to the emergence of the State of Qin, northwest Guizhou was part of the State of Shu. During the Warring States period, the Chinese state of Chu conquered the area, and control later passed to the Dian Kingdom. During the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), to which the Dian was tributary, Guizhou was home to the Yelang collection of tribes, which largely governed themselves before the Han consolidated control in the southwest and established the Lingnan province. During the Three Kingdoms period, parts of Guizhou were governed by the Shu Han state based in Sichuan, followed by Cao Wei (220–266) and the Jin dynasty (266–420).

During the 8th and 9th centuries in the Tang dynasty, Chinese soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native women. Their descendants are known as &quot;Lǎohànrén&quot; (), in contrast to new Chinese who populated Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect. Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married these pre-Chinese women.

Kublai Khan and Möngke Khan conquered the Chinese southwest in the process of defeating the Song during the Mongol invasion of China, and the newly established Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) saw the importation of Chinese Muslim administrators and settlers from Bukhara in Central Asia.

It was during the following Ming dynasty, which was once again led by Han Chinese, that Guizhou was formally made a province in 1413. The Ming established many garrisons in Guizhou from which to pacify the Yao and Miao minorities during the Miao Rebellions. Chinese-style agriculture flourished with the expertise of farmers from Sichuan, Hunan and its surrounding provinces into Guizhou. Wu Sangui was responsible for the ousting the Ming in Guizhou and Yunnan during the Manchu conquest of China. During the governorship-general of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s nobleman Ortai, the &quot;tusi&quot; system of indirect governance of the southwest was abolished, prompting rebellions from disenfranchised chieftains and the further centralization of government. After the Second Opium War, criminal triads set up shop in Guangxi and Guizhou to sell British opium. For a time, Taiping Rebels took control of Guizhou, but they were ultimately suppressed by the Qing. Concurrently, Han Chinese soldiers moved into the Taijiang region of Guizhou, married Miao women, and their children were brought up as Miao.

More unsuccessful Miao rebellions occurred during the Qing, in 1735, from 1795–1806 and from 1854–1873. After the overthrow of the Qing in 1911 and following Chinese Civil War, the Communists took refuge in Guizhou during the Long March (1934–1935). While the province was formally ruled by the warlord Wang Jialie, the Zunyi Conference in Guizhou established Mao Zedong as the leader of the Communist Party. As the Second Sino-Japanese War pushed China&#x27;s Nationalist Government to its southwest base of Chongqing, transportation infrastructure improved as Guizhou was linked with the Burma Road. After the end of the War, a 1949 Revolution swept Mao into power, who promoted the relocation of heavy industry into inland provinces such as Guizhou, to better protect them from Soviet and American attacks. The 1957 influenza pandemic started in Guizhou and killed a million people around the world. After the Chinese economic reform began in 1978, geographical factors led Guizhou to become the poorest province in China, with a GDP growth average of 9 percent from 1978 to 1993.

== District Planning ==
Regional history

In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), Guizhou established six administrative supervision areas, each in charge of several counties. In the 30th year (1941), Guiyang City was established.

== Geography ==
=== Topography and landforms ===
Guizhou Province is located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, between longitudes 103°36′ to 109°35′ east and latitudes 24°37′ to 29°13′ north. The average altitude is around 1100 meters. It borders Hunan to the east, Guangxi to the south, Yunnan to the west, and Sichuan and Chongqing to the north. It stretches approximately 595 kilometers from east to west and about 509 kilometers from north to south. The total area of Guizhou Province is 176,167 square kilometers, accounting for 1.8% of the total area of China. The easternmost point is in Di Lake Township, Tianzhu County, Qiandongnan Prefecture. The westernmost point is in Yulong Township(玉龙乡), Weining County, Bijie City. The southernmost point is in Luowan Township(洛万乡), Xingyi City, Qianxinan Prefecture. The northernmost point is in Yangxi Town(阳溪镇), Daozhen County, Zunyi City.

Guizhou is a mountainous province, although its higher altitudes are in the west and centre. It lies at the eastern end of the Yungui Plateau. At above sea level, Jiucaiping is Guizhou&#x27;s highest point.

Guizhou Plateau is predominantly mountainous, and its topography can be generally divided into three basic types: plateau mountains, hills, and basins(盆地), with 92.5% of the area being mountains and hills. There are numerous mountain ranges within the province, with overlapping ridges and peaks stretching across the landscape. In the north, there is the Dalou Mountain, which runs diagonally from the west to the northeast, with the important pass Loushan Pass at an altitude of 1444 meters; in the central and southern part, Miaoling Mountain(苗岭) Range stretches across, with its main peak, Leigong Mountain(雷公山), at 2178 meters; in the northeastern part, there is the Wuling Mountain Range, which winds into Guizhou from Hunan, with its main peak, Fanjing Mountain, at 2572 meters; in the west, there is the towering Wumeng Mountain(乌蒙山), with the highest point in Guizhou being Jiucaiping(韭菜坪) in Zhushi Township(珠市乡), Hezhang County, at an altitude of 2900.6 meters.

=== Climate ===
Guizhou has a humid subtropical climate. There are few seasonal changes. Its annual average temperature is roughly , with January temperatures ranging from and July temperatures ranging from . with annual rainfall ranging from ; the frost-free period lasts between 250 and 300 days. There is no severe cold in winter and no extreme heat in summer, with the coldest month of January averaging , and the hottest month of July averaging . The unique climatic characteristics make Guizhou an ideal place for leisure travel and summer retreats.
Precipitation is abundant, with a distinct rainy season, many cloudy days, and less sunshine, with the number of cloudy days generally exceeding 150 days throughout the year, and the annual relative humidity above 70%. Influenced by atmospheric circulation and terrain, Guizhou&#x27;s climate is diverse, with the saying. Additionally, the climate is unstable, with a variety of disastrous weather conditions such as droughts, autumn winds, freezing, and hail, which can have a significant impact on agricultural production.

Like in China&#x27;s other southwest provinces, rural areas of Guizhou suffered severe drought during spring 2010. Beginning on 3 April 2010, China&#x27;s premier Wen Jiabao went on a three-day inspection tour in the southwest drought-affected province of Guizhou, where he met villagers and called on agricultural scientists to develop drought-resistant technologies for the area.

Because of its lesser development compared to many other provinces in China, Guizhou&#x27;s environment is well-preserved. As of at least 2023, its environment and favorable climate have been assets in attracting the new, increasingly digital, economy.

=== Hydrology ===
Guizhou Province&#x27;s rivers are located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, with 69 counties falling within the scope of the Yangtze River protective forest conservation area, making it an important ecological barrier for the upper reaches of both the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. The water system of the province flows from the west and center towards the north, east, and south according to the terrain. Miao Ridge serves as the watershed between the Yangtze and Pearl River basins; to the north lies the Yangtze River basin, covering an area of 115,747 square kilometers, accounting for 65.7% of the province&#x27;s total land area, with major rivers including: Wu River, Chishui River, Qingshuijiang, Hongzhou River(洪州河), Wuyang River, Jinjiang, Songtao River(松桃河)， Songkan River(松坎河), Niulan River(牛栏江), Hengjiang(横江), etc.; to the south of Miao Ridge lies the Pearl River basin, covering an area of 60,420 square kilometers, accounting for 34.3% of the province&#x27;s total land area, with major rivers including: Nanpan River, Beipan River, Hongshui River, Duliu River, Dagou River(打狗河), etc. Guizhou has a large number of rivers with continuous flow, and there are 984 rivers with a length of more than 10 kilometers.

== Natural Resources ==

=== Water resources ===
Guizhou Province has a large number of rivers, with 984 rivers that are over 10 kilometers long. In 2002, the runoff volume of Guizhou&#x27;s rivers reached 114.52 billion cubic meters. The mountainous characteristics of Guizhou&#x27;s rivers are evident, with most rivers having broad valleys and gentle water flow in the upper reaches, with small water volume; the middle reaches have alternating tight and open valleys with rapid water flow; the lower reaches have deep and narrow valleys, with large water volume and abundant hydropower resources. The potential of hydropower resources is 18.745 million kilowatts, ranking sixth in China, of which 16.833 million kilowatts are exploitable, accounting for 4.4% of China&#x27;s total, with many concentrated river sections with large water level drops, and favorable development conditions.

=== Land resources ===
Guizhou Province&#x27;s land resources are predominantly mountainous and hilly, with relatively few plains. The mountainous area is 108,740 square kilometers, accounting for 61.7% of the total land area of Guizhou Province. The hilly area is 54,197 square kilometers, accounting for 31.1% of the total land area of Guizhou Province. The area of mountainous flatlands is 13,230 square kilometers, only accounting for 7.5% of the total land area of Guizhou Province. There is a limited amount of land resources available for agricultural development. Due to the increasing population and the growth of non-agricultural land use, the area of arable land is continuously decreasing. By the end of 2002, the actual area of arable land in Guizhou Province was 17,694 square kilometers, a reduction of 629 square kilometers compared to 2001. The per capita area of arable land is less than 0.05 hectares, which is significantly lower than the national average of China. The proportion of arable land with thick soil layers, high fertility, and good water conditions is low.

=== Biological resources ===

The border mountains of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan have been identified as one of the eight plant diversity hotspots in China. Guizhou Province is home to 9,982 species of vascular plants (including subspecies and varieties, the same below)， The main ecosystem types include evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, and montane elfin forest. more than 700 of which are edible, and over 2,000 that are used for greening, beautification, and for pollution resistance and environmental improvement. Plant species endemic to this region include &quot;Abies ziyuanensis&quot;, &quot;Cathaya argyrophylla&quot;, and &quot;Keteleeria pubescens，Davidia involucrata, Guizhou Cycas.&quot; The province is also rich in wildlife resources, with 1,053 species of vertebrates, including 141 mammals, 509 birds, 104 reptiles, 74 amphibians, and 225 fish species. In broad terms, the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau is one of the vertebrate diversity hotspots of China. At the level of counties, Xingyi is one of nine Chinese vertebrate (excluding birds) diversity hotspots. Animals only known from Guizhou include Leishan moustache toad, Kuankuoshui salamander, Shuicheng salamander, Guizhou salamander, and Zhijin warty newt. 

Caohai Lake with its surroundings is a wetland that is an important overwintering site for many birds. It is a National Nature Reserve and an Important Bird Area identified by BirdLife International.
Guizhou is one of the four major medicinal material-producing areas in China. The province boasts 4,419 species of medicinal plants and 301 medicinal animals. It is famous for its 50 &quot;authentic medicinal materials&quot; known both domestically and internationally. Over 350 types of Chinese medicinal resources have been developed and utilized, with Gastrodia elata, Eucommia ulmoides, Coptis chinensis, Evodia rutaecarpa, and Dendrobium being the five famous medicinal materials of Guizhou.

=== Mineral resources ===
Guizhou Province is rich in mineral resources and is a major province for mineral resources. More than 110 types of minerals have been discovered, among which 76 types have identified reserves. Several have proven reserves that rank at the forefront nationwide. 
Those ranking first include mercury, barite, fertilizer sandstone, metallurgical sandstone, decorative diabase, and brick and tile sandstone, etc. Those ranking second include phosphorus, bauxite, rare earths, etc.; those ranking third include magnesium, manganese, gallium, etc. In addition, coal, antimony, gold, pyrite, and other minerals hold significant positions in China. Coal reserves are substantial, with a complete range of coal types and excellent coal quality, with proven reserves at the end of 2002 being 49.227 billion tons; bauxite proven reserves are 424 million tons; phosphate rock reserves are 2.695 billion tons, accounting for over 40% of the national total; barite reserves account for one-third of the country&#x27;s total; gold reserves rank twelfth in the nation, making it an emerging base for gold production in China.

== Scientific research ==
Major scientific research facilities in Guizhou include:

* The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world&#x27;s largest radio telescope
* The Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences

==Politics==
== Administrative divisions ==

Guizhou is divided into nine prefecture-level divisions: six prefecture-level cities and three autonomous prefectures:

These nine prefecture-level divisions are in turn subdivided into 88 county-level divisions (14 districts, 7 county-level cities, 55 counties, and 11 autonomous counties and one special district).

=== Urban areas ===

== Economy ==

As of the mid-19th century, Guizhou exported mercury, gold, iron, lead, tobacco, incense and drugs.

Its natural industry includes timber and forestry. Guizhou is also the third largest producer of tobacco in China, and home to the well-known brand Guizhou Tobacco. Other important industries in the province include energy (electricity generation) - a large portion of which is exported to Guangdong and other provinces - and mining, especially in coal, limestone, arsenic, gypsum, and oil shale. Guizhou&#x27;s total output of coal was 118 million tons in 2008, a 7% growth from the previous year. Guizhou&#x27;s export of power to Guangdong equaled 12% of Guangdong&#x27;s total power consumption. Over the next 5 years Guizhou hopes to increase this by as much as 50%.

Historically, Guizhou was a poorer province with lagging development. It was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

The digital economy has grown significantly since 2015 and as of at least 2023 continues to develop Guizhou&#x27;s growing reputation as a center for big data in China.

==Transportation==
In 2017, Sun Zhigang, the governor of Guizhou, announced plans to build of highways, of inland waterways, of high-speed rail lines, and 17 airports in three years, in an effort to boost tourism in the province. Guizhou has continued to develop transportation infrastructure (as well as other infrastructure such as electric, water, and broadband infrastructure) to support the growing big data-related sections of the economy.

Guizhou&#x27;s rail network consists primarily of a cross formed by the Sichuan–Guizhou, Guangxi–Guizhou and Shanghai–Kunming railways, which intersect at the provincial capital, Guiyang, near the center of the province. The Liupanshui–Baiguo, Pan County West and Weishe–Hongguo railways form a rail corridor along Guizhou&#x27;s western border with Yunnan. This corridor connects the Neijiang–Kunming railway, which dips into northwestern Guizhou at Weining, with the Nanning–Kunming railway, which skirts the southwestern corner of Guizhou at Xingyi.

As of 2018, Shanghai–Kunming and Guiyang–Guangzhou high-speed railways are operational. Chengdu–Guiyang high-speed railway is under construction.

==Demographics==
In 1832, the population was estimated at five million.

Guizhou is demographically one of China&#x27;s most diverse provinces. Minority groups account for more than 37% of the population and they include Miao (including Gha-Mu and A-Hmao), Yao, Yi, Qiang, Dong, Zhuang, Bouyei, Bai, Tujia, Gelao and Sui. 55.5% of the province area is designated as autonomous regions for ethnic minorities. Guizhou is the province with the highest fertility rate in China, standing at 2.19 (urban: 1.31; rural: 2.42).

===Religion===

The predominant religions in Guizhou are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 31.18% of the population believes and is involved in ancestor veneration, while 0.99% of the population identifies as Christian, decreasing from 1.13% in 2004.
The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 67.83% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects, and small minorities of Muslims. There are significant ethnic minority populations (the Miao and the Buyei) who traditionally follow their autochthonous religions.
==Cuisine==
Guizhou is the home of the well-known Chinese liquor Moutai, as well as Lao Gan Ma.

== Tourism ==
The province has many covered bridges, called &quot;Wind and Rain Bridges&quot;. These were built by the Dong people.

The southeastern corner of the province is known for its unique Dong minority culture. Towns such as Rongjiang, Liping, Diping and Zhaoxing are scattered amongst the hills along the border with Guangxi.

=== Three recommended forms ===
The World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Environmental Assessment Study: Tourism Development in the Province of Guizhou, China&quot; (May 25, 2007) points to three different forms of tourism that should be fostered and developed in Guizhou: Nature-based, heritage-based and rural. Heritage-based tourism provides ethnic minority groups with an opportunity to preserve their unique heritage while still making a living.

<text>Heilongjiang is a province in northeast China. It is the northernmost and easternmost province of the country and contains China&#x27;s northernmost point (in Mohe City along the Amur) and easternmost point (at the junction of the Amur and Ussuri rivers). 

The province is bordered by Jilin to the south and Inner Mongolia to the west. It also shares a border with Russia (Amur Oblast, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai and Zabaykalsky Krai) to the north and east. The capital and the largest city of the province is Harbin. Among Chinese provincial-level administrative divisions, Heilongjiang is the sixth-largest by total area, the 20th-most populous, and the second-poorest by GDP per capita after only Gansu province.

The province takes its name from the Amur river which marks the border between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Russia. 

Heilongjiang has significant agricultural production, and raw materials, such as timber, oil, and coal.

==Etymology==
The province takes its name from the Amur river, whose name in Mandarin is &quot;Heilongjiang&quot; (&#x27;black dragon river&#x27;).

==History==

Ancient Chinese records and other sources state that Heilongjiang was inhabited by people such as the Sushen, Buyeo, the Mohe, and the Khitan. Mongolic Donghu people lived in Inner Mongolia and the western part of Heilongjiang. Some names are Manchu or Mongolian. The eastern portion of Heilongjiang was ruled by the Bohai Kingdom between the 7th and 10th centuries, followed by the Khitan Liao dynasty. The Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) that subsequently ruled much of north China arose within the borders of modern Heilongjiang.
Heilongjiang as an administrative entity was created in 1683, during the Kangxi era of the Manchu Qing dynasty, from the northwestern part of the Jilin province. This Heilongjiang Province only included the western part of today&#x27;s Heilongjiang Province, and was under the supervision of the General of Heilongjiang (Sahaliyan Ula i Jiyanggiyūn) (the title is also translated as the Military Governor of Heilongjiang; &quot;jiyanggiyūn&quot; is the Manchu reading of the Chinese word ; &quot;military leader, general&quot; and is cognate with Japanese &quot;shōgun&quot;), whose power extended, according to the Treaty of Nerchinsk, as far north as the Stanovoy Mountains. The eastern part of what&#x27;s today Heilongjiang remained under the supervision of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiyūn), whose power reached the Sea of Japan. These areas deep in Manchuria were closed off to Han Chinese migration.
The original seat of the Military Governor of Heilongjiang, as established in 1683, was in Heilongjiang City (also known as Aigun or Heihe, or, in Manchu, Saghalien Ula), located on the Amur river. However, already in 1690 the seat of the governor was transferred to Nenjiang (Mergen) on the Nen River, and, in 1699, further south to Qiqihar. According to modern historians, the moves may have been driven by supply considerations: Nenjiang and Qiqihar are connected by a convenient waterway (Nen River) with southern Manchuria, whereas accessing Aigun (Heihe) would require either sailing all the way down the Sungari River until its confluence with the Amur and then up the Amur to Heihe, or using a portage over the Lesser Xing&#x27;an Mountains between the Nen River valley and the Amur valley. An additional advantage of Qiqihar may have been its location at the junction of a northbound road (to Nenjiang) and a westbound one (to Mongolia), enabling its garrison to defend both against the Russians and the Ölöt Mongols.

Little Qing Military presence existed north of Aigun. According to the 18th- and early-20th-century European sources and the reports of the Russians in the 1850s, the farthest Qing &quot;advance guard&quot; post was at Ulusu-Modon (Ulussu-Mudan) ( &quot;Wūlǔsūmùdān&quot;), near the Amur river&#x27;s famous S-shaped meander. (The post was on the left (north) bank of the river, lost to the Russians in 1860.)

In 1858 and 1860, the Qing government was forced to give up all land beyond the Amur and Ussuri rivers to the Russian Empire, cutting off the Qing Empire from the Sea of Japan and giving Heilongjiang its present northern and eastern borders. At the same time, Manchuria was opened to Han Chinese migration by the Qing government. By the early twentieth century, due to the &quot;Chuang Guandong&quot;, the Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group in the region.

In 1931, Japanese forces invaded Heilongjiang. In 1932, the Japanese completed their conquest of the province, which became part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.

In 1945, Japanese forces in Manchuria were defeated by the Soviet Army. During the Chinese Civil War, Soviet forces aided the Chinese communists. Heilongjiang became the first province to be completely controlled by the communists and Harbin the first major city to be controlled by them.

At the beginning of communist rule, Heilongjiang included only the western portion of the present-day province, and had its capital at Qiqihar. The remaining area was the province of Songjiang; its capital was Harbin. In 1954, these two provinces were merged into present-day Heilongjiang. During the Cultural Revolution, Heilongjiang was also expanded to include Hulunbuir League and some other areas previously in Inner Mongolia; this has since mostly been reversed.
==Geography==

Heilongjiang is a land of varied topographies. Much of the province is dominated by mountain ranges such as the Greater Khingan Range and Lesser Khingan Range, Zhangguangcai Mountains, Laoye Mountains, and Wanda Mountains. The highest peak is Datudingzi Mountain at , located on the border with Jilin province. The Greater Khingan Range contains China&#x27;s largest remaining virgin forest and is an important area for China&#x27;s forestry industry.

The east and southwest of the province, which are relatively flat and low in altitude, feature the Muling River, the Naoli River, the Songhua River, the Nen River, and the Mudan River, all tributaries of the Amur, while the northern border forms part of the Amur valley. Xingkai Lake (or Khanka Lake) is found on the border with Russia&#x27;s Primorsky Krai.

===Climate===

A humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot; or &quot;Dwb&quot;) predominates in the province, though areas in the far north are subarctic (Köppen &quot;Dwc&quot;). Winters are long and bitter, with an average of in January, and summers are short and warm to very warm with an average of in July. The annual average rainfall is , concentrated heavily in summer. Clear weather is prevalent throughout the year, and in the spring, the Songnen Plain and the Sanjiang Plain provide abundant sources of wind energy.

The province&#x27;s largest cities include Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Daqing, Jixi, Shuangyashan, Hegang, Qitaihe, Yichun, and Heihe.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Heilongjiang boasts an extensive road network. As of October 2020, it has of expressways, highways and other roads.

<doc id="173817" wikidata="Q57052" url="?curid=173817" title="Jiangxi">
<text>Jiangxi is an inland province of East China. Spanning from the banks of the Yangtze river in the north into hillier areas in the south and east, it shares a border with Anhui to the north, Zhejiang to the northeast, Fujian to the east, Guangdong to the south, Hunan to the west, and Hubei to the northwest. Major cities include its capital Nanchang, Ganzhou, and Jiujiang. 

The name &quot;Jiangxi&quot; is derived from the circuit administrated under the Tang dynasty in 733, Jiangnanxidao. The abbreviation for Jiangxi is &quot;&quot;, for the Gan River which runs across from the south to the north and flows into the Yangtze River. Jiangxi is also alternately called &quot;Ganpo Dadi&quot; which literally means the &quot;Great Land of Gan and Po&quot;.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the Chinese Communist Party. The Nanchang Uprising took place in Jiangxi on 1 August, 1927, beginning the Chinese Civil War. In 1931, the Chinese Soviet Republic&#x27;s government was established in Ruijin, which is sometimes called the &quot;Former Red Capital&quot;.

The southern half of Jiangxi is hilly and mountainous, with ranges and valleys interspersed; notable mountains and mountain ranges include Mount Lu, the Jinggang Mountains and Mount Sanqing. The northern half is comparatively lower in altitude. The Gan River flows through the province.

Although the majority of Jiangxi&#x27;s population is Han Chinese, Jiangxi is linguistically diverse. It is considered the center of Gan Chinese; Hakka Chinese is also spoken to some degree. Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of copper, tungsten, gold, silver, uranium, thorium, tantalum, niobium and lithium.

==History==

Jiangxi is centered on the Gan River valley, which historically provided the main north–south transport route of south China. The corridor along the Gan River is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the North China Plain and the Yangtze River valley in the north and the territory of modern Guangdong province in the south. As a result, Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of China&#x27;s history.

Jiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the Shang dynasty (16th to 11th centuries BC). It is likely that peoples collectively known as the Baiyue inhabited the region. During the Spring and Autumn period, the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of Wu. After Wu was conquered by the state of Yue (a power based in modern northern Zhejiang) in 473 BC, the state of Chu (based in modern Hubei) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC. In 223 BC, when Qin conquered Chu, a majority of the Jiangxi area was recorded to be put under Jiujiang Commandery situated in Shouchun (). However the commandery was ineffective and ended shortly when Qin falls.

Yuzhang Commandery (, Gan: Ì-zong) was established in Jiangxi at the beginning of the Han dynasty, possibly before the death of Xiang Yu in 202 BC, and it was also the first commandery set up by Chinese dynasty in Jiangxi. It was named after the Yuzhang River (, Gan: Ì-zong Kong), the original name of Gan River. &quot;Gan&quot; has become the abbreviation of the province. In 201, eight counties were added to the original seven of Qin, and three more were established in later years. Throughout most of the Han dynasty the commandery&#x27;s eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others were located at the sites of modern major cities. Other counties, however, have been moved or abolished in later centuries.

Under the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, Yuzhang Commandery was assigned to Yangzhou Province, as part of a trend to establish provinces (&quot;zhou&quot;) all across China. In 291 AD, during the Western Jin dynasty, Jiangxi became its own &quot;Zhou&quot; called Jiangzhou (, Gan: Kong-chiu). During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of &quot;zhou&quot; slowly grew.

During the Sui dynasty, there were seven commanderies and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the Tang dynasty, another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming &quot;zhou&quot; (henceforth translated as &quot;prefectures&quot; rather than &quot;provinces&quot;).

Circuits were established during the Tang dynasty as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the Jiangnan Circuit (lit. &quot;Circuit south of the Yangtze&quot;). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called Jiangnanxi Circuit (lit. &quot;Western circuits south of the Yangtze&quot;). This is the source of the modern name &quot;Jiangxi&quot;.

The Tang dynasty collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Jiangxi first belonged to Wu (, Gan: Ng), then to Southern Tang (, Gan: Nām-thóng). Both states were based in modern-day Nanjing, further down the Yangtze River.

During the Song dynasty, Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).

During the Yuan dynasty, the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern Guangdong. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the Ming dynasty after Guangdong was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the Communists and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people&#x27;s revolution. The Nanchang Uprising took place in Jiangxi on 1 August, 1927, during the Chinese Civil War. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang&#x27;s attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the Chinese Soviet Republic&#x27;s government was established in Ruijin, which is sometimes called the &quot;Former Red Capital&quot; (, Gan: Fūng-set Kū-tu), or just the &quot;Red Capital&quot;. In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the Long March to Yan&#x27;an.

From 1930 to 1934, the National Government carried out five military campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet area. Its brutal two-party battles and cleansing (including the internal cleansing of the Red Army and the cleaning of the post-war government) caused a large number of deaths or escapes, causing the population of Jiangxi to drop by 40%, until only 13.8 million people were left in 1936.

In 1936, after the opening of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan, Jiangxi lost its important position regarding north–south traffic. In 1937, the east-west Zhegan Railway was opened to traffic, which changed the original traffic patterns in Jiangxi to a large extent. The Jiujiang Port () began to decline in importance.

Following the Doolittle Raid during World War II, most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The Imperial Japanese Army began the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to intimidate the Chinese from helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians of China while searching for Doolittle&#x27;s men.

Jiangxi came under the full control of the CCP upon the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. The Republican provincial government was evacuated to Taichung in Taiwan Province before dissolving itself that same year.

==Geography==

Mountains surround Jiangxi on three sides, with the Mufu Mountains, Jiuling Mountains, and Luoxiao Mountains on the west; Huaiyu Mountains and Wuyi Mountains on the east; and the () and Dayu Mountains in the south. The southern half of the province is hilly with ranges and valleys interspersed; while the northern half is flatter and lower in altitude. The highest point in Jiangxi is Mount Huanggang () in the Wuyi Mountains, on the border with Fujian. It has an altitude of .

The Gan River dominates the province, flowing through the entire length of the province from south to north. It enters Lake Poyang in the north, the largest freshwater lake of China; that lake in turn empties into the Yangtze River, which forms part of the northern border of Jiangxi. Important reservoirs include the Zhelin Reservoir in the northwest of the province on the Xiushui River, and the in the upper section of the Gan.

Jiangxi has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification), with short, cool, damp winters, and very hot, humid summers. Average temperatures are about in January and in July. Annual precipitation is , much of it falling in the heavy rains occurring in late spring and summer.

Nanchang, the provincial capital and the most densely populated city, is one of the largest Chinese metropolises. Nanchang is the hub of Jiangxi civilization throughout its history, which plays a leading role in the commercial, intellectual and industrial and political fields. Ganzhou is the largest subdivision of Jiangxi.

==Administrative divisions==

Jiangxi is divided into eleven prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities:

These prefecture-level cities are in turn subdivided into 100 county-level divisions (27 districts, 12 county-level cities, and 61 counties). Those in turn are divided into 1566 township-level divisions (830 towns, 560 townships, 8 ethnic townships, and 168 subdistricts).

See List of administrative divisions of Jiangxi for a complete list of county-level divisions.

==Politics==

The politics of Jiangxi is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Jiangxi is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Jiangxi. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangxi Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the &quot;Jiangxi CCP Party Chief&quot;.

==Economy==
Jiangxi was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

Rice is the dominant crop in Jiangxi. Cash crops commonly grown include cotton and rapeseed. Jiangxi is the leading producer of kumquats in China, particularly in Suichuan County.

Mining-related industries are a major part of Jiangxi&#x27;s economy.Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of copper, tungsten, gold, silver, uranium, thorium, tantalum, niobium, among others. Noted centers of mining include Dexing (copper) and Dayu County (tungsten).

It is located in extreme proximity to some of the richest provinces of China (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian), which are sometimes blamed for taking away talent and capital from Jiangxi.

Jiangxi has the lowest wages and third lowest property prices in all of China. As of 2016 Jiangxi&#x27;s nominal GDP was CNY 1.84 trillion or US$276.48 billion, and a per capita of CNY 40,400 or US$6,082.

In addition, Jiangxi is connected by rail to Anhui Province via the Anhui–Jiangxi and Tongling–Jiujiang Railways; to Hubei via the Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway; and to Fujian via the Yingtan–Xiamen, Hengfeng–Nanping, Ganzhou–Longyan and Xiangtang–Putian Railways.

==Tourism==
There are several famous mountains in Jiangxi Province, including Mount Lu in Jiujiang, Jinggang Mountains at the border of Jiangxi and Hunan, and Mount Sanqing in Yushan county.

Near the northern port city of Jiujiang lies the well-known resort area of Mount Lu. Also near the city is the Donglin Temple, an important Buddhist temple in china.

Near the small city of Yingtan is the resort area of Longhushan, which purports to be the birthplace of Taoism and hence has great symbolic value to Taoists. The region has many temples, cave complexes, mountains and villages.

The Mount Lu National Park has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.

Kuling located on the top of Mount Lu is a summer resort developed by European in the 19th century. There were 3000 European living in Kuling, Lushan and Jiujiang in summer time in 1920s.

In 2007, Jiangxi (specifically the Zhelin Reservoir, located in Jiujiang) was the filming location for the fifteenth series of the American TV show &quot;&quot;.

==Flora and fauna==

The mountainous terrain and large forest coverage of Jiangxi has made it historically one of the more wild places of central China. South China tigers have been seen as recently as fifteen or twenty years ago and projects are underway to document evidence of existing tigers, if there are any. Several mountain areas along the northern border with Hunan and Hubei are potential sites for &quot;wilderness&quot; preserves specifically for protecting or even reintroducing tigers.

Other wildlife, though not plentiful, are more numerous in Jiangxi than in many other developed areas of China. Numerous species of birds are common, especially around the marshes of Lake Poyang in the north. Though protected, mammals such as muntjac, wild boar, civet cats, and pangolins, are still common enough that they&#x27;ll even occasionally be seen in markets for sale as game meat, or possibly even in a forest.

The late Paleocene mesonychid, &quot;Jiangxia chaotoensis&quot; was found in the province, and named after it.

<text>Qinghai is an inland province in Northwestern China. It is the largest province of China (excluding autonomous regions) by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.

Qinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name &quot;Qinghai&quot; is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.

Located mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining, nearby Haidong, and Haixi), Tibetans, Hui, Mongols, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai&#x27;s population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.

The area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi&#x27;s control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.

==History==
During the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.

In the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.

In the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake). Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen&#x27;s and Ralpacan&#x27;s reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848, which included Xi&#x27;an.

During the fragmentation of the Tibetan Empire, a series of local polities emerged under the political jostling of Western Xia to the north and Song dynasty to the east -- from the military-rule of Guiyi Circuit, to a Tibetan tribal confederacy, and eventually the Tibetan theocratic kingdom of Tsongkha. The Song dynasty eventually defeated the Kokonor kingdom Tsongkha in the 1070s. During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty&#x27;s administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.

Most of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370. The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname. The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.

From 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty. Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the &quot;Tibetan frontier district&quot;. In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.

Under the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations. The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai. Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.

In July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was &quot;Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur&quot; (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai). In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin and then Ma Qi&#x27;s son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords. Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui. Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.

Ma Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai&#x27;s politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated. General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.

As the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People&#x27;s Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People&#x27;s Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province&#x27;s territorial integrity. Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis&#x27; Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south. Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai&#x27;s population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.

==Geography==
Qinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).

The Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.

The Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.

Qinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province.

The Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert.

===Climate===
The average elevation of Qinghai is approximately 3000 m. Mountain ranges include the Tanggula Mountains and Kunlun Mountains, with the highest point being Bukadaban Feng at 6860 m. Due to the high altitude, Qinghai has quite cold winters (harsh in the highest elevations), mild summers, and a large diurnal temperature variation. Its mean annual temperature is approximately , with January temperatures ranging from and July temperatures ranging from . It is also prone to heavy winds as well as sandstorms from February to April. Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.

==Politics==

The Politics of Qinghai Province in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Qinghai. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the &quot;Qinghai Party Chief&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
Because the Han form Qinghai&#x27;s ethnic majority and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels. Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:

The eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).

===Urban areas===

==Population==

===Demographics===
===Ethnicity===
There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai&#x27;s population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population. In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province. Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao&#x27;an. The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.

===Religion===
The predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province&#x27;s population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004. According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.

From September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.
==Culture==
Qinghai has been influenced by interactions &quot;between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west&quot;. The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another. In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the &quot;Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven&quot;. According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.

The main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380. Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities. The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat. The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.

==Economy==

Qinghai&#x27;s economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (US$50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country&#x27;s economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (US$9,028) (nominal), the 24th in China.

Its heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy. Salt works operate at many of the province&#x27;s numerous salt lakes.

Outside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.

===Economic and technological development zone===

Xining Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. Xining is located in the east of the province at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River, one of the Yellow River&#x27;s branches. The city is surrounded by mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m, the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation&#x27;s strategy of developing the west.

XETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi&#x27;ning Airport—a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi&#x27;an. Xining is Qinghai province&#x27;s passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.

It focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.

===Tourism===

There are many tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.

During the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.

Qinghai Lake () is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta&#x27;er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;, the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.

===Transportation===
The Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province&#x27;s capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.

Construction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province&#x27;s northwestern part, started in 2012.

Six National Highways run through the province.

Xining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province&#x27;s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.

==Telecommunications==
Since the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its &quot;Access to Telephones Project&quot;, Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3,860 out of its 4,133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunications facilities in the region.

Satellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007. The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.

<doc id="173821" wikidata="Q16247075" url="?curid=173821" title="Cucumber soup">
<text>Cucumber soup is a traditional Polish and Lithuanian soup (, ). It is made from sour, salted cucumbers and potato. Occasionally, rice is substituted for the potatoes.

Cucumber soup is also any soup using cucumbers as a primary ingredient, and is present in various cuisines. The two major varieties are fresh cucumber soup and pickled cucumber soup.

A similar soup is also common in Russia and Ukraine, where it is known as &quot;rassolnik&quot;. There is another cucumber based soup known as tarator in Bulgaria, which is served cold.

==Fresh cucumber soups==
Some fresh cucumber soups are just a blend of ingredients (cucumber, spices, other vegetables or fruits, etc.) served cold; others are cooked, possibly in some kind of broth, and served either hot or chilled.

<doc id="173825" wikidata="Q180861" url="?curid=173825" title="Roger Waters">
<text>George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician and singer-songwriter. In 1965, he co-founded the rock band Pink Floyd as the bassist. Following the departure of the songwriter, Syd Barrett, in 1968, Waters became Pink Floyd&#x27;s lyricist, co-lead vocalist and conceptual leader until his departure in 1985.

Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975), &quot;Animals&quot; (1977), &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute over the use of the band&#x27;s name and material. They settled out of court in 1987. Waters&#x27;s solo work includes the studio albums &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; (1984), &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; (1987)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Amused to Death&quot; (1992)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Is This the Life We Really Want?&quot; (2017). In 2005, he released &quot;&quot;, an opera translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils&#x27; libretto about the French Revolution.

In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;, with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Later in 2005, he reunited with Pink Floyd for the Live 8 global awareness event, their only appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999. He performed &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; for his world tour of 2006–2008, and The Wall Live, his tour of 2010–2013, was the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist at the time.

Waters incorporates political themes in his work and is a prominent supporter of Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, and describes Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. Elements of his live show and some of his comments, such as his likening of Israel to Nazi Germany, drew accusations of antisemitism, which Waters dismissed as a conflation with anti-Zionism.

==Early years==
Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member.

In the early years of the Second World War, Waters&#x27;s father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz. He later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated in Aprilia and at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, Italy and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband&#x27;s death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters&#x27;s earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations.

Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett. The future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school&#x27;s cricket and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: &quot;I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... The same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers.&quot;

Waters met future Pink Floyd members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London, at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) School of Architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well suited to that field. He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.

==1965–1985: Pink Floyd==
===Formation and Barrett-led period===
By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar, Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble&#x27;s sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.

When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and the guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters switched to the bass. By January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard&#x27;s Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. In late 1965, the Tea Set had changed their name to the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and, by early 1966, Pink Floyd.

By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd&#x27;s frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, released in August 1967. Waters contributed the song &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot; (his first sole writing credit) to the album. By late 1967, Barrett&#x27;s deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour rendered him &quot;unable or unwilling&quot; to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd&#x27;s songwriter and lead guitarist. In early March 1968, to discuss the band&#x27;s future, Barrett, Mason, Waters, and Wright met with the band&#x27;s managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, of the rock music management company they had all founded, Blackhill Enterprises. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band &quot;agreed to Blackhill&#x27;s entitlement in perpetuity&quot; regarding &quot;past activities&quot;. Their new manager, Steve O&#x27;Rourke, made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of Gilmour in April 1968.

===Waters-led period===
After Barrett&#x27;s departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd&#x27;s artistic direction. In 1970, he composed – in collaboration with Ron Geesin – &quot;Music from The Body&quot;, a soundtrack for Roy Battersby&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Body&quot;.

Waters said he wanted to &quot;drag [Pink Floyd] kicking and screaming back from the borders of space, from the whimsy that Syd was into, to my concerns, which were much more political and philosophical&quot;. He became a dominant songwriter and the band&#x27;s principal lyricist, sharing lead vocals with Gilmour and sometimes Wright. Throughout the late 1970s, he was the band&#x27;s dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote most of the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his departure, starting with &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and ending with &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control. Every Waters studio album from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; onwards has been a concept album.

With lyrics entirely by Waters, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is one of the most successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 consecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. As of 2005, it continued to sell over 8,000 copies a week. According to the Pink Floyd biographer Glenn Povey, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is the world&#x27;s second-bestselling album and the United States&#x27; 21st-bestselling album. In 2006, asked if he felt his goals for &quot;Dark Side&quot; had been accomplished, Waters said his wife wept the first time he played it for her: &quot;You then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, &#x27;Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work,&#x27; and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.

Waters&#x27;s thematic ideas became the impetus for the concept albums &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975), &quot;Animals&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979) — written largely by Waters — and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983), written entirely by him. The cost of war and the loss of his father became a recurring theme, from &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; (&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, 1968) and &quot;Free Four&quot; (&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;, 1972) to &quot;Us and Them&quot; from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;, first used in the feature film &quot;The Wall&quot; (1982), later included with &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; on &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, an album dedicated to his father. The theme and composition of &quot;The Wall&quot; was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the World War II.

&quot;The Wall&quot;, written almost entirely by Waters, is largely based on his life story. Having sold over 23 million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is tied for sixth-most certified album of all time in America. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the sleeve art. They embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund, Germany. The last Pink Floyd performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; was on 17 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd&#x27;s last appearance with Waters until the band&#x27;s brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, 24 years later.

In March 1983, the last Pink Floyd album with Waters, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, was released. It was subtitled, &quot;A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd&quot;. Waters wrote all the album&#x27;s lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name. At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour&#x27;s name &quot;disappeared&quot; from the production credits, though he retained his pay. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as &quot;a superlative achievement&quot; and &quot;art rock&#x27;s crowning masterpiece&quot;. Loder viewed the work as &quot;essentially a Roger Waters solo album&quot;.

===Departure and legal battles===
Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material. In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the &quot;Leaving Member&quot; clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated High Court proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a &quot;spent force creatively.&quot; Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters said he had been forced to resign like Barrett had been years earlier, and decided to leave the band based on legal considerations, saying: &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely.&quot;

Waters did not want the band to use the name Pink Floyd without him. He said later: &quot;I would be distressed if Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr made records and went on the road calling themselves the Beatles. If John Lennon&#x27;s not in it, it&#x27;s sacrilegious ... To continue with Gilmour and Mason, getting in a whole bunch of other people to write the material, seems to me an insult to the work that came before.&quot; In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement. Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O&#x27;Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the &quot;Wall&quot; concept and the inflatable &quot;Animals &quot;pig. Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; (1987), &quot;The Division Bell&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Endless River&quot; (2014). According to a 1999 interview with Gilmour, Waters declined an invitation to perform &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; with Pink Floyd at Earls Court, London.

In 2005, Waters said the period of his departure had been a &quot;bad, negative time&quot;, and that he regretted his part in the negativity: &quot;Why should I have imposed my feeling about the work and what it was worth on the others if they didn&#x27;t feel the same? I was wrong in attempting to do that.&quot; In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members.

==1984–present: solo career==

=== 1984–1989: &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; and &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; ===
In 1984, Waters released his first solo album, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;, which dealt with Waters&#x27;s feelings about monogamy and family life versus &quot;the call of the wild.&quot; The protagonist, Reg, finally chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album features the guitarist Eric Clapton, the jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. Kurt Loder described &quot;The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; as a &quot;strangely static, faintly hideous record&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the album a &quot;rock bottom one star&quot;. Years later, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic praised its &quot;ingenious symbolism&quot; and &quot;brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm&quot;, rating it four out of five.

Waters toured the album with Clapton, a new band, and new material; the shows included a selection of Pink Floyd songs. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour drew poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; Waters estimated that he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, played a tour of smaller venues in North America in 1985. &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; was certified gold in the US.

In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated film &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;, based on the book by Raymond Briggs. His band featuring, Paul Carrack, was credited as the Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;, a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to tune into radio waves in his head. Billy learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world&#x27;s computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a tour.

=== 1989–1999: &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; and &quot;Amused to Death&quot; ===
In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history, &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show reported an attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. Leonard Cheshire asked Waters to perform the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters&#x27;s musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set, and Scarfe&#x27;s inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale. Many rock icons received invitations to the show, though Gilmour, Mason, and Wright did not. Waters released a double album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, &quot;Amused to Death&quot;, in 1992. The record was influenced heavily by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; by Neil Postman. Patrick Leonard, who worked on &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album&#x27;s tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios. It is Waters&#x27;s most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd. Waters described the record as a &quot;stunning piece of work&quot;, ranking it alongside &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; as one of the best of his career. The song &quot;What God Wants, Pt. 1&quot; reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. &quot;Amused to Death&quot; was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. Sales of &quot;Amused to Death&quot; topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour. In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.

===1999–2004: In the Flesh tour and &quot;Wall&quot; Broadway production===
In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones. The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, &quot;In the Flesh – Live&quot;. During the tour, Waters played two new songs &quot;Flickering Flame&quot; and &quot;Each Small Candle&quot; as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.

Miramax announced in 2004 that a production of &quot;The Wall&quot; was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from &quot;The Wall&quot;, but also songs from &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material. On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture, were played on the occasion of the &quot;Welcome Europe&quot; celebrations in the accession country of Malta. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta. In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks online: &quot;To Kill the Child&quot;, inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and &quot;Leaving Beirut&quot;, an anti-war song inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager.

=== 2005: Pink Floyd reunion and &quot;&quot; ===

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, Pink Floyd&#x27;s only appearance with Waters since their final performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; at Earls Court London 24 years earlier. They played a 23-minute set consisting of &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe&quot;/&quot;Breathe (Reprise)&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be &quot;slight&quot; considering his and Gilmour&#x27;s continuing musical and ideological differences. Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he &quot;agreed to roll over for one night only&quot;. In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.

In September 2005, Waters released &#x27; (pronounced , French for &quot;it will be fine&quot;; Waters added the subtitle, &quot;There is Hope&quot;), an opera in three acts translated from the late Étienne Roda-Gil&#x27;s French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution. &#x27; was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves. Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989, and said about the composition: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Beethoven&#x27;s choral music, Berlioz and Borodin ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that&#x27;s where my tastes lie in classical and choral music.&quot; Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would &quot;take in stride&quot;, a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes is &quot;a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy&quot;. &quot;&quot; reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Classical Music Chart in the United States.

=== 2006–2009: The Dark Side of the Moon Live ===
In June 2006, Waters began the two-year Dark Side of the Moon Live world tour. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters&#x27;s solo material; the second included a complete performance of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, the first time in more than three decades that Waters had performed it. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of &quot;The Wall&quot;. The elaborate staging, by the concert lighting designer Marc Brickman, included laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a &quot;handler&quot; dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree quadraphonic sound system. Mason joined Waters for the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; set and the encores on some 2006 performances.

In March 2007, the Waters song &quot;Hello (I Love You)&quot; featured in the science fiction film &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot;. Waters released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as &quot;a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity&#x27;s best and worst instincts, and how a child&#x27;s innocence can win the day&quot;. He performed at California&#x27;s Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India, in December 2008, but the concert was cancelled following the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai. In April 2008, Waters discussed a possible new album with the tentative name &quot;Heartland&quot;.

===2010s: The Wall Live and &quot;Is This the Life We Really Want?&quot; ===
In June 2010, Waters released a cover of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, a protest song rewritten and arranged by Guy Carawan and Pete Seeger. He performed with Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010. The set comprised a cover of the Phil Spector song &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot;, which was played in early Pink Floyd soundchecks, followed by &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two)&quot;.

In September 2010, Waters began the Wall Live tour, an updated version of the original Pink Floyd tour, featuring a complete performance of &quot;The Wall&quot;. At the O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason again performed with Waters on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, and &quot;Outside the Wall&quot;. For the first half of 2012, the tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales, having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. By 2013, the Wall Live had become the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist. Waters performed at the Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, he headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island, accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius. Waters performed at the Desert Trip festival in October 2016.
Waters released his first solo album in nearly 25 years, &quot;Is This the Life We Really Want?,&quot; on 2 June 2017. It was produced by the Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. Godrich was a fan of Waters&#x27;s work with Pink Floyd, but was critical of his solo work and encouraged him to make a concise album showcasing his lyrics. Waters returned to North America in 2017 with the Us + Them Tour, performing Pink Floyd and solo material.

On 26 October 2018, Sony Classical Masterworks released an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s theatrical work &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot; narrated by Waters. On 18 April 2019, Waters joined Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets on stage at the Beacon Theatre to sing &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;. Waters was one of the ten highest-grossing concert acts of the decade.

=== 2020s: This is Not a Drill, Pink Floyd disputes and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot; ===
In January 2020, Waters announced a new arena tour, This Is Not a Drill, that would tour North America and finish one month before the 2020 presidential election. The tour was rescheduled to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The concerts were held from July to October 2022, and expanded with dates in Europe from March to June 2023. In 2021, Waters said he had begun writing a memoir during the pandemic. In December 2022, he released an EP, &quot;The Lockdown Sessions&quot;, comprising six new versions of songs from his solo career and Pink Floyd.

Waters continued to quarrel with Gilmour. In 2021, Waters wrote publicly of their disputes over Pink Floyd reissues and credits, accusing Gilmour of distorting the truth, and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd&#x27;s website and social media channels. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that Waters and Gilmour had &quot;hit yet another low point in their relationship&quot;.

Early in 2023, Waters gave an interview in which he criticised Pink Floyd&#x27;s 2022 track &quot;Hey, Hey, Rise Up!&quot;, which was released in support of Ukraine. Shortly afterwards, Polly Samson, the wife of Gilmour and a lyricist for Pink Floyd, wrote on Twitter that Waters was antisemitic and &quot;a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy megalomaniac&quot;. Gilmour responded to the tweet on Twitter: &quot;Every word demonstrably true.&quot; Waters released a statement on Twitter saying he was aware of the &quot;incendiary and wildly inaccurate&quot; comments and was &quot;taking advice as to his position&quot;. Asked by Piers Morgan to respond to the comments, Waters said: &quot;No comment. Oh, shut up ... They&#x27;re public, and I&#x27;m private.&quot;

For the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Waters recorded a new version, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot;, released on 6 October 2023. It features spoken-word sections and no guitar solos, to &quot;bring out the heart and soul of the album musically and spiritually&quot;. In a press release, Waters wrote: &quot;Dave, Rick, Nick, and I were so young when we made [the original], and when you look at the world around us, clearly the message hasn&#x27;t stuck. That&#x27;s why I started to consider what the wisdom of an 80 year old could bring to a reimagined version.&quot; In October, Waters held two concerts at the London Palladium, where he performed &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot;, spoke on topics such as Julian Assange and read from his unpublished memoir.

== Politics ==

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict and accusations of antisemitism ===
Waters is a vocal supporter of Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He is a member of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a campaign for an international boycott of Israel. Waters first saw the Israeli West Bank barrier in 2006, at the request of Palestinian supporters, when he was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv. He subsequently moved a Tel Aviv concert to Neve Shalom and called for the barrier&#x27;s removal: &quot;The wall is an appalling edifice to behold. It is policed by young Israeli soldiers who treated me, a casual observer from another world, with disdainful aggression.&quot; He has repeatedly described Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. In 2023, he was one of the principal signers of an open letter called Artists Against Apartheid. 

Waters has criticised numerous other artists who have performed in Israel. In 2015, Waters published an open letter in &quot;Salon&quot; criticising the rock band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv. In 2017, he urged Radiohead to cancel a concert there, signing a letter with 50 others, and was co-signatory on an open letter asking Nick Cave to cancel his. Neither Radiohead nor Cave cancelled their concerts. Waters narrated the 2016 documentary &quot;The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel&#x27;s Public Relations War in the United States&quot; about the methods used by Israel to shape American public opinion.

In 2013, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Jewish human rights organisation the Simon Wiesenthal Center, accused Waters of antisemitism for including a giant pig balloon bearing a Star of David in his concerts. Waters responded that it was one of several religious and political symbols in the show and not an attempt to single out Judaism as an evil force. 

The same year, in an interview in CounterPunch, Waters compared the Israeli treatment of Palestinians to Nazi Germany, saying: &quot;The parallels with what went on in the 1930s in Germany are so crushingly obvious.&quot; He said the reason why few celebrities had joined the BDS movement in the United States was because &quot;the Jewish lobby is extraordinary powerful here and particularly in the industry that I work in, the music industry&quot;. Following the remarks, the Anti-Defamation League charged that Waters&#x27;s remarks were antisemitic. The American rabbi Shmuley Boteach responded to Waters in the &quot;New York Observer&quot;: &quot;That you would have the audacity to compare Jews to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency, you have no heart, you have no soul.&quot; Speaking in New York afterwards, Waters said supporters of Israel often attack critics as antisemitic as a &quot;diversionary tactic&quot; by conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism. 

In a 2017 interview with Omar Barghouti, Waters again likened Israel&#x27;s public diplomacy to Nazi Germany: &quot;The thing about propaganda – again, it&#x27;s not hard to go back to Goebbels or the 1930s. You understand the tactic is to tell the big lie as often as possible over and over and over and over again. And people believe it.&quot; In 2017, the writer Ian Halperin produced a documentary, &quot;Wish You Weren&#x27;t Here&quot;, accusing Waters of antisemitism and &quot;erecting the very walls that hinder peace in the region and fuel hatred&quot;.

In 2020, Major League Baseball stopped advertising Waters&#x27;s This Is Not a Drill concerts after receiving criticism from Jewish advocacy groups. Later that year, Waters said the American Jewish businessman and Republican Party donor Sheldon Adelson was a &quot;puppet master&quot; controlling American politics. He said that Adelson believed that &quot;only Jewish people are completely human ... I&#x27;m not saying Jewish people believe this. I am saying that he does, and he is pulling the strings.&quot; In the same interview, Waters said that the murder of George Floyd was carried out with a technique developed by the Israeli Defence Forces. He said the Americans had studied the technique to learn &quot;how to murder the blacks because they have seen how efficient the Israelis have been at murdering Palestinians in the occupied territories by using those techniques ... The Israelis are proud of it.&quot; In January 2024, the BMG music company cancelled a publishing agreement with Waters over his comments on Israel, Ukraine and the United States. 

In a February 2024 interview with Al Jazeera, Waters criticised the U2 singer Bono for dedicating a live performance of &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; to those killed in the 2023 Nova music festival massacre. Bono changed the lyrics of the song, which was written about Martin Luther King, from &quot;Free at last/They took your life&quot; to &quot;Stars of David/They took your life&quot;. Waters said it was &quot;so disgusting and degrading when you stand up for the Zionist entity. What he did a couple of weeks ago in the Sphere in Las Vegas, singing about the Stars of David, was one of the most disgusting things I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.&quot;

In July 2024, Waters engaged in heated debate with Piers Morgan on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot;, arguing that there was no evidence of sexual assault by the Palestinian organisation Hamas, that Israel targeted its own citizens in false flag operations, and that Palestinians had a right to &quot;fight back against the oppressor&quot;. During the UK general election that month, Waters criticised the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for his stance on the Israel–Hamas war and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, and performed a pro-Palestine concert in London with Cat Stevens and Lowkey.

====Fascist imagery and German police investigation====
On 25 February 2023, the German city of Frankfurt cancelled one of Waters&#x27;s scheduled shows, calling him one of the &quot;most widely known antisemites&quot; and citing his support for BDS, the imagery at his shows and his talks with Hamas. The move was supported by the Central Council of Jews in Germany and the Frankfurt Jewish Community. Waters hired a German law firm to challenge the concert cancellation, and released a statement denying the accusations and stating that the cancellation could have &quot;serious, far-reaching consequences for artists and activists all over the world&quot;. A German court overturned the cancellation, saying the concert should be viewed as a work of art and that it &quot;did not glorify or relativise the crimes of the Nazis or identify with Nazi racist ideology&quot;.

That May, German police opened a criminal investigation into Waters and the Nazi-style uniform he wore during his Berlin performance for possible incitement. Nazi symbolism is banned in Germany, with exemptions for educational and artistic purposes. Waters has long used similar uniforms for performances of &quot;The Wall,&quot; in which the protagonist hallucinates himself as a fascist dictator. Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry criticised Waters for his performance. The US Department of State called it &quot;deeply offensive to Jewish people&quot; and accused Waters of having a record of using antisemitic tropes. In the UK, Starmer and the secretary of state, Michael Gove, issued statements condemning him.

Waters said the use of fascist imagery was a statement in &quot;opposition to fascism, injustice and bigotry&quot;. He pointed out that he had been using Nazi-inspired uniforms in performances since 1980, but they had only recently attracted controversy. Waters felt the criticism was disingenuous and politically motivated, and that he had been attacked at the behest of the &quot;Israeli lobby&quot; in Germany. In an interview with Double Down News, Waters said the accusations of antisemitism were a &quot;vicious lie&quot; and &quot;deeply insulting&quot;, and that he was a victim of cancel culture. He said that the Israeli government was attempting to discredit him as they saw him as an &quot;existential threat to their settler-colonialist, racist, apartheid regime&quot;.

In May 2023, the Labour MP Christian Wakeford criticised Waters&#x27;s shows in UK parliament. Waters responded at a concert in London the following month, calling Wakeford a &quot;fucking moron&quot; and a &quot;cripple&quot;, which &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;drew a sharp intake of breath&quot; from some in attendance. Waters also said he was &quot;pissed off with this Israeli lobby bullshit&quot; and accused critics of &quot;making up stuff because you&#x27;ve been told to by your masters from the Foreign Office in Tel Aviv&quot;.

====2023 documentary alleging antisemitism====
In September 2023, a documentary alleging antisemitism by Waters, &quot;The Dark Side of Roger Waters&quot;, directed by John Ware, was released by the British group Campaign Against Antisemitism. It includes accounts from Waters&#x27;s past collaborators, including the &quot;Wall&quot; producer Bob Ezrin, who say Waters made offensive remarks about Jewish people. In a separate statement, Ezrin said he did not object to Waters&#x27;s challenging Israeli policy, but that &quot;if your language directly or by implication promotes the eradication of the world&#x27;s only Jewish state, then that is absolutely antisemitism in my book&quot;. Waters responded in a statement that he was &quot;frequently mouthy and prone to irreverence&quot; but not antisemitic, and that the film misrepresented his views.

According to the documentary, in a 2010 email to his crew, Waters described his idea for the inflatable pig to be floated above his gigs, which would have the words &quot;dirty kyke&quot;, &quot;follow the money&quot; and &quot;Scum&quot; written on it. In response, Waters said that the &quot;offensive words I referenced... were my brainstorming ideas on how to make the evils and horrors of fascism and extremism apparent&quot;, and &quot;not the manifestation of any underlying bigotry as the film suggests&quot;.

Ware sued for libel after Waters described called him a &quot;lying, conniving Zionist mouthpiece&quot; and accused him of &quot;cheerleading the genocide of Palestinians&quot; in interview on Al Jazeera. On 25 February, 2025, a London High Court judge ruled that Waters&#x27; comments were defamatory, advancing the case towards trial.

====Hotel cancellations====
Waters said in an interview with Glenn Greenwald that the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel may have been a false flag operation and that &quot;resistance to the Israeli occupation&quot; is legally and morally justifiable. In November 2023, after the interview with Greenwald, the Faena Hotel and the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos Aires cancelled Waters reservations without giving a reason. Several Argentine deputies repudiated Waters&#x27;s visit to their country.

The Hyatt Centric and the Regency Hotels in Montevideo denied Waters accommodation based on the right of admission. , a Colorado Party National Representative, asked the Municipality of Montevideo to withdraw the &quot;illustrious visitor to Montevideo&quot; title given to Waters in 2018.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
A week before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Waters told an RT interviewer that rumours of Russia launching an invasion were &quot;bullshit&quot; and Russophobic propaganda. After the invasion, Waters said that US President Joe Biden was &quot;fuelling the fire in the Ukraine... that is a huge crime&quot;, and questioned why the United States was not encouraging Ukraine &quot;to negotiate, obviating the need for this horrific, horrendous war&quot;. Responding to accusations that he was placing the responsibility to negotiate on the country that was invaded, Waters said that Russia was responding to provocations from NATO: &quot;This war is basically about the action and reaction of NATO pushing right up to the Russian border – which they promised they wouldn&#x27;t do.&quot; In another interview, Waters said the attack on Ukraine was &quot;probably the most provoked invasion ever&quot; and he refused to &quot;see Russia from the current Russo-phobic perspective&quot;.

On 5 September 2022, Waters published an open letter to Olena Zelenska, the First Lady of Ukraine. He accused Ukrainian &quot;extreme nationalists&quot; of starting the war and made no mention of Russia&#x27;s responsibility for the invasion. He argued that the West should not provide Ukraine with weapons, and that Western governments were prolonging the war with their support. Waters urged her husband to end the war based on the Minsk agreements. Waters&#x27;s concerts in Poland were cancelled following local outrage over his comments. 

In February 2023, Waters echoed Russian propaganda, saying that &quot;the Ukraine&quot; is &quot;not really a country&quot; but a &quot;vague experiment&quot;, and suggesting that Vladimir Putin was &quot;leading his country to the benefit of all of the people of Russia&quot;. Polly Samson and former bandmate David Gilmour responded by calling Waters a &quot;Putin apologist&quot;. On 8 February, Waters gave a speech to the United Nations Security Council at the Russian government&#x27;s behest. He condemned the invasion of Ukraine as illegal, but said it was &quot;not unprovoked&quot; and also &quot;condemned the provocateurs&quot; and called for a ceasefire. Waters was praised by Russia&#x27;s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukraine&#x27;s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, denounced Waters as &quot;another brick in the wall&quot; of Russian &quot;disinformation and propaganda&quot;.

In February 2025, Waters made another speech to the United Nations Security Council, which was requested by Russia for the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Minsk II agreement. Waters accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of abandoning the Minsk agreements, in breach of his election promise, and accused the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson of acting for the US to stop peace talks.

===Other views===
After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC.

He criticised the Hunting Act of 2004 and supported the Countryside Alliance, but explained he was defending the right to hunt rather than supporting the activity himself. Waters explained that whether he supported hunting or not, it was important to defend it as a right.

In 2007, Waters became a spokesman for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation fighting poverty and malaria. That July, he participated in the American leg of the Live Earth concert, aimed at raising awareness about global climate change. In 2015, Waters said that socialism was &quot;a good thing&quot;, and called for socialised healthcare in the United States.

Waters is supportive of veterans, which he partly attributes to the death of his father in World War II. He allocates a block of tickets for veterans at his shows. For a few years he performed with a group of wounded veterans that was arranged through the United States National Military Medical Center. In 2012, he led a benefit for United States military veterans, Stand Up for Heroes, and invited a group of combat-wounded veterans, MusiCorps, to perform with him.

Waters opposed Brexit (the UK leaving the European Union). Following the June 2016 referendum, which resulted in leaving the EU, he said: &quot;I thought we were better than that. I was wrong.&quot; He criticised US President Donald Trump and his policies. In 2017, Waters condemned Trump&#x27;s plan to build a wall separating the US and Mexico, drawing parallels to &quot;The Wall&quot;.

After the April 2018 Douma chemical attack carried out by the Syrian government, Waters called civil defence volunteers, the White Helmets, &quot;a fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists&quot; trying to incite the West to &quot;start dropping bombs on people in Syria&quot;.

In 2018, Waters included the Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in a list of &quot;neo-fascists&quot; displayed on a screen at his concert in São Paulo, which drew mixed responses from the crowd. In a concert in Rio de Janeiro that October, he acknowledged the murdered Brazilian councilwoman Marielle Franco and brought her daughter, sister and widow on stage. In an interview with the online music magazine &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot;, he said he tried to visit the progressive politician Lula da Silva, who was imprisoned on corruption charges; Waters said &quot;the only reason Lula is in prison is because he would have won the election&quot;.

In 2019, Waters spoke at a rally outside the Home Office calling for the release of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and dedicated a performance of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; to him. The following year, he spoke at a rally in support of Assange outside parliament in London. He showed his support for the 2019–2022 Chilean protests through a video from POUSTA.com. In an interview with the communist deputy Camila Vallejo, he condemned the president Sebastian Piñera, calling him a &quot;rat&quot;, and said the 2022 Chilean national plebiscite was &quot;extraordinarily revolutionary&quot;.

Waters supports Steven Donziger, an American lawyer embroiled in environmental litigation against Chevron corporation, and has funded some of Donziger&#x27;s legal fees. He endorsed the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 UK general election, describing him as a &quot;beacon of hope&quot;.

During his 2022 &quot;This Is Not a Drill&quot; shows, every US president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump was labelled a war criminal and a message was displayed that Joe Biden was &quot;just getting started&quot;. In an interview with Michael Smerconish, Waters said that Taiwan was part of China and that this had been &quot;absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948&quot;. Waters endorsed the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro for the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election, saying the main Venezuelan opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, is a &quot;sockpuppet&quot; of the U.S. government.

==Artistry==

Waters&#x27;s primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the bass guitar. However, he said in 1992 that he was &quot;never a bass player&quot; and was &quot;not interested in playing instruments and I never have been&quot;. Gilmour said that Waters used a limited, simple style and had not been interested in improving, and that Gilmour had played many of the bass parts on Pink Floyd records. According to Mason in 2018, Waters feels that &quot;everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing&quot;.

Author Mike Cormack claims that Waters is &quot;surely the greatest lyricist in all of rock music&quot;, for example pointing to Waters&#x27;s use of trochaic tetrameter in the refrain of the song &quot;Time&quot;, calling the lyrics to &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; &quot;the greatest ever in rock music&quot; and highlighting the &quot;exquisite phrasing&quot; of &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;.

Waters briefly played a Höfner bass, but replaced it with a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S. In 1970, it was stolen along with the rest of Pink Floyd&#x27;s equipment in New Orleans. He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London, in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972, when it became his main stage guitar. On 2 October 2010, it became the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses Rotosound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. He has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt, and Ashdown amplifiers but used Ampeg for later tours. He has employed delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing.

Waters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as &quot;On the Run&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, and &quot;In the Flesh?&quot; He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars. He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song &quot;Sheep&quot;, from &quot;Animals&quot;, and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as &quot;Pigs on the Wing 1 &amp; 2&quot;, also from &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Southampton Dock&quot; from &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, and on &quot;Mother&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot;. A Binson Echorec 2 delay effect was used on his bass lead track &quot;One of These Days&quot;. Waters plays trumpet during concert performances of &quot;Outside the Wall&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart Judith Trim, a school teacher and potter. She was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of the Pink Floyd album &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, but excised from CD reissues. They had no children and divorced in 1975. Trim died in 2001. 

In 1976, Waters married Carolyne Christie, the niece of the third Marquess of Zetland. They had a son, Harry Waters, who has played keyboards with Waters&#x27;s touring band since 2002, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992. In 1993, Waters married Priscilla Phillips. They had a son, Jack Fletcher. Their marriage ended in 2001. 

In 2004, Waters became engaged to the actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning. They married on 14 January 2012 and filed for divorce in September 2015. Waters married his fifth wife, Kamilah Chavis, in October 2021. Waters has homes in Long Island and Hampshire. He is an atheist.
