<text>The Bevis Frond is an English rock band formed in 1986 in Walthamstow, London, England. The band is fronted by Nick Saloman and has recorded many singles and albums on various independent labels.

==Information==
Saloman was originally in a band known as the Bevis Frond Museum in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s, whilst at college, he played guitar with a duo called Oddsocks. They released one album, &quot;Men of the Moment&quot;. In 1979 he formed a band called the Von Trap Family, who released the first single on his own Woronzow Records label. The early Von Trap Family recordings, comprising three sessions, were released on the Bevis Frond Bandcamp site for the first time in May 2010. The next release on Woronzow was in 1982, a 12&quot; single by Room 13 with Saloman on guitar and future Bevis Frond drummer Martin Crowley. After Room 13 reached the end of its natural life, Nick Saloman had a bad motorbike accident that left him with a constriction of movement in his left arm. True to form, he had the arm set so that he could continue playing guitar. With the proceeds from a damages claim he bought a 4 track recorder and recorded some music which he decided to press as a limited release of 250 albums, more for the sake of just releasing an album than anything else. He was very surprised when Funhouse records in Kent phoned him up and asked for a couple of hundred copies as they had been selling the album quite briskly. Saloman&#x27;s desire was to &quot;record the kind of music I&#x27;d like to listen to… I wanted a Hendrix/Wipers/Byrds sound but with a distinctly British feel.&quot; Subsequent albums were also recorded in a home studio and released on Woronzow until 1988, when he signed a deal with Reckless Records for the UK and USA. All the early albums were finally re-released on CD and Reckless financed the recording and release of his sixth album, &quot;Any Gas Faster&quot;, using a professional studio for the first time, reuniting him with drummer Martin Crowley. This is also the point that he began touring. Another 1990 album, &quot;Magic Eye&quot;, was a collaboration with Twink of the Pink Fairies. In 1990, he returned to the studio to record his next album, &quot;New River Head&quot;, which featured guest musicians including Barry Dransfield and David Tibet. The next year he recorded &quot;London Stone&quot;, but Reckless were less than happy with the album, and in the ensuing friction, Saloman decided to release the album on Woronzow again.

Saloman continued to release albums regularly until the release of &quot;Hit Squad&quot; in 2004. A couple of years earlier he had signed a deal with Past and Present in the UK and Rubric Records in the US, after which most of his early albums were remastered and re-released with bonus tracks. This initiative faltered after a couple of years, and all the early albums up to and including &quot;London Stone&quot; were re-released (except &quot;Any Gas Faster&quot;).

In February 2010, a download site was set up for the Bevis Frond. The aim of this project is to make all the Bevis Frond material available for download in the best possible quality, and to make digitally available unreleased tracks and vinyl only tracks from throughout Saloman&#x27;s career. Recent additions include all the studio sessions by the Von Trap Family. This project was completed in September 2010.

Early albums were usually entirely recorded by Saloman, while most later albums have been recorded by the contemporary touring band. For performances, the Bevis Frond usually has Adrian &quot;Ade&quot; Shaw on bass. Bevis Frond material is typically released on Woronzow Records label, and is frequently featured in the Ptolemaic Terrascope magazine and accompanying records and CDs. The Bevis Frond also record with and write much of the material for US singer Mary Lou Lord. The song &quot;Lights Are Changing&quot; was chosen for inclusion on &quot;Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era, 1976–1995&quot;.

After seven years without the appearance of new material, The Bevis Frond released a new album, &quot;The Leaving of London&quot;, on 10 October 2011. Recorded at Golddust Studios, it features a new drummer, Dave Pearce, formerly of Woronzow artists Psycho&#x27;s Mum, along with regular contributors Adrian Shaw and Paul Simmons. Live shows in Europe and the UK to promote the album are scheduled for late 2011 and early 2012. In January 2012 the band toured Germany.

Following &quot;The Leaving of London&quot;, The Bevis Frond released &quot;White Numbers&quot; in May 2013, with a similar band line-up. In 2014 the compilation titled &quot;High in a Flat&quot; was released including that song, which had been released on the CD reissue of &quot;New River Head&quot; but not on the one-CD release earlier. Then, in September 2015, Nick released a new album titled &quot;Example 22&quot;. 

Saloman and Simmons host a weekly radio program called &quot;The Scene&quot;, covering music from the 1960s to the 1980s, usually nearly-forgotten tracks from their own extensive record collections. It is broadcast from 7:00 A.M to 8:00 A.M. on Friday mornings on MIT&#x27;s radio station WMBR, 88.1 FM, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They use their knowledge of musicians&#x27; timelines, bands played in and with to connect songs they play to other musicians and other bands.
Saloman is owner of Platform One Records, a vinyl record store in Bexhill, East Sussex, United Kingdom-chiefly selling used &#x27;rock&#x27; vinyl.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Nick Saloman was a contestant on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;. He is a supporter of Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers F.C., prompting Richard Whiteley to joke &quot;What do you get when you cross The Bevis Frond and Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers? Rock bottom.&quot;

Saloman&#x27;s mother Joanne was a schoolteacher to Adam Ant and is credited by Ant as first having encouraged him to be an artist. Saloman himself was also friends with Ant at school and later, according to Ant, would introduce him to &quot;long hair, Jimi Hendrix and loud guitars, which he played wildly and not without skill.&quot;

<text>Sir William Robert Wills Wilde FRCSI (March 1815 – 19 April 1876) was an Irish oto-ophthalmologic surgeon and the author of significant works on medicine, archaeology and folklore, particularly concerning his native Ireland. He was the father of Oscar Wilde.

==Early life and career==

William Wilde was born at Kilkeevin, near Castlerea, in County Roscommon, the youngest of the three sons and two daughters of a prominent local medical practitioner, Thomas Wills Wilde, and his wife, Amelia Flynne (d. c.1844). His family were members of the Church of Ireland, and he was descended from a Dutchman, Colonel de Wilde, who went to Ireland with King William of Orange&#x27;s invasion army in 1690, and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. He received his initial education at the Elphin Diocesan School in Elphin, County Roscommon. In 1832, Wilde was bound as an apprentice to Abraham Colles, the pre-eminent Irish surgeon of the day, at Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital in Dublin. He was also taught by the surgeons James Cusack and Sir Philip Crampton and the physician Sir Henry Marsh. Wilde also studied at the private and highly respected school of anatomy, medicine, and surgery in Park Street (later Lincoln Place), Dublin. In 1837, he earned his medical degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In the same year, Wilde embarked on an eight-month cruise to the Holy Land with a recovering patient, visiting various cities and islands throughout the Mediterranean. Porpoises were flung on board the ship, &quot;Crusader&quot;, and Wilde dissected them. Taking notes, he eventually composed a two-volume book on the nursing habits of the creatures. Among the places he visited on this tour was Egypt. In a tomb, he found the mummified remains of a dwarf and salvaged the torso to bring back to Ireland. He also collected embalmed ibises.

Once back in Ireland, Wilde published an article in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; suggesting that one of the &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Needles&quot; be transported to England (eventually in 1878 one of the Needles was transported to London, and in 1880 the other one was brought to New York&#x27;s Central Park). In 1873 he was awarded the Cunningham Gold Medal by the Royal Irish Academy. Wilde was a founder member of the Irish nationalist Home Government Association, established by his Trinity College Dublin colleague Isaac Butt as the precursor to the Irish Parliamentary Party.

==Recognition==
He ran his own hospital, St Mark&#x27;s Ophthalmic Hospital for Diseases of the Eye and Ear, in Dublin and was appointed to serve as Oculist-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria. At one point, Wilde performed surgery on the father of another famous Irish dramatist, George Bernard Shaw.

Wilde had a very successful medical practice and was assisted in it by his natural son, Henry Wilson, who had been trained in Dublin, Vienna, Heidelberg, Berlin, and Paris. Wilson&#x27;s presence enabled Wilde to travel and he visited Scandinavia, where he received an honorary degree from Uppsala, and was welcomed in Stockholm by Anders Retzius, among others. King Karl XV of Sweden conferred on him the Nordstjärneorden (Order of the North Star). In 1853, he was appointed Surgeon Occulist in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland, the first position of its kind, probably created for him.

He was awarded a knighthood in a ceremony at Dublin Castle on 28 January 1864 more for his involvement with the Irish census than for his medical contributions, although he had been appointed medical commissioner to the Irish census in 1841. In 1845, he became editor of the &quot;Dublin Journal of Medical Science&quot;, to which he contributed many articles.

There is a plaque at 2 Merrion Square, Dublin dedicated to Wilde.

==Marriage and children==
On 12 November 1851, Wilde married the poet Jane Francesca Agnes Elgee, who wrote and published under the name of Speranza. The couple had two sons: William (Willie) and Oscar, and a daughter, Isola Francesca, who died in childhood.

In addition to his children with his wife, Sir William Wilde was the father of three children born out of wedlock before his marriage: Henry Wilson, born in 1838, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, of different parentage to Henry. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate children and provided for their education, but they were reared by his relatives rather than with his wife and legitimate children. Emily and Mary both died in 1871 following a Halloween party at which their dresses accidentally caught fire.

From 1855 to his death in 1876, William Wilde lived at No. 1 Merrion Square, now the headquarters of American College Dublin. The building is named Oscar Wilde House after William Wilde&#x27;s son, who also lived at the address from 1855 until 1878.

==Later life==

Wilde&#x27;s reputation suffered when Mary Travers, a long-term patient of his and the daughter of a colleague, claimed that he had raped her two years earlier. She wrote a pamphlet crudely parodying Wilde and Lady Wilde as Dr and Mrs Quilp, and portraying Dr Quilp as the rapist of a female patient anaesthetised under chloroform. She distributed the pamphlets outside the building where Wilde was about to give a public lecture. Lady Wilde complained to Mary&#x27;s father, Robert Travers, which resulted in Mary bringing a libel case against her. Mary Travers won her case but was awarded a mere farthing in damages by the jury. Legal costs of £2,000 were awarded against Lady Wilde. The case was the talk of all Dublin, and Wilde&#x27;s refusal to enter the witness box during the trial was widely held against him as ungentlemanly behaviour.

From this time onwards, Wilde began to withdraw from Dublin to the west of Ireland, where he had started in 1864 to build what became Moytura, his house overlooking Lough Corrib in Connemara, County Galway. He died aged 61 in 1876, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin.

<text>Think Global was a Norwegian electric car manufacturer located in Bærum, which manufactured cars under the &quot;TH!NK&quot; brand. Production of the Think City was stopped in March 2011 and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. The company was bought soon after by Electric Mobility Solutions AS and production ceased in August 2012 with no more announcements regarding future production. , a total of 2,500 units had been manufactured at Oslo-based TH!NK&#x27;s production facility.

The Ford TH!NK was a line of electric vehicles produced by TH!NK Mobility, then an enterprise of the Ford Motor Company. The short-lived line included four models: the TH!NK Neighbor and the TH!NK City, small electric automobiles, and the TH!NK Bike Traveler and the TH!NK Bike Fun, electric-powered motorized bicycle. Ford sold its stock, and the resulting company, Think Global, produced electric cars in Norway until declaring bankruptcy in 2011.

== History ==

The company was founded in January 1991 in Bærum, as &quot;Pivco&quot; (for Personal Independent Vehicle Company). The first practical prototype, the &quot;PIV2&quot;, like the vehicles that followed, were built around a chassis made of aluminum and carrying a body made of polyethylene thermoplastic rotomolded in one piece. The chassis were developed by Hydro Aluminium Tonder in Tønder in Denmark and were one of the main reasons that Ford later acquired 51% of the stock. 10 of 15 prototypes were built in time for the Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games in 1994. The battery technology was NiCd, driving a three-phase AC induction motor via the front wheels.

The PIV2 was followed by the PIV3, the &quot;City Bee&quot; (&quot;Citi&quot; in the US), introduced in 1995. 120 of these were produced, 40 of which participated in the &quot;San Francisco Bay Area Station Car Demonstration&quot; project from 1995 to 1998.

Based on the experiences from the prototypes, Pivco then went on to develop their first true production model, PIV4, later called the &quot;TH!NK&quot;, with Lotus Cars in a consulting role. The basic construction concept from the prototypes was retained, except that the roof was made of ABS plastic, and the lower frame chassis elements were made of steel. The production model had a range of (modified ECE101 cycle) between charges, and a top speed of .

Development took more time and resources than anticipated, so when development of the production model was finished in 1999, finances had dried up. The company was then acquired by Ford, who could start production of the &quot;TH!NK City&quot;. Ford even embraced the &quot;TH!NK&quot; concept, and marketed electrically driven bicycles as well as golf carts under the same brand.

The TH!NK city Electric Vehicle (EV) Demonstration Program Project was initiated late 2001, and completed in April 2005. US. Partners include Federal, State and Municipal agencies as well as commercial partners. Phase I, consisted of placement of the vehicles in demonstration programs, and it was completed in 2002. Phase II, the monitoring of these programs was completed in 2004. Phase III, the decommissioning and/or exporting of vehicles concluded in 2005. Phase I - the Program successfully assigned 192 EV&#x27;s with customers (including Hertz) in the state of California, 109 in New York (including loaner and demo vehicles), 16 in Georgia, 7 to customers outside of the US and 52 in Ford&#x27;s internal operations in Dearborn, Michigan for a total of 376 vehicles. Phase II – the monitoring of the operational fleet was ongoing and completed in 2004, and all vehicles were returned throughout 2004 and 2005. The Department of Energy (DOE) was involved with the monitoring of the New York Power Authority / TH!NK Clean Commute Program units through partnership with Electric Transportation Engineering Corporation (ETEC), which filed separate reports to DOE. The remainder of the field fleet was monitored through Ford&#x27;s internal operations. Vehicles were retired from lease operation throughout the program for various operator reasons. Some of the vehicles were involved in re-leasing operations. At the end of the program, 376 vehicles had been involved, 372 of which were available for customer use while 4 were engineering prototype and study vehicles. At the end of leases, City vehicles have been decommissioned and/or exported to KamKorp in Norway. By April 2005, the last of the City vehicles had been returned and processed or exported to Norway.

Production ceased in 2002, after 1,005 units had been made. Many of these cars participated in &quot;station car&quot; projects in California and in New York City.

Probably due to changes in the California zero-emissions vehicle policy, Ford gave up THINK on January 31, 2003. The company was sold to KamKorp, owned by Indian businessman Kamal Siddiqi. Development of a successor to the &quot;City&quot; was subsequently halted. The used cars from US and UK have been re-exported to Norway where they are in high demand due to the government&#x27;s policy to promote the use of electrical cars (EVs are exempt from taxes, have free parking, pass toll roads for free, and are allowed to drive in the bus lanes avoiding traffic congestion).

A controversy erupted when Ford decided to crush off-lease TH!NK City cars stockpiled in the U.S. After protesting by environmentalist groups, including a Greenpeace rally on the roof of Ford&#x27;s Norway offices, Ford decided to ship the excess vehicles to Norway.

In 2004, the company turned its attention to development of the &quot;TH!NK public&quot;, a micro size electric bus to be rented to customers for inner city travel. By February 2006, prototypes of the vehicle had been developed, but the company went into receivership.

At the end of March 2006, Think Nordic was acquired by Norwegian investment group InSpire, which includes the original founder Jan Otto Ringdal and Jan-Olaf Willums - a Norwegian engineer educated at the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Polytechnic) - as partners. The company was renamed THINK Global.

For the next year, the THINK website showed a restyled &quot;new THINK City&quot; car which was under development. An open version of the car was also pictured but the company said it had no plans to put it into production.

In May 2007, Tesla Motors, maker of the electric Tesla Roadster, announced an agreement to sell 43 million dollars worth of its Li-ion battery systems to THINK Nordic for use in the next generation THINK City, but on 2 November 2007 it of the deal.

The THINK assembly line was restarted in late November 2007 to start manufacturing the re-designed City car.

On March 5, 2008, General Electric, battery manufacturer A123 Systems and THINK Global announced that they had entered a partnership to enable global electrification of transportation. GE invested in THINK and $20 million in A123 Systems to help A123 roll out batteries for THINK. A123 Systems and THINK at the same time signed a commercial supply agreement. The partnership was announced at the 78th annual international Geneva Motor Show.

Also at the 2008 Geneva motor show, THINK unveiled its future five-seater, concept car, the TH!NK Ox.

In July 2008, THINK introduced the THINK City for the first time in the UK.

As of August 2008, some 100 City cars had been manufactured for customers in Norway. It was reported that &quot;the lean plant is ready for efficient production supported by the experts of Porsche Consulting&quot;.

On December 15, 2008, THINK suspended all vehicle production and laid off 50% of its staff pending negotiation of up to $29 million in funding for working capital, citing &quot;urgent financial distress.&quot;
As of January 13, 2009, THINK Global received a bridge loan of 40 million Norwegian kroner (~$5.69 million) to continue operation. Much of that bridge loan came from one of its battery suppliers, EnerDel.

On August 27, 2009, THINK announced a successful recapitalization ($47 million) through existing and new investors, which allowed the company to exit court protection and resume normal business operations in terms of manufacturing and sales of the THINK City EV in Europe. Announced investors included battery manufacturer Ener1 in U.S. (31%); US venture capital firms RockPort Capital Partners (Boston); Element Partners (Philadelphia) and Kleiner Perkins (Palo Alto, CA) as well as Valmet Automotive based in Finland and Investinor (the venture capital sovereign fund of Norway). On the same day, the company also announced that the THINK City electric car would be produced in Valmet later that year. The deal also included engineering. Valmet invested around ($4.27 million) to the project, and became a minor shareholder of the company.

Production of the THINK City car at Valmet Automotive started on December 10, 2009, in Uusikaupunki, Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;valmet-automotive.com/automotive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2010, THINK announced plans to manufacture the THINK City in Elkhart, Indiana beginning in 2011.

On April 6, 2010, THINK announced plans to begin selling the THINK City in the U.S. in 2010.

December 2010, the first 15 THINK electric cars made in the Elkhart, Indiana, assembly plant were delivered to its customer – the state of Indiana – for government fleet use. This marks the first time that an American-made electric vehicle with Lithium-ion batteries has been purchased for U.S. fleet operation. The vehicles delivered were the THINK City model, which is a pure electric vehicle that produces zero emissions and is capable of traveling as far as on a single charge.

“Our delivery today is part of a larger effort to help transform the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet from one that is mostly dependent on imported oil, to one that is fueled entirely by domestically produced electric energy,” said Barry Engle, THINK CEO. Engle continued, “As part of that goal, we&#x27;ve made a strategic decision to target initially the many millions of fleet vehicles in operation in the U.S. market…These fleets can jumpstart vehicle electrification in America&#x27;s cities and help push the industry past early adopters into mainstream consumer markets.”

Production of the Th!nk City was stopped in March 2011 and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years.

Think Global&#x27;s assets were bought by Electric Mobility Solutions AS in July 2011, including shares of wholly owned subsidiaries THINK North America and THINK UK. The new owners announced that production is scheduled to restart in early 2012 with a refined Think City. However, despite such announcements production ceased in August 2012.

== Models ==

===Ford TH!NK City===

The two door Think City could seat a driver and a passenger and had a top speed of . The car had an acceleration speed of zero to in seven seconds and weighed 2,075 pounds. The model was long, wide, and high.

===TH!NK Neighbor===
The Neighbor (part of Ford Th!nk) was designed to meet the NHTSA specification for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles. Design and manufacture was unrelated to the Th!nk City. The Neighbor was initially offered in two models, a two-seater and a four-seater, with a two-passenger utility truck version offered near the end of production. The TH!NK Neighbor had a fixed roof over an open enclosure; a rain cover was optionally available to protect the passengers from the elements.

The normal top speed was governed to per NHTSA requirements, and it also had a &quot;turf&quot; mode that set its maximum speed at for golf course use. Many options were designed for use on the golf course: it featured a bag rack, a holder for scorecards, tees, and balls, and a club washer. Additionally, there was a trunk option for the four-passenger version that could double as a cooler. Overall, 7,162 total units were produced for the 2002 model year. 2,268 P20 (2 seater), 863 P21 (utility) and 4,031 P22 (4 passenger) units were built.

=== TH!NK city ===

The Th!nk City was a small two-seater or 2+2-seater highway capable electric car, with a top speed of and an in-town range of on a full charge.
The Think City is available with either a Zebra Sodium (molten salt battery) battery or a lithium-ion battery, which both travel 100 miles, or 160 kilometres on a full charge, and based on the International Electrotechnical Commission&#x27;s standards for electric cars.

After a failed start up in Norway in 2008, mass production was restarted in Finland in December 2009.

As of September 2010 the Th!nk City was sold in Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland and Finland.

It was one of the first three electric cars in the world to be crash-tested and highway-certified, together with the Tesla Roadster (2008) and the Mitsubishi i MiEV.

=== TH!NK Ox ===
The TH!NK Ox, presented at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, was a concept five-seater electric car with a top speed of and a 100 kW motor.

The website for the Think Ox, now shut down, listed the top speed as 135 km/h (~84 mi/h) and the range as 250 km (~155 mi).

<text>The Dwarves are an American punk rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois and based in San Francisco, California as of 2009.

Formed as a garage punk band under the name Suburban Nightmare, their career subsequently saw them move in a hardcore direction before settling into an eclectic punk rock sound emphasizing intentionally shocking lyrics. They have been described as &quot;one of the last true bastions of punk rock ideology in the contemporary musical age&quot;.

==History==

The original members of the Dwarves began making music together in the mid-1980s as teenagers in the Chicago garage rock outfit, Suburban Nightmare, which was compared to The Sonics, and which has been described as part of the Paisley Underground scene. This era of the Dwarves is captured on &quot;Lick It (the psychedelic years 83-86)&quot; a 34 track collection put out by Recess records in 1999.

The band became notorious for self-mutilation, on-stage sex, and taking hard drugs. Their live shows would often only last around fifteen minutes, occasionally cut short due to injury caused by spectators. The band&#x27;s sound began to evolve beyond its early garage roots with their second (nine-minute long) LP, &quot;Toolin&#x27; for a Warm Teabag&quot;, which saw the band drifting towards a more truculent punk rock sound, influenced by GG Allin. Recess records issued &quot;Free Cocaine 86–88&quot; in 1999, a 39-song collection that shows the band&#x27;s transition to the nihilistic style that took them to the Sub Pop era. The band released &quot;Blood Guts &amp; Pussy&quot; on Sub Pop in 1990. By this time the Dwarves had dropped their early psychedelic sensibilities and morphed into a hardcore punk band. The &quot;Blood Guts &amp; Pussy&quot; LP was followed up by EP &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Crank&quot; released by No.6 Records, as well as another Sub Pop LP, the metal-punk &quot;Thank Heaven For Little Girls&quot;, both in 1991.

In 1993 the band issued a press release stating their guitarist HeWhoCannotBeNamed had been stabbed to death in Philadelphia. Though this later turned out to be a hoax, the band even went as far as to attach a tribute to the &quot;late&quot; guitarist on their 1993 Sub Pop-released album &quot;Sugarfix&quot;. Sub Pop did not respond well to the hoax and summarily dropped the band from its label. The Dwarves reformed in 1997, releasing &quot;The Dwarves Are Young and Good Looking&quot; (described by Adam Bregman of AllMusic as &quot;the beginning of a new Dwarves...one that plays real songs, had a set list, and left the club unbloodied&quot;), and its 2000 follow-up &quot;The Dwarves Come Clean&quot;. 

In 2004 the band released &quot;The Dwarves Must Die&quot;, its first LP for the indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, which featured guest appearances from Dexter Holland (The Offspring), Nick Oliveri (Queens of the Stone Age), Nash Kato (Urge Overkill), and voice actor Gary Owens. Dahlia was assaulted by Josh Homme of QOTSA before a Dwarves show in Los Angeles in 2004, which saw Homme placed on summary probation for thirty-six months.

==In other media==
In 2000 film &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, Jim Carrey is seen singing along to Dwarves &quot;Motherfucker&quot;, which Dahlia later said he got &quot;tens of thousands of dollars&quot; for. 

In 2000, the band offered the track &quot;River City Rapist&quot; to George W. Bush as his presidential campaign song. The Bush campaign did not use the song.

The Dwarves&#x27; cover of the Norwegian rock band Turbonegro&#x27;s song &quot;Hobbit Motherfuckers&quot; from the Turbonegro tribute album &quot;Alpha Motherfuckers&quot; can be heard playing in the comic book store scene in the 2000s indie film &quot;Ghost World&quot; albeit without Blag Dhalia&#x27;s profanity laden vocals. This song does not appear on the soundtrack album for the film.

In 2009, Blag and HeWhoCannotBeNamed were immortalised as Bobbleheads by Aggronautix.

==Band members==
Singer Blag Dahlia (a.k.a. Julius Seizure, born Paul Cafaro), and guitarist HeWhoCannotBeNamed (a.k.a. Pete Vietnamcheque) have always been the two core members of the group. The lineup has shifted around them, and currently consists of members &quot;Rex Everything&quot; on bass and vocals, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Darkness&quot; on guitar and &quot;Snupac&quot; on drums. Former members include &quot;Dutch Ovens&quot;, &quot;Gregory Pecker&quot;, &quot;Chip Fracture&quot;, &quot;Wholley Smokes&quot;, &quot;Clint Torres&quot;, &quot;Tazzie Bushweed&quot;, &quot;Thrusty Otis&quot;, &quot;Crash Landon&quot;, &quot;Wreck Tom&quot;, &quot;Hunter Down&quot; and &quot;Vadge Moore&quot;, among others. Drummer Josh Freese appears on many Dwarves recordings.

==Musical style==
The Dwarves are known for their simple, loud, yet nuanced punk repertoire, and controversial lyrics. Since the garage punk sound of their early days, they developed a more direct hardcore punk sound, often identified as &quot;scum punk&quot; due to the intentional perversity of the lyrics. Around the turn of millennium, the Dwarves developed more of a manic pop punk influence. Bits of hardcore, surf rock, pop, hip-hop, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll all factor into the band&#x27;s current punk rock sound.

Their shows have been notable for some aggressive fights on stage (with the audience and even a cop), and because HeWhoCannotBeNamed performs either in nothing but a jockstrap or totally nude, apart from his trademark &quot;Rey Mysterio&quot; wrestling mask.

==Cover art==
Many of the band&#x27;s album covers are controversial, often featuring dwarf actor Bobby Faust with an assortment of naked women, sometimes with sacrilegious themes such as re-enacting the Crucifixion. Faust posed sodomizing a rabbit covered in blood for their 1990 album &quot;Blood Guts &amp; Pussy&quot; - followed up a decade later, with a similar theme, this time covered in soap suds, for &quot;Come Clean&quot;.

<text>The municipality of Coatepec () is located in the central region of the Mexican state of Veracruz. Its north latitude is 19° 27′, west longitude is 96° 58′, altitude of , and surface of . It represents the 0.338% of the current state. The municipal seat and largest community of the municipality is also called Coatepec. The Mexican census of 2020 reported a population of 55,720 in the city, while the municipality had 93,911 inhabitants. The municipality also includes many smaller communities within its boundaries. The largest of these are Tuzamapan, (8,300 hab.), Pacho Viejo (4,829 hab.), and Mahuixtlán (3,946 hab.).

Often called &quot;The Coffee Capital of Mexico&quot;, the name Coatepec comes from the Nahuatl &quot;coatl&quot; (serpent), and &quot;tepetl&quot; (hill), or &quot;The Hill of the Snakes&quot;.

Coatepec was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2006.

==Geography==
Coatepec borders the municipalities of Xalapa and Tlalnelhuayocan (north); Teocelo and Jalcomulco (south); Emiliano Zapata (east); and Xico and Teocelo (west).

This municipality has four small rivers: the Pixquiac, the Pintores, the Sordo and the Hueyapan; all flow into the Pescados (La Antigua) River.

===Climate===
Coatepec&#x27;s yearly median temperature is 19.5 °C (67 °F). Seasonal variations in temperature are moderate as elsewhere in central Mexico, whilst precipitation has more pronounced changes. The warmest month is May, when temperatures top 30 °C (86 °F) on average, although at night because of the high elevation the mercury drops to 15 °C (59 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures varying from 9 °C (48 °F) to 22 °C (72 °F). Precipitation is at its lowest during the spring months (however still some rainfall falls from late cold fronts or early thunderstorm activity). Rainfall peaks at two times during the year, in June, at the beginning of the rainy season, and in September, towards the end of it. During these months precipitation exceeds on average 300 mm (11.8 in) and have been as high as over 25 in (640.7 mm in September 1974). The city&#x27;s mild to warm temperatures have their extremes in 33 °C (92 °F) in May 1984 and -1 °C (28 °F) during February, 1976. There are 161 days with rain each year, while fog is common during the winter months.

<doc id="173049" wikidata="Q2623837" url="?curid=173049" title="Kewet">
<text>Kewet was the brand name of a battery electric vehicle. Since 2007, it has been manufactured under the name Buddy by Elbil Norge in Oslo, Norway. From inception in 1991 through October 2013, total combined sales of the Kewet and Buddy totaled approximately 1,500 units, mainly in Norway. It is similar to the Citicar of the 1970s.

==History==
In 1971, Knud Erik Westergaard started KEW Industries in Hadsund, Denmark. The company produced industrial washing equipment and high pressure cleaners. In 1988, this company was sold, and Westergaard founded Kewet (Knud Erik Westergaard Elektrisk Transport) to produce electric cars. In 1991, the first cars emerged from the production facilities. In 1995, production was moved to Nordhausen in the former East Germany. But this move was unsuccessful. Kewet went bankrupt in 1998. In August 1998, Kewet International was formed. Shortly thereafter, rights to the Kewet vehicle were transferred to the Norwegian company, Kollega Bil A/S, which changed its name to Elbil Norge AS. Currently, Kewet Service provides spare parts and repairs Kewet vehicles in Denmark, while Consys develops various systems for electric vehicles.

==Models==

Six generations of the Kewet were produced:

*Models 1 and 2 used 48 volt systems, 5 kW motors equipped with a four-speed manual transmission.
*Model 3 was equipped with a 48 volt system, a 7.5 kW motor and a single-speed transmission.
*Model 4 used 60 volt systems and a 10 kW motor. 
*Model 5 used 72 volt systems with a 12 kW motor. It was also available as a van.
*Model 6 (Buddy) uses 72 volt systems with a 13 kW motor.

The car seats three, has a range of typically 50 to 80 km (~31 to 50 mi) between charges (150 km/~93 mi with Li-Ion), with a top speed of 80 km/h (~49.7 MPH), and features a 1.6 kW electric heater or an optional paraffin heater. The chassis is made of galvanized steel and the shell is made of GRP.

<doc id="173057" wikidata="Q375268" url="?curid=173057" title="Frank Stella">
<text>Frank Philip Stella (May 12, 1936 – May 4, 2024) was an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, noted for his work in the areas of minimalism and post-painterly abstraction. He lived and worked in New York City for much of his career before moving his studio to Rock Tavern, New York. Stella&#x27;s work catalyzed the minimalist movement in the late 1950s. He moved to New York City in the late 1950s, where he created works which emphasized the picture-as-object. These were influenced by the abstract expressionist work of artists like Franz Kline and Jackson Pollock. He developed a reductionist approach to his art, saying he wanted to demonstrate that for him, every painting is &quot;a flat surface with paint on it—nothing more&quot;, and disavowed conceptions of art as a means of expressing emotion. He won notice in the New York art world in 1959 when his four black pinstripe paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art. Stella was a recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 2009 and the Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture by the International Sculpture Center in 2011.

==Biography==
Frank Stella was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on May 12, 1936, to first-generation Italian-American parents, as the oldest of their three children. His grandparents on both sides had immigrated to the United States at the turn of the 20th century from Sicily. His father, Frank Sr., was a gynecologist, and his mother Constance (née Santonelli) was a housewife and artist who attended fashion school and later took up landscape painting. His father painted houses to pay his way through medical school, with young Stella as his helper. Many years later he told an interviewer, &quot;My father would make me sand the floor; we had to do the sanding and scraping before you could hold the brush and then paint on the wall. So it was that kind of apprenticeship and familiarity.&quot;

Stella went to high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where Carl Andre, later to become a minimalist sculptor, was in the class ahead of him, but Andre said they never actually met. In his sophomore year, the abstractionist Patrick Morgan, a teacher at the school, began teaching Stella how to paint. At this time Stella was particularly affected by the work of the artist Josef Albers, a Bauhaus color theorist, and Hans Hofmann, an influential proto-Abstract Expressionist. After entering Princeton University where he majored in history, played lacrosse and wrestled, Stella took art courses and was introduced to the New York art scene by painter Stephen Greene and art historian William C. Seitz, professors at the school who brought him to exhibitions in the city. His work was influenced by abstract expressionism.

In the 1970s, he moved into NoHo in Manhattan in New York City. As of 2015, Stella lived in Greenwich Village and kept an office there but commuted on weekdays to his upstate studio at Rock Tavern, New York, in the Hudson River Valley. The critic and essayist Megan O&#x27;Grady visited the studio in 2019, and writing for the New York Times Style Magazine, described it as a &quot;hangar-like structure&quot;, its entrance marked by a piece of wood spray-painted with the name &quot;Stella&quot;. She called the interior a &quot;vast space more easily traversed by golf cart than on foot&quot;, divided into separate rooms for fabrication and display, with a curtain hanging in the rear behind which he kept his spray-painter, his industrial sander, and new works being assembled. 

==Work==

===Late 1950s and early 1960s===

After moving to New York City in the late 1950s, Stella began to create works which emphasized the picture-as-object. His visits to the art galleries of New York, where he was exposed to the abstract expressionist work of artists like Franz Kline and Jackson Pollock, had exerted a great influence on his development as an artist.

He created a series of paintings in 1958–1959 known as his &quot;Black Paintings&quot; which flouted conventional ideas of painterly composition. At age 22 in late 1958, he used commercial enamel paint and a house-painter&#x27;s brush to paint black stripes of the same width and evenly spaced on bare canvas, leaving the thin strips of canvas between them unpainted and exposed, along with his pencil-and-ruler drawn guidelines. These paintings, his response to the Abstract Expressionist movement that grew in the years following World War II, were devoid of color and meant to lack any visual stimulation.

&quot;Die Fahne Hoch!&quot; (1959), one of the &quot;Black Paintings&quot; series, takes its name (&quot;Hoist the Flag!&quot; or &quot;Raise the Flag!&quot; in English) from the first line of the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, the anthem of the Nazi Party. According to Stella himself, the painting has similar proportions as flags used by that organization.

Stella&#x27;s work was a catalyst for the minimalist movement in the late 1950s; he stressed the properties of the materials he used in his paintings, disavowing any conception of art as a means of expressing emotion. He made a splash in the New York art world in 1959 when his four black pinstripe paintings were shown in the &quot;Sixteen Americans&quot; exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, along with works by Louise Nevelson, Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. Taking a reductionist approach to his art, Stella said he sought to demonstrate that he considered every painting as &quot;a flat surface with paint on it—nothing more&quot;. The same year, several of his paintings were included in the &quot;Three Young Americans&quot; showing at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College. A year later, his first gallery show at art dealer Leo Castelli&#x27;s New York gallery gained him few sales. Stella shared studio space with Hollis Frampton and Carl Andre, both of whom had attended Phillips Academy, and scrounged a living by renting cold-water flats and painting houses.

Stella repudiated all efforts by critics to interpret his work. In a 1964 radio broadcast of a discussion of contemporary art with fellow artists Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, he summarized his concerns as a painter with the words, &quot;My painting is based on the fact that only what can be seen there &quot;is&quot; there. It really is an object... All I want anyone to get out of my paintings, and all I ever get out of them, is the fact that you can see the whole idea without any confusion... What you see is what you see.&quot; The much-quoted tautology, &quot;What you see is what you see&quot;, became &quot;the unofficial motto of the minimalist movement&quot;, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

From 1960, his works used shaped canvases, developing in 1966 into more elaborate designs, as in the &quot;Irregular Polygon&quot; series (67). In 1961, Stella followed Barbara Rose, later a well-known art critic, to Pamplona, Spain, where she had gone on a Fulbright fellowship; they married in London that November. Upon their return to New York, Rose and Stella moved into an apartment near Union Square and had two children. After they split up in 1969, Rose began to reconsider her relationship with minimalism, and became a champion of less well-recognized painters.

===Late 1960s and early 1970s===

In 1967, Stella designed the set and costumes for Scramble, a dance piece by Merce Cunningham. The same year, his began his &quot;Protractor Series&quot; (1967–71) of paintings, named after the common measuring instrument, a half circle protractor. These feature arcs, sometimes overlapping, within square borders named after circular-plan cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. He was especially intrigued by the arches and decorative patterns he observed in the architecture and art of Iran. His painting, &quot;Protractor Variation I&quot; (1969), now at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, epitomizes his move away from ascetic, monochrome compositions to the vibrant colors and formal complexity of his output after the late 1960s. This work typified his experimentation with shaped canvases, producing innovative paintings in which the imagery was set by their contours.

In 1969, Stella was commissioned to create a logo for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial. The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a retrospective of Stella&#x27;s work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one. Stella was among those artists invited to participate in the problem-plagued 35th Art Biennale in Venice (1970) who joined a boycott by artists opposed to the US wars in Vietnam and Cambodia and withdrew their works from display at the American Pavilion.

In the following decade, as he began to adopt more unusual color schemes and shapes, Stella brought to his artistic productions the element of relief, which he called &quot;maximalist&quot; painting because it had sculptural attributes. He presented wood and other materials in his &quot;Polish Village&quot; series (1970–1973), executed in high relief. They were inspired by photographs and drawings he saw of wooden synagogues that the Nazis had burned down in eastern Poland during World War II.

Stella abandoned rational structures in the mid-1970s and began to explore new, individualistic paths. He replaced solid planes with sqiggles, lattices, and swirls of color. Composite features began to project from his canvases in all directions, while his wall-mounted paintings evolved into outlandish sculptures. Through the 1970s and 1980s, as his works became more uninhibited and intricate, his minimalism became baroque.

In 1976, Stella was commissioned by BMW to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL for the second installment in the BMW Art Car Series. He said of this project, &quot;The starting point for the art cars was racing livery. The graph paper is what it is, a graph, but when it&#x27;s morphed over the car&#x27;s forms it becomes interesting. Theoretically it&#x27;s like painting on a shaped canvas.&quot;

He married pediatrician Harriet McGurk in 1978.

===1980s and afterward===

From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Stella produced a large oeuvre that grappled with Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in a broad way. In this period of his career, as the relief of his paintings became increasingly higher with more undercutting, the process eventually resulted in fully three-dimensional sculptural forms that he derived from decorative architectural elements, and incorporating French curves, pillars, waves, and cones. To generate these works, he made collages or scale models that were subsequently enlarged to the original&#x27;s specifications by his assistants, along with the use of digital technology and industrial metal cutters.

In 1993, he designed and executed for Toronto&#x27;s Princess of Wales Theatre a 10,000-square-foot mural installation which covers the ceiling of the dome, the proscenium arch and the exterior rear wall of the building. The mural for the dome was based on computer-generated imagery. In 1997, he oversaw the installation of the 5,000-square-foot &quot;Euphonia&quot; at the Moores Opera House at the Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music at the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas. A monumental sculpture of his, titled &quot;Prinz Friedrich von Homburg, Ein Schauspiel, 3X&quot;, was installed outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

From 1978 to 2005, Stella owned the Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart building in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village and used it as his studio which resulted in the facade being restored. After a six-year campaign by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the historic building was designated a New York City Landmark in 2012. After 2005, Stella split his time between his West Village apartment and his Newburgh, New York, studio.

The &quot;Scarlatti K&quot; series, begun in 2006, consists of eight works by Stella from his Scarlatti Kirkpatrick polychrome sculpture series, for which he used a 3-D printer to create the metal and resin segments. The series title refers to the music of the Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, known for his short but exuberant Baroque period harpsichord sonatas (he wrote more than 500 of them), and to Ralph Kirkpatrick, the American musicologist and harpsichordist, who brought Scarlatti&#x27;s work to the attention of the listening public, and in 1953 produced the authoritative scholarly catalogue of the sonatas. Stella was inspired by the sonatas, and his series works, like the sonatas, are given &quot;K&quot; numbers, but they allude to Scarlatti&#x27;s music abstractly with visual rhythm and movement, according to Stella, rather than literal correlation. Stella continued producing new works in the series into 2012. These were shown at the Freedman Art Gallery that year, and commenting about his work in the series, Stella said, &quot;If you follow the edges of the lines, there&#x27;s a sense of movement, and when they move well and the color follows, they become colorful, and that&#x27;s what happens in the Scarlatti—it builds up and it moves...&quot;. Ron Labaco, a curator at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, showed Stella&#x27;s work in an exhibition featuring computer-enabled pieces, &quot;Out of Hand: Materialising the Postdigital&quot; (2013-14).

By the turn of the 2010s, Stella started using the computer as a painterly tool to produce stand-alone star-shaped sculptures. The resulting stars are often monochrome, black or beige or naturally metallic, and their points can take the form of solid planes, spindly lines or wire-mesh circuits. His &quot;Jasper&#x27;s Split Star&quot; (2017), a sculpture constructed out of six small geometric grids that rest on an aluminum base, was installed at 7 World Trade Center in 2021. It was created to replace the large (each ten feet wide by ten feet tall) diptych of his paintings, &quot;Laestrygonia I&quot; and &quot;Telepilus Laestrygonia II&quot;, that had been displayed in the lobby of the original World Trade Center, destroyed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.

In late 2022, Stella launched his first NFT (non-fungible token) for his &quot;Geometries&quot; project in collaboration with the Artists Rights Society (ARS). It includes the right to the CAD files to 3D print the art works in the NFTs. Katarina Feder, director of business development at ARS, said, &quot;We sold out all 2,100 tokens, and, importantly, brought in resale royalties for secondary sales, something that Frank has been championing for decades.&quot;

==Artists&#x27; rights==
On June 1, 2008, Stella, a member artist of the Artists Rights Society) published with ARS president Theodore Feder an op-ed for &quot;The Art Newspaper&quot; decrying a proposed U.S. Orphan Works law which &quot;remove[s] the penalty for copyright infringement if the creator of a work, after a diligent search, cannot be located&quot;.

In the op-ed, Stella wrote,

==Exhibitions==
Stella&#x27;s work was included in several exhibitions in the 1960s, among them the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s &quot;The Shaped Canvas&quot; (1965) and &quot;Systemic Painting&quot; (1966). The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a second retrospective of Stella&#x27;s work in 1970.

The exhibition &quot;Frank Stella and Synagogues of Historic Poland&quot;, was on view at the POLIN Museum in Warsaw through June 20, 2016. The series of paintings on display, &quot;Polish Village&quot; (1970–74), had previously been exhibited at other venues, including the Fort Worth Museum of Dallas in 1978, the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1987, and the Jewish Museum in New York in 1983. The paintings were inspired by photographs and drawings he saw of wooden synagogues that the Nazis had burned down in eastern Poland during World War II. They came from Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka&#x27;s book &quot;Wooden Synagogues&quot; (Arkady, 1959), and were themselves part of the exhibition.

In 2012, a retrospective of Stella&#x27;s career was shown at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg.

==Collections==
In 2014, Stella gave his sculpture &quot;Adjoeman&quot; (2004) as a long-term loan to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His works are in the collections of many major art institutions, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Pérez Art Museum Miami; the List Visual Arts Center at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge; the Tate; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice; and the Kunstmuseum Basel.

==Recognition==
Stella gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1984, calling for a rejuvenation of abstraction by achieving the depth of baroque painting. These six talks were published by Harvard University Press in 1986 under the title &quot;Working Space&quot;.

In 2009, Frank Stella was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. In 2011, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture by the International Sculpture Center. In 1996, he received an honorary Doctorate from the University of Jena in Jena, Germany, where his large sculptures of the &quot;Hudson River Valley&quot; series are on permanent display, becoming the second artist to receive this honorary degree after Auguste Rodin in 1906.

He was heralded by the Birmingham Museum of Art for having created abstract paintings that bear &quot;no pictorial illusions or psychological or metaphysical references in twentieth-century painting&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Writer and curator Klaus Ottmann says many art critics were outraged when Stella&#x27;s Black Paintings (1958–60) were shown at the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s &quot;16 Americans&quot; (1959-1960) exhibition. Irving Sandler attributed the death of American gesture painting to the mortal blow dealt by these reductive and non-allusive paintings. According to Ottman, &quot;Today, they are universally considered seminal works of 20th-century American art.&quot;

According to critic Megan O&#x27;Grady, art critics were shocked by the &quot;Black Paintings&quot;, with their purposely flat affect, their extreme reductiveness, and their &quot;refusal to appease&quot;. In her view, the young artist had been inspired by the artists he admired in New York, among them Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning, and felt that he was allowed freedom to do whatever he wanted with painting. She writes that critics have always been disconcerted by the fact that &quot;the godfather of Minimalist painting&quot; became a forbear of modern baroque.

The art historian and critic Douglas Crimp writes that the notion of art as existing detached from everything else and autonomous proceeds from the logic of modernism, and is a notion maintained by contemporary painting into the 1980s. Painting is understood as having an origin and an essential nature, and its historical development as being a long, unbroken panorama. According to Crimp, the stylistic change that occurred during the late 1970s in Frank Stella&#x27;s work embodied this art historical view of painting and how it operates to maintain the practice of painting. By his lights, Stella&#x27;s shift to the &quot;flamboyantly idiosyncratic constructed works&quot; of this period was &quot;a kind of quantum leap&quot; compared to his breakout works of the late 1950s.

For Crimp it was Stella&#x27;s earliest paintings which suggested to his fellows that the end of painting had at last arrived. He sees Stella as working in profound torment over the inferences made by those early works, moving ever further away from them, and disavowing them more vehemently with every new series. Crimp goes on to say the late 1970s paintings &quot;are truly hysterical in their defiance of the black paintings; each one reads as a tantrum, shrieking and sputtering that the end of painting has not come&quot;.

Viewing some of Stella&#x27;s large scale works at a 1982 exhibition in the Addison Gallery at the Phillips Academy, critic Kenneth Baker voiced a dissenting opinion. He wrote in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; that &quot;The physical impact of the recent works is unsettling. They make you want to back away; you&#x27;re not sure how firmly they&#x27;re anchored to the wall. But soon you realize that any object of comparable size might have the same impact. That this question arises at all suggests how small a part &#x27;painting&#x27; plays here. Stella’s stvle resides wholly in the design of these objects, and their designs are just not that interesting to contemplate.&quot;

When the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited its Frank Stella retrospective in 2015, art critic Jerry Saltz reminded viewers that Stella had declared &quot;I don&#x27;t make Conceptual Art. I need the physical thing to work with or against.&quot; Saltz advised them to think literally, and in terms of the space the works occupy and the nature of their surfaces, seeing color as an element of their structures. He described Stella as being one of &quot;the first to deal as directly as possible with the perception of material, form, and color&quot;, &quot;the first hard-core Minimalist painter&quot;, and &quot;a forerunner to the Postminimalism that defined the late 1960s and 1970s&quot;. Saltz goes on to say &quot;even though he&#x27;s prone to cranking out a lot of work that looks like God-awful space junk, I always pay attention to this artist&quot;.

== Art market ==
In May 2019, Christie&#x27;s set an auction record for one of Stella&#x27;s works with the sale of his &quot;Point of Pines&quot;, which sold for $28 million.

In April 2021, his &quot;Scramble: Ascending Spectrum/Ascending Green Values&quot; (1977) was sold for £2.4 million ($3.2 million with premium) in London. The painting was bought for $1.9 million in 2006 from the collection of Belgian art patrons Roger and Josette Vanthournout at Sotheby&#x27;s.

== Stella and the sport of squash ==

In the 1980s, Stella took up the game of squash after he injured his back while opening a garage door. His racquet was strung with five bright colors. He later had a squash court built at his horse farm in upstate New York, and formed close friendships with many squash players. In 1986 he told Nicholas Dawidoff, a writer for Sports Illustrated: &quot;The advantage of squash is that I can forget about painting. A white blank and a ball; you don’t know where you are. It&#x27;s like a snowstorm.&quot; Being interviewed in 1987 by Susan Orleans of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he quipped, &quot;In art, you can keep getting better, but in squash you hit your level and that&#x27;s just about it. Curtains. You’re finished. I hit my limit at about forty minutes of mediocre playing.&quot; 

Speaking of Stella after his death, Ned Edwards, the executive director of the U.S. Squash Foundation, said that &quot;Frank was a transformational figure for squash.&quot; The director of the Tournament of Champions, John Nimick, said, &quot;Frank was a patron saint of our sport and various efforts to promote squash in New York City for forty years. He was a player, promoter, sponsor and creator of our perpetual trophy.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
From 1961 to 1969, Stella was married to art historian Barbara Rose; they had two children, Rachel and Michael. At the time of his death, he was married to Harriet E. McGurk, a pediatrician. They had two sons, Patrick and Peter. He also had a daughter, Laura, from a relationship with Shirley De Lemos Wyse between his marriages.

Stella died of lymphoma at his home in West Village, Manhattan, on May 4, 2024, eight days before his 88th birthday.

== History ==
=== 1970s ===
Donnie Van Zant, the younger brother of Lynyrd Skynyrd co-founder and frontman Ronnie Van Zant, began playing music during his teen years, forming a band called the Other Side in 1965, and later Sons of Satan, which changed its name to Standard Production in 1968. This paved the way for Sweet Rooster, Donnie&#x27;s first professional group that he formed in 1969 with guitarists Jeff Carlisi (from Doomsday Refreshment Committee) and Kevin Elson (later the sound man for Skynyrd and 38 Special, who eventually graduated to producing Journey, Night Ranger and many others), drummer Bill Pelkey and Standard Productions bassist Ken Lyons. Carlisi left Sweet Rooster after graduating high school to study architecture at Georgia Tech and was replaced by Don Barnes, from a fellow band called Camelots, in 1970. Sweet Rooster then evolved into Alice Marr, with Van Zant, Barnes, Elson, Pelkey, bassist Larry Steele and keyboardist Billy Powell, who soon moved on to roadie for Lynyrd Skynyrd before joining them as their pianist.

In the meantime, Van Zant, Barnes and Lyons, while continuing to work their day jobs as well as their musical careers, began composing original songs. By 1974, they decided to form &quot;the ultimate band&quot; that would be their &quot;one last shot&quot; at success. Briefly, Van Zant was considering a higher-paying position for the railroad at which he worked, but was finally convinced by brother Ronnie to stick with music since it was &quot;in his blood&quot;.

The new group comprised Van Zant, Barnes, Steele (who dropped out almost immediately, to be replaced by Lyons, later returning as the group&#x27;s stage manager), drummer Brookins (who had played with Van Zant in Sons of Satan), second drummer Jack Grondin (a New Jersey native who was attending Jacksonville University at the time) and a returning Carlisi. The band&#x27;s name was thought up after an incident which found the boys practicing in a warehouse out in the middle of nowhere. When police arrived after being notified by locals of the noise, the band members were unable to come out because of a padlock on the door. One of the cops said, &quot;That&#x27;s all right. We&#x27;ll let this .38 special do the talking&quot;, and shot off the lock.

Now that they had their name, the group spent most of 1975 and 1976 playing a steady grind of one-nighters, mostly in the South and the Midwest. Eventually, big brother Ronnie, who had hooked the boys up with Phil Walden&#x27;s Paragon Booking Agency, who had worked with Skynyrd, figured Donnie and the gang had paid enough dues and set them up with Skynryd&#x27;s manager Peter Rudge, who also handled the Who and was tour manager for the Rolling Stones. Rudge quickly set the group up to open shows for popular acts such as Peter Frampton, Foghat and Kiss, and got them signed to A&amp;M Records, who assigned Dan Hartman (of Edgar Winter Group fame) to produce their first album, &quot;.38 Special&quot;, which was released in May 1977.

During the record&#x27;s recording, bassist Ken Lyons had decided to leave the band due to domestic troubles and was replaced by their friend, roadie and original Lynyrd Skynyrd member Larry Junstrom.

Also in 1977, the band added two female backup singers, Carol Bristow and Dale Krantz. Krantz was replaced by Nancy Henderson (1979–1981), Lu Moss (1981–1984) and then Lynn Hineman (1986–1987), before backup singers were dispensed with in 1987.

In October 1977 Ronnie Van Zant was killed when Skynyrd&#x27;s plane crashed. Donnie wrote &quot;Take Me Back&quot; as a tribute to his brother, which appeared on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Special Delivery&quot; (March 1978), also produced by Hartman.

=== 1980–1999 ===
The band&#x27;s first two albums had a strong Southern rock influence. By the early 1980s, .38 Special had shifted to a more accessible guitar-driven arena rock style without completely abandoning the Southern rock roots. This shift helped to usher in a string of successful albums and singles. Engineer Rodney Mills, who had worked with Atlanta Rhythm Section and others, assumed the producer&#x27;s reins, and Survivor co-founder Jim Peterik became a frequent songwriting collaborator with the band from 1979 on, which helped account for this change in sound and subsequent success.

&quot;Rockin&#x27; into the Night&quot;, the title track from the group&#x27;s third album (released in October 1979), which Peterik and his bandmates had originally written for Survivor, found its way to 38 Special&#x27;s manager, Mark Spector, and was given to the band. Sung by 38&#x27;s guitarist Don Barnes (who would sing lead vocals on all of the band&#x27;s hits through 1987), the tune became their first song to receive national airplay, peaking at No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1980.

This paved the way for their platinum-selling fourth record, &quot;Wild-Eyed Southern Boys&quot; (January 1981), and its bigger hit &quot;Hold On Loosely&quot; (which reached No. 27 in 1981).

Their next release, &quot;Special Forces&quot; (May 1982), contained the Top 10 hit &quot;Caught Up in You&quot; (just like &quot;Hold On Loosely&quot;, composed by Barnes, Carlisi, and Peterik), which hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Tracks chart, as did the single &quot;If I&#x27;d Been the One&quot; (October 1983) from their November 1983 release &quot;Tour de Force&quot;. &quot;You Keep Runnin&#x27; Away&quot; (August 1982) and &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; (February 1984) continued the sequence of hit radio favorites.

In the fall of 1984, they had another hit with &quot;Teacher, Teacher&quot;, from the soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;Teachers&quot;, written by Jim Vallance and Bryan Adams. The song climbed to No. 4 on the Billboard Top Tracks Chart, spending ten weeks on the chart.

In 1984 38 Special toured with the up-and-coming Huey Lewis and the News, who were just breaking huge with their &quot;Sports&quot; album, and in 1986 they shared the bill with the soon-to-be-platinum-selling hard rock band Bon Jovi.

By 1987, Don Barnes, who was having differences with Carlisi and some of the others, had decided to leave the band to go out on his own. He recorded an album called &quot;Ride the Storm&quot;, which, though slated for release in 1989, was shelved after A&amp;M Records was sold, and was not released until 2017 – some 28 years later.

In the meantime, the group moved on, bringing in San Francisco guitarist Danny Chauncey, after drummer Steve Brookins also decided to leave, and singer/keyboardist Max Carl, from West Coast rhythm and blues group Jack Mack &amp; the Heart Attack.

The next release, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Strategy&quot; (June 1988), saw the group playing down their heavy guitar sound and putting forth a more 1980s pop keyboard-oriented approach, led by Carl&#x27;s more R&amp;B-style voice. &quot;Second Chance&quot; (taken from &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Strategy&quot;) was a No. 1 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s adult contemporary chart in early 1989.

Carl was also lead singer on &quot;The Sound of Your Voice&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 33 in 1991) from &quot;Bone Against Steel&quot; (July 1991), which saw the group moving from A&amp;M to the American iteration of the British label Charisma Records. That same year, Arkansas native Bobby Capps (from Johnny Van Zant Band) came aboard as keyboardist/co-singer and drummer Scott Meeder replaced Jack Grondin after Grondin decided to leave the music business to pursue a career as a Christian missionary. The band found themselves without a home after Charisma folded in 1992.

After touring with the band through the spring of 1992, Max Carl decided to depart, making way for the return of Don Barnes. Since that time, the band has mostly concentrated on touring, with an occasional release of new material. Scott Hoffman took over the drum chair from Meeder later in 1992. Donny Baldwin (ex-Jefferson Starship) filled in for Hoffman on some 1996 tour dates after Hoffman was down with a broken arm, but Gary &quot;Madman&quot; Moffatt (formerly of Cactus) has been the band&#x27;s drummer since 1997.

In early 1997, 38&#x27;s long time guitarist/co-founder Jeff Carlisi, tired of the endless touring, decided to leave to form the Bonnie Blue Band, which led to the supergroup Big People, which also featured Benjamin Orr (from the Cars), Liberty DeVitto (from Billy Joel&#x27;s band), Derek St. Holmes (ex-Ted Nugent) and Pat Travers. Unfortunately Big People failed to launch after the death of Benjamin Orr in 2000.

Through the small Razor &amp; Tie label, 38 Special released &quot;Fade to Blue&quot; from the album &quot;Resolution&quot; (The last album to feature Carlisi, released in June 1997). The single hit No. 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1997.

Since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Resolution&quot;, two more releases have followed on the CMC International and Sanctuary Records labels, respectively &quot;A Wild-Eyed Christmas Night&quot; (September 2001) and &quot;Drivetrain&quot; (July 2004).

=== 2000s–present ===
In 2007 .38 Special was the opening act on Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s Rowdy Frynds Tour. Also, on September 27, 2008, they filmed a CMT Crossroads special with country singer Trace Adkins, performing both artists&#x27; hits from over the years.

In 2009 .38 Special opened for REO Speedwagon and Styx as part of the &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Rockin&#x27; Tour&quot;.

Van Zant missed a handful of shows in 2011, and in 2012 a notice was posted on 38 Special&#x27;s website saying Donnie Van Zant would not tour with the band due to health issues related to inner-ear nerve damage, although he would continue to write and record with the band. In 2013, after nearly a year of missing performances, Van Zant officially left 38 Special after 39 years and retired from music.

In 2012 original bassist Ken Lyons died at age 59.

In 2014 longtime bassist Larry Junstrom was replaced by Barry Dunaway (a veteran of many classic rock groups, including Pat Travers Band, Yngwie Malmsteen and Survivor). Dunaway had previously filled in for Junstrom for a handful of shows in 2011, and a few shows in 2013 as well. Junstrom was then forced to retire due to a hand injury that required surgery.

Since 2019, the band&#x27;s lineup has consisted of Don Barnes, keyboardist/vocalist Bobby Capps, drummer Gary Moffatt, Dunaway, and guitarist Jerry Riggs. This leaves Don Barnes as the only original member, although Barnes was absent from the band from 1987 until 1992.

Larry Junstrom died on October 6, 2019, at age 70.

In 2022 bassist Paul Drennan filled in for Barry Dunaway.

<text>The Spacing Guild is an organization in Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction &quot;Dune&quot; universe that possesses a monopoly on interstellar travel and banking. Guild Navigators (alternately Guildsmen or Steersmen) use the drug melange (also called &quot;the spice&quot;) to achieve limited prescience, a form of precognition that allows them to successfully navigate &quot;folded space&quot; and safely guide enormous starships called heighliners across interstellar space instantaneously.

The power of the Guild is balanced against that of the Padishah Emperor as well as of the assembled noble Houses of the Landsraad. Essentially apolitical, the Guild is primarily concerned with the flow of commerce and preservation of the economy that supports them. Although their ability to dictate the terms of and fees for all transport gives them influence in the political arena, they do not pursue political goals beyond their economic ones.

==Navigators==
In the &quot;Dune&quot; series, enormous starships called heighliners employ a scientific phenomenon known as the Holtzman effect to &quot;fold space&quot; and thereby travel great distances across the universe instantaneously. Navigators are able to use a limited form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar space. Navigators are humans who mutated through the consumption of and exposure to massive amounts of the drug melange. Control of these Navigators gives the Spacing Guild its monopoly on interstellar travel and banking, making the organization a balance of power against the Padishah Emperor and the assembled noble Houses of the Landsraad.

===Description===

To enable their prescience, Guild Navigators not only consume large quantities of the spice, but are also continuously immersed in highly concentrated amounts of orange spice gas. This level of extreme and extended exposure causes their bodies to atrophy and mutate over time, their heads and extremities elongating, and causing them to become vaguely aquatic in appearance. The first external sign of melange-induced metabolic change is visible in the eyes, as the drug tints the sclera and iris to a dark shade of blue, called &quot;blue-in-blue&quot; or &quot;the Eyes of Ibad,&quot; &quot;a total blue so dark as to be almost black.&quot; This is a common side effect in all spice addicts.

In the original 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;, Duke Leto Atreides notes that the Guild is &quot;as jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly,&quot; and that not even their own agents ever see Navigators. Leto&#x27;s son Paul wonders if they are mutated to the point of no longer appearing human. At the end of the novel, two self-identified Guild Navigators accompanying Emperor Shaddam IV are described as &quot;fat&quot; but not otherwise non-human. The Guild Navigator Edric, introduced in the first chapter of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), is called a &quot;humanoid fish,&quot; and described in his tank of spice gas as &quot;an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membranous hands—a fish in a strange sea.&quot; The Navigators&#x27; &quot;elongated and repositioned limbs and organs&quot; are noted in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. In 1985&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Lucilla notes that &quot;Navigators were forever bathed in the orange gas of melange, their features often fogged by the vapors,&quot; that they possess a &quot;tiny v of a mouth&quot; and &quot;ugly flap of nose&quot; and that &quot;Mouth and nose appeared small on a Navigator&#x27;s gigantic face with its pulsing temples.&quot; She also notes that their mutated voices require translation devices, describing &quot;the singsong ululations of the Navigator&#x27;s voice with its simultaneous mechtranslation into impersonal Galach.&quot;

In an unused passage by Frank Herbert from &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; published in &quot;The Road to Dune&quot; (2005), Edric is described as surviving without spice gas once a hole is opened in his tank, though his prescient abilities are practically useless in this state.

==Plotlines==
===Original series===
====&quot;Dune&quot;====
In &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), the Spacing Guild enjoys a profitable monopoly on interstellar travel and commerce. Though powerful, the Spacing Guild has never actively tried to openly seize power over all of humanity and rule directly, instead sharing power with the Emperor and the Great Houses, and influencing events from the shadows. Paul Atreides concludes that the Guild does this out of a belief that any political empire is finite, ending sooner or later. The only way to guarantee their continual existence is to be a &quot;parasite&quot;, propping up one imperial dynasty until it collapses, then simply switching to support the next one. At the end of the novel, Paul deposes Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV by seizing control of Arrakis, the only source of the all-important drug melange. Paul has learned the extent of the Guild&#x27;s dependence on spice, and that without it they are &quot;blind&quot; and unable to navigate interstellar travel. The Guild is forced to side with Paul, threatening to strand the Emperor and his troops on Arrakis if he does not relinquish the throne.

In &#x27;Appendix A&#x27; of &quot;Dune&quot;, Herbert wrote that the Guild, along with the Bene Gesserit order, had been responsible for the standardization of religion in the universe by promoting the adoption of the Orange Catholic Bible and offering protection to the dissenting theologians who created this book. Nonetheless, in the same appendix, Herbert held that the Guild members themselves were atheists, and only promoted this move to promote a stable societal order from which they could profit. Houses of the Imperium may contract with the Guild to be removed &quot;to a place of safety outside the System&quot;. Some Houses in danger of ruin or defeat have &quot;become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium&quot;. The Guild controls a &quot;sanctuary planet&quot; (or planets) known as Tupile, intended for such &quot;defeated Houses of the Imperium ... Location(s) known only to the Guild and maintained inviolate under the Guild Peace&quot;.

====&quot;Dune Messiah&quot;====
In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), the Navigator Edric engages in a conspiracy to dethrone Emperor Paul Atreides, joined by the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, and Paul&#x27;s embittered consort, Princess Irulan of House Corrino. With their endless need for melange, the Spacing Guild has a vested interest in breaking Paul&#x27;s stranglehold over the spice supply. Edric&#x27;s involvement also protects the conspirators from discovery, as his prescience hides the activities of himself and those around him from other prescients, like Paul. The plot ultimately fails, and Edric and Mohiam are executed by Fremen naib Stilgar on orders from Paul&#x27;s sister Alia Atreides.

In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; (1985), a &quot;very powerful&quot; Navigator is described as &quot;one of the Edrics&quot;, suggesting a possible breeding plan or use of gholas.

====&quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;====
In &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), God Emperor Leto II has secured complete control over of the scarce melange reserves through hydraulic despotism, making the Guild completely dependent on him. He also notes in the novel that though history has attributed the design of the first Guild ship to Aurelius Venport, it was actually Venport&#x27;s mistress Norma Cenva who designed it.

====&quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; and &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;====
The fifth and sixth novels of the series, &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; (1985), are set 5,000 years after the reign of Paul Atreides, a period that includes 3,500 years of Leto II&#x27;s reign and 1,500 years following his death. The warlike Honored Matres have seized control of , the old Spacing Guild complex above Gammu. The technocrats of Ix develop technology that the Ixians and the Administrative faction of the Spacing Guild refer to as &quot;compilers&quot;. These compilers perform calculations very similar to computers, nearly violating the prohibitions against &quot;thinking machines&quot; that were imposed following the Butlerian Jihad several millennia before. These compilers eliminate the need for the Navigators, and the strategic disadvantage that this aspect of melange dependency has become, because the Navigators&#x27; abilities are slowly being compromised by the severe reductions in the availability of spice resulting from the destruction of Dune and the sandworms on that planet, and the strict control by the Bene Gesserit, who maintain a monopoly over the largest stockpiles of melange. The prescient rule of Leto II that lasted 3,500 years has shown the universe the perils of prescience, namely that the entire universe can be locked into the vision of a single entity, giving that entity absolute power. The Guild, facing obsolescence and suspicion, couples itself with Ix in decline; Navigators continue to exist, but their importance in the universe is severely diminished. As Paul Atreides notes in &quot;Dune&quot;, it was the Spacing Guild&#x27;s obsession with the &quot;safe path&quot; that led them &quot;ever into stagnation&quot;, and brought on their eventual obsolescence.

===Sequels===
After publishing six &quot;Dune&quot; prequel novels, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson released two sequel novels, &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), which complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began with Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. The works were based on a 30-page outline by Frank Herbert for a sequel to &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; he dubbed &quot;Dune 7&quot;.

In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, the Navigator Edrik fears his kind&#x27;s obsolescence when the Spacing Guild itself (pressured by a shortage of melange) begins funding the development of superior Ixian navigation technology that would not require Navigators. Seeking an alternative source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, Edrik meets with Uxtal, the last of the Lost Tleilaxu, hoping that he can rediscover the method of producing melange in axlotl tanks (a secret believed lost when the Bene Tleilax were destroyed by the Honored Matres). However, Uxtal is in the forced service of the Matre Superior Hellica, and her price for his expertise is Edrik&#x27;s help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Uxtal is ultimately unsuccessful, but the ghola he creates of deceased Tleilaxu Master Waff later offers Edrik something better in exchange for sanctuary—the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms to produce melange.

In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), the sequel to &quot;Hunters&quot; and finale of the original &quot;Dune&quot; series, the Spacing Guild has begun replacing its Navigators with the more cost-effective Ixian navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators&#x27; supply of melange. More and more Navigators are dying from withdrawal of the spice—including Ardrae, &quot;one of the oldest remaining Navigators&quot;—and many defect and disappear into space rather than allow the devices on their ships. All are unaware that Face Dancer infiltrators are behind the plan, plotting their own takeover of the universe. Waff works in secret, hidden on Edrik&#x27;s own heighliner, on genetically engineering his &quot;advanced&quot; sandworms. He accomplishes this by altering the DNA of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these &quot;seaworms&quot; quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed &quot;ultraspice.&quot; Edrik and the ultraspice are later intercepted by Face Dancer leader Khrone, who seizes the valuable optimized melange. He incapacitates Edrik by damaging his tank and releasing its spice gas, soon destroying the entire heighliner to rid himself of the Navigator altogether.

===Prequels===
The &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Anderson, set immediately before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, explores the previously-unexplained process of becoming a Navigator through the story of D&#x27;murr Pilru. D&#x27;murr, a human native of the technology-producing planet Ix, goes through the training process and physical transformation to become a full Navigator. In &quot;&quot; (2001), D&#x27;murr is piloting one of two heighliners which Count Fenring uses to secretly test the synthetic melange created by the Tleilaxu in their Project Amal. The flawed spice disrupts and confuses D&#x27;murr&#x27;s thoughts, feelings and prescience. Disastrously, the first heighliner emerges from foldspace at the wrong point, striking the defensive shields of Wallach IX and plummeting into the atmosphere to its destruction. Affected by the tainted melange, D&#x27;murr misguides his ship out of the known universe and collapses. As his spice supply is replaced with genuine melange, D&#x27;murr uses the last of his strength to return the ship safely to Junction, home of the Guild headquarters, before dying.

In the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Anderson, unappreciated scientist Norma Cenva creates the Holtzman engine, which allows a ship to fold space, traveling great distances instantaneously. Her future husband, entrepreneur Aurelius Venport, begins mass-producing the ships which are eventually known as heighliners. The technique proves to be unsafe, however, as one in ten flights ends in the ship&#x27;s destruction due to navigational difficulties. Desperate for a solution, Norma consumes increasing amounts of melange to improve her thinking and concentration. Full immersion in a tank of spice gas deforms her body, but ultimately bestows on her the prescient ability to plot a safe path for a heighliner through foldspace. As the first Navigator, Norma begins a training program to produce enough Navigators to pilot a fleet of heighliners. Over 80 years later, she puts the creation of the Spacing Guild in motion through her descendant, Josef Venport.

After consolidating its hold on the space travel industry during the events of &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot; (2012), this company, now called &quot;Venport Holdings&quot; or even &quot;VenHold&quot;, evolves into the Guild of the later novels. VenHold originally has the monopoly on foldspace travel, granted to Aurelius Venport by Serena Butler. However, decades after the end of the Butlerian Jihad, Emperor Jules revokes the monopoly in order to curry political favor, resulting in several rival foldspace companies springing up, such as Celestial Transport and EsconTran. These new companies, however, are unable to provide 100% safe transportation due to their lack of Navigators, the creation process of whom is a proprietary secret tightly held by VenHold. Director Josef Venport ruthlessly crushes the competition and even executes a rival CEO. Josef Venport&#x27;s desire for restoring his family&#x27;s monopoly and thirst for knowledge put him in conflict with the Butlerians, a radical religious sect that follows the teachings of the late Rayna Butler under the leadership of Manford Torondo. Realizing that the weak Emperor Salvador Corrino is unwilling to crush the Butlerians, Venport lures him out to Arrakis and has him eaten by a sandworm. Unfortunately for him, Salvador&#x27;s sabotaged ship manages to return to Salusa Secundus and report the truth to the newly-crowned Emperor Roderick, Salvador&#x27;s brother. Roderick swears vengeance on Venport. Just then, Torondo gets his hands on a cache of atomics, which he uses to obliterate VenHold&#x27;s main planet. Eventually, imperial forces track down Venport&#x27;s secret laboratory and invade. Norma offers Josef a chance to survive by becoming a Navigator. She then folds space to the bridge of the imperial flagship and strikes a deal with the Emperor, agreeing to dissolve VenHold in exchange for Roderick sparing her and all her Navigators, and also establishing the Spacing Guild.

==Depictions==

===Film and television===
In David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, the Navigator&#x27;s mutation affects his entire body, and he resembles a giant newt or worm with a heavily deformed head, V-shaped mouth and vestigial limbs. The Navigator is not shown to have the blue-in-blue eyes of a spice addict. The 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; portrays the Navigator as a withered figure with a humanoid head, blue-in-blue eyes and arms which have mutated into wings with elongated webbed fingers. The 2003 sequel miniseries Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Children of Dune&quot; presents Edric as a sleek, golden humanoid with an elongated head and limbs, and feathery appendages. Though Navigators are not present in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, Guild representatives are depicted as humanoids in white, cloaked space suits with opaque helmet visors. Villeneuve explained:

Writing for &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, Adam Felman opined that the limited inclusion of the Guild in Villeneuve&#x27;s film helped prevent the story from becoming convoluted.

===Games===
The Spacing Guild is a sub-faction in the real-time strategy video game &quot;&quot; (2001). It has its own private army with which it can back up its demands. The Guild uses its heighliners to transport troops of the three player Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen and Ordos) from their homeworlds to Arrakis. The Guild also uses its Navigators to pilot their NIAB (&quot;Navigator in a Boat&quot;) Tanks, a hover tank that projects a single electrical bolt, and NIAP (&quot;Navigators in a Plane&quot;) Flyers, an aerial version of the NIAB Tank, although without any weapons of its own. The NIAB Tank also has the ability to fold-space for short distances on the battlefield. One mission in the game involves the three House attacking each other on a Guild heighliner. The Guild forces in the game can also deploy a unit called the Maker, an infantry unit somewhat resembling both a Navigator and a small sandworm, armed with an electrical weapon. Later in the game, the Spacing Guild attempts to seize control of the universe by building an &quot;Emperor Worm&quot;.

==Analysis==

John C. Smith analyzes the concept of the Guild in the essay &quot;Navigators and the Spacing Guild&quot; in &quot;The Science of Dune&quot; (2008).

<text>Drama was introduced to Britain from Europe by the Romans, and auditoriums were constructed across the country for this purpose.

==Medieval period==

By the medieval period, the mummers&#x27; plays had developed, a form of early street theatre associated with the Morris dance, concentrating on themes such as Saint George and the Dragon and Robin Hood. These were folk tales re-telling old stories, and the actors travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality.

===English mystery plays===
Mystery plays and miracle plays (sometimes distinguished as two different forms, although the terms are often used interchangeably) are among the earliest formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They developed from the 10th to the 16th century, reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre. The name derives from &quot;mystery&quot; used in its sense of &quot;miracle&quot;, but an occasionally quoted derivation is from &quot;misterium&quot;, meaning &quot;craft&quot;, a play performed by the craft guilds.

There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late medieval period; although these collections are sometimes referred to as &quot;cycles,&quot; it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the &quot;York cycle&quot; of forty-eight pageants. They were performed in the city of York, from the middle of the fourteenth century until 1569. There are also the &quot;Towneley plays&quot; of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true &#x27;cycle&#x27; of plays and most likely performed around the Feast of Corpus Christi probably in the town of Wakefield, England during the late Middle Ages until 1576. The &quot;Ludus Coventriae&quot; (also called the N Town plays&quot; or &quot;Hegge cycle&quot;), now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the &quot;Chester cycle&quot; of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament cycle acted at Coventry and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of Mary Magdalene, &quot;The Brome Abraham and Isaac&quot; and a sixteenth-century play of the &quot;Conversion of Saint Paul&quot; exist, all hailing from East Anglia. Besides the Middle English drama, there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the &quot;Fall of Lucifer&quot;, the &quot;Creation and Fall of Man&quot;, &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, &quot;Noah and the Flood&quot;, &quot;Abraham and Isaac&quot;, the &quot;Nativity&quot;, the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;, the &quot;Passion&quot;, and the &quot;Resurrection&quot;. Other pageants included the story of &quot;Moses&quot;, the &quot;Procession of the Prophets&quot;, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Baptism&quot;, the &quot;Temptation in the Wilderness&quot;, and the &quot;Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin&quot;. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval craft guilds. The York mercers, for example, sponsored the &quot;Doomsday&quot; pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the Ark from the carpenters&#x27; guild; the five loaves and fishes miracle from the bakers; and the visit of the Magi, with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths. The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on pageant wagons. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the &quot;Second Shepherds&#x27; Play&quot; to Horbery Shrogys (The Towneley plays line 454) is strongly suggestive

===Morality plays===
The morality play is a genre of Medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as &quot;interludes&quot;, a broader term given to dramas with or without a moral theme. Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a Godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre.

&quot;The Somonyng of Everyman&quot; (&quot;The Summoning of Everyman&quot;), usually referred to simply as &quot;Everyman&quot;, is a late 15th-century English morality play. Like John Bunyan&#x27;s 1678 Christian novel &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot; examines the question of Christian salvation by use of allegorical characters, and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one&#x27;s life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, [material] Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatized by the interactions between characters.

==Renaissance: Elizabethan and Jacobean periods==
The period known as the English Renaissance, approximately 1500–1660, saw a flowering of the drama and all the arts. The two candidates for the earliest comedy in English Nicholas Udall&#x27;s &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot; (c. 1552) and the anonymous &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Needle&quot; (c. 1566), belong to the 16th century.

During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and then James I (1603–25), in the late 16th and early 17th century, a London-centred culture, that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend of and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561) by Sackville and Norton and Thomas Kyd&#x27;s (1558–94) revenge tragedy &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; (1592), that influenced Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

William Shakespeare stands out in this period as a poet and playwright as yet unsurpassed. Shakespeare was not a man of letters by profession and probably had only some grammar school education. He was neither a lawyer nor an aristocrat like the &quot;university wits&quot; that had monopolised the English stage when he started writing. But he was very gifted and incredibly versatile, and he surpassed &quot;professionals&quot; like Robert Greene, who mocked this &quot;shake-scene&quot; of low origins. He was himself an actor and deeply involved in the running of the theatre company that performed his plays. Most playwrights at this time tended to specialise in either histories, comedies, or tragedies, but Shakespeare is remarkable in that he produced all three types. His 38 plays include tragedies, comedies, and histories. In addition, he wrote his so-called &quot;problem plays&quot;, or &quot;bitter comedies&quot;, that include, amongst others, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;All&#x27;s Well that Ends Well&quot;.

His early classical and Italianate comedies, like &quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot;, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, gave way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. After the lyrical &quot;Richard II&quot;, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, &quot;Henry IV, parts 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, based on Sir Thomas North&#x27;s 1579 translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, which introduced a new kind of drama.

Though most of his plays met with success, it was in his later years that Shakespeare wrote what have been considered his greatest plays: &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, as well as the collaboration &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, probably with John Fletcher.

Other important playwrights of this period include Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Dekker, John Fletcher Francis Beaumont, Ben Jonson, and John Webster.

Other important figures in Elizabethan theatre include Christopher Marlowe (1564–1593), Thomas Dekker (c. 1572 – 1632), John Fletcher (1579–1625) and Francis Beaumont (1584–1616). Marlowe (1564–1593) was born only a few weeks before Shakespeare and must have known him. Marlowe&#x27;s subject matter is different from Shakespeare&#x27;s as it focuses more on the moral drama of the renaissance man than any other thing. Marlowe was fascinated and terrified by the new frontiers opened by modern science. Drawing on German lore, he introduced the story of Faust to England in his play Doctor Faustus (c. 1592), a scientist and magician obsessed by the thirst for knowledge and the desire to push man&#x27;s technological power to its limits. At the end of a 24-year covenant with the devil, Faust must surrender his soul to him. Beaumont and Fletcher are less known, but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his best dramas, and were popular at the time. One of Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s chief merits was that of realising how feudalism and chivalry had turned into snobbery and make-believe and that new social classes were on the rise. Beaumont&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; (1607) satirises the rising middle class and especially the nouveaux riches who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much literature at all.

Ben Jonson (1572/3-1637) is best known for his satirical plays, particularly &quot;Volpone&quot;, &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, and &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;. He was also often engaged to write courtly masques, ornate plays where the actors wore masks. Ben Jonson&#x27;s aesthetics have roots in the Middle Ages as his characters are based on the theory of humours. However, the stock types of Latin literature were an equal influence. Jonson therefore tends to create types or caricatures. However, in his best work, characters are &quot;so vitally rendered as to take on a being that transcends the type&quot;. He is a master of style, and a brilliant satirist. Jonson&#x27;s famous comedy &quot;Volpone&quot; (1605 or 1606) shows how a group of scammers are fooled by a top con-artist, vice being punished by vice, virtue meting out its reward. Others who followed Jonson&#x27;s style include Beaumont and Fletcher, whose comedy, &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; (c. 1607–08), satirizes the rising middle class and especially of those &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much about literature at all. In the story, a grocer and his wife wrangle with the professional actors to have their illiterate son play a leading role in the play.

A popular style of theatre during Jacobean times was the revenge play, which had been popularised earlier in the Elizabethan era by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), and then subsequently developed by John Webster (1578–1632) in the 17th century. Webster&#x27;s major plays, &quot;The White Devil&quot; (c. 1609 – 1612) and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (c. 1612/13), are macabre, disturbing works. Webster has received a reputation for being the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatist with the most unsparingly dark vision of human nature. Webster&#x27;s tragedies present a horrific vision of mankind; in his poem &quot;Whispers of Immortality,&quot; T. S. Eliot memorably says that Webster always &quot;saw the skull beneath the skin&quot;. While Webster&#x27;s drama was generally dismissed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there has been &quot;a strong revival of interest&quot; in the 20th century.

Other revenge tragedies include &quot;The Changeling&quot;, written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley; &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; by Cyril Tourneur, first published in 1611; Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;; &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; by George Chapman; &quot;The Malcontent&quot; (c. 1603) of John Marston; and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot;. Besides &quot;Hamlet&quot;, other plays of Shakespeare&#x27;s with at least some revenge elements are &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

George Chapman (?1559-?1634) was a successful playwright who produced comedies (his collaboration on &quot;Eastward Hoe&quot; led to his brief imprisonment in 1605 as it offended the King with its anti-Scottish sentiment), tragedies (most notably &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot;) and court masques (&quot;The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&quot;), but who is now remembered chiefly for his translation in 1616 of Homer&#x27;s Iliad and Odyssey.

&quot;The Tragedy of Mariam, the Fair Queen of Jewry&quot;, a closet drama written by Elizabeth Tanfield Cary (1585–1639) and first published in 1613, was the first original play in English known to have been written by a woman.

==17th and 18th centuries==
During the Interregnum 1649–1660, English theatres were kept closed by the Puritans for religious and ideological reasons. When the London theatres opened again with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, they flourished under the personal interest and support of Charles II. Wide and socially mixed audiences were attracted by topical writing and by the introduction of the first professional actresses (in Shakespeare&#x27;s time, all female roles had been played by boys). New genres of the Restoration were heroic drama, pathetic drama, and Restoration comedy. Notable heroic tragedies of this period include John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;All for Love&quot; (1677) and &quot;Aureng-zebe&quot; (1675), and Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserved&quot; (1682). The Restoration plays that have best retained the interest of producers and audiences today are the comedies, such as George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode&quot; (1676), William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot; (1676), John Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;The Relapse&quot; (1696), and William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1700). This period saw the first professional woman playwright, Aphra Behn, author of many comedies including &quot;The Rover&quot; (1677). Restoration comedy is famous or notorious for its sexual explicitness, a quality encouraged by Charles II (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish aristocratic ethos of his court.

In the 18th century, the highbrow and provocative Restoration comedy lost favour, to be replaced by sentimental comedy, domestic tragedy such as George Lillo&#x27;s &quot;The London Merchant&quot; (1731), and by an overwhelming interest in Italian opera. Popular entertainment became more dominant in this period than ever before. Fair-booth burlesque and musical entertainment, the ancestors of the English music hall, flourished at the expense of legitimate English drama. By the early 19th century, few English dramas were being written, except for closet drama, plays intended to be presented privately rather than on stage.

==Victorian era==

A change came in the Victorian era with a profusion on the London stage of farces, musical burlesques, extravaganzas and comic operas that competed with Shakespeare productions and serious drama by the likes of James Planché and Thomas William Robertson. In 1855, the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of (formerly risqué) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and were followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies. W. S. Gilbert and Oscar Wilde were leading poets and dramatists of the late Victorian period. Wilde&#x27;s plays, in particular, stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a much closer relationship to those of the Edwardian dramatists such as Irishman George Bernard Shaw and Norwegian Henrik Ibsen.

The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly during the Victorian period. As transportation improved, poverty in London diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy &quot;Our Boys&quot;, opening in 1875. Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;. Several of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas broke the 500-performance barrier, beginning with &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in 1878, and Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson&#x27;s 1886 hit, &quot;Dorothy&quot;, ran for 931 performances.

==The theatre: 1901–45==
Edwardian musical comedy held the London stage (not together with foreign operetta imports) until World War I and was then supplanted by increasingly popular American musical theatre and comedies by Noël Coward, Ivor Novello and their contemporaries. The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only a limited challenge to theatre. But by the end of the 1920s, films like &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; could be presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. Some dramatists wrote for the new medium, but playwriting continued.

Irish playwrights George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) and J. M. Synge (1871–1909) were influential in British drama. Shaw&#x27;s career began in the last decade of the nineteenth-century and he wrote more than 60 plays. Synge&#x27;s plays belong to the first decade of the twentieth century. Synge&#x27;s most famous play, &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, &quot;caused outrage and riots when it was first performed&quot; in Dublin in 1907. George Bernard Shaw turned the Edwardian theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, &quot;the morality of armaments and war&quot; and the rights of women. In the 1920s and later Noël Coward (1899–1973) achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1925), &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1930), &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1932), &quot;Present Laughter&quot; (1942) and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1941), have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. In the 1930s W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood co-authored verse dramas, of which The Ascent of F6 (1936) is the most notable, that owed much to Bertolt Brecht. T. S. Eliot had begun this attempt to revive poetic drama with &quot;Sweeney Agonistes&quot; in 1932, and this was followed by &quot;The Rock&quot; (1934), &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; (1939). There were three further plays after the war.

==The period 1945–2000==
An important cultural movement in the British theatre which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was Kitchen sink realism (or &quot;kitchen sink drama&quot;), a term coined to describe art (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by John Bratby), novels, film and television plays. The term angry young men was often applied to members of this artistic movement. It used a style of social realism which depicts the domestic lives of the working class, to explore social issues and political issues. The drawing room plays of the post-war period, typical of dramatists like Terence Rattigan and Noël Coward were challenged in the 1950s by these Angry Young Men, in plays like John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956). Arnold Wesker and Nell Dunn also brought social concerns to the stage.

Again In the 1950s, the absurdist play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1955) (originally &quot;En attendant Godot&quot;, 1952), by the French resident Irishman Samuel Beckett profoundly affected British drama. The Theatre of the Absurd influenced Harold Pinter (1930-2008), (The Birthday Party, 1958), whose works are often characterised by menace or claustrophobia. Beckett also influenced Tom Stoppard (1937-) (&quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot;,1966). Stoppard&#x27;s works are, however, also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. Both Pinter and Stoppard continued to have new plays produced into the 1990s. Michael Frayn (1933- ) is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas. He is also a novelist.

Other Important playwrights whose careers began later in the century are: Caryl Churchill (&quot;Top Girls&quot;, 1982) and Alan Ayckbourn (&quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot;, 1972).

An important new element in the world of British drama, from the beginnings of radio in the 1920s, was the commissioning of plays, or the adaption of existing plays, by BBC radio. This was especially important in the 1950s and 1960s (and from the 1960s on for television). Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill&#x27;s early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with &quot;The Ants&quot;, there were nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton&#x27;s dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play &quot;The Ruffian on the Stair&quot;, which was broadcast on 31 August 1964. Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;first professional production was in the fifteen-minute &quot;Just Before Midnight&quot; programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists&quot;. John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel &quot;Like Men Betrayed&quot; for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with &quot;The Dock Brief&quot;, starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio&#x27;s Third Programme, later televised with the same cast, and subsequently presented in a double bill with &quot;What Shall We Tell Caroline?&quot; at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for Rumpole of the Bailey a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.

Other notable radio dramatists included Brendan Behan, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC radio, from the early 1970s. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play &quot;The Big House&quot; (1956); prior to this he had written two plays &quot;Moving Out&quot;and &quot;A Garden Party&quot; for Irish radio.

Among the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1954), Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;All That Fall&quot; (1957), Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;A Slight Ache&quot; (1959) and Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1954). Samuel Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television. Beckett&#x27;s radio play &quot;Embers&quot; was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.

== 21st century ==
Three Girls is a three-part British television&#x27;s real life drama series, written by screenwriter Nicole Taylor, and directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, that broadcast on three consecutive nights between 16 and 18 May 2017 on BBC One. the series is a dramatised version of the events surrounding the Rochdale child sex abuse ring, the mini series Three Girls attempts to create awareness about how complex criminal process of child grooming takes place while sexually abusing children and describes how the authorities failed to investigate allegations of rape because the victims were perceived as unreliable witnesses. The story is told from the viewpoint of three of the victims: fourteen-year-old Holly Winshaw (Molly Windsor), sixteen-year-old Amber Bowen (Ria Zmitrowicz) and her younger sister Ruby (Liv Hill) According to lawyers Richard Scorer &amp; Nazir Afzal, the drama Three girls helps in building awareness around child protection issues of 21st century. While few critics including whistleblower Sara Rowbotham and few victims appreciated accuracy of depiction; Ben Lawrence in The Telegraph found it to be too timid and not going deep down to investigate &amp; expose root causes surrounding inappropriate behavior of perpetrators of Pakistani descent fully enough.

<doc id="173061" wikidata="Q188111" url="?curid=173061" title="Ayumi Hamasaki">
<text>is a Japanese singer-songwriter and producer. Nicknamed the &quot;Empress of Pop&quot; on account of her influence throughout Asia, she is widely recognized for her versatile music production, songwriting, and live performances. Hamasaki is the best-selling solo artist in Japan, and a cultural icon of the Heisei era.

Born and raised in Fukuoka, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at 14 in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting. In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single &quot;Poker Face&quot; and debut major-label album &quot;A Song for ××&quot;. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. This rapid rise to fame was attributed to her style of lyric-writing, listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, &quot;Duty,&quot; selling nearly three million. &quot;A Best&quot;, her first compilation album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in Japan. It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label&#x27;s income.

After &quot;A Best&quot;, Hamasaki went on to experiment with her music style and lyricism, incorporating English into her work from &quot;Rainbow&quot; onwards. Later albums would range from electronic dream-pop to rock genres, the singer commenting that she focuses on what she wants to create &quot;whether it is trendy or not&quot;. Hamasaki currently holds the record for the most albums to place in the top ten by a female artist in Japan.

Hamasaki has sold over 50.708 million units in Japan, and has several domestic record achievements for her singles: the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (25), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is also the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon, and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut. In addition to this, Hamasaki&#x27;s remix albums &quot;Super Eurobeat Presents Ayu-ro Mix&quot; and &quot;Ayu-mi-x II Version Non-Stop Mega Mix&quot;, are recognized as two of the best selling remix albums of all time worldwide.

==Life and career==
===1978–1997: Childhood and early endeavors===
Born in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother; her father had left the family when she was three, and had no further contact with the family. Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother due to her mother working full-time. She described herself as a tomboy when she was a teenager, and as a &quot;strange kid&quot; who liked to be alone.

At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, to supplement the family&#x27;s income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency. Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians&#x27; agency. Under the name of &quot;Ayumi&quot;, Hamasaki released a rap EP, &quot;Nothing from Nothing&quot;, on the Nippon Columbia label in 1995. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart. After this, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in movies and television dramas, which included &quot;Ladys Ladys!! Sōcho Saigo no Hi&quot; and &quot;Miseinen&quot;. From August 1995 to March 1996, Hamasaki also co-hosted the SoundLink &quot;Hōkago no Ōsama&quot; (&quot;After-School King&quot;) for Nintendo Satellaview with Shigeru Izumiya. Hamasaki decided to return to studying after her mother moved to Tokyo.

Hamasaki attended Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped out in the tenth grade after struggling to adjust to student life. She describes living aimlessly during this period, shopping in Shibuya and going to nightclubs. After singing karaoke at Velfarre, she was introduced to Max Matsuura, who offered her a record deal. Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down, saying later &quot;I&#x27;d never heard of Avex. When he asked if I wanted to pursue a singing career, I said, &#x27;No way.&#x27; He was this older guy, and I thought the whole thing sounded fishy.&quot;

Matsuura persisted, and Hamasaki eventually agreed to take voice lessons the following year, most of which she would end up skipping due to reminding her of school. When Matsuura found out, he offered to send her abroad for one-to-one training instead. &quot;I thought he was kidding&quot; Ayu said later of this time, &quot;I mean, I was seventeen&quot;. Hamasaki stayed in New York for three months, corresponding frequently with Matsuura. Due to difficulties voicing her thoughts, that correspondence was usually through letter; impressed by her writing style, the producer asked her to try her hand at lyrics while they prepared for her debut. &quot;No one had ever asked anything of me before, or expected anything,&quot; the singer said later. &quot;He&#x27;s the one who found me and drew me out.&quot; 

===1998–1999: Musical beginnings, &quot;A Song for xx&quot;, and &quot;Loveppears&quot;===
Hamasaki made her debut on April 8, 1998 with the single &quot;Poker Face&quot;. Almost a year later, the singer released her debut studio album &quot;A Song for ××;&quot; it was an unprecedented success, topping the Oricon charts for five weeks and selling over a million copies. Later in 1999, she received the Japan Gold Disc Award for &quot;Best New Artist of the Year&quot;.

&quot;Ayu-mi-x&quot; (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, signalled Hamasaki moving beyond the pop-rock sound of &quot;A Song for ××&quot;. She began to experiment with musical style in her singles, releasing remixes which spanned reggae and house. Later singles became milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single (&quot;Love: Destiny&quot;) and first million-selling single (&quot;A&quot;). Her second studio album, &quot;Loveppears&quot; (November 1999), topped the Oricon charts and sold nearly 3 million copies. In support of &quot;Loveppears&quot;, she held her first tour: &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A&quot;. Two DVDs of the tour were released. &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 Vol. 1&quot; was released on September 13, 2000 with a multi-angle function to switch between backstage view and audience view. &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 Vol. 2&quot; was released on September 27, 2000 with a multi-angle function to switch between audience view and the video effects on the giant video screen in the concert.

===2000–2002: &quot;Duty&quot;, &quot;A Best&quot;, &quot;I Am...&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow&quot;===
From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the &quot;despair trilogy&quot;: &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Far Away&quot;, and &quot;Seasons&quot;. Her subsequent studio album, &quot;Duty&quot;, reflected on the artist&#x27;s feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of responsibility; it resonated with fans, and became Hamasaki&#x27;s best-selling studio album. At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first New Year countdown concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.

In 2001, Hamasaki released her first compilation album, &quot;A Best&quot;. In support of &quot;Duty&quot; and &quot;A Best&quot;, Hamasaki held a tour of Japan&#x27;s domes.

In 2002, the singer released her fourth studio album, &quot;I Am...&quot;, which featured her own compositions under the pseudonym &quot;Crea&quot;. In light of the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of the album, focusing on issues such as faith and world peace. &quot;A Song Is Born&quot;, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex&#x27;s Song Nation project. She also changed her idea for the album cover, opting instead to be portrayed as a &quot;peace muse&quot;: In support of &quot;I Am...&quot;, Hamasaki held two tours: &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2002 A,&quot; and &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki Stadium Tour 2002 A&quot;. Live albums of both tours were released in 2003. Later that year, Hamasaki performed at the MTV Asia music awards ceremony in Singapore, and received the award for &quot;Most Influential Japanese Singer in Asia&quot;. In November she released her first European single, &quot;Connected&quot;, under the name &quot;Ayu&quot;. It was released in Germany on the Drizzly label. Hamasaki continued to release singles in Germany until 2005.

The singles &quot;Free &amp; Easy&quot;. &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;Voyage&quot; were released ahead of Hamasaki&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Rainbow&quot; (December 2002)&quot;.&quot; 

===2003–2006: &quot;My Story&quot;, &quot;(Miss)Understood&quot;, and &quot;Secret&quot;===
In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;Forgiveness&quot;, and &quot;No Way to Say&quot;. The singer then held the &quot;A Museum&quot; concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. The singer&#x27;s next release, the EP &quot;Memorial Address,&quot; topped the Oricon chart and sold over a million copies. Despite this, sales of Hamasaki&#x27;s singles began to wane — although all three of the album&#x27;s singles topped the Oricon charts, &quot;&amp;&quot; was Hamasaki&#x27;s last single to sell over 500,000 copies. By the end of &quot;Arena Tour 2003–2004&quot;, Hamasaki had grown disillusioned with her position in Avex. This period of reassessment led her to begin work on her next studio album, &quot;My Story,&quot; ahead of schedule.

&quot;My Story&quot; and its singles, &quot;Moments&quot;, &quot;Inspire&quot;, and &quot;Carols&quot;, all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, &quot;My Story&quot; became Hamasaki&#x27;s last million-selling studio album according to Oricon. From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide &quot;My Story&quot; arena tour, her first album-based tour. &quot;My Story Classical&quot;, a classical version of &quot;My Story,&quot; was released in March 2005.

&quot;(Miss)understood&quot;, Hamasaki&#x27;s seventh studio album, was released in January 2006. In support of the album, Hamasaki held the &quot;(Miss)understood&quot; arena tour, which spanned three months with thirty concerts.

&quot;Startin&#x27;&quot;, Hamasaki&#x27;s twenty-sixth number-one single, was released in March 2006. The subsequent studio album, &quot;Secret&quot;, was released in November 2006. 

===2007–2008: &quot;A Best 2&quot;, &quot;Guilty&quot;, and &quot;A Complete&quot;===

In 2007, Hamasaki released &quot;A Best 2&quot;. The two versions, &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;, debuted at the first and second positions on the Oricon weekly charts. Hamasaki held the four-month-long &quot;Tour of Secret&quot; from March to the end of June.

Hamasaki released &quot;Glitter/Fated&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; 2 Myself&quot;, and &quot;Together When...&quot; ahead of her ninth studio album, &quot;Guilty&quot; (2008). In April 2008, Hamasaki released the single &quot;Mirrorcle World&quot;. Between April and September 2008, Hamasaki held her second tour of Asia: &quot;Asia Tour 2008: 10th Anniversary&quot;. On September 10, Hamasaki released &quot;A Complete: All Singles&quot;.

===2009–2011: &quot;Next Level&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Circus&quot;, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, and &quot;Five&quot;===

Hamasaki&#x27;s next two releases, &quot;Days/Green&quot; and &quot;Rule/Sparkle&quot;, continued her streak of number-one singles. The subsequent studio album, &quot;Next Level&quot;, was released on March 25, 2009. &quot;Next Level&quot; reached the top of the Oricon charts, making Hamasaki the only artist to have a number-one album every year for eleven years in a row since her debut. On August 12, 2009, Hamasaki released &quot;Sunrise/Sunset (Love Is All)&quot;. &quot;Sunrise (Love Is All)&quot; was used as the theme song for the Japanese television drama &quot;Dandy Daddy?&quot;. Hamasaki&#x27;s third single of the year, &quot;You Were.../Ballad&quot;, was used for Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure in Japan.

Hamasaki&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Circus&quot; was released on April 14, 2010. Hamasaki also began expanding her online presence, setting up accounts on MySpace, Ustream, and Twitter. In July, entertainment company Livespire announced that Hamasaki&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Next Level&quot; tour would be shown in 3D at Toho cinemas nationwide during August 2010. Later that year, Hamasaki released singles &quot;Moon/Blossom&quot;, &quot;Crossroad&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;. On December 22, Hamasaki released &quot;Love Songs,&quot; which debuted atop the Oricon album chart. 

In February 2011, it was announced that her upcoming tour, &quot;Hotel Love Songs&quot;, would start in April. It was later renamed to &quot;Power of Music&quot; and delayed until late May due to the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, Hamasaki instead focusing on charity efforts in the immediate aftermath.

On April 20, 2011, Hamasaki simultaneously released four &quot;Ayu-mi-x 7&quot; remix albums: &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Trance 4&quot;, and &quot;Ayu-ro Mix 4&quot;. On the same day, &quot;2010 Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Circus Tour&quot; and &quot;A 50 Singles: Live Selection&quot; topped the weekly chart at number one and two respectively. The simultaneous releases made Hamasaki the first artist ever to have four albums in Oricon&#x27;s top ten, and also the first artist to hold the two top positions on the Oricon DVD chart. 

On August 31, Hamasaki released her second mini album: &quot;Five&quot;. It topped the Oricon chart for two weeks.

===2012–2013: 15th anniversary, &quot;Party Queen&quot;, &quot;Love Again&quot;, and &quot;A Summer Best&quot;===

On March 21, Hamasaki released her thirteenth studio album, &quot;Party Queen.&quot; During the press tour, Hamasaki would say that she had considered making the release her first double album due to &quot;how easy&quot; songwriting had come to her during production.

On August 6, 2012, Hamasaki released her sixth compilation album &quot;A Summer Best&quot;. In September, it was announced that there would be new material for five consecutive months to celebrate the artist&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary; these releases consisted of &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;A Classical&quot;, &quot;Love Again&quot;, and &quot;Arena Tour 2012 A: Hotel Love Songs&quot;.

In April 2013, Hamasaki began the &quot;15th Anniversary Tour: A Best Live&quot; tour. Its setlist, selected by an online fan survey, was later released as her first live album CD. 

===2014–2015: &quot;Colours&quot;, &quot;A One&quot;, and &quot;Sixxxxxx&quot;===
From May 30 to July 6, 2014, Hamasaki held her &quot;Premium Showcase: Feel the Love&quot; tour. Hamasaki&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Colours&quot;, was released on July 2, 2014; recorded in Los Angeles, it was the sole project the singer worked on entirely in the United States. Of its creative direction, Hamasaki said: &quot;Now that I&#x27;m living in L.A., I thought &#x27;I want to do work I could only do in L.A&#x27;... I was very proactive about it.&quot;

&quot;A One,&quot; Hamasaki&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, was released on April 8, 2015; during its press tour, the singer described the album as a return to &quot;the &#x27;Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27; of the past&quot;. Between April and July 2015, Hamasaki embarked on her &quot;Arena Tour 2015 A: Cirque de Minuit&quot; tour, followed by the released of &quot;Sixxxxxx,&quot; her sixth EP. To promote the release, Hamasaki held her first fanclub exclusive tour in twelve years. On December 23, 2015, Hamasaki released &quot;Winter Diary: A7 Classical&quot;.

=== 2016–2020: &quot;Made in Japan,&quot; 20th anniversary, &quot;Trouble&quot; ===
A 15th anniversary edition of &quot;A Best&quot; was released on March 28, 2016. In May 2016, Hamasaki began the &quot;Arena Tour 2016 A: Made in Japan&quot; tour.

On May 11, &quot;Made in Japan&quot; was released on the streaming platform AWA. Later that same month, Hamasaki embarked on her &quot;Just the Beginning Tour 2017&quot; tour. The second part of the tour, &quot;Just the Beginning Part 2: Sacrifice&quot;, was held between September and November 2017. On September 6, 2017, Hamasaki released &quot;Words&quot; as a free download for tour attendees. The third chapter of the tour began in December 2017 through February 2018.

The &quot;Power of Music: 20th Anniversary&quot; tour ran from April 7 to July 22, 2018. &quot;Trouble&quot;, her seventh EP, was released on August 15, 2018.

Inbetween, Hamasaki held her annual New Year&#x27;s Eve concert: &quot;Countdown Live 2019–2020: Promised Land.&quot; 

In February 2020, the singer began her &quot;Trouble Tour 2020: Saigo no Trouble&quot; tour; it was later cancelled after two dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, Hamasaki organized and took part in multiple online concerts: &quot;Premium Limited Live A: Natsu no Trouble&quot; on July 25, &quot;A-Nation Online 2020&quot; on August 29&quot;,&quot; &quot;Trouble Tour 2020: Saigo no Trouble - Final&quot; on October 2, and &quot;Special Showcase Xmas Eve 2020&quot; on December 24. &quot;Countdown Live 2020-2021 A: Music For Life,&quot; two concerts for December 30 and 31, was cancelled on December 29 due to a member of staff testing positive with COVID-19.

Hamasaki released the compilation album &quot;A Ballads 2&quot;, which peaked at number three in the Oricon top ten, and single &quot;23rd Monster&quot; on April 8 2021.

In June 2021, Hamasaki held &quot;Music for Life: Return&quot;, which used some of the concept and setlist initially planned for the cancelled &quot;Countdown Live 2020 - 2021: Music For Life&quot; concert. &quot;Summer Party 2021&quot; was held on August 23. Hamasaki then embarked on &quot;Asia Tour 2021-2022 A: 23rd Monster&quot; from October 2; despite the name, there were no confirmed dates outside of Japan due to COVID-19 restrictions. 

On November 4, it was reported that Hamasaki had fractured her ankle but that her concerts later that week would still be held. On November 6, the artist was found unresponsive after that evening&#x27;s event, and was hospitalized for anaphylactic shock.

===2023: 25th anniversary, &quot;Remember You&quot;===
On January 25, Hamasaki released her eighteenth studio album: &quot;Remember You.&quot; The album&#x27;s subsequent performance earned her the distinction of becoming the female artist with the most albums to reach the top ten on the Oricon charts.

On March 28, Hamasaki was announced as a brand ambassador for Rhythm Co. Ltd. When asked about her 25th anniversary, the singer said: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do all of this alone for 25 years, if I&#x27;d only done it for myself. I want to repay the people who took care of me. (...) I don&#x27;t really feel like celebrating myself at all.&quot; The singer held her &quot;25th Anniversary Live&quot; concert on April 8 alongside a livestream hosted by Abema. From April 7, the 25th Anniversary Shibuya109 Campaign took place to celebrate Hamasaki&#x27;s milestone year.

==Artistry==
=== Lyrics ===
Having trouble voicing her thoughts out loud, Hamasaki began writing as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own experiences and emotions, as well as from the lives of those around her. She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, &quot;If I write when I&#x27;m low, it will be a dark song, but I don&#x27;t care. I want to be honest with myself at all times&quot;. 

In Hamasaki&#x27;s debut years, Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in the lyrical style between &quot;A Song for ××&quot; and her following albums &quot;Loveppears,&quot; and &quot;Duty&quot;. Misaki believed that Hamasaki&#x27;s meteoric rise to fame had impacted her perspective, signalled by her using the words and more often; it gave the impression that she was thinking more on her influence as a public figure. Hamasaki&#x27;s awareness of her fame went on to shape the lyrical direction of her albums &quot;I Am...&quot; and &quot;Rainbow,&quot; only returning to a more autobiographical style with &quot;My Story&quot;; in a 2004 interview, she stated that her goal was to make something &quot;unmistakably human&quot; instead of writing to specifically give people hope, or comfort.

Hamasaki&#x27;s lyrics went on to define her public image; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki&#x27;s writing as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; noted that Hamasaki quickly developed a reputation as a &quot;thoughtful, introspective lyricist&quot;; Barry Walters of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; went further, complimenting her ability to sing of &quot;the pain and happiness of millennial life&quot;. Subaru Tomioka, in regard to the singer&#x27;s impact on the LGBTQ community, appreciated how she &quot;replaced love songs between men and women with ones between people of the same sex, in a world where role models hadn&#x27;t previously existed outside of your own imagination.&quot; Tomioka also highlighted her ability to bring emotion into her work, specifically the enmity Hamasaki has conveyed through songs such as &quot;My Name&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;Lady Dynamite&quot;, and &quot;Vibees&quot;. 

A notable aspect of Hamasaki&#x27;s discography is her consistent use of English for her song, album, and tour titles; in an interview for her fifteenth anniversary, the singer stated &quot;The meaning would be more restricted in Japanese—for example, if I use &#x27;red&#x27; instead of &#x27;aku&#x27; (赤), wouldn’t you wonder, “What’s the meaning? It’s not simply &#x27;aku&#x27;, right?” I want to evoke more ideas (from the reader).&quot;

=== Musical style ===
Hamasaki has released almost three hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R&amp;B, progressive rock, pop, and classical. Hamasaki has cited Madonna, Babyface, En Vogue, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple among her early influences, and has openly appreciated the works of Seiko Matsuda, Michelle Branch, Yumi Matsutoya, Rie Miyazawa, Utada Hikaru, Joan Osborne, Miyuki Nakajima, and Keiko Yamada. 

Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. These remixes span a variety of genres such as Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic mixes, classical and traditional Chinese music. The musicians and acts she has worked with directly include Above &amp; Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra, Junkie XL, and the Princess China Music Orchestra.

In addition to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has involved herself in other aspects of production throughout her career. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, &quot;Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer&#x27;s arena. I think really we should say &#x27;Produced by Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27;.&quot; In 2022, Matsuura stated that he stepped away from the lead producer role in 2000 as Hamasaki took on more responsibilities.

Hamasaki began to pen her own compositions in 2000, beginning with her single &quot;M&quot;. During its production process, she struggled to find a melody that matched what she had in mind, and decided it would be faster to compose it herself. In a 2001 interview, she stated that &#x27;I never thought it was important for me to start writing original songs... with “M”, it just so happened that the melody I wrote fit the best.&#x27; In the same interview, Hamasaki said she felt no pressure to continue composing, and that she felt she could &#x27;only go so far&#x27; with it due to her lack of formal knowledge. Her final published composition was &quot;Will&quot;, the b-side track to the 2005 single &quot;Heaven&quot;.

=== Videos and stage ===

Hamasaki is often involved in the artistic direction of her music videos. The themes of the videos are varied; many contain short storylines, some of which use symbolism to convey their respective messages. Additionally, the videos of &quot;Fairyland&quot;, &quot;My Name&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;Jewel&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, and &quot;Virgin Road&quot; are among the top twenty or so most expensive music videos, making Hamasaki the only non-American artist to hold such a distinction.

Hamasaki is also involved in the production and artistic direction of her live performances; they, like her videos, are often lavish productions and use a variety of props, extravagant costumes, and choreographed dances. She has used large video screens, fireworks, simulated rain drops, trick stage floors, and suspended devices.

==Public image and legacy==
Hamasaki&#x27;s lyrics and image initially gained a following predominantly among young Generation X and Millennials, often referred to as &quot;the voice of the lost generation&quot;. Music critic Tetsu Misaki believed that the juxtaposition of her fashionable appearance and her personal lyrics was one of her most important selling points, helping shape the 2000s pop scene in Japan. Teresa Nieman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Hamasaki&#x27;s willingness to take on unusual subject matter is what made her noteworthy among her peers, naming her as the &#x27;undisputed Queen of J-pop&#x27;. According to publications, it was that ability to contrast striking visuals and vulnerability that went on to inspire an entire generation across Asia.

Lisa Takeuchi Cullen of &quot;Time&quot; magazine credits some of Hamasaki&#x27;s early success to her &quot;by-the-bootstraps climb to pop royalty&quot; journey, her perspective resonating with the general public. Tomoyuki Hokari of &quot;OKMusic&quot; agrees, considering her lyricism as a &quot;reaction against the customs and culture of the previous generation&quot;, and a &quot;terrifyingly calm, objective view&quot; on the social turmoil of turn-of-the-century Japan. In addition, her history of supporting LGBTQ rights has led to widespread recognition as a gay icon, and remains a defining element of her image.

In the 2000s, her frequent changes in image greatly impacted the course of fashion. Described as a &quot;chameleonic style icon&quot;, Hamasaki was known for being fully involved in every aspect of her work, displaying an unprecedented degree of ownership over her image; the control she had over the market drove stores to buy black market paparazzi shots of magazine shoots pre-publication, hoping to get ahead of the next &quot;Ayu-instigated trend&quot;. Mishal Varna of &quot;MTV&quot; compared her influence to that of Madonna, reflecting on the singer drawing in over 150 million viewers to her performance on &quot;MTV Asia&quot;. A regular face on publications such as &quot;Vivi&quot;, &quot;Popteen&quot;, and &quot;Cawaii!,&quot; Hamasaki herself considered her constantly changing image essential to her craft. That process is credited for the creation of the &quot;hime-kei&quot; wave, along with influencing returning Y2K &quot;kogal&quot; and &quot;gyaru-kei&quot; trends. 

Hamasaki&#x27;s career has become the subject of academic study, and is considered to have had a profound impact on how the Japanese music industry manages and promotes female artists. Zhan Hongzhi of &quot;Inter-Margins&quot; magazine named her success as a type of &quot;identity economy&quot;, explaining: &quot;Japan spends 33.3 billion yen a year on Hamasaki. She is no longer just an idol. She has become &quot;Hamasaki Industries&quot;, a media in her own right.&quot; In the wider media industry, various artists have spoken of being influenced directly by Hamasaki; these include Itano Tomomi, Mao Asado, Maximum the Hormone, Tsubasa Masuwaka, Sayaka Kanda, Ken Hirai, Ayaki Sasaki, Chiharu Niiyama, Riisa Naka, Lin Yu-chun, Rinka, Asako Ito, Mana Sakura, Misono, Rina (Scandal), Rie Tanaka, and Rina Kawaei.

Hamasaki&#x27;s previous consideration of herself as a product has sometimes led to conflict between her artistry and her economic influence. Accusations of the singer having lost her relatability, or presenting an overly fake or cultivated image, have continued throughout her career. A renewed sense of appreciation for Hamasaki&#x27;s work was covered by media outlets during her 25th anniversary, &quot;The First Times&quot; writing: &quot;Involved in the Japanese pop scene for over 24 years, she has never stopped touring, never stopped releasing new music, and has never taken a break to recharge her batteries. How many artists can we say we have like that?&quot;

== Other activities ==

===Philanthropy===
In March 2011, Hamasaki donated 30 million yen to relief efforts for the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2021, the artist donated 10 million yen to the Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine, receiving the Medal of Honor. During the 2022 typhoon aftermath in the Shizuoka prefecture, Hamasaki openly criticized the media for not reporting on the disaster thoroughly. Over a period of three days, she organized a donation point and visited Shizuoka to talk to survivors and coordinate resources.

In May 2018, Hamasaki was the headliner for Tokyo Pride, held in Yoyogi Park. During her performance, the singer spoke about her friends in the Ni-chōme district and the need to stand up for change: &quot;Japan is still a conservative country, so there is a part of us that cannot shake off the idea that those in minority groups are wrong. If there are moments in the future when you feel small and want to give up, please remember this day—I hope that you will always be proud of who you are, and keep going. I will always be walking alongside you.&quot;

In 2023, Hamasaki adopted two dogs who had severe medical issues and a background of abuse. Speaking jointly with animal shelter representatives, Hamasaki highlighted the need to provide care for long-term residents of rescue homes, and encouraged awareness of puppy mills and the impact adoption can have: &quot;Saving an animal&#x27;s life won&#x27;t change the world, but you can change that animal&#x27;s world forever&quot;.

===&quot;Ayuready?&quot;===
From October 2002 to March 2004, Hamasaki was the host of her own talk and variety TV show, named &quot;Ayuready?&quot;, on Fuji Television. The talk show, which aired on Saturday nights from 11:30 to midnight, often featured her performing songs with guests. Among the names who appeared on the program were Goto Maki, Puffy, and Akina Nakamori. To promote the program (and her album &quot;Rainbow&quot;), Hamasaki opened the Rainbow House restaurant on Shōnan Beach on July 1, 2003, which was open until August 31, 2003. After almost two years, the last episode of &quot;Ayuready?&quot; aired in March 2004.

===Branded products and endorsements===
Throughout her early career under Avex, Hamasaki promoted products that ranged from electronics (Tu-Ka cell phones and Panasonic) to various snack foods. Among the products she has advertised on television are the Honda Crea scooter, KOSÉ cosmetics, Mister Donut donuts, and Boss coffee. Although Hamasaki initially supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, saying that it was &quot;necessary that [she is] viewed as a product&quot;, she eventually opposed Avex&#x27;s decision to market her as a &quot;product rather than a person&quot; from 2004. This began a significant hiatus from lending her name to product advertisements and endorsements.

In 2001, Hamasaki launched her own limited-run fashion brand, MTRLG (Material Girl); the clothes were sold at MTRLG boutiques and at Mise S*clusive stores. In 2002, Hamasaki created Ayupan, a cartoon version of herself that appeared in a line of merchandise (mainly figurines), and in a 2003 animation. For her 2007 tour &quot;Tour of Secret&quot;, Hamasaki collaborated with Sanrio to create a line of merchandise, &quot;Ayumi Hamasaki x Hello Kitty&quot;. The merchandise included cell phone straps and Lumix cameras decorated with a picture of Hello Kitty behind Hamasaki&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; logo; the former product was a result of a collaboration with Sanrio and Japanese fashion brand Ash &amp; Diamonds, the latter a collaboration with Sanrio and Panasonic.

In August 2019, author Narumi Komatsu released a novel about the early years of Hamasaki&#x27;s career: &quot;M Aisubeki Hito ga Ite.&quot; The book included a written endorsement from the artist as a part of its introduction. On social media, Hamasaki stated that the book &quot;combined both fact and fiction&quot; and had become its own story. A television drama-series based on the novel aired from April to July 2020. 

In March 2023, Hamasaki became a beauty brand ambassador for Rhythm Co., representing their R-Face BFT Pack product. The packaging included Hamasaki&#x27;s signature &quot;A&quot; logo, and advertisements used &quot;MASK&quot; as the official collaboration theme. On October 2, Hamasaki was announced as a brand ambassador for Gem Castle, and her song &quot;Dearest&quot; was used throughout their 45th anniversary campaign.

In December 2024, Hamasaki announced an official collaboration with the Sailor Moon brand. Merchandise featured an illustration by Naoko Takeuchi of Ayu and titular character Usagi. On the same day, the artist also launched her second design line with Sanrio: &quot;Ayupan x My Melody&quot;. 

==Personal life==
Hamasaki had a romantic relationship with her producer, Max Matsuura, from 1998 to 2000. 

Hamasaki began dating actor Tomoya Nagase in 2000, with their relationship ending in 2007. The pair had known each other since co-starring a TV drama in 1997.

On January 1, 2011, Hamasaki announced her engagement to Austrian actor and model Manuel Schwarz, whom she had met on the set of &quot;Virgin Road&quot;. On January 2, her office announced that she and Schwarz had married in the United States the day before. On January 16, 2012, Hamasaki announced her divorce through her fan club website, Team Ayu.

On December 13, 2013, it was announced through a fan club blog post that Hamasaki was engaged. In the announcement, the singer said &quot;As my partner is an ordinary student, I would be very happy if you could watch over us quietly.&quot; On March 3, 2014, the singer announced her second marriage. The couple filed for divorce in September 2016.

On January 1, 2020, Hamasaki revealed that she had given birth to her first child &quot;at the end of last year&quot;. On October 2, 2020, Hamasaki announced her second pregnancy through the Team Ayu website, and in May 2021 confirmed that she had given birth to her second child &quot;sometime in spring&quot;.

===Hearing loss===
In January 2008, Hamasaki announced on her blog that an inoperable condition, possibly tinnitus or Ménière&#x27;s disease, had caused complete deafness in her left ear. While the diagnosis was made in 2006, she admitted to the symptoms dating back to 2000, originating from her continuing stage performances while having an ear infection. Hamasaki stated in the blog post that she wished to continue singing, and that as a professional, she wanted to &quot;continue delivering the best performance I can&quot;.

On May 20, 2017, Hamasaki revealed that she had also began losing hearing in her right ear, experiencing severe bouts of dizziness and nausea. She vowed to continue performing, writing: &quot;The stage is where I belong. It&#x27;s the only place I really, truly exist. I don&#x27;t know anything else.&quot;

<text>This is a list of all the genera in the botanical family Arecaceae, the palm family, based on Baker &amp; Dransfield (2016), which is a revised listing of genera given in the 2008 edition of &quot;Genera Palmarum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
This is a list of all the genera in the botanical family Arecaceae, the palm family, arranged by tribes and subtribes within the family.

&quot;Genera Palmarum&quot; (2008) lists 183 genera. &quot;Lanonia&quot;, &quot;Saribus&quot;, and the monotypic genera &quot;Jailoloa&quot;, &quot;Wallaceodoxa&quot;, &quot;Manjekia&quot;, and &quot;Sabinaria&quot;, which were described after 2008, have also been included below. &quot;Ceratolobus&quot;, &quot;Daemonorops&quot;, &quot;Pogonotium&quot;, &quot;Wallichia&quot;, &quot;Lytocaryum&quot;, and the monotypic genera &quot;Retispatha&quot;, &quot;Pritchardiopsis&quot;, and &quot;Solfia&quot; have since been removed from &quot;Genera Palmarum&quot; (2008) as obsolete genera. This brings the total number of genera to 181 as of 2016.

<text>The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army (United States Army), Union Navy (U.S. Navy), and the Marines who served in the American Civil War. It was founded in 1866 in Decatur, Illinois, and grew to include thousands of &quot;posts&quot; (local community units) across the North and West. It was dissolved in 1956 at the death of its last member, Albert Woolson.
According to Stuart McConnell:The Grand Army of the Republic, the largest of all Union Army veterans&#x27; organizations, was the most powerful single-issue political lobby of the late nineteenth century, securing massive pensions for veterans and helping to elect five postwar presidents from its own membership. To its members, it was also a secret fraternal order, a source of local charity, a provider of entertainment in small municipalities, and a patriotic organization. Linking men through their experience of the war, the GAR became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, promoting patriotic education, helping to make Memorial Day a national holiday, lobbying Congress to establish regular veterans&#x27; pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at 410,000, was in 1890, a high point of various Civil War commemorative and monument dedication ceremonies.

==History==

After the end of American Civil War, various state and local organizations were formed for veterans to network and maintain connections with each other. Many of the veterans used their shared experiences as a basis for fellowship. Groups of men began joining, first for camaraderie and later for political power. Emerging as most influential among the various organizations during the first post-war years was the Grand Army of the Republic, founded on April 6, 1866, on the principles of &quot;Fraternity, Charity and Loyalty,&quot; in Decatur, Illinois, by Dr. Benjamin F. Stephenson. The GAR almost disappeared in the early 1870s, and many state-centered divisions, named &quot;departments&quot;, and local posts ceased to exist.

In his General Order No. 11, dated May 5, 1868, first GAR Commander-in-Chief, General John A. Logan declared May 30 to be Memorial Day (also referred to for many years as &quot;Decoration Day&quot;), calling upon the GAR membership to make the May 30 observance an annual occurrence. Although not the first time war graves had been decorated, Logan&#x27;s order effectively established &quot;Memorial Day&quot; as the day upon which Americans now pay tribute to all their war casualties, missing-in-action, and deceased veterans. As decades passed, similarly inspired commemorations also spread across the South as &quot;Confederate Memorial Day&quot; or &quot;Confederate Decoration Day&quot;, usually in April, led by organizations of Southern soldiers in the parallel United Confederate Veterans.



In the 1880s, the Union veterans&#x27; organization revived under new leadership that provided a platform for renewed growth, by advocating Federal pensions for veterans. As the organization revived, black veterans joined in significant numbers and organized local posts. In at least one case, in Ohio, an African American was elected as the commander of a predominately white post. This was Robert A. Pinn of Hart Post 124 in Massillon, Ohio.. While the national organization may have failed to press the case for pensions for black soldiers, many of them did receive federal pensions, and the papers in these pension files are now a rich source for African American genealogical research. Some sources emphasize that these pensions for black soldiers were less frequent than for their white counterparts. Some African American members of the GAR organized the National Memorial Association to advocate for a memorial to black soldiers in 1919.

The GAR was organized into &quot;Departments&quot; at the state level and &quot;Posts&quot; at the community level, and military-style uniforms were worn by its members. There were posts in every state in the U.S., and several posts overseas. The pattern of establishing departments and local posts was later used by other American military veterans&#x27; organizations, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (organized originally for veterans of the Spanish–American War and the Philippine Insurrection) and the later American Legion (for the First World War and later expanded to include subsequent World War II, Korean, Vietnam and Middle Eastern wars).

The GAR&#x27;s political power grew during the latter part of the 19th century, and it helped elect several United States presidents, beginning with the 18th, Ulysses S. Grant, and ending with the 25th, William McKinley. Six Civil War veterans (Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur; Benjamin Harrison, and McKinley) were elected President of the United States; all were Republicans. (The sole post-war Democratic president was Grover Cleveland--he bought a substitute and did not serve in the Civil War, but he did veto many pension laws passed by Congress.) 
Of the six mentioned US Presidents, at least five were members of the GAR but there is no record of membership for Chester Arthur, who was a Union general:
* Ulysses S. Grant (Lt General of the Union Armies) Became a member of the Philadelphia PA George G. Meade Post GAR Post # 1 May 16, 1877
* Rutherford B. Hayes (Brevet Major General) Became a Member of the Fremont Ohio Manville Moore GAR Post
* James A. Garfield (Major General) Possibly a member of the GAR – a GAR Post publication refers to the death of Comrade James Garfield, President of the United States
* Benjamin Harrison (Brevet Brigadier General) Became a member of the Indianapolis Indiana General George H. Thomas GAR Post
* William McKinley. (Brevet Major of the 23d Ohio) Became a member of the Canton Ohio GAR Post # 25 July 7, 1880 [It was later renamed McKinley GAR Post # 25]

With membership strictly limited to soldiers, sailors or Marines who served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Revenue Cutter Service of the United States of America during the War of the Rebellion 1861–1865, the GAR encouraged the formation of Allied Orders to aid them in various works. Numerous male organizations jousted for the backing of the GAR, and the political battles became quite severe until the GAR finally endorsed the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War as its heir.

The GAR, according to Stuart McConnell, promoted, &quot;a nationalism that honored white, native-stock, middle-class males and ...affirmed a prewar ideal of a virtuous, millennial Republic, based on the independent producer, entrepreneurial capitalism, and the citizen-soldier volunteer.&quot;

===Female members===
The GAR had at least three women who were members.

The first female known to be admitted to the GAR was Kady Brownell, who served in the Union Army with her husband Robert, a private in the 1st Rhode Island Infantry at the First Battle of Bull Run in Virginia and with the 5th Rhode Island Infantry at the Battle of New Berne in North Carolina. Brownell was admitted as a member in 1870 to Elias Howe Jr. Post #3, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The GAR insignia is engraved on her gravestone in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island.

In 1897 the GAR admitted Sarah Emma Edmonds, who served in the 2nd Michigan Infantry as a disguised man named &quot;Franklin Thompson&quot; from May 1861 until April 1863. In 1882, she collected affidavits from former comrades in an effort to petition for a veteran&#x27;s pension which she received in July 1884. Edmonds was only a member for a brief period as she died September 5, 1898; however she was given a funeral with military honors when she was reburied in Houston in 1901.

Dr. Mary Edwards Walker was a surgeon in the Union Army during the Civil War and a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. She treated soldiers from both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, and was captured by Confederate troops in 1864. Prior to her death in 1919, she was admitted to the Grand Army of the Republic.

Mary Bostwick Shellman was made an associate member of the Wilson Post No. 1 of the Department of Maryland Grand Army, circa 1899, for her lifelong work caring for soldiers and veterans, first as a teenage volunteer nurse and later for creating and continuing to lead one of the nation&#x27;s oldest Decoration Day Parades in Westminster, Maryland. She made remembering and caring for veterans her life&#x27;s work and saved at least five Union soldiers from having &quot;pauper burials.&quot;

It is possible that other women were members of the GAR, as well.
===Later years===

The GAR reached its largest enrollment in 1890, with 410,000 members. It held a &quot;National Encampment&quot; in 1866 and then every year from 1868 to 1949. Interesting anecdotes from the war were told around the many campfires at these reunions and compiled in a book of campfire &quot;chats&quot;, including descriptions of the festivities at the 1884–1886 encampments in Minneapolis, Portland, Maine and San Francisco. At the final encampment in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1949, the few surviving attendees voted to retain the existing officers in place until the organization&#x27;s dissolution. Theodore Penland of Oregon, the GAR&#x27;s Commander at the time, was therefore its last. At the time of the last national encampment, 16 members were still living and six were able to attend, including James Hard, the last combat veteran, who had fought at First Bull Run, Antietam, and Chancellorsville. In 1956, after the death of the last member, Albert Woolson, the GAR was formally dissolved.

==Memorials, honors and commemorations==

There are physical memorials to the Grand Army of the Republic in numerous communities throughout the United States.

U.S. Route 6 is known as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway for its entire length.

The Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps began during the conflict by both sides. In 1948, the Grand Army of the Republic was commemorated on a stamp. In 1951, the U.S. Postal Service printed a virtually identical stamp for the final reunion of the United Confederate Veterans.

==State posts==
Every state (even those of the former Confederacy) fell within a GAR &quot;Department,&quot; and within these Departments were the &quot;Posts&quot; (forerunners of modern American Legion Halls or VFW Halls). The posts were made up of local veterans, many of whom participated in local civic events. As the posts were formed, they were assigned to the home Department of the National Commander-in-chief of the year that they were chartered. There was no GAR post in London, but there was a Civil War Veterans Association Group that had many GAR members belonging to it.

As Civil War veterans died or were no longer able to participate in GAR activities, posts consolidated or were disbanded. Posts were assigned a sequential number based on their admission into the state&#x27;s GAR organization, and most posts held informal names which honored comrades, battles, or commanders; it was not uncommon to have more than one post in a state honoring the same individual (such as Abraham Lincoln) and posts often changed their informal designation by vote of the local membership.

==In literature and the arts==

John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot; features several references to the Grand Army of the Republic. Despite having very little actual battle experience during his brief military career, cut short by the loss of his leg, Adam Trask&#x27;s father Cyrus joins the GAR and assumes the stature of &quot;a great man&quot; through his involvement with the organization. At the height of the GAR&#x27;s influence in Washington, he brags to his son:

Later in the book, references are made to the graves of GAR members in California in order to emphasize the passage of time.

Sinclair Lewis also refers to the GAR in his acclaimed novel &quot;Main Street&quot; and in his novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, as does Charles Portis in his classic novel &quot;True Grit&quot;. The GAR is briefly mentioned in William Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Willa Cather&#x27;s short story &quot;The Sculptor&#x27;s Funeral&quot; briefly references the organization.

The GAR is mentioned in the seldom-sung second verse of the patriotic song &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot;.

The GAR is referenced in John McCrae&#x27;s poem &quot;He Is There!&quot; which was set to music in 1917 by Charles Ives as part of his cycle &quot;Three Songs of the War&quot;.

In Ward Moore&#x27;s 1953 alternate history novel &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, the Confederates won the Civil War and became a major world power while the rump United States was reduced to an impoverished dependence. The Grand Army of the Republic is the name of a nationalistic organization working to restore the United States to its former glory through acts of sabotage and terrorism.

The name appears in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel era. &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; refers to the clone army as &quot;The Grand Army of the Republic&quot;.

==Notable commanders-in-chief==

==Women&#x27;s auxiliaries==

The Woman&#x27;s Relief Corps was founded in 1879 as a &quot;secret&quot; organization and recognized in 1883 as the &quot;official women&#x27;s auxiliary&quot; to the GAR.

The Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic was also a significant organization. It was founded by Lelia P. Roby. As a congressionally chartered non-profit organization, it is the oldest women&#x27;s hereditary organization in the United States. The original objectives of the organization included promotion of patriotism and loyalty to the Union, and participation in community service, especially for the aid of our Veterans and their dependents.&quot;

As original Union veterans of the GAR, organized in 1866, grew old, many women&#x27;s groups formed to aid them and their widows and orphans. The Loyal Ladies League was established in 1881 as an auxiliary to the GAR; in 1886 the organization went more national and changed its name to &quot;The Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic.&quot; It was incorporated by Public Law 86-47 [S.949] of the 86th Congress on June 17, 1959 

In 1899, the president was Dr. Julia P. Shade of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Its president in 1922 was Mrs. Ethel M. Irish, of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

<text>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), also referred to simply as the &quot;Journal,&quot; is an American newspaper based in New York City. The newspaper provides extensive coverage of news, especially business and finance. It operates on a subscription model, requiring readers to pay for access to its articles and content. The &quot;Journal&quot; is published six days a week by Dow Jones &amp; Company, a division of News Corp. 

As of 2023, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; is the largest newspaper in the United States by print circulation, with 609,650 print subscribers. It has 3.17 million digital subscribers, the second-most in the nation after &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The newspaper is one of the United States&#x27; newspapers of record. The first issue of the newspaper was published on July 8, 1889. The editorial page of the &quot;Journal&quot; is typically center-right in its positions. The newspaper has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes.

==History==
===Founding and 19th century===

A predecessor to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was the Kiernan News Agency founded by John J. Kiernan in 1869. In 1880, Kiernan hired Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones as reporters. On a recommendation of Collis Potter Huntington, Dow and Jones co-founded their own news service, Dow Jones and Company, with fellow Kiernan reporter Charles Bergstresser. Dow Jones was headquartered in the basement of 15 Wall Street, the same building as Kiernan&#x27;s company next to the New York Stock Exchange Building.

The first products of Dow Jones &amp; Company, the publisher of the &quot;Journal&quot;, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed &quot;flimsies&quot;, hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange. Beginning in 1883, they were aggregated in a printed daily summary called the &quot;Customers&#x27; Afternoon Letter&quot;, sold for $1.50 per month compared to the $15 a month Dow Jones bulletin service. Dow Jones opened its own printing press at 71 Broadway in 1885.

Beginning July 8, 1889, the &quot;Afternoon Letter&quot; was renamed &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The debut issue of the &quot;Journal&quot; was four pages long, with dimensions of 20 3/4 × 15 1/2 inches and cost of $0.02 per copy. In its early days, the &quot;Journal&quot; had &quot;a tedious, blow-by-blow account of the day&#x27;s business without benefit of editing,&quot; wrote Edward E. Scharff in 1986.

For nearly 40 years, the front page had a four-column format, with the middle two devoted to news briefs and the farther two filled with advertisements for brokerage services. The &quot;Journal&quot; focused on stories from news wires and listings of stocks and bonds, while occasionally covering sports or politics. One front-page story on the debut edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was a raw wire report about the boxing match between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain, with varying accounts of the fight citing &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;Baltimore American&quot;, and anonymous sources. Seldom did &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; publish analysis or opinion articles in its early decades. In addition to a private wire to Boston, the &quot;Journal&quot; had reporters communicate via telegraph from Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Albany, and London.

In 1896, the &quot;Journal&quot; began publishing two separate Dow Jones stock indicies, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Jones Railroad Average. The first morning edition of the &quot;Journal&quot; was published on November 14, 1898. By the late 1890s, daily circulation reached 7,000.

Charles Dow wrote the first &quot;Review and Outlook&quot; column on April 21, 1899, a front-page editorial column explaining stock prices in terms of human nature; Dow&#x27;s thinking would later be known as the Dow theory. Scharff regarded Dow&#x27;s essays from 1899 to 1902 as &quot;stock market classics&quot;.

===20th century===
In the months before his death in 1902, Dow arranged to sell Dow Jones and the &quot;Journal&quot; to Clarence W. Barron, the Boston correspondent for the &quot;Journal&quot; since 1889, for $130,000 (). Because Barron had financial difficulties, his wife Jessie Waldron Barron made the $2,500 down payment to buy Dow Jones in 1902; Clarence would first own a Dow Jones share about ten years later.

Under Barron&#x27;s ownership, Thomas F. Woodlock was editor of the &quot;Journal&quot; from 1902 to 1905. By the end of Woodlock&#x27;s tenure, daily circulation for the &quot;Journal&quot; rose from 7,000 to 11,000. William Peter Hamilton became lead editorial writer in 1908, a time when the &quot;Journal&quot; began reflecting the views of Barron. Hamilton wrote what Scharff considered &quot;daily sermons in support of free-market capitalism&quot;.

Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot;, the United States&#x27;s premier financial weekly, was founded. Scharff described the newspaper in the Barron era as &quot;Wall Street&#x27;s public defender&quot; against regulatory efforts by the U.S. Congress. Circulation continued to rise, reaching 18,750 to 1920 and 52,000 briefly in 1928. Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron&#x27;s descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 would be yet another challenge to the &quot;Journal&quot; on top of Barron&#x27;s death. William Peter Hamilton died of pneumonia on December 9, 1929, aged 63. Circulation of the &quot;Journal&quot;, having surpassed 50,000 in 1928, dropped below 28,000 in the 1930s, and the newspaper downsized from 28 to 16 pages in the 1930s as well. Dow Jones president Hugh Bancroft retired in 1932; following his death in 1933, his widow Jane Waldron Bancroft appointed Kenneth Craven &quot;Casey&quot; Hogate as new company president. Hogate envisioned expanding the scope of the &quot;Journal&quot; to a &quot;more general business paper&quot; beyond stock and bond numbers.

Expanding westward, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; debuted a West Coast edition on October 21, 1929, &quot;The Wall Street Journal Pacific Coast Edition&quot;. The &quot;Pacific Coast Edition&quot; focused on California businesses and replicated some items from the regular &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;; however, its circulation never exceeded 3,000, and the Great Depression led numerous subscription cancellations.

By 1931, Bernard Kilgore became news editor for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, having joined the &quot;Journal&quot; copy desk in 1929. He began writing a column for the &quot;Pacific Coast Edition&quot; called &quot;Dear George&quot;, a feature explaining obscure financial topics in simpler, plain rhetoric. &quot;Dear George&quot; sharply contrasted with other &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; articles that relied on jargon that was incomprehensible even to its own reporters. The Eastern edition of the &quot;Journal&quot; began carrying &quot;Dear George&quot;, and beginning in 1932, Kilgore wrote &quot;Dear George&quot; three times a week from New York for the &quot;Journal&quot;. Then in 1934, Kilgore began writing a daily news digest &quot;What&#x27;s News&quot; for the &quot;Journal&quot; front page. Kilgore&#x27;s writings attracted the attention of the White House; President Franklin D. Roosevelt publicly recommended Kilgore&#x27;s work about pension payments for World War I veterans and a Supreme Court decision on the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. However, the &quot;Journal&quot; continued to struggle financially, with circulation stagnant at 32,000 in 1940. Most editions were only 12 to 14 pages long, and Dow Jones made only $69,000 of profits on $2 million of revenue, mostly due to its news ticker. Scharff observed a lack of coverage about a possible U.S. role in World War II.

In the 1940s, Dow Jones took steps to restructure the &quot;Journal&quot;. Kilgore was named managing editor of the &quot;Journal&quot; in 1941 and Dow Jones CEO in 1945. Scharff described Kilgore&#x27;s approach to journalism: &quot;A &quot;Journal&quot; story had to satisfy its sophisticated readership, but it also had to be clear enough not to discourage neophytes.&quot; Additionally, Kilgore aimed to have the newspaper appeal to a national audience, by making the East Coast and West Coast editions of the &quot;Journal&quot; more homogeneous. Until printing presses and reporting bureaus could be opened on location, photographs could not be included in the &quot;Journal&quot;.

In 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes&#x27;s editorials. Also in May 1947, the &quot;Journal&quot; launched a Southwest edition based in Dallas. The newspaper also added a new slogan in 1949: &quot;Everywhere, Men Who Get Ahead in Business Read &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.&quot; Circulation grew by nearly four-fold, from 32,000 in 1940 to 140,000 in 1949; however, Kilgore&#x27;s editorial reforms of the &quot;Journal&quot; had not yet entered popular understanding.

The first major journalism award for the &quot;Journal&quot; was a Sigma Delta Chi public service award, for stories in late 1952 exposing links between Empire Mail Order and organized crime. These stories followed news that Howard Hughes sold RKO Pictures to Empire Mail Order. Circulation of the &quot;Journal&quot; continued increasing throughout the 1950s, to 205,000 in 1951, 400,000 in 1955, and over 500,000 by 1957.

Warren H. Phillips became managing editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1957 after being promoted from Chicago bureau manager. Phillips was Jewish, in contrast to the largely midwestern, WASP management of the &quot;Journal&quot; at the time. Phillips, a former socialist, shifted his political views in the 1950s to reflect social liberalism and fiscal conservatism. Under Phillips, the &quot;Journal&quot; provided in-depth coverage of the civil rights movement, on the grounds that it &quot;was something that the average businessman needed to know about&quot;. For instance, &quot;Journal&quot; coverage of the Little Rock Central High School integration crisis went beyond the largely visual, emotional elements on newspapers and television, in depicting local citizens as supportive of integration in contrast to Governor Orval Faubus and other local politicians.

During the 1962–1963 New York City newspaper strike, the &quot;Journal&quot; was the only daily newspaper to continue printing in New York City; however, after the strike, Kilgore ordered the printing presses moved from New York to Chicopee, Massachusetts effective July 1, 1963. Although Kilgore did not publicly explain his rationale then, Scharff wrote in 1986 that the move resulted from feuds between Dow Jones and the printer&#x27;s union.

By Kilgore&#x27;s death in 1967, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; circulation exceeded one million. In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group. The first strike affecting a &quot;Journal&quot; printing plant was a three-day strike at Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1967; that would be followed by a weeklong strike by truck drivers at the South Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1970.

The period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including &quot;Factiva&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal Asia&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and &quot;WSJ Weekend Edition&quot;. In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. &quot;WSJ.&quot;, a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.

A complement to the print newspaper, &quot;The Wall Street Journal Online&quot;, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning. A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.

===21st century===

In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the &quot;Journal&quot; print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers. Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind &quot;The New York Times&quot; with 3 million digital subscriptions. In May 2008, an annual subscription to the digital edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers. Digital subscription rates increased dramatically to $443.88 per year as its popularity increased over print, with first-time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.

On November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; released an app that would allow users to access content from &quot;The Wall Street Journal Online&quot; via their mobile phones.

In September 2005, the &quot;Journal&quot; launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.

In 2005, the &quot;Journal&quot; reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1million, and an average age of 55.

In 2007, the &quot;Journal&quot; launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

===Design changes===
The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.

Front-page advertising in the &quot;Journal&quot; was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.

After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century always six columns, with the day&#x27;s top stories in the first and sixth columns, &quot;What&#x27;s News&quot; digest in the second and third, the &quot;A-hed&quot; feature story in the fourth (with &#x27;hed&#x27; being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12inches while keeping the length at 22inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save $18million a year in newsprint costs across all &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; papers. This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the &quot;A-hed&quot; out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).

The paper uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls, in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. the &quot;Journal&quot; still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert. The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more &quot;lifestyle&quot; sections.

The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World&#x27;s Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.

===News Corporation and News Corp===
On May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering $60 per share for stock that had been selling for $36.33 per share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.

Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The $5billion sale added &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, London&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and the Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).

On December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones&#x27;s voting stock approved the company&#x27;s acquisition by News Corporation.

In an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the &quot;Journal&quot;″s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent.

A special committee was established to oversee the paper&#x27;s editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.

A 2007 &quot;Journal&quot; article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long &quot;expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations&quot;. Former &quot;Times&quot; assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when &quot;Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing &quot;Times&quot; editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn&#x27;t be fired without the independent directors&#x27; approval. &#x27;God, you don&#x27;t take all that seriously, do you?&#x27; Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.&quot; Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.

In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; found evidence that the &quot;Journal&quot; had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the &quot;Journal&quot; to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the &quot;Journal&quot; agreed to run &quot;articles&quot; featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising. The case came to light after a Belgian &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice. As a result, the then &quot;Wall Street Journal Europe&quot; CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper&#x27;s business partners involved in the issue. Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.

The &quot;Journal&quot;, along with its parent Dow Jones &amp; Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp.

In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the &quot;Journal&quot; editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections. The new &quot;Business &amp; Finance&quot; section combined the former &quot;Business &amp; Tech&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Investing&quot; sections. The new &quot;Life &amp; Arts&quot; section took the place of &quot;Personal Journal&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot;. In addition, the &quot;Journal&quot; &quot;Greater New York&quot; coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper. The section was shuttered on July 9, 2021.

A 2018 survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was considered the third most-accurate and fourth most-unbiased news organization among the general public, tenth among Democrats, and second among Republicans. In an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was ranked the most trusted news organization by Americans. Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University wrote that the paper&#x27;s &quot;combination of respected news pages and conservative editorial pages seem to be a magic formula for generating trust across the ideological spectrum.&quot;

From 2019 through 2022, the &quot;Journal&quot; partnered with Facebook to provide content for the social-media site&#x27;s &quot;News Tab&quot;. Facebook paid the &quot;Journal&quot; in excess of $10 million during that period, terminating the relationship as part of a broader shift away from news content.

On June 13, 2022, the &quot;Journal&quot; launched a product review website called &quot;Buy Side&quot;. The website remains free and has a distinct team from the &quot;Journal&quot; newsroom.

In February 2024, the &quot;Journal&quot; laid off about 20 employees, primarily economics reporters based in Washington, D.C. Moving forward, those beats will be covered by the newspaper&#x27;s New York-based business team. The next month the paper laid off another five people from its standards and ethics team. In April, the paper laid off at least 11 people from its video and social media desks. In May, the &quot;Journal&quot; cut six editorial staff positions from its Hong Kong bureau and another two reporter jobs in Singapore. Moving forward the paper will shift its focus in the region from Hong Kong to Singapore with new the creation of several new jobs at that bureau. More staff were laid off a few weeks later amid further restructuring, including at least eight reporters.

&quot;WSJ.&quot; is &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s luxury lifestyle magazine. Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Sarah Ball is Editor in Chief and Omblyne Pelier is Publisher.

Launched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014. The magazine is inserted into the weekend U.S. edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and is available on WSJ.com and in the newspaper&#x27;s iPad app.

The editorials (titled &quot;Review &amp; Outlook&quot;) reflected &quot;The Journal&quot;″s conservative political editorial line, as did its regular columnists, who included Peggy Noonan, John Fund, and Daniel Henninger.

===&quot;WSJ Noted.&quot;===
On June 30, 2020, the &quot;Journal&quot; launched &quot;WSJ Noted.&quot;, a monthly digital &quot;news and culture&quot; magazine for subscribers aged 18–34 in a bid to attract a younger audience to the &quot;Journal&quot;. The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&amp;As with Noted staff.

==Editorial board==

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial board members oversee the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s editorial page, dictating the tone and direction of the newspaper&#x27;s opinion section. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.

Every Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page, appear on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Journal Editorial Report&quot;, where they discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (1958–1971) and Robert Bartley (1972–2000) provided a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.

Contrasts have been noted between the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s news reporting and its editorial pages. &quot;While &quot;Journal&quot; reporters keep busy informing readers,&quot; wrote one reporter in 1982, &quot;&quot;Journal&quot; editorial writers put forth views that often contradict the paper&#x27;s best reporting and news analysis.&quot; Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; criticized the &quot;Journal&quot; editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. One reference work in 2011 described the editorial pages as &quot;rigidly neoconservative&quot; while noting that the news coverage &quot;has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes&quot;.

In July 2020, more than 280 &quot;Journal&quot; journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages&#x27; &quot;lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence&quot;, adding that &quot;opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by &quot;WSJ&quot; reporting.&quot; The editorial board responded that its opinion pages &quot;won&#x27;t wilt under cancel-culture pressure&quot; and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the &quot;Journal&quot;″s news content and offer alternative views to &quot;the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today&#x27;s media.&quot; The board&#x27;s response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter.

===Editorial positions===
====Economic====
In the 1900s, the &quot;Journal&quot; supported the antitrust efforts of President Theodore Roosevelt. However, after the ownership change from Dow to Barron, the &quot;Journal&quot; became far more unequivocally supportive of free-market economics in the 1920s. One editorial in March 1928 criticized Congressional efforts to regulate the securities industry: &quot;People who know nothing about credit, surplus bank funds, collateral, call loans or anything else germane to the question profess to be terrified when the Stock Exchange loans attain the figure of $4 billion or more.&quot;

On April 14, 1932, the &quot;Journal&quot; published a commentary by former editor Thomas F. Woodlock criticizing the Glass–Steagall banking regulation bill: &quot;There are those who cannot endure the sight of autonomous securities markets beyond the control of legislatures, bureaucrats, and, in fact, of courts.&quot;

In the 1980s, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert L. Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.

In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the &quot;Journal&quot; has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates.

====Political====

The &quot;Journal&quot; editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles. Despite this, the &quot;Journal&quot; refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928.

The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.

The &quot;Journal&quot; editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill. The &quot;Journal&quot; editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s energy policies and foreign policy.

On October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia. In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller&#x27;s resignation. The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper&#x27;s credibility.

In October 2021, the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages. Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election. The next day, the editorial board published their own critique of Trump&#x27;s letter.

====Scientific====
The &quot;Journal&quot; editorial pages were described as a &quot;forum for climate change denial&quot; in 2011 due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud. A 2011 study found that the &quot;Journal&quot; was alone among major American print news media in how, mainly in its editorial pages, it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether. That year, the Associated Press described the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s editorial pages as &quot;a place friendly to climate change skeptics&quot;. In 2013, the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama&#x27;s plan to address climate change, mostly without mentioning climate science. A 2015 study found &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.

Climate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, determined that multiple opinion articles range between &quot;low&quot; and &quot;very low&quot; in terms of scientific credibility. The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in 2016 that 14% of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of &quot;mainstream climate science&quot;, while the majority did not. The Partnership also determined that none of the 201 editorials concerning climate change that were published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; since 1997 conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Journal&quot; published numerous opinion columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second-hand smoke, acid rain, and ozone depletion, in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos. The &quot;Journal&quot; later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful, a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments.

==Political views==
Its reporting has been described as &quot;small-c conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_10/25/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the &quot;Journal&quot; former reporters say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s purchase.

===Bias in news pages===
====Pre-Murdoch ownership====
The &quot;Journal&quot;″s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. According to CNN in 2007, the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.&quot; Ben Smith of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s news reporting as &quot;small-c [conservative]&quot;, and noted that its readership leans further to the right than that of other major newspapers.

Under the ownership of Clarence W. Barron, the &quot;Journal&quot; generally restricted editorializing to its opinion pages, but a 1922 series of news articles described the organized labor movement as having &quot;one of the most sordid records of humanity&quot;.

In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo argue the &quot;Journal&quot; news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of the &quot;Journal&quot; was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or &quot;The New York Times&quot;). The study did not factor in editorials. Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that &quot;the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.&quot; The authors assume that &quot;think tank ideology ... only matters to liberals.&quot;

The company&#x27;s planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion
about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1, 2007, editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to &quot;maintain the values and integrity of the &quot;Journal&quot;&quot;.

====During Trump presidency====
In 2016 and 2017, the &quot;Journal&quot; leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, who viewed the paper&#x27;s coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid. Particularly controversial was the &quot;Journal&quot;″s November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump&#x27;s false claim that &quot;millions of people&quot; had voted illegally in the election, only noting that the statement was &quot;without corroboration&quot;.

Also controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to &quot;Journal&quot; editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase &quot;seven majority-Muslim countries&quot; when writing about Trump&#x27;s executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note &quot;clarifying that there was &#x27;no ban on the phrase, &quot;but that the publication should &#x27;always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.

At a town-hall-style meeting with &quot;Journal&quot; staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper&#x27;s coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being &quot;dragged into the political process&quot; through a dispute with the Trump administration.

On February 19, 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporters based in Beijing. China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China&#x27;s efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible.

In June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the &quot;Journal&quot; sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance. The reporters stated that they &quot;frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources&#x27; credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities&quot;.

==Notable stories==
The &quot;Journal&quot; has won 38 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper&#x27;s best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.

===1939: World War I battleships===
In 1939, Vermont C. Royster wrote a series of articles showing the length of time required for World War I battleships to be ready for duty. One story summarized the process of manufacturing armor plates. The U.S. Navy accused Royster, then a Naval Reserve officer, of using classified information for his reporting. Royster said that he obtained the information from &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;.

===1952: Empire Mail Order===
In October 1952, the Chicago bureau of the &quot;Journal&quot; received a press release announcing that Howard Hughes sold his controlling interest in RKO Pictures to the Empire Mail Order Company. Managing editor Henry Gemmill led reporting efforts that resulted in articles in late 1952 exposing links between Empire Mail Order and organized crime. Following these stories, Hughes canceled the RKO sale. These stories also led to the first major industry award for the &quot;Journal&quot;, a Sigma Delta Chi public service award for these stories.

===1954: Automobile models===
On May 28, 1954, the &quot;Journal&quot; published a front-page story by John Williams revealing designs of 1955 automobiles by Ford, Pontiac, and other auto makers. Williams had talked to factory workers and auto executives for several weeks. The story revealed that the cars would have larger engines and wrap-around windshields. The inclusion of drawings was notable for being a rare use of graphics by the &quot;Journal&quot; of the time. Nearly a week later, General Motors canceled its nearly $250,000 in advertising with the &quot;Journal&quot;; GM president Harlow Curtice accused the &quot;Journal&quot; of copyright infringement and breach of confidentiality. Richard Tofel of ProPublica commented on this story in 2015: &quot;The little-remembered incident helped establish the notion that news organizations could and should preserve their independence from advertisers.&quot;

===1973: Spiro Agnew bribery===
On August 7, 1973, in an article by Jerry Landauer, the &quot;Journal&quot; was the first publication to report that U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew was under federal investigation on bribery, extortion, and tax fraud charges. Agnew released a statement confirming the investigation on the night before the &quot;Journal&quot; article was published. After pleading no contest to one charge of income tax evasion, Agnew was sentenced to a $10,000 fine and three-year suspended jail sentence. On the same day of his sentencing, Agnew resigned as vice president on October 10, 1973.

===1987: RJR Nabisco buyout===
In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen &quot;Journal&quot; articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, which was turned into a film for HBO.

===1988: Insider trading===
In the 1980s, then-&quot;Journal&quot; reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg, who went on to serve as the paper&#x27;s senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his 1991 book, &quot;Den of Thieves&quot;.

===1997: AIDS treatment===
David Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement. He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.

===2000: Enron===
Jonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000. Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly, and wrote a book, &quot;24 Days&quot;. In October 2021, the &quot;Journal&quot; released Bad Bets, a podcast that recounted the papers reporting on Enron.

===2001: 9/11===
The &quot;Journal&quot; claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper&#x27;s 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor&#x27;s home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones&#x27;s South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. The front page included a first-hand account of the Twin Towers&#x27; collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey. Holed up in a ninth-floor office next to the towers, he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the &quot;Journal&quot; offices and filling them with dust and debris. The &quot;Journal&quot; won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day&#x27;s stories.

The &quot;Journal&quot; subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, reporters Alan Cullison and Andrew Higgins bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated. It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed &quot;Journal&quot; reporter Daniel Pearl.

===2007: Stock option scandal===
In 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.

===2015–present: Theranos investigation===
In 2015, a report written by the &quot;Journal&quot; John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos&#x27; technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors. According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;a damning report published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham—that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors&#x27; equipment.&quot; The &quot;Journal&quot; has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos&#x27; and Holmes&#x27; credibility. In May 2018, Carreyrou released a book about Theranos, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. 

Rupert Murdoch—at the time a major investor in Theranos and owner of the &quot;Journal&quot;—lost approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos.

===2018–present: Investigation into Stormy Daniels payment===
On January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair. In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered. In April of that year, FBI agents stormed Cohen&#x27;s home, seizing records related to the transaction. On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment. The coverage earned the &quot;Journal&quot; the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.

===2021: Facebook company files leak===
==Controversies==
=== Hong Kong Journalists Association ===
In June 2024 Wall Street Journal editors learned that WSJ journalist Selina Cheng was a candidate for the leadership role, or chairperson, of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, the local press union. Cheng&#x27;s editor demanded that she withdraw from the election and from participation in the union. However, the right to stand for election and participate in a union without employer consent are established under Hong Kong employment law. Cheng did not withdraw and was elected to the leadership role.
In July 2024, Wall Street Journal chief editor Gordon Fairclough travelled to Hong Kong and fired her from her role at the WSJ. In response to press queries, the WSJ declined to comment on Cheng&#x27;s case except to acknowledge there had been &#x27;restructuring&#x27;. Cheng responded that the restructuring was a layoff of one person.

The WSJ&#x27;s action against Cheng attracted criticism from media organisations, press unions and Human Rights Proponents across the globe. Chinese state media, meanwhile, celebrated Cheng&#x27;s sacking, with the Chinese Communist Party-owned &quot;Global Times&quot; tabloid calling the press union &quot;a malignant tumour that harms the city&#x27;s safety and security&quot;. When Hong Kong&#x27;s Security Minister made a similar statement, Cheng responded that The Wall Street Journal fired her to avoid advocating press freedom in the city. In November 2024, Cheng filed a civil lawsuit in Hong Kong against the newspaper over her firing.

In February 2025, criminal proceedings against the WSJ began in Hong Kong.

In a series of articles on News Corp, Australian online news outlet Crikey described Cheng&#x27;s firing as part of &quot;turmoil&quot; at the WSJ and that &quot;the global purging of newsrooms is as much about creating a politically correct workforce of reliable journalistic cadres as it is about simply saving costs.&quot;

The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission annual report noted the significance of the event as demonstrating &quot;the pressures on foreign media to self-censor in line with the CCP’s requirements&quot;, and that the WSJ&#x27;s action &quot;calls into question claims that foreign businesses have been unaffected by the new atmosphere following the passage of the NSL and Article 23 Ordinance.&quot;

<doc id="173072" wikidata="Q29956617" url="?curid=173072" title="Growth hormone">
<text>Growth hormone (GH) or somatotropin, also known as human growth hormone (hGH or HGH) in its human form, is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in human development. GH also stimulates production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and increases the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to the receptors on certain types of cells. GH is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.

A recombinant form of HGH called somatropin (INN) is used as a prescription drug to treat children&#x27;s growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies by prescription from a licensed health care provider. In recent years in the United States, some health care providers are prescribing growth hormone in the elderly to increase vitality. While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial. Many of the functions of HGH remain unknown.

In its role as an anabolic agent, HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982 and has been banned by the IOC and NCAA. Traditional urine analysis does not detect doping with HGH, so the ban was not enforced until the early 2000s, when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by WADA at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, targeted primarily HGH. Use of the drug for performance enhancement is not currently approved by the FDA.

GH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in industrial agriculture and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production. These uses have been controversial. In the United States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called bovine somatotropin for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin.

==Nomenclature==

The names &quot;somatotropin&quot; (&quot;STH&quot;) or &quot;somatotropic hormone&quot; refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated &quot;hGH&quot;. The main growth hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology has the approved generic name (INN) &quot;somatropin&quot; and the brand name &quot;Humatrope&quot; and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992, Humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent and in this context is referred to as HGH.

The term &quot;growth hormone&quot; has been incorrectly applied to refer to anabolic sex hormones in the European beef hormone controversy, which initially restricts the use of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, zeranol, melengestrol acetate and trenbolone acetate.

==Biology==

===Gene===
Genes for human growth hormone, known as growth hormone 1 (somatotropin; pituitary growth hormone) and growth hormone 2 (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to human chorionic somatomammotropin (also known as placental lactogen) genes. GH, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and prolactin belong to a group of homologous hormones with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity.

===Structure===
The major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species, only human and Old World monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor.

Several molecular isoforms of GH exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood. In particular, a variant of approximately 20 kDa originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio, while recently an additional variant of ~ 23-24 kDa has also been reported in post-exercise states at higher proportions. This variant has not been identified, but it has been suggested to coincide with a 22 kDa glycosylated variant of 23 kDa identified in the pituitary gland. Furthermore, these variants circulate partially bound to a protein (growth hormone-binding protein, GHBP), which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor, and an acid-labile subunit (ALS). 

===Regulation===
Secretion of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus.
These cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or &quot;somatocrinin&quot;) and growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH or &quot;somatostatin&quot;) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary.
GH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion.

Somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete GH in a pulsatile manner, in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus.
The largest and most predictable of these GH peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 ng/mL.
Maximal secretion of GH may occur within minutes of the onset of slow-wave (SW) sleep (stage III or IV). Otherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals. Nearly fifty percent of GH secretion occurs during the third and fourth NREM sleep stages.
Surges of secretion during the day occur at 3- to 5-hour intervals. The plasma concentration of GH during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 ng/mL.
Between the peaks, basal GH levels are low, usually less than 5 ng/mL for most of the day and night. Additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of GH described in all cases less than 1 ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 ng/mL.

A number of factors are known to affect GH secretion, such as age, sex, diet, exercise, stress, and other hormones. Young adolescents secrete GH at the rate of about 700 μg/day, while healthy adults secrete GH at the rate of about 400 μg/day. Sleep deprivation generally suppresses GH release, particularly after early adulthood.

Stimulators of growth hormone (GH) secretion include:
* Peptide hormones
** GHRH (&quot;somatocrinin&quot;) through binding to the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR)
** Ghrelin through binding to growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHSR)
* Sex hormones
** Increased androgen secretion during puberty (in males from testes and in females from adrenal cortex)
** Testosterone and DHEA
** Estrogen
* Clonidine, moxonidine and L-DOPA by stimulating GHRH release
* α4β2 nicotinic agonists, including nicotine, which also act synergistically with clonidine or moxonidine.
* Hypoglycemia, arginine, pramipexole, ornitine, lysine, tryptophan, γ-Aminobutyric acid and propranolol by inhibiting somatostatin release
* Deep sleep
* Glucagon
* Sodium oxybate or γ-Hydroxybutyric acid
* Niacin as nicotinic acid (vitamin B3)
* Fasting
* Insulin
* Vigorous exercise

&quot;Inhibitors&quot; of GH secretion include:
* GHIH (&quot;somatostatin&quot;) from the periventricular nucleus 
* circulating concentrations of GH and IGF-1 (negative feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus)
* Hyperglycemia
* Glucocorticoids
* Dihydrotestosterone
* Phenothiazines

In addition to control by endogenous and stimulus processes, a number of foreign compounds (xenobiotics such as drugs and endocrine disruptors) are known to influence GH secretion and function.

===Function===
Effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic (building up). Like most other peptide hormones, GH acts by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of cells.

Increased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of GH. Height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms:

# Because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble, they cannot penetrate cell membranes. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage.
# GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.

In addition to increasing height in children and adolescents, growth hormone has many other effects on the body:
* Increases calcium retention, and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone
* Increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy
* Promotes lipolysis
* Increases protein synthesis
* Stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain
* Plays a role in homeostasis
* Reduces liver uptake of glucose
* Promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver
* Contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets
* Stimulates the immune system
* Increases deiodination of T4 to T3
* Induces insulin resistance

==Biochemistry==
GH has a short biological half-life of about 10 to 20 minutes.

The most common disease of GH excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. These somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly, gradually producing more and more GH. For years, the principal clinical problems are those of GH excess. Eventually, the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches, impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves, or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement.

Prolonged GH excess thickens the bones of the jaw, fingers and toes, resulting in heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits, referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.

GH-secreting tumors are typically recognized in the fifth decade of life. It is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood, but, when it does, the excessive GH can cause excessive growth, traditionally referred to as pituitary gigantism.

Surgical removal is the usual treatment for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like octreotide (somatostatin agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) can be used to block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.

===Deficiency===
The effects of growth hormone (GH) deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur. Alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin, or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin. Major manifestations of GH deficiency in children are growth failure, the development of a short stature, and delayed sexual maturity. In adults, somatomedin alteration contributes to increased osteoclast activity, resulting in weaker bones that are more prone to pathologic fracture and osteoporosis. However, deficiency is rare in adults, with the most common cause being a pituitary adenoma. Other adult causes include a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or trauma, and very rarely idiopathic GHD.

Adults with GHD &quot;tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life&quot;.

Diagnosis of GH deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process, usually culminating in GH stimulation tests to see if the patient&#x27;s pituitary gland will release a pulse of GH when provoked by various stimuli.

==Psychological effects==

===Quality of life===
Several studies, primarily involving patients with GH deficiency, have suggested a crucial role of GH in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level. Adults with GH deficiency often have higher rates of depression than those without. While GH replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of GH deficiency, the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown.

===Cognitive function===
GH has also been studied in the context of cognitive function, including learning and memory. GH in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of GH deficiency.

==Medical uses==
===Replacement therapy===
GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, benefits have variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being. Long acting growth hormone (LAGH) analogues are now available for treating growth hormone deficiency both in children and adults. These are once weekly injections as compared to conventional growth hormone which has to be taken as daily injections. LAGH injection 4 times a month has been found to be as safe and effective as daily growth hormone injections.

===Other approved uses===
GH can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH. Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are Turner syndrome, Growth failure secondary to chronic kidney disease in children, Prader–Willi syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, and severe idiopathic short stature. Higher (&quot;pharmacologic&quot;) doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal (&quot;physiologic&quot;).

One version of rHGH has also been FDA approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to AIDS.

===Off-label use===
Off-label prescription of HGH is controversial and may be illegal.

Claims for GH as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published a study wherein GH was used to treat 12 men over 60. At the conclusion of the study, all the men showed statistically significant increases in lean body mass and bone mineral density, while the control group did not. The authors of the study noted that these improvements were the opposite of the changes that would normally occur over a 10- to 20-year aging period. Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti-aging agent. This has led to organizations such as the controversial American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine promoting the use of this hormone as an &quot;anti-aging agent&quot;.

A Stanford University School of Medicine meta-analysis of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of GH on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2 kg and decreased body fat by the same amount. However, these were the only positive effects from taking GH. No other critical factors were affected, such as bone density, cholesterol levels, lipid measurements, maximal oxygen consumption, or any other factor that would indicate increased fitness. Researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength, which led them to believe that GH merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth. This would explain the increase in lean body mass.

GH has also been used experimentally to treat multiple sclerosis, to enhance weight loss in obesity, as well as in fibromyalgia, heart failure, Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis, and burns. GH has also been used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total parenteral nutrition.

In 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the Crime Control Act of 1990, that amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances and added a new section that stated that a person who &quot;knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services&quot; has committed a felony.

The Drug Enforcement Administration of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH. This section has also been interpreted by some doctors, most notably the authors of a commentary article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005, as meaning that &quot;prescribing&quot; HGH off-label may be considered illegal. And some articles in the popular press, such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use (with concern of ethics violations) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe HGH off-label: &quot;Unlike other prescription drugs, HGH may be prescribed only for specific uses. U.S. sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands.&quot; At the same time, anti-aging clinics where doctors prescribe, administer, and sell HGH to people are big business. In a 2012 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, when asked how HGH prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients estimated to have HGH-deficiency, Dragos Roman, who leads a team at the FDA that reviews drugs in endocrinology, said &quot;The F.D.A. doesn&#x27;t regulate off-label uses of H.G.H. Sometimes it&#x27;s used appropriately. Sometimes it&#x27;s not.&quot;

===Side effects===
Injection site reactions are common. More rarely, patients can experience joint swelling, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and an increased risk of diabetes. In some cases, the patient can produce an immune response against GH. GH may also be a risk factor for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

One survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver GH (which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established.

==Performance enhancement==
The first description of the use of GH as a doping agent was Dan Duchaine&#x27;s &quot;Underground Steroid handbook&quot; which emerged from California in 1982; it is not known where and when GH was first used this way.

Athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance. Some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes. Many athletic societies ban the use of GH and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it. However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor.

==Dietary supplements==
To capitalize on the idea that GH might be useful to combat aging, companies selling dietary supplements have websites selling products linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as &quot;HGH Releasers&quot;. Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements, it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations.

==Agricultural use==
In the United States, it is legal to give a bovine GH to dairy cows to increase milk production, and is legal to use GH in raising cows for beef; see article on Bovine somatotropin, cattle feeding, dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy.

The use of GH in poultry farming is illegal in the United States. Similarly, no chicken meat for sale in Australia is administered hormones.

Several companies have attempted to have a version of GH for use in pigs (porcine somatotropin) approved by the FDA but all applications have been withdrawn.

==Drug development history==

Genentech pioneered the use of recombinant human growth hormone for human therapy, which was approved by the FDA in 1985.

Prior to its production by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers. Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed. Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy to the treatment of idiopathic short stature. Very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an Old World monkey, the rhesus macaque, were conducted by John C. Beck and colleagues in Montreal, in the late 1950s. The study published in 1957, which was conducted on &quot;a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma,&quot; found that: &quot;Human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage ... (and) there was a retention of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium. ... There was a gain in body weight during both periods. ... There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone. This was most marked with the human growth hormone. ... Impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone. No change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone.&quot; The other study, published in 1958, was conducted on six people: the same subject as the Science paper; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years; a 15-year-old female with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a craniopharyngioma; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases; a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.

In 1985, unusual cases of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were found in individuals that had received cadaver-derived HGH ten to fifteen years previously. Based on the assumption that infectious prions causing the disease were transferred along with the cadaver-derived HGH, cadaver-derived HGH was removed from the market.

In 1985, biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the U.S. and elsewhere.

As of 2005, recombinant growth hormones available in the United States (and their manufacturers) included Nutropin (Genentech), Humatrope (Lilly), Genotropin (Pfizer), Norditropin (Novo), and Saizen (Merck Serono). In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a version of rHGH called Omnitrope (Sandoz). A sustained-release form of growth hormone, Nutropin Depot (Genentech and Alkermes) was approved by the FDA in 1999, allowing for fewer injections (every 2 or 4 weeks instead of daily); however, the product was discontinued by Genentech/Alkermes in 2004 for financial reasons (Nutropin Depot required significantly more resources to produce than the rest of the Nutropin line).

<doc id="173075" wikidata="Q1488729" url="?curid=173075" title="Moruya, New South Wales">
<text>Moruya ( ) is a town located on the far south coast of New South Wales, Australia, situated on the Moruya River. The Princes Highway runs through the town that is about south of Sydney and from Canberra. At the , Moruya had a population of 4,295. Its built-up area had a population of 2,762. The town relies predominantly on agriculture, aquaculture, and tourism. Moruya is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire Council and the shire chambers are located in the town.

==History==

The South Coast region of New South Wales is the traditional home of the Yuin people, with the area in and around Moruya home to the Bugelli-Manji clan.

The name &quot;Moruya&quot; is derived from an Aboriginal Tharawal word (&quot;&quot;) believed to mean &quot;home of the black swan&quot;, although this is not probable and not verifiable. Black swans can be seen in the lakes and rivers around Moruya, and the black swan is used locally as an emblem.

European settlement commenced in the 1820s following the extension of the limits of location in 1829, although the coast from Batemans Bay to Moruya was surveyed the previous year by surveyor Thomas Florance. The first European settler was Francis Flanagan, a tailor from Ireland, who was granted title to on the north bank of the river at Shannon View in 1829. In 1830, the next settler, John Hawdon, set up a squat at Bergalia, but being beyond the limits, could not gain title to the land. In 1831, though, he was granted land on the north bank of the river, upstream from Flanagan. He called the property Kiora, and it also occupied . A village named after the property soon grew.

In 1835, across the river from Flanagan, William Morris squatted a block he called Gundary. William Campbell took up as a manager there and eventually bought the place himself in 1845. The town centre was surveyed in 1850 by surveyor Parkinson and the town was gazetted in 1851. It centred about the track opposite where the road from Broulee terminated at the river bank, the two being linked by a punt. As a blacksmith was on that track, it was named Vulcan Street. Campbell Street owed its name to the squatter, Queen Street to patriotism, and Church Street to the Catholic Church&#x27;s presence there; a Catholic church was later completed in 1887. Land sales commenced in 1852.
Moruya was proclaimed a municipality in 1891. Local industries were timber logging, gold mining, dairying, and quarrying for granite. The first bridge across the Moruya River was erected in 1876, though frequent flooding caused new bridges to be erected in 1900, 1945, and most recently in 1966.

During World War II, Moruya aerodrome was used as an advanced operational base by the RAAF. The fishing trawler &quot;Dureenbee&quot; was attacked offshore between Moruya and Batemans Bay by a Japanese submarine on 3 August 1942, leading to the deaths of three merchant seamen who are buried in Moruya cemetery. A &quot;bush memorial&quot; has been dedicated to these sailors and 8 other airmen who were killed whilst operating out of Moruya Aerodrome during the war. The memorial is located at the site of the wartime airstrip.

On 25 December 1944, the US liberty ship USS &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot; was torpedoed off Moruya by the German submarine &quot;U-862&quot;, sinking the next day between Moruya and Bega. Casualties were two dead, with 67 survivors.

Rural areas around Moruya were affected by the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.

== Heritage listings ==
Moruya has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Moruya and District Historical Society, 85 Campbell Street: Abernethy and Co Stonemason&#x27;s Lathe
* 13 Page Street: Moruya Mechanics&#x27; Institute

==Moruya granite==

Moruya is known for its granite stone that was used to build significant Australian landmarks, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The granite used in the Harbour Bridge pylons was quarried in the area. The proximity of the quarries to the water meant it could be easily transported to Sydney. Quarrying for granite commenced in the district in the late 1850s by brothers Joseph and John Flett Louttit, who were from the Orkney Islands. Their quarry on the south side of the river produced stone for many Sydney landmarks, including the columns of the General Post Office in Martin Place, and the base of the Captain Cook statue in Hyde Park.
The Moruya Quarry, also known as the Government Quarry, opened in 1876 on the northern bank of the Moruya River. From 1925 to 1932, the Harbour Bridge works had 250 stonemasons employed and relocated to Moruya by the contractor to produce of dimension stone for the bridge pylons, 173,000 blocks, and 200,000 yards of crushed stone that was used as aggregate for concrete. Moruya granite was also used for the Sydney Cenotaph in Martin Place. During the seven years of this work, a small town of about 70 houses grew up near the quarry called Granitetown; little remains of the town today. The quarry had a tramway that closed in 1931. The wharf that was used by the quarry stood until around 2008, but was pulled down and replaced by a fishing platform. 

The Moruya Quarry is operated by the New South Wales Department of Infrastructure, Planning, and Natural Resources. A third quarry west of the Moruya Quarry was operated by the Ziegler family.

== Retail ==
Moruya has various retailers, banks, and services located on the high street, whilst supermarkets are located on the side streets. Harris Scarfe has a store in the town, it being a former branch of Goulburn retailer Allen&#x27;s. Moruya has two supermarkets; one is a 10-aisle Woolworths (opened in 2000) and an IGA (opened in 2013). The former eight-aisle Franklins, which opened on 28 June 2011, ceased trading in February 2013. 

Moruya is also home to the regional telecommunications company, Southern Phone. The Tuesday afternoon and Saturday markets and fruit and vegetable markets are popular with local people and visitors.

==Landmarks==
Moruya Airport (code MYA) is located on the north side of Moruya Heads. The strip adjoins the beachfront, and flights to Moruya offer a slow and picturesque descent along the coastline. Rex Airlines flies mostly Saab 340B aircraft from Moruya to Sydney and Moruya to Merimbula, with connecting flights to Melbourne.

==Climate==
Moruya has a mild oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm, wet summers and cool, moderately drier winters. The drier winters are owed to the foehn effect from the Great Dividing Range, which blocks rainfall from the westerly cold fronts that arrive from the Southern Ocean. The town features 121.2 clear days annually.

<text>Starwisp is a hypothetical unmanned interstellar probe design proposed by the late Robert L. Forward. It is propelled by a microwave sail, similar to a solar sail in concept, but powered by microwaves from a human-made source. It would fly through the target system without slowing down.

== Description ==

&quot;Starwisp&quot; is a concept for an ultra-low-mass interstellar probe pushed by a microwave beam. It was proposed by scientist and author Robert L. Forward in 1985, and further work was published by Geoffrey A. Landis in 2000. The proposed device uses beam-powered propulsion in the form of a high-power microwave antenna pushing a sail. The probe itself would consist of a mesh of extremely fine carbon wires about 100 m across, with the wires spaced the same distance apart as the 3 mm wavelength of the microwaves that will be used to push it.

Forward proposed that the wires would incorporate nanoscale computer circuitry, sensors, microwave power collection systems and microwave radio transmitters fabricated on the wire surfaces, giving the probe data collection and transmission capability. Being distributed across the entire sail, no &quot;rigging&quot; is needed, as would be the case if the mission electronics were placed in a separate probe that was pulled by the sail.

The original Starwisp concept assumed that the microwaves would be efficiently reflected, with the wire mesh surface acting as a superconductor and nearly perfectly efficient mirror. This assumption is not valid. Landis showed that a grid will absorb a significant fraction of the power incident on it, and therefore cannot stay cool enough to be superconducting. The design is thermally limited, hence the use of carbon as the material in Landis&#x27;s concept. 

Low mass was the key feature of the Starwisp probe. In Landis&#x27;s calculations, the mesh has a density of only 100 kg/km2, for a total mass of 1 kg, plus a payload of 80 grams.

Although the diffraction limit severely constrains the range of the transmitting antenna, the probe is designed to have an acceleration of 24 m/s2, so that it can reach a significant fraction of the speed of light within a very short distance, before passing out of range. The antenna uses a microwave lens 560 km in diameter, would transmit 56 GW of power, and would accelerate the probe to 10% of the speed of light.

The probe would cruise without power for decades until it finally approached the target star, at which point the antenna which launched it would again target its beam on Starwisp. This would be done when the Starwisp was about 80% of the way to its destination, so that the beam and Starwisp would arrive there at the same time. At such extreme long range the antenna would be unable to provide any propulsion, but Starwisp would be able to use its wire sail to collect and convert some of the microwave energy into electricity to operate its sensors and transmit the data it collects back home. Starwisp would not slow down at the target star, performing a high-speed flyby mission instead.

Since the antenna is only required for a few days at Starwisp&#x27;s launch and again for another few days several decades later to power it while it passes its target, Starwisp probes might be mass-produced and launched by the maser every few days. In this manner, a continuous stream of data could be collected about distant solar systems even though any given Starwisp probe only spends a few days travelling through it. Alternatively, the launching transmitter could be used in the interim to transmit power to Earth for commercial use, as with a solar power satellite.

==Possible methods of fabrication==
Constructing such a delicate probe would be a significant challenge. One proposed method would be to &quot;paint&quot; the probe and its circuitry onto an enormous sheet of plastic which degrades when exposed to ultraviolet light, and then wait for the sheet to evaporate away under the assault of solar UV after it has been deployed in space.

Another proposed method noted that the Starwisp probe wires were of the same physical scale as wires and circuit elements on modern computer microchips and could be produced by the same photolithographic fabrication technologies as those of computer chips. The probe would have to be built in sections the size of current chip fabrication silicon wafers and then connected together.

== Technical problems ==

A major problem this design would face would be the radiation encountered en route. Travelling at 20% of light speed, ordinary interstellar hydrogen would become a significant radiation hazard, and the Starwisp would be without shielding and likely without active self-repair capability. Another problem would be keeping the acceleration of the Starwisp uniform enough across its sail area so that its delicate wires would not tear or be twisted out of shape. Distorting the shape of the Starwisp even slightly could result in a runaway catastrophe, since one portion of the Starwisp would be reflecting microwaves in a different direction than the other portion and be thrust even farther out of shape. Such delicate and finely-balanced control may prove impossible to realize.

The possibility of using a dusty plasma sail in which a dusty substance that is maintained as a plasma within space is responsible for the reflection of electromagnetic radiation could circumvent problems associated with radiation damage to the medium responsible for the transfer of radiation pressure (the dusty plasma sail might not be as easy to damage as a thin film or the like). Dusty plasma sails can also adapt their three-dimensional structure in real time to ensure reflection perpendicular to any incident light/microwave beam.

==In fiction==
*In a science fiction story Forward suggested that the beam from a solar power satellite could be used to push a Starwisp probe while the solar power satellite was being tested after construction.

<doc id="173082" wikidata="Q202878" url="?curid=173082" title="Mae West">
<text>Mary Jane &quot;Mae&quot; West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress, singer, comedian, screenwriter, and playwright whose career spanned over seven decades. Considered a sex symbol, she was known for her breezy sexual independence and her lighthearted bawdy double entendres, often delivered in a husky contralto voice. She was active in vaudeville and on stage in New York City before moving to Los Angeles to begin a career in the film industry.

West was one of the most controversial movie stars of her day; she encountered problems especially with censorship. She once quipped, &quot;I believe in censorship. I made a fortune out of it.&quot; She bucked the studio system by making comedy out of conventional beliefs, and the Depression-era audience admired her for it. When her film career ended, she wrote books and plays, continued to perform in Las Vegas and London and on radio and television, and recorded rock and roll albums. In 1999, the American Film Institute posthumously voted her the 15th-greatest female screen legend of classic American cinema.

==Early life==
Mary Jane West was born in either the Greenpoint or Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn on August 17, 1893, before New York City was consolidated. She was delivered at home by an aunt who was a midwife. She was the eldest surviving child of Mathilde Delker (originally &quot;Doelger&quot; and later Americanized to &quot;Delker&quot; or &quot;Dilker&quot;) West, a corset and fashion model, and John Patrick &quot;Battlin&#x27; Jack&quot; West, a prizefighter who later worked as a &quot;special policeman&quot; and created his own private investigations agency. Her German-born mother, who went by the nicknames &quot;Tillie&quot; and &quot;Matilda&quot;, had emigrated from Bavaria in 1886 with her five siblings and their parents, Christiana (née Brüning) and Jakob Doelger. Her paternal grandmother after whom she was named, Mary Jane (née Copley), was of Irish descent. Her paternal grandfather, John Edwin West, was of English and Scottish descent.

West&#x27;s parents married in Brooklyn on January 18, 1889, to the pleasure of the groom&#x27;s parents and the displeasure of the bride&#x27;s, and raised their children as Protestants. Her eldest sister, Katie, died in infancy. Her remaining siblings were a sister named Mildred Katherine &quot;Beverly&quot; West and a brother named John Edwin West II (sometimes inaccurately called &quot;John Edwin West, Jr.&quot;). During her childhood, the family moved to various parts of Woodhaven, Queens, as well as the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn. At Neir&#x27;s Social Hall in Woodhaven, West supposedly first performed professionally.

==Career==
===Beginning of stage career===

West was five when she first entertained a crowd at a church social, and she started appearing in amateur shows at the age of seven. She often won prizes at local talent contests. She began performing professionally in vaudeville in the Hal Clarendon Stock Company in 1907 at the age of 14. As a young child, West had first performed under the stage name &quot;Baby Mae&quot; (&quot;the baby may behave like this&quot;), and a bit later tried various personas, including a male impersonator.

She used the alias &quot;Jane Mast&quot; early in her career. Her trademark walk was said to have been inspired or influenced by female impersonators Bert Savoy and Julian Eltinge, who were famous during the Pansy Craze. Her first appearance in a Broadway show, at age 18, was in a 1911 revue &quot;A La Broadway&quot; put on by her former dancing teacher, Ned Wayburn. The show folded after eight performances, but West was discovered and singled out for praise by a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer, who wrote that a &quot;girl named Mae West, hitherto unknown, pleased by her grotesquerie and snappy way of singing and dancing&quot;. West next appeared in a show called &quot;Vera Violetta&quot;, whose cast featured Al Jolson. In 1912, she appeared in the opening performance of &quot;A Winsome Widow&quot; as a &quot;baby vamp&quot; named La Petite Daffy.
West developed her career in vaudeville, appearing in such circuits (or &quot;wheels&quot;) as that run by Gus Sun of Ohio, which was considered bottom of the barrel but gave her experience. She was encouraged as a performer by her mother, who, according to West, always thought that anything Mae did was fantastic. Other family members were less encouraging, including an aunt and her paternal grandmother. They are all reported as having disapproved of her career and her choices. In 1918, after exiting several high-profile revues, West finally got her break in the Shubert Brothers revue &quot;Sometime&quot;, opposite Ed Wynn. Her character Mayme danced the shimmy and her photograph appeared on an edition of the sheet music for the popular number &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Shimmies Now&quot;.

===Broadway stardom and jail===
Eventually, West began writing her own risqué plays using the pen name Jane Mast. Her first starring role on Broadway was in a 1926 play entitled &quot;Sex&quot;, which she wrote, produced, and directed. Although conservative critics panned the show, ticket sales were strong. The production did not go over well with city officials, who had received complaints from some religious groups, and the theater was raided and West arrested along with the cast. She was taken to the Jefferson Market Court House (now Jefferson Market Library), where she was prosecuted on morals charges, and on April 19, 1927, was sentenced to 10 days for &quot;corrupting the morals of youth&quot;. Though West could have paid a fine and been let off, she chose the jail sentence for the publicity it would garner. While incarcerated on Welfare Island (now known as Roosevelt Island), she dined with the warden and his wife; she told reporters that she had worn her silk panties while serving time, in lieu of the &quot;burlap&quot; the other girls had to wear. West got great mileage from this jail stint. She served eight days with two days off for &quot;good behavior&quot;. Following her release, West told reporters that her play was &quot;a work of art&quot;. Media attention surrounding the incident enhanced her career, by crowning her the darling &quot;bad girl&quot; who &quot;had climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong&quot;.

Her next play, &quot;The Drag&quot;, dealt with homosexuality, and was what West called one of her &quot;comedy-dramas of life&quot;. After a series of try-outs in Connecticut and New Jersey, West announced she would open the play in New York. However, &quot;The Drag&quot; never opened on Broadway, owing to efforts by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to ban any attempt by West to stage it. West explained, &quot;The city fathers begged me not to bring the show to New York because they were not equipped to handle the commotion it would cause.&quot; West was an early supporter of the women&#x27;s liberation movement, but said she was not a &quot;burn your bra&quot; type of feminist. Since the 1920s, she was also an early supporter of gay rights, and publicly declared against the police brutality that gay men experienced. She adopted a then &quot;modern&quot; psychological explanation that gay men were women&#x27;s souls in men&#x27;s bodies, and hitting a gay man was akin to hitting a woman. In her 1959 autobiography &quot;Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It&quot;, a memoir compiled by ghostwriter Stephen Longstreet, West strongly objects to hypocrisy while also disparaging homosexuality:

This perspective, never elaborated upon by West in other books or interviews, seems inconsistent with the Mae West persona, for in her 1975 book &quot;Mae West: Sex, Health, and ESP&quot;, writing:

Between the late 1920s and early 1930s, West continued to write plays, including &quot;The Wicked Age&quot;, &quot;Pleasure Man&quot;, and &quot;The Constant Sinner&quot;. Her productions predictably aroused controversy, which ensured that she stayed in the news and often resulted in packed houses at her performances. Her 1928 play &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;, a story about a racy, easygoing, and ultimately very smart lady of the 1890s, became a Broadway hit and cemented West&#x27;s image in the public&#x27;s eye. This show had an enduring popularity and West successfully revived it many times throughout the course of her career.

Three years after the initial success of &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;, West portrayed another sexually charged character, Babe Gordon, in &quot;The Constant Sinner&quot;, which opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on September 14, 1931. The influential drama critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, J. Brooks Atkinson, was among many reviewers at the time who bashed the play&#x27;s storyline as well as West&#x27;s performance. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;scathing&quot; assessment of her three-act production was published in &quot;The Times&quot; the day after the dramedy&#x27;s premiere:

Other prominent reviewers in 1931, like Atkinson, roundly criticized the stage production, calling it a &quot;clumsy drama&quot;, &quot;deliberately outlandish&quot;, and labeling West herself as an &quot;atrocious playwright&quot;. Ultimately, the elaborate play closed on Broadway after just eight weeks and 64 performances. When compared to &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;, which had run for nine months with 323 performances, &quot;The Constant Sinner&quot; was critically, financially, and personally a disappointment for West. Nevertheless, its notoriety and even its negative reviews further enhanced her public image as a daring, sensational performer and brought her additional widespread media attention. During that time, in the months after the play closed, West decided to put her stage career on hold and to accept a short-term, but lucrative, contract offer from Paramount Pictures to perform in a feature film in Hollywood.

===Motion pictures and censorship===

In June 1932, after signing a two-month contract with Paramount that provided her a weekly salary of $5,000 ($110,000 in 2023), West left New York by train for California. The veteran stage performer was by then nearly 40 years old, an unusually late age to begin a film career, especially for women, although Paramount certainly never had the slightest intention of casting her as an ingénue. She nonetheless managed to keep her age ambiguous for some time. She made her film debut in the role of Maudie Triplett in &quot;Night After Night&quot; (1932) starring George Raft, who had suggested West for the part. She did not like her small supporting role in the drama at first, but was appeased when she was allowed to rewrite portions of her character&#x27;s dialogue. One of several revisions she made is in her first scene in &quot;Night After Night&quot;, when a hat-check girl exclaims, &quot;Goodness, what beautiful diamonds&quot;, and West replies, &quot;Goodness had nothing to do with it, dearie.&quot; Reflecting on the overall result of her rewritten scenes, Raft is reported to have said, &quot;She stole everything but the cameras.&quot;

For her next role for Paramount, West brought her &quot;Diamond Lil&quot; character, now renamed &quot;Lady Lou&quot;, to the screen in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; (1933). The film was one of Cary Grant&#x27;s early major roles, which boosted his career. West claimed she spotted Grant at the studio and insisted that he be cast as the male lead. She claimed to have told a Paramount director, &quot;If he can talk, I&#x27;ll take him!&quot; The film was a box office hit and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The success of the film saved Paramount from bankruptcy, grossing over $2 million, the equivalent of $46 million in 2023. Paramount recognizes that debt of gratitude today, with a building on the lot named after West.

Her next release, &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1933), teamed her again with Grant. The film was also a box-office hit and was the most successful of her entire screen career. In the months after its release, references to West could be found almost everywhere, from the song lyrics of Cole Porter, to a Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural of San Francisco&#x27;s newly built Coit Tower, to &quot;She Done Him Right&quot;, a Pooch the Pup cartoon, to &quot;My Dress Hangs There&quot;, a painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Kahlo&#x27;s husband, Diego Rivera, paid his own tribute: &quot;West is the most wonderful machine for living I have ever known—unfortunately on the screen only.&quot; To F. Scott Fitzgerald, West was especially unique: &quot;The only Hollywood actress with both an ironic edge and a comic spark.&quot; As &quot;Variety&quot; put it, &quot;Mae West&#x27;s films have made her the biggest conversation-provoker, free-space grabber, and all-around box office bet in the country. She&#x27;s as hot an issue as Hitler.&quot;

By 1933, West was one of the largest box-office draws in the United States and, by 1935, she was also the highest paid woman and the second-highest paid person in the United States (after William Randolph Hearst). Hearst invited West to Hearst Castle, his massive estate in San Simeon, California, where Hollywood celebrities and prominent political and business figures frequently gathered to socialize. &quot;I could&#x27;a married him,&quot; West later commented, &quot;but I got no time for parties. I don&#x27;t like those big crowds.&quot; On July 1, 1934, the censorship guidelines of the film industry&#x27;s Production Code began to be meticulously enforced. As a result, West&#x27;s scripts were subjected to more editing. She, in turn, would often intentionally place extremely risqué lines in her scripts, knowing they would be cut by the censors. She hoped they would then not object as much to her other less suggestive lines. Her next film was &quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot; (1934). The original title, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t No Sin&quot;, was changed because of censors&#x27; objections. Despite Paramount&#x27;s early objections regarding costs, West insisted the studio hire Duke Ellington and his orchestra to accompany her in the film&#x27;s musical numbers. Their collaboration was a success; the classic &quot;My Old Flame&quot; (recorded by Duke Ellington) was introduced in this film. Her next film, &quot;Goin&#x27; to Town&quot; (1935), received mixed reviews, as censorship continued to take its toll by preventing West from including her best lines.

Her following effort, &quot;Klondike Annie&quot; (1936), dealt, as best it could given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her magnum opus, but not everyone agreed. Press baron and film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an off-handed remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, &quot;That Mae West picture &quot;Klondike Annie&quot; is a filthy picture... We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount... DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE.&quot; At one point, Hearst asked aloud, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?&quot; Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization or face further recrimination. &quot;I was the first liberated woman, you know. No guy was going to get the best of me. That&#x27;s what I wrote all my scripts about.&quot;

Around the same time, West played opposite Randolph Scott in &quot;Go West, Young Man&quot; (1936). In this film, she adapted Lawrence Riley&#x27;s Broadway hit &quot;Personal Appearance&quot; into a screenplay. Directed by Henry Hathaway, &quot;Go West, Young Man&quot; is considered one of West&#x27;s weaker films of the era, because of the censor&#x27;s cuts.

West next starred in &quot;Every Day&#x27;s a Holiday&quot; (1937) for Paramount before their association came to an end. The film performed below its goal. Censorship had made West&#x27;s sexually suggestive brand of humor impossible for the studios to distribute. West, along with other stellar performers, was put on a list of actors called &quot;Box Office Poison&quot; by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners Association. Others on the list were Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire, Dolores del Río, Katharine Hepburn and Kay Francis. The attack was published as a paid advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and was taken seriously by the fearful studio executives. The association argued that these stars&#x27; high salaries and extreme public popularity did not affect their ticket sales, thus hurt the exhibitors. This did not stop producer David O. Selznick, who next offered West the role of the sage madam Belle Watling, the only woman ever to truly understand Rhett Butler, in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, after Tallulah Bankhead rejected the role. West also turned down the part, claiming it was too small for an established star and that she would need to rewrite her lines to suit her own persona. The role eventually went to Ona Munson.

In 1939, Universal Studios approached West to star in a film opposite W. C. Fields. The studio was eager to duplicate the success of &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, with a comic vehicle starring West and Fields. Having left Paramount 18 months earlier and looking for a new film, West accepted the role of Flower Belle Lee in the film &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; (1940). Despite the stars&#x27; intense mutual dislike, Fields&#x27;s very real drinking problems and fights over the screenplay, &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; was a box office hit, outgrossing Fields&#x27;s previous film, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot; (1939) and the later &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; (1940). Despite this, religious leaders condemned West as a negative role model, taking offense at lines such as &quot;When I&#x27;m caught between two evils, I generally like to take the one I never tried&quot;.

West&#x27;s next film was Columbia Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot; (1943). Initially, she did not want to do the film, but after actor, director and friend Gregory Ratoff (producer Max Fabian in &quot;All About Eve&quot;) pleaded with her and claimed he would go bankrupt if she could not help, West relented as a personal favor. Censors curtailed the sexual burlesque of the West characterization. The studio had orders to raise the neck lines and clean up the double entendres. This was the only film for which West was virtually not allowed to write her own dialogue and, as a result, the film suffered.

Perhaps the most critical, ongoing challenge facing West in her career was censorship of her dialogue. As on Broadway a decade before, by the mid-1930s her risqué and ribald dialogue could no longer be allowed. &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot; opened to poor reviews and weak performance at the box office. West was so distraught after the experience and by her years of struggling with the strict Hays Code censorship office, that she would not attempt another film role for the next quarter-century. Instead, West pursued a successful and record-breaking career in top nightclubs, Las Vegas, nationally in theater and on Broadway, where she was allowed, even welcomed, to be herself.

===Radio and censorship===
On December 12, 1937, West appeared in two separate sketches on ventriloquist Edgar Bergen&#x27;s radio show &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;. Appearing as herself, West flirted with Charlie McCarthy, Bergen&#x27;s dummy, using her usual brand of wit and risqué sexual references. West referred to Charlie as &quot;all wood and a yard long&quot; and commented, &quot;Charles, I remember our last date, and have the splinters to prove it!&quot; West was on the verge of being banned from radio.

More outrageous still was an NBC sketch written by Arch Oboler, starring Don Ameche and West as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. She tells Ameche to &quot;get me a big one... I feel like doin&#x27; a big apple!&quot; This ostensible reference to the then-current dance craze was one of the many double entendres in the dialogue. Days after the broadcast, the studio received letters calling the show &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot;. Several conservative women&#x27;s clubs and religious groups admonished the show&#x27;s sponsor, Chase &amp; Sanborn Coffee Company, for &quot;prostituting&quot; their services for allowing &quot;impurity [to] invade the air&quot;.

Under pressure, the Federal Communications Commission later deemed the broadcast &quot;vulgar and indecent&quot; and &quot;far below even the minimum standard which should control in the selection and production of broadcast programs&quot;. Some debate existed regarding the reaction to the skit. Conservative religious groups took umbrage far more swiftly than the mainstream. These groups found it easy to make West their target. They took exception to her outspoken use of sexuality and sexual imagery, which she had employed in her career since at least the pre-Code films of the early 1930s and for decades before on Broadway, but which was now being broadcast into American living rooms on a popular family-friendly radio program. The groups reportedly warned the sponsor of the program they would protest her appearance.

NBC Radio scapegoated West for the incident and banned her (and the mention of her name) from their stations. West would not perform in radio for a dozen years, until January 1950, in an episode of &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;, which was hosted by Perry Como. Ameche&#x27;s career did not suffer any serious repercussions, however, as he was playing the &quot;straight&quot; guy. Nonetheless, Mae West went on to enjoy a record-breaking success in Las Vegas, swank nightclubs such as Lou Walters&#x27;s The Latin Quarter, Broadway, and London.

===Middle years===

After appearing in &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot; in 1943, West returned to a very active career on stage and in clubs. Among her popular new stage performances was the title role in &quot;Catherine Was Great&quot; (1944) on Broadway, in which she penned a spoof on the story of Catherine the Great of Russia, surrounding herself with an &quot;imperial guard&quot; of tall, muscular young actors. The play was produced by theater and film impresario Mike Todd (&quot;Around The World in 80 Days&quot;) and ran for 191 performances and then went on tour.

When Mae West revived her 1928 play &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;, bringing it back to Broadway in 1949, &quot;The New York Times&quot; labeled her an &quot;American Institution—as beloved and indestructible as Donald Duck. Like Chinatown, and Grant&#x27;s Tomb, Mae West should be seen at least once.&quot; In the 1950s, West starred in her own Las Vegas stage show at the newly opened Sahara Hotel, singing while surrounded by bodybuilders. The show stood Las Vegas on its head. &quot;Men come to see me, but I also give the women something to see: wall to wall men!&quot; West explained. Jayne Mansfield met and later married one of West&#x27;s muscle men, former Mr. Universe Mickey Hargitay.

When casting for the role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, Billy Wilder offered West the role. Still smarting from the censorship debacle of &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot;, and the constraints placed on her characterization, she declined. The theme of the Wilder film, she noted, was pure pathos, while her brand of comedy was always &quot;about uplifting the audience&quot;. Mae West had a unique comic character that was timeless, the same as Charlie Chaplin. After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast.

In subsequent years, West was offered the role of Vera Simpson, opposite Frank Sinatra, in the 1957 film adaptation of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, which she turned down, with the role going to Rita Hayworth. In 1964, West was offered a leading role in &quot;Roustabout&quot;, starring Elvis Presley. She turned the role down, and Barbara Stanwyck was cast in her place. West was also approached for roles in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; and &quot;Satyricon&quot;, but rejected both offers.

===Television, and the next generations===
On March 26, 1958, West appeared at the live televised Academy Awards and performed the song &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with Rock Hudson, which received a standing ovation. In 1959, she released an autobiography, &quot;Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It&quot;, which became a best-seller. West guest-starred on television, including &quot;The Dean Martin Variety Show&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; in 1960, to promote her autobiography, and a lengthy interview on &quot;Person to Person&quot; with Charles Collingwood in 1959, which never aired. CBS executives felt members of the television audience were not ready to see a nude marble statue of West, which rested on her piano. In 1964, she made a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. Much later, in 1976, she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang two songs on his &quot;Back Lot U.S.A.&quot; special on CBS.

===Recording career===
West&#x27;s recording career started in the early 1930s with releases of her film songs on shellac 78 rpm records. Most of her film songs were released as 78s, as well as sheet music. In 1955, she recorded her first album, &quot;The Fabulous Mae West&quot;. In 1965, she recorded two songs, &quot;Am I Too Young&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s Good for Me&quot;, for a 45 rpm record released by Plaza Records. She recorded several tongue-in-cheek songs, including &quot;Santa, Come Up to See Me&quot;, on the album &quot;Wild Christmas&quot;, which was released in 1966 and reissued as &quot;Mae in December&quot; in 1980. Demonstrating her willingness to keep in touch with the contemporary scene, in 1966 she recorded &quot;Way Out West&quot;, the first of her two rock-and-roll albums. The second, released in 1972 on MGM Records and titled &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, covered songs by The Doors, among others, and had songs written for West by English songwriter-producer Ian Whitcomb.

===Later years===
Mae West&#x27;s likeness was used on the front cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. When approached for permission, West initially refused and asked, &quot;What would I be doing in a Lonely Heart&#x27;s Club?&quot; She changed her mind after the band wrote her a personal letter declaring themselves great fans of her. After a 27-year absence from motion pictures, West appeared as Leticia Van Allen in Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970) with Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Farrah Fawcett, and Tom Selleck in a small part. The movie was intended to be deliberately campy sex change comedy, but had serious production problems, resulting in a botched film that was both a box-office and critical failure. Author Vidal, at great odds with inexperienced and self-styled &quot;art film&quot; director Michael Sarne, later called the film &quot;an awful joke&quot;. Though Mae West was given star billing to attract ticket buyers, her scenes were truncated by the inexperienced film editor, and her songs were filmed as though they were merely side acts. Mae West&#x27;s counterculture appeal (she was dubbed &quot;the queen of camp&quot;), included the young and hip, and by 1971, the student body of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) voted Mae West &quot;Woman of the Century&quot; in honor of her relevance as a pioneering advocate of sexual frankness and courageous crusader against censorship.
In 1975, West released the books &quot;Sex, Health, and ESP&quot; (William Allen &amp; Sons, publisher) and &quot;Pleasure Man&quot; (Dell publishers) based on her 1928 play of the same name. Her autobiography, &quot;Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It&quot;, was also updated and republished in the 1970s.

Mae West was a shrewd investor, produced her own stage acts, and invested her money in large tracts of land in Van Nuys, a thriving suburb of Los Angeles. With her considerable fortune, she could afford to do as she liked. In 1976, she appeared on &quot;Back Lot U.S.A.&quot; on CBS, where she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; along with &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone.&quot; That same year, she began work on her final film, &quot;Sextette&quot; (1978). Adapted from a 1959 script written by West, the film&#x27;s daily revisions and production disagreements hampered production from the beginning. Because of the near-endless last-minute script changes and tiring production schedule, West agreed to have her lines signaled to her through a speaker concealed in her hair piece. Despite the daily problems, West was, according to &quot;Sextette&quot; director Ken Hughes, determined to see the film through. At 84, her now-failing eyesight made navigating around the set difficult, but she made it through the filming, a tribute to her self-confidence, remarkable endurance, and stature as a self-created star 67 years after her Broadway debut in 1911 at the age of 18. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote an article on the indomitable star entitled &quot;At 84, Mae West Is Still Mae West&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Sextette&quot; was not a critical or commercial success. The diverse cast included some of West&#x27;s first co-stars such as George Raft (&quot;Night After Night&quot;, 1932), silver screen stars such as Tony Curtis, Timothy Dalton and Walter Pidgeon, plus contemporary pop stars such as Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper, and television favorites such as Dom DeLuise and gossip queen Rona Barrett. It also included cameos of some of the musclemen from her 1950s Las Vegas show, such as the still remarkably fit Reg Lewis. &quot;Sextette&quot; also reunited Mae West with Edith Head, her costume designer from 1933 in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;.

For her contribution to the film industry, Mae West has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street in Hollywood. For her contributions as a stage actor in the theater world, she has been inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Public image==

Mae West was noted for her &quot;voluptuous figure&quot;. The Mae West look has been described as &quot;a figure-hugging floor-length gown with a very low neckline and the figure to fill it.&quot; Noted features were the fishtail train and feather trim.

==Personal life==

West was married on April 11, 1911, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Frank Szatkus (1892–1966), whose stage name was Frank Wallace, a fellow vaudevillian whom she met in 1909. She was 17. She kept the marriage a secret, but a filing clerk discovered the marriage certificate in 1935 and alerted the press. The clerk also uncovered an affidavit in which she had declared herself married, made during the &quot;Sex&quot; trial in 1927. At first, West denied ever marrying Wallace, but she finally admitted it in July 1937, in reply to a legal interrogatory. The couple never lived together as husband and wife. She insisted that they had separate bedrooms, and she soon sent him away in a show of his own to get rid of him. She obtained a divorce on July 21, 1942, during which Wallace withdrew his request for separate maintenance, and West testified that Wallace and she had lived together for only &quot;several weeks&quot;. The final divorce decree was granted on May 7, 1943.

In August 1913, she met Guido Deiro (1886–1950), an Italian-born vaudeville headliner and piano-accordion star. Her affair, and possible 1914 marriage to him, as alleged by Deiro&#x27;s son Guido Roberto Deiro in his 2019 book &quot;Mae West and The Count&quot;, went &quot;very deep, hittin&#x27; on all the emotions&quot;. According to the &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary &quot;Mae West: Dirty Blonde&quot;, West aborted Deiro&#x27;s child on the advice of her mother, the procedure nearly killing her and leaving her infertile. The younger Deiro said that his father was devastated when he learned about the abortion and ended the relationship. West later said, &quot;Marriage is a great institution. I&#x27;m not ready for an institution.&quot;

In 1916, when she was a vaudeville actress, West had a relationship with James Timony (1884–1954), an attorney nine years her senior. Timony was also her manager. By the time that she was an established movie actress in the mid-1930s, they were no longer a couple. West and Timony remained extremely close, living in the same building, working together, and providing support for each other until Timony&#x27;s death in 1954.

West had a relationship with the Cotton Club&#x27;s Owney Madden, who did not &quot;date&quot; the chorus girls.

West remained close to her family throughout her life and was devastated by her mother&#x27;s death in 1930. In 1930, she moved to Hollywood and into the penthouse at The Ravenswood apartment building where she lived until her death in 1980. Her sister, brother, and father followed her to Hollywood where she provided them with nearby homes, jobs, and sometimes financial support. Among her boyfriends was boxing champion William Jones, nicknamed Gorilla Jones (1906–1982). The management at her Ravenswood apartment building barred the African American boxer from entering the premises; West solved the problem by buying the building and lifting the ban.

She became romantically involved at age 61 with Chester Rybinski (1923–1999), one of the muscle men in her Las Vegas stage show—a wrestler, former Mr. California, and former merchant sailor. He was 30 years younger than she, and later changed his name to Paul Novak. He moved in with her, and their romance continued until her death in 1980 at age 87. Novak once commented, &quot;I believe I was put on this Earth to take care of Mae West.&quot; 
West would sometimes refer to herself in the third person and speak of &quot;Mae West&quot; as the entertainment character she had created.

West was a Presbyterian.

==Death==

In August 1980, West tripped while getting out of bed. After the fall, she was unable to speak and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where tests revealed that she had suffered a stroke. She died three months later on November 22, at the age of 87. Three days after her death, a private service was held at the church in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Her friend, bishop Andre Penachio, officiated at the entombment in the family mausoleum at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, which had been purchased in 1930 when her mother died. Her father and brother had also been entombed there before her, and her younger sister, Beverly, was laid to rest in the last of the five crypts less than 18 months after West&#x27;s death.

<text>The Black Dog is a British electronic music group, founded in 1989 by Ken Downie along with Ed Handley and Andy Turner. The group are considered pioneering figures of techno&#x27;s ruminative &quot;home-listening&quot; aesthetic in the early 1990s. 

Following several self-released EPs, the group signed to Warp Records in 1993 and released albums such as &quot;Bytes&quot; (1993) and &quot;Spanners&quot; (1995). In 1995, Handley and Turner departed to work on their spin-off project Plaid. Downie continued recording under the band name The Black Dog, with Richard and Martin Dust joining. The band&#x27;s early EPs were collected on the 2007 compilation &quot;Book of Dogma&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early career===
In 1989, The Black Dog was unable to find a label to back its releases and started its own, Black Dog Productions, which released four vinyl records including the acclaimed &quot;Virtual&quot;. These were followed by a number of EPs on the General Production Recordings label. The Black Dog released their first full-length album &quot;Bytes&quot; on Warp Records on 15 March 1993. The albums &quot;Temple of Transparent Balls&quot; (GPR) and &quot;Spanners&quot; (Warp) followed. The music was often produced under a number of different names, such as Close Up Over, Xeper, Atypic, I.A.O., Balil and the Discordian Popes. The group did numerous remixes, notably for Björk, with whom it collaborated on &quot;&#x27;Sweet Intuition&quot; (a B-side on the &quot;Army of Me&quot; CD single) and &quot;Charlene&quot; (a b side on the &quot;Isobel&quot; CD single).

In the early 1990s, Downie was also running a bulletin board system called &quot;Black Dog Towers&quot;.

In 1995, Handley and Turner left to focus on Plaid but Downie continued working as The Black Dog on his own for a while, releasing the solo album &quot;Music for Adverts (and Short Films)&quot;. With new management, and an increased vigour, Downie then teamed up with Steve &#x27;Hotdog&#x27; Ash and Ross Knight (&quot;thek1d&quot;). Though they completed over a dozen critically acclaimed remixes during this period, only one album was ever released: &quot;Unsavoury Products&quot; featured the talents of Parisian beat poet Black Sifichi on vocals.

===Current line-up===
In 2001, Downie teamed up with Richard and Martin Dust, owners of the label Dust Science Recordings. Since then, they have started to play live again and have released eight EPs and four full-length albums on Dust Science. Their first album, &quot;Silenced&quot;, was released in 2005. The second, &quot;Radio Scarecrow&quot;, was released in 2008 and was very well received and nominated for DJ Mag&#x27;s Best of British 2008.

The follow-up to &quot;Radio Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;Further Vexations&quot;, was released in 2009. It was described as having a dark cynicism of Orwellian practices of government and the passivity of the general public. &quot;We’ve helplessly watched with mounting horror, while the government trashed the country, signed away its sovereignty to Brussels (with a flourish of a specially minted silver pen), sold off precious national industries and assets at next to bargain basement prices, and indulged itself with two utterly pointless wars which it couldn’t afford,&quot; the group stated on their home page.

In May 2010, the Black Dog teamed with creative agency &quot;Human&quot; to create &quot;Music for Real Airports&quot;, described by them as &quot;a contemporary reply to Brian Eno&#x27;s work from the 70s&quot;. While Eno&#x27;s album is well known for being peaceful and sedate, The Black Dog intend theirs to be tense and bittersweet, saying &quot;This record is not necessarily a comfortable listen. But it captures the spectrum of emotions stirred by airports.&quot;

==Side projects==
The initial lineup kept themselves busy with numerous alter-egos and side-projects, including Echo Mike, Close Up Over, Xeper, Atypic, I.A.O., Plaid, Balil and the Discordian Popes. 1993&#x27;s &quot;Bytes&quot; compiles an album&#x27;s worth of tracks by these side projects under the mantle of Black Dog Productions. Of these side-projects, only Plaid continues to be active.

More recently, the current lineup of The Black Dog (Ken Downie with Martin and Richard Dust) have collaborated with Psychick Warriors ov Gaia on a new ambient project called Dadavistic Orchestra. Taking inspiration from the Dada artists of the early 1900s, Dadavistic Orchestra have issued an album and two EPs, offering limited edition gelatin silver prints in homage to avant-garde photographer Man Ray with early copies sold via mail order.

<text>Radio broadcasting is the broadcasting of audio (sound), sometimes with related metadata, by radio waves to radio receivers belonging to a public audience. In terrestrial radio broadcasting the radio waves are broadcast by a land-based radio station, while in &quot;satellite radio&quot; the radio waves are broadcast by a satellite in Earth orbit. To receive the content the listener must have a broadcast radio receiver (&quot;radio&quot;). Stations are often affiliated with a radio network that provides content in a common radio format, either in broadcast syndication or simulcast, or both. The encoding of a radio broadcast depends on whether it uses an analog or digital signal. Analog radio broadcasts use one of two types of radio wave modulation: amplitude modulation for AM radio, or frequency modulation for FM radio. Newer, digital radio stations transmit in several different digital audio standards, such as DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), HD radio, or DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale).

==History==

The earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio. For audio broadcasts to be possible, electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated.

The thermionic valve, a kind of vacuum tube, was invented in 1904 by the English physicist John Ambrose Fleming. He developed a device that he called an &quot;oscillation valve,&quot; because it passes current in only one direction. The heated filament, or cathode, was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the &quot;plate&quot; (or &quot;anode&quot;) when it was at a higher voltage. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated, and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons. Later known as the Fleming valve, it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current, and as a radio wave detector. This greatly improved the crystal set, which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat&#x27;s whisker. However, an amplifier was still required.

The triode (mercury-vapor filled with a control grid) was created on March 4, 1906, by the Austrian Robert von Lieben; independently, on October 25, 1906, Lee De Forest patented his three-element Audion. It was not put to practical use until 1912 when its amplifying ability became recognized by researchers.

By about 1920, valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable. However, an early audio transmission that could be termed a &quot;broadcast&quot; may have occurred on Christmas Eve in 1906 by Reginald Fessenden, although this is disputed. While many early experimenters attempted to create systems similar to radiotelephone devices by which only two parties were meant to communicate, there were others who intended to transmit to larger audiences. Charles Herrold started broadcasting in California in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year. (Herrold&#x27;s station eventually became KCBS).

In The Hague, the Netherlands, PCGG started broadcasting on November 6, 1919, making it arguably the first commercial broadcasting station. In 1916, Frank Conrad, an electrical engineer employed at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, began broadcasting from his Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8XK. Later, the station was moved to the top of the Westinghouse factory building in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Westinghouse relaunched the station as KDKA on November 2, 1920, as the first commercially licensed radio station in the United States. The commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license; advertisements did not air until years later. The first licensed broadcast in the United States came from KDKA itself: the results of the Harding/Cox Presidential Election. The Montreal station that became CFCF began broadcast programming on May 20, 1920, and the Detroit station that became WWJ began program broadcasts beginning on August 20, 1920, although neither held a license at the time.

In 1920, wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England. A famous broadcast from Marconi&#x27;s New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was made by the famous soprano Dame Nellie Melba on June 15, 1920, where she sang two arias and her famous trill. She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. The 2MT station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922. The BBC was amalgamated in 1922 and received a Royal Charter in 1926, making it the first national broadcaster in the world, followed by Czechoslovak Radio and other European broadcasters in 1923.

Radio Argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires on August 27, 1920, making its own priority claim. The station got its license on November 19, 1923. The delay was due to the lack of official Argentine licensing procedures before that date. This station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment, and cultural fare for several decades.

Radio in education soon followed, and colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula. Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs. By 1931, a majority of U.S. households owned at least one radio receiver.
In line to ITU Radio Regulations (article1.61) each &quot;broadcasting station&quot; shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily.

==Types==

Broadcasting by radio takes several forms. These include AM and FM stations. There are several subtypes, namely commercial broadcasting, non-commercial educational (NCE) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio, student-run campus radio stations, and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world. Many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using AM technology that can be received over thousands of miles (especially at night). For example, the BBC, VOA, VOR, and Deutsche Welle have transmitted via shortwave to Africa and Asia. These broadcasts are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and solar activity.

Nielsen Audio, formerly known as Arbitron, the United States–based company that reports on radio audiences, defines a &quot;radio station&quot; as a government-licensed AM or FM station; an HD Radio (primary or multicast) station; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station; one of the satellite radio channels from XM Satellite Radio or Sirius Satellite Radio; or, potentially, a station that is not government licensed.

===AM===
AM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to amplitude modulation, a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted. The medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the long wave band. In response to the growing popularity of FM stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some North American stations began broadcasting in AM stereo, though this never gained popularity and very few receivers were ever sold.

The signal is subject to interference from electrical storms (lightning) and other electromagnetic interference (EMI). One advantage of AM radio signal is that it can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed; building an unpowered crystal radio receiver was a common childhood project in the early decades of AM broadcasting.

AM broadcasts occur on North American airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1,705 kHz (known as the &quot;standard broadcast band&quot;). The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine channels from 1,605 to 1,705 kHz. Channels are spaced every 10 kHz in the Americas, and generally every 9 kHz everywhere else.

AM transmissions cannot be ionospheric propagated during the day due to strong absorption in the D-layer of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment, this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called clear-channel stations. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. During the night, absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections. However, fading of the signal can be severe at night.

AM radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15 kHz (now limited to 10 kHz in the US due to FCC rules designed to reduce interference), but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5 kHz or less. At the time that AM broadcasting began in the 1920s, this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones, 78 rpm recordings, and loudspeakers. The fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably, but the receivers did not. Reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference. AM stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area. This prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other. Bob Carver created an AM stereo tuner employing notch filtering that demonstrated that an AM broadcast can meet or exceed the 15 kHz baseband bandwidth allotted to FM stations without objectionable interference. After several years, the tuner was discontinued. Bob Carver had left the company and the Carver Corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely.

As well as on the medium wave bands, amplitude modulation (AM) is also used on the shortwave and long wave bands. Shortwave is used largely for national broadcasters, international propaganda, or religious broadcasting organizations. Shortwave transmissions can have international or inter-continental range depending on atmospheric conditions. Long-wave AM broadcasting occurs in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The ground wave propagation at these frequencies is little affected by daily changes in the ionosphere, so broadcasters need not reduce power at night to avoid interference with other transmitters.

===FM===
FM refers to frequency modulation, and occurs on VHF airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz everywhere except Japan and Russia. Russia, like the former Soviet Union, uses 65.9 to 74 MHz frequencies in addition to the world standard. Japan uses the 76 to 90 MHz frequency band.

Edwin Howard Armstrong invented wide-band FM radio in the early 1930s to overcome the problem of radio-frequency interference (RFI), which plagued AM radio reception. At the same time, greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum. Instead of 10 kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US, FM channels are 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) apart. In other countries, greater spacing is sometimes mandatory, such as in New Zealand, which uses 700 kHz spacing (previously 800 kHz). The improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s, but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband FM.

Bandwidth of 200 kHz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal — 20 kHz to 30 kHz is all that is necessary for a narrowband FM signal. The 200 kHz bandwidth allowed room for ±75 kHz signal deviation from the assigned frequency, plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. The larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15 kHz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38 kHz stereo &quot;subcarrier&quot;—a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal. Additional unused capacity is used by some broadcasters to transmit utility functions such as background music for public areas, GPS auxiliary signals, or financial market data.

The AM radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - by a factor of approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion. Propagation speeds are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50 MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels.

The original FM radio service in the U.S. was the Yankee Network, located in New England. Regular FM broadcasting began in 1939 but did not pose a significant threat to the AM broadcasting industry. It required purchase of a special receiver. The frequencies used, 42 to 50 MHz, were not those used today. The change to the current frequencies, 88 to 108 MHz, began after the end of World War II and was to some extent imposed by AM broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat.

FM radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a commercial venture, it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts&#x27; medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station (&quot;simulcasting&quot;). The FCC limited this practice in the 1960s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and FM tuners, FM became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments.

===Pirate radio===

Pirate radio is illegal or non-regulated radio transmission. It is most commonly used to describe illegal broadcasting for entertainment or political purposes. Sometimes it is used for illegal two-way radio operation. Its history can be traced back to the unlicensed nature of the transmission, but historically there has been occasional use of sea vessels—fitting the most common perception of a pirate—as broadcasting bases.
Rules and regulations vary largely from country to country, but often the term pirate radio describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or shortwave signals over a wide range. In some places, radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received—especially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered &quot;pirate&quot; due to the type of content, its transmission format, or the transmitting power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as a webcast or an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations.

===Terrestrial digital radio===
Digital radio broadcasting has emerged, first in Europe (the UK in 1995 and Germany in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and many other countries worldwide. The simplest system is named DAB Digital Radio, for Digital Audio Broadcasting, and uses the public domain EUREKA 147 (Band III) system. DAB is used mainly in the UK and South Africa. Germany and the Netherlands use the DAB and DAB+ systems, and France uses the L-Band system of DAB Digital Radio.

The broadcasting regulators of the United States and Canada have chosen to use HD radio, an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast. HD Radio is owned by a consortium of private companies that is called iBiquity. An international non-profit consortium Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), has introduced the public domain DRM system, which is used by a relatively small number of broadcasters worldwide.

==International broadcasting==

Broadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. Commercial broadcasters may simply see a business opportunity to sell advertising or subscriptions to a broader audience. This is more efficient than broadcasting to a single country, because domestic entertainment programs and information gathered by domestic news staff can be cheaply repackaged for non-domestic audiences.

Governments typically have different motivations for funding international broadcasting. One clear reason is for ideological, or propaganda reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment in or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. Radio RSA, the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on Radio Moscow from the 1960s to the 1980s was &quot;What is Communism?&quot;

A second reason is to advance a nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the Cold War the American Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and Indian Radio AIR were founded to broadcast news from &quot;behind the Iron Curtain&quot; that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate disinformation. Currently, the US operates similar services aimed at Cuba (Radio y Televisión Martí) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Vietnam, Laos and North Korea (Radio Free Asia).

Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, Vatican Radio, established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as HCJB or Trans World Radio will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, both governmental and religious programming is provided.

==Extensions==
Extensions of traditional radio-wave broadcasting for audio broadcasting in general include cable radio, local wire television networks, DTV radio, satellite radio, and Internet radio via streaming media on the Internet.

===Satellite===
The enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters and restrictions on available radio spectrum licenses has restricted growth of Satellite radio broadcasts. In the US and Canada, just two services, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio exist. Both XM and Sirius are owned by Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which was formed by the merger of XM and Sirius on July 29, 2008, whereas in Canada, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada remained separate companies until 2010. Worldspace in Africa and Asia, and MobaHO! in Japan and the ROK were two unsuccessful satellite radio operators which have gone out of business.

==Program formats==
Radio program formats differ by country, regulation, and markets. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission designates the 88–92 megahertz band in the U.S. for non-profit or educational programming, with advertising prohibited.

In addition, formats change in popularity as time passes and technology improves. Early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time, known as &quot;live&quot; broadcasting. As technology for sound recording improved, an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material. A current trend is the automation of radio stations. Some stations now operate without direct human intervention by using entirely pre-recorded material sequenced by computer control.

<doc id="173089" wikidata="Q19816749" url="?curid=173089" title="Richard Keith (actor)">
<text>Keith Thibodeaux (born December 1, 1950), also known as Richard Keith, is an American actor and musician, best known for playing Little Ricky on the television sitcoms &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;. He was billed as Richard Keith because his Cajun French last name, &quot;Thibodeaux&quot;, was considered too hard to pronounce by producer Desi Arnaz. He is the last living regular appearing cast member from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

==Career==
=== &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; ===

Thibodeaux showed skill on the drums at a young age, and was making $500 ($ in dollars ) a week at the age of 3 while touring with the Horace Heidt Orchestra. His father took him to audition for the part of Little Ricky in 1955, &quot;I walked on the set and there was Lucy, she was standing there and she was looking at me,&quot; he said. &quot;She said &#x27;OK he&#x27;s cute, but what does he do?&#x27; My dad said, &#x27;Well he plays the drums&#x27; and she said, &#x27;Oh, come on--I can&#x27;t believe that.&#x27; Then, she says &#x27;Look, we have a drum set over there, go ahead and let him play.&#x27; Eventually Desi Arnaz himself came over and started jamming with me on the drums and then he kind of stood up and said &#x27;Well, I think we found Little Ricky.&#x27;&quot;

According to Lucie Arnaz, who was interviewed on the TV show Archive of American Television, he became like part of the family. &quot;For a long time I thought Keith was related to us, because he went &quot;everywhere&quot; with us. Desi (Jr.) considered him his best friend and [Keith] was responsible for teaching him the drums. He came over to our house on many weekends and traveled with them during the summer. My mother kind of adopted him. He is in all of our home movies and photographs growing up and was a great kid, and still is.&quot;

In 1964 Thibodeaux appeared for a split second in an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; titled &quot;Lucy is a Process Server.&quot; Initially he was featured in a comedic sequence at a train station in which a vending machine malfunctions. However, the scene was cut when the show ran too long. After the episode was edited, Thibodeaux is only seen for a moment, entering the station. Nevertheless, Thibodeaux remained in the credits listed as Richard Keith, the actor who played &quot;Little Boy.&quot;

=== Other TV appearances ===
As a child, he made 13 appearances on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, between 1962 and 1966, usually as Opie&#x27;s friend &quot;Johnny Paul Jason&quot;. He later described &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; set as a far more laid-back and pleasant experience compared to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, though due to age differences between himself and Ron Howard, he never grew as close to that show&#x27;s cast as he did to the Arnaz family. He also accepted small roles on other popular television shows.

=== Music career ===
In 1969, Thibodeaux joined the rock group &quot;David and the Giants&quot; who were based in Laurel, Mississippi. The group recorded in its early years with Capitol Records, Fame Records, and Crazy Horse Records, primarily touring throughout the South, and enjoyed a few regional hits which were recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and were well known in the Northern Soul music scene in England. After turning 21 in 1971, Thibodeaux received a final payment of $8,000 from a trust fund set up during his days on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;

Thibodeaux developed a drug problem and eventually left the band, which broke up soon after. He became a born again Christian in 1974. The band leader, David Huff, and other members later converted. The group got back together. The band released a number of albums in the 1980s and 1990s for CBS Priority Records (Epic Records), The Benson Company, ABC Word Records (Myrrh) label, and the band&#x27;s own label Giant Records. They released a CD in 2014 titled &quot;Still Rockin&quot;. A live David and the Giants album, &quot;The Best Is Yet To Come&quot;, and a DVD of the live performance, was recorded and released in August 2017, which marked the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The band was honored in 2017, along with other notable Mississippi musicians such as Steve Forbert, Tammy Wynette, George Soule, and Elvis Presley, by receiving &quot;The Jimmie&quot; Mississippi Dreamers (Jimmie Rodgers Award) for their musical contributions as Mississippi artists at a special concert at Peavey Electronics Corporate headquarters in Meridian, MS, along with Hartley Peavey.

In 1990, Thibodeaux became the executive director for his wife&#x27;s company, Ballet Magnificat! which tours nationally and internationally. In 2017 the couple launched the Ballet Magnificat! Brasil dance company and trainee program headquartered in Curitiba, Brazil.

==Personal life==
Raised as a Roman Catholic, Thibodeaux went to school at St. Victor&#x27;s elementary in West Hollywood and St. Jane Frances de Chantal School in North Hollywood. He attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks for two years before his parents separated in 1966.

After his parents separated, Keith, his mother, and siblings moved back to Lafayette, Louisiana. He graduated from Lafayette High School where he continued to play drums in rock and rhythm and blues bands. He left Louisiana for Mississippi in late 1969 after going to college for a short period where he said he &quot;majored in drinking beer and playing pool&quot; to pursue a career with the band David and the Giants.

In 1976, he met and married ballet dancer Kathy Denton in Jackson, Mississippi. The couple moved briefly to Southern California in 1977 where he was asked to join the pop band Starbuck famous for the late &#x27;70s hit &quot;Moonlight Feels Right&quot;. Thibodeaux returned to Mississippi in 1978, where he, his wife and daughter Tara (b. 1979) eventually settled in Jackson, Mississippi. Thibodeaux played with jazz bands locally for a brief time before joining a newly revamped Christian rock band, David and the Giants, in 1979.

Thibodeaux&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Life After Lucy&quot; was published in 1994.

<doc id="173094" wikidata="Q10859544" url="?curid=173094" title="Islamization of knowledge">
<text>The [[Islamization]] of Knowledge (also abbreviated as IoK) is a conceptual framework originating from Islamic philosophy, advocating for the integration of Islamic teachings with modern academic disciplines, such as the social sciences, management sciences, humanities, sciences, engineering, and technology. This model emphasizes that all knowledge and scientific inquiry should align with the principles of Islam, aiming to foster a holistic understanding of the world through an Islamic worldview. This includes aligning ethical principles and scientific practices with Islamic teachings to address contemporary issues.

== Origins ==
The Islamization of Knowledge traces its roots to the 1977 Makkah conference, an influential event that initiated a dialogue among Islamic intellectuals regarding the role of Islam in shaping knowledge in the modern world. Among these intellectuals, Isma&#x27;il Raji al-Faruqi played a pivotal role in formalizing and articulating the concept. Al-Faruqi expressed concerns about the secularization of knowledge in Muslim societies, describing it as &quot;the malaise of the &quot;ummah&quot;&quot; (Muslim community). He argued that reliance on Western tools and analytical methods often led to breaches of Islamic ethics and a disconnect with the ecological and social realities of Muslim nations.

Al-Faruqi advocated for the revival of methods used in early Muslim philosophy, the restoration of &quot;ijtihad&quot; (independent reasoning), and the integration of scientific methodologies within the boundaries of Islam. His theoretical framework and work plan for this concept were outlined in his 1982 book, &quot;Islamization of Knowledge: General Principles and Work Plan&quot;, which remains a foundational reference.

== Principles and frameworks ==
The Islamization of Knowledge emphasizes the integration of Islamic teachings with modern disciplines by critiquing and re-evaluating contemporary fields through an Islamic perspective. Ismail al-Faruqi’s 12-step work plan systematically integrates Islamic principles with modern disciplines. It focuses on mastery of modern sciences, understanding Islamic knowledge in various fields, and establishing the relevance of Islamic values to contemporary academic disciplines. Al-Faruqi&#x27;s approach critiques Western epistemologies and recasts them within an Islamic worldview, harmonizing ethical and intellectual pursuits with the tenets of Islam.

In Southeast Asia, Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas developed a complementary framework. He emphasized linguistic and philosophical foundations, focusing on the role of &quot;adab&quot; (proper conduct) and the metaphysical aspects of knowledge. His contributions shaped the curricula of institutions like ISTAC, which he helped establish.

Abdullah Berghout, a contemporary scholar, proposed a quality-management system model for Islamization, incorporating Islamic perspectives into modern academic disciplines. His framework emphasizes input, procedure, output, and feedback, focusing on intellectual, psychomotor, and affective domains, with particular emphasis on the affective domain.

The implementation of Islamization involves steps such as mastering modern disciplines, analyzing their history and development, mastering Islamic legacy, and critically evaluating modern knowledge from an Islamic perspective. It includes synthesizing Islamic and modern knowledge and reformulating these disciplines within an Islamic framework.

== Reception and critiques ==
Supporters argue that the Islamization of Knowledge enables Muslims to maintain their religious identity in a secular world while benefiting from modern advancements. Critics, however, highlight potential risks, such as conflating religion with science, restricting academic freedom, and imposing a single interpretation of Islam on diverse Muslim societies.

== Impact and legacy ==
The concept has significantly influenced academic institutions such as the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), which advances research on Islamic epistemology and interdisciplinary studies. Similarly, institutions like IIUM have implemented integrated curricula combining Islamic values with modern disciplines, serving as models for others globally.

<text>Outsider art is art made by self-taught individuals who are untrained and untutored in the traditional arts with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art worlds.

The term &quot;outsider art&quot; was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art critic Roger Cardinal. It is an English equivalent for art brut (, &quot;raw art&quot; or &quot;rough art&quot;), a label created in the 1940s by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture. Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples psychiatric hospital patients, hermits, and spiritualists.

Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes applied as a marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream &quot;art world&quot; or &quot;art gallery system&quot;, regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work. A more specific term, &quot;outsider music&quot;, was later adapted for musicians.

== Art of the mentally ill ==

Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children and the makers of &quot;peasant art&quot;, developed from the end of the 19th century onward, both by psychiatrists such as Cesare Lombroso, Auguste Marie or Marcel Réjà, and by artists, such as members of &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; group: Wassily Kandinsky, August Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej von Jawlensky, and others. 

What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, &quot;Der Blaue Reiter Almanac&quot;. During World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these &#x27;primitives&#x27;.

Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book &quot;Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler&quot; (&quot;A Psychiatric Patient as Artist&quot;) about Adolf Wölfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. Wölfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. Wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf Wölfli Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern.

A defining moment was the publication of &quot;Bildnerei der Geisteskranken&quot; (&quot;Artistry of the Mentally Ill&quot;) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.

People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia. In the hospital he painted, producing &quot;The Maze&quot;, a dark depiction of his tortured youth. He was transferred from the Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with Edward Adamson (1911–1996), a pioneer of art therapy, and creator of the Adamson Collection.

== Jean Dubuffet and &quot;art brut&quot; ==
French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by &quot;Bildnerei der Geisteskranken&quot; and began his own collection of such art, which he called &quot;art brut&quot; or &quot;raw art&quot;. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l&#x27;Art Brut along with other artists, including André Breton and Claude Lévi-Strauss. The collection he established became known as the Collection de l&#x27;art brut and the curator was Slavko Kopač for almost three decades. It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Dubuffet characterized art brut as:

Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses – where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere – are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade.
:— Jean Dubuffet, &quot;Place à l&#x27;incivisme&quot; (December 1987 – February 1988).

Dubuffet argued that &#x27;culture&#x27;, that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated.

Dubuffet&#x27;s championing of Art Brut would not last long. Scholars argue Dubuffet&#x27;s distaste for the mainstream art world helped ensure that art brut and the Compagnie de l&#x27;Art Brut would not survive on a commercial basis. Dubuffet would kill art brut as he defined it in his quest for its authenticity. Three years after the Compagnie de l&#x27;Art Brut was formed, Dubuffet dissolved it, caving in to form the more conventional Collection de l&#x27;art brut afterward.

== Cultural context ==
The interest in &quot;outsider&quot; practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist, and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, for example, abandoned &quot;painterly&quot; technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to recontextualize existing &quot;ready-made&quot; objects as art. Mid-century artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of what they deemed &quot;primitive&quot; societies, the unschooled art made by children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet&#x27;s championing of the &quot;art brut&quot; – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values. As with analysis of these other art movements, current discourse indicates art brut is innately tied to primitivism due to its similarity in its borrowing of personal &quot;de-patriation&quot; and exoticization of familiar yet alien forms.

== Terminology ==
A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as &quot;outside&quot; of official culture. Definitions of these terms vary and overlap. The editors of &quot;Raw Vision&quot;, a leading journal in the field, suggest that &quot;Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary&quot;. Consequently, they lament the use of &quot;outsider artist&quot; to refer to almost any untrained artist. &quot;It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name.&quot;

*Art Brut: Coined by Jean Dubuffet, the term translated literally from French means &quot;raw art&quot;. &#x27;Raw&#x27; is analogous in that it has not been through the academic &#x27;cooking&#x27; process: i.e. the world of art schools, galleries, and museums. Dubuffet&#x27;s original definition pertains strictly to the ‘raw art’ created by the autodidactic and shunned fringes of society. 
*Folk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe – though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society&#x27;s mainstream.
*Intuitive art/Visionary art: &quot;Raw Vision Magazine&quot;″s preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.
*Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as &quot;Neuve Invention&quot;; refers to artists on the margins of the art world.
*Naïve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to &quot;normal&quot; artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists.
*Neuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too; strictly speaking, it refers only to a special part of the Collection de l&#x27;art brut.
*Visionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists – ranging from decorated houses to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The Palais idéal by Ferdinand Cheval.

<text>Dutch elm disease (DED) is caused by a member of the sac fungi (Ascomycota) affecting elm trees, and is spread by elm bark beetles. Believed to be originally native to Asia, the disease was accidentally introduced into America, Europe, and New Zealand. In these regions it has devastated native populations of elms that did not have resistance to the disease. The name &quot;Dutch elm disease&quot; refers to its identification in 1921 and later in the Netherlands by Dutch phytopathologists Bea Schwarz and Christine Buisman, who both worked with professor Johanna Westerdijk. The disease affects species in the genera &quot;Ulmus&quot; and &quot;Zelkova&quot;, therefore it is not specific to the Dutch elm hybrid.

== Overview ==

Dutch elm disease (DED) is caused by ascomycete microfungi. Three species are now recognized:
*&quot;Ophiostoma ulmi&quot;, which afflicted Europe from 1910, reaching North America on imported timber in 1928.
*&quot;Ophiostoma himal-ulmi&quot;, a species endemic to the western Himalaya.
*&quot;Ophiostoma novo-ulmi&quot;, an extremely virulent species from Japan which was first described in Europe and North America in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s.


DED is spread in North America by three species of bark beetles (Family: Curculionidae, Subfamily: Scolytinae):
*The native elm bark beetle, &quot;Hylurgopinus rufipes&quot;.
*The smaller European elm bark beetle, &quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;.
*The banded elm bark beetle, &quot;Scolytus schevyrewi&quot;.

In Europe, while &quot;S. multistriatus&quot; still acts as a vector for infection, it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle, &quot;S. scolytus&quot;. &quot;H. rufipes&quot; can be a vector for the disease, but is inefficient compared to the other vectors. &quot;S. schevyrewi&quot; was found in 2003 in Colorado and Utah.

Other reported DED vectors include &quot;Scolytus sulcifrons&quot;, &quot;S. pygmaeus&quot;, &quot;S. laevis&quot;, &quot;Pteleobius vittatus&quot; and &quot;Р. kraatzi&quot;. Other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors.

===Field resistance===
&#x27;Field resistance&#x27; is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place, rather than survive it. A clear example would be the European White Elm (&quot;Ulmus laevis&quot;) which, while having little or no genetic resistance to DED, synthesizes a triterpene, Alnulin, rendering the bark distasteful to the vector beetles, obliging them to look further afield for more suitable elms. Another would be the inability of the beetles to see elms which did not break the silhouette. &#x27;Weeping&#x27; elms are often spared infection owing to the beetles&#x27; aversion to hanging upside-down while feeding.

===Mechanism===
In an attempt to block the fungus from spreading farther, the tree reacts by plugging its own xylem tissue with gum and tyloses, bladder-like extensions of the xylem cell wall. As the xylem (one of the two types of vascular tissue produced by the vascular cambium, the other being the phloem) delivers water and nutrients to the rest of the plant, these plugs prevent them from travelling up the trunk of the tree, starving the tree of water and nutrients, which eventually kills it.

===Symptoms===
The first symptom of infection is usually an upper branch of the tree with leaves starting to wither and yellow in summer, months before the normal autumnal leaf shedding. This morbidity spreads in a progressive manner throughout the tree, with further dieback of branches. Eventually, the roots die, starved of nutrients from the leaves. Often, not all the roots die: the roots of some species, especially the English elm (formerly &quot;Ulmus procera&quot;), can repeatedly put up suckers, which flourish for approximately 15 years before dying off.

==Disease range==

===Europe===
Dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental Europe in 1910, and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except Greece and Finland. Barendina Gerarda Spierenburg compiled records of trees displaying symptoms from 1900 - 1905 onwards in the Netherlands and her publication of this information in 1921 was one part of the start of extensive research and practical measures to try to halt the disease. In addition the fungus that caused the disease was isolated in 1921 in The Netherlands by Bea Schwarz, a pioneering Dutch phytopathologist, and this discovery would lend the disease its name. Following this, in the 1920s and 30s Christine Buisman, working in the Netherlands and USA, identified the sexual stage of the fungal pathogen and also developed methods for experimental infections of elm seedlings that led to selection of resistant trees.

In Britain, the disease was first identified in 1927 by T R Peace on English elm in Hertfordshire. This first strain was a relatively mild one, which killed only a small proportion of elms, more often just killing a few branches, and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses.

In around 1967, a new, far more virulent, strain arrived in Britain, apparently via east coast ports on shipments of rock elm &quot;U. thomasii&quot; logs from Canada destined for the small-boat industry, confirmed in 1973 when another consignment was examined at Southampton Docks. This strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to European elms; more than 25 million trees died in the United Kingdom alone, while France lost 97% of its elms. The disease spread rapidly northwards, reaching Scotland within 10 years.

By 1990, very few mature elms were left in Britain or much of continental Europe. One of the most distinctive English countryside trees (See John Constable&#x27;s painting &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the South-West&quot;), the English elm &quot;U. minor&quot; &#x27;Atinia&#x27;, is particularly susceptible as it is the elm most favoured by the Scolytus beetles. Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic, nearly all these trees, which often grew to more than 45 m high, are gone. The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts (&quot;suckers&quot;). These suckers rarely reach more than 5 m tall before dying off from a new attack. However, established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the United Kingdom.

The largest concentrations of mature elms in Europe are now in Amsterdam and The Hague. In 2005, Amsterdam was declared the &quot;Elm City of Europe&quot;: the city&#x27;s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms, including several generations of research-elms (see below: Resistant trees). Some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in The Hague are elms, planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds. Since the 1990s, a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms, and of sanitation felling, has reduced annual elm losses in The Hague from 7% to less than 1% (see below: Preventive treatment). The losses are made up by the planting of disease-resistant cultivars. The largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 15,000 still stand (2005 figures), several of which are estimated to be over 400 years old. Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area, between the English Channel and the South Downs, and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease. Empowered by the Dutch Elm Disease (Local Authorities) (Amendment) Order 1988, local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber, although in practice they usually do it themselves, successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle &quot;Scolytus&quot; spp. Sanitary felling has also, to date, preserved most of the 250,000 elms on the Isle of Man, where average temperature and wind speed inhibit the activity of the beetles, which need a temperature of at least 20 degrees to fly and a wind speed of less than five metres per second. The largest concentration of mature elms in Scotland is in Edinburgh, where over 5,000 remained in 2009 from some 35,000 in 1976. The city council gives the overall number of elms as 15,000 (2016). Edinburgh&#x27;s Leith Links and Meadows have some of the highest concentrations of mature elms among U.K. parks (2014). A policy of sanitary felling has kept losses in the city to an average of 1,000 a year (2009). Between 2013 and 2020 losses were below 1,000 a year. Elm was the most common tree in Paris from the 17th century; before the 1970s there were some 30,000 &quot;ormes parisiens&quot;. Today, only 1,000 mature elms survive in the city, including examples in the large avenues (Avenue d&#x27;Italie, Avenue de Choisy, Boulevard Lefebvre, Boulevard de Grenelle, Boulevard Garibaldi) and two very old specimens, one in the garden of the Tuileries in front of the l&#x27;Orangerie and another in the Place Saint-Gervais in front of l&#x27;hôtel de ville de Paris. Losses are now being made up with disease-resistant cultivars, especially the Dutch-French research elm &#x27;Nanguen&#x27; (), named for the ancient Roman name for the city: Lutetia.

===North America===

DED was first reported in the United States in 1928, with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from the Netherlands destined for use as veneer in the Ohio furniture industry. Quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within of metropolitan New York City until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them. The disease spread from New England westward and southward, almost completely destroying the famous elms in the &quot;Elm City&quot; of New Haven, Connecticut, reaching the Detroit area in 1950, the Chicago area by 1960, and Minneapolis by 1970. Of the estimated 77 million elms in North America in 1930, over 75% had been lost by 1989.
The disease first appeared on the planted rows of American elm trees (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The United States National Park Service (NPS) used a number of methods to control the epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with DED-resistant American elm cultivars (see &quot;Ulmus americana&quot; cultivars). The NPS combated the disease&#x27;s local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (&quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. As a result, the population of American elms planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years.

DED reached eastern Canada during World War II, and spread to Ontario in 1967, Manitoba in 1975 and Saskatchewan in 1981. In Toronto, 80% of the elm trees have been lost to Dutch elm disease; many more fell victim in Ottawa, Montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s. Quebec City still has about 21,000 elms, thanks to a prevention program initiated in 1981. Alberta and British Columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of Dutch elm disease, although, in an isolated case, an elm tree in Wainwright, Alberta, was found diseased in June 1998 and was immediately destroyed. The presence of DED was monitored in this area during subsequent years but was not seen again. Today, Alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by Dutch elm disease in the world.

The provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan all prohibit the pruning of elm trees during the middle of the year (taking effect in April, and lasting through the end of September, July, and August respectively), which they deem to be the most active time of year for bark beetles. It is also illegal to use, store, sell, or transport elm firewood.

The largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in North America is believed to be in the city of Winnipeg, where close to 200,000 elms remain. The city spends $3 million annually to aggressively combat the disease using Dursban Turf and the Dutch Trig vaccine.

===New Zealand===
Dutch elm disease has reached New Zealand. It was found in Napier where it was eradicated and was also found in the Auckland Region in 1989. The Ministry of Agriculture funded a national management programme but it was cancelled to allow more funds to be available for pests of a higher priority. A major outbreak occurred in New Zealand in July 2013, particularly at the site of Kingseat Hospital, south of Auckland. Auckland has 20,000 elms.

==Preventive treatment==

===Mechanical===
The first attempts to control Dutch elm disease consisted of pruning trees to remove and burn diseased timber. While this method was effective in New York State and adjacent areas, its cost made it uneconomical except in large cities where elms were considered valuable attractions.

===Chemical===
In the US, when Dutch elm disease spread away from the Atlantic coast, control focused on controlling the bark beetle by using insecticides such as DDT and dieldrin, which were sprayed heavily across all parts of elm trees, usually twice a year in the spring and again at a lower concentration in the summer. In its early years, it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the United States but as early as 1947, concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates. In areas sprayed during the 1950s, local people observed birds such as the American woodcock, American robin, white-breasted nuthatch, brown creeper and various &quot;Poecile&quot; species dying. Biologist Rachel Carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms, which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering Dutch elm disease. Spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962, a trend aided by fungicides.

Lignasan BLP (carbendazim phosphate), introduced in the 1970s, was the first fungicide used to control Dutch elm disease. This had to be injected into the base of the tree using specialized equipment, and was never especially effective. It is still sold under the name &quot;Elm Fungicide&quot;.

Arbotect (thiabendazole hypophosphite) became available some years later, and it has been proven effective. Arbotect must be injected every two to three years to provide ongoing control; the disease generally cannot be eradicated once a tree is infected. Arbotect is not effective on root graft infections from adjacent elm trees. It is more than 99.5% effective for three years from beetle infections, which is the primary mode of tree infection.

Alamo (propiconazole) has become available more recently, though several university studies show it to be effective only for the current season in which it is injected. Alamo is primarily recommended for treatment of oak wilt.

Multistriatin is a pheromone produced by female elm bark beetles, which can be produced synthetically. It has potential in being used to trap male beetles, which carry the fungus.

===Biological===
Because of the ban on the use of chemicals on street and park trees in the Netherlands, the University of Amsterdam developed a biological vaccine by the late 1980s. Dutch Trig is nontoxic, consisting of a suspension in distilled water of spores of a strain of the fungus &quot;Verticillium albo-atrum&quot; that has lost much of its pathogenic capabilities, injected in the elm in spring. The strain is believed to have enough pathogenicity left to induce an immune response in the elm, protecting it against DED during one growing season. This is called induced resistance. Trials with the American elm have been successful; in a six-year experiment with the American elm in Denver, CO, annual Dutch elm disease losses declined significantly after the first year from 7 percent to between 0.4 and 0.6 percent; a greater and more rapid reduction in disease incidence than the accompanying tree sanitation and plant health care programs.

Preventive treatment is usually justified only when a tree has unusual symbolic value or occupies a particularly important place in the landscape.

==Resistant trees==

Research to select resistant cultivars and varieties began in the Netherlands in 1928, followed by the United States in 1937 (see &quot;Ulmus americana&quot; cultivars). Initial efforts in the Netherlands involved crossing varieties of &quot;U. minor&quot; and &quot;U. glabra&quot;, but later included the Himalayan or Kashmir elm &quot;U. wallichiana&quot; as a source of antifungal genes. Early efforts in the USA involved the hybridization of the Siberian elm &quot;U. pumila&quot; with American red elm &quot;U. rubra&quot; to produce resistant trees. Resulting cultivars lacked the traditional shape and landscape value of the American elm; few were planted.

In 2005, the National Elm Trial (USA) began a 10-year evaluation of 19 cultivars in plantings across the United States. The trees in the trial were exclusively American developments; no European cultivars were included. Based on the trial&#x27;s final ratings, the preferred cultivars of the American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) are ‘New Harmony’ and ‘Princeton’. The preferred cultivars of Asian elms are the Morton Arboretum introductions and ‘New Horizon’.

Recent research in Sweden has established that early-flushing clones are less susceptible to DED owing to an asynchrony between DED susceptibility and infection.

===Testing for disease resistance===
Elms are tested for resistance by inoculation with the fungal pathogen in late May when the tree&#x27;s growth is at its annual peak. Clones raised for testing are grown to an age of 3 or 4 years. In Europe, the is introduced into the cambium by a knife wound. However this method, developed in the Netherlands, was considered too severe in America, where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle &quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;, a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to Europe, &quot;Scolytus scolytus&quot;, which is unknown in America. In the method devised by the USDA, the inoculum is introduced to the cambium via a 2 mm-diameter hole drilled through the bark in the lower third of the tree. This method was further refined by the University of Wisconsin team, which drilled holes in the branches to simulate natural infection by the bark beetles feeding in the twig crotches, but results from this method were found to exaggerate the genetic resistance of the host. Consequently, tests were conducted on specimens in a controlled environment, either in greenhouses or customized plant chambers, facilitating more accurate evaluation of both internal and external symptoms of disease.

Another variable is the composition of the inoculum; while an inoculum strength of 106 spores /  ml is standard in both continents, its composition reflects the different &quot;Ophiostoma&quot; species, subspecies and hybrids endemic to the two continents. In Italy for example, two subspecies, &quot;americana&quot; and &quot;novo-ulmi&quot;, are present together with their hybrid, whereas in North America, ssp. &quot;novo-ulmi&quot; is unknown. The differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the American cultivar &#x27;Princeton&#x27;, displaying high resistance in the US, has often succumbed to Dutch elm disease in Europe.

===Hybrid cultivars===

Many attempts to breed disease-resistant cultivar hybrids have involved a genetic contribution from Asian elm species that are demonstrably resistant to this fungal disease. Much of the early work was undertaken in the Netherlands. The Dutch research programme began in 1928, and ended in 1992. During those 64 years, well over 1000 cultivars were raised and evaluated. Still in use are cultivars such as &#x27;Groeneveld&#x27;, &#x27;Lobel&#x27;, &#x27;Dodoens&#x27;, &#x27;Clusius&#x27; and &#x27;Plantijn&#x27;, although the resistance levels in these trees aren&#x27;t high enough to confer good protection. The programme had three major successes: &#x27;Columella&#x27;, &#x27;Nanguen&#x27;, and &#x27;Wanoux&#x27;, all found to have an extremely high resistance to the disease when inoculated with unnaturally large doses of the fungus. Only &#x27;Columella&#x27; was released during the Dutch programme&#x27;s lifetime—-in 1987. Patents for the and clones were purchased by the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), which subjected the trees to 20 years of field trials in the Bois de Vincennes, Paris, before releasing them to commerce—-in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

Asian species featured in the American DED research programs were the Siberian elm &quot;U. pumila&quot;, Japanese elm &quot;U. davidiana&quot; var. &quot;japonica&quot;, and the Chinese elm &quot;U. parvifolia&quot;, which gave rise to several dozen hybrid cultivars resistant not just to DED, but also to the extreme cold of Asian winters. Among the most widely planted of these, both in North America and in Europe, are &#x27;Sapporo Autumn Gold&#x27;, &#x27;New Horizon&#x27; and &#x27;Rebona&#x27;. Some hybrid cultivars, such as &#x27;Regal&#x27; and &#x27;Pioneer&#x27; are the product of both Dutch and American research. Hybridization experiments using the slippery (or red) elm &quot;U. rubra&quot; resulted in the release of &#x27;Coolshade&#x27; and &#x27;Rosehill&#x27; in the 1940s and 50s; the species last featured in hybridization as the female parent of &#x27;Repura&#x27; and &#x27;Revera&#x27;, both patented in 1993, although neither has yet appeared in commerce.

In Italy, research was initiated at the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante, Florence, to produce a range of disease-resistant trees adapted to the warmer Mediterranean climate, using a variety of Asiatic species crossed with the early Dutch hybrid &#x27;Plantyn&#x27; as a safeguard against any future mutation of the disease. Two trees with very high levels of resistance, &#x27;San Zanobi&#x27; and &#x27;Plinio&#x27;, were released in 2003. &#x27;Arno&#x27; and &#x27;Fiorente&#x27; were patented in 2006 and entered commerce in 2012. All four have the Siberian elm &quot;U. pumila&quot; as a parent, the source of disease-resistance and drought-tolerance genes. &#x27;Morfeo&#x27; was released in 2011; it arose from a crossing of the Dutch hybrid clone &#x27;405&#x27; (female parent) and the Chenmou Elm, the latter a small tree from the provinces of Anhui and Jiangsu in eastern China, The &#x27;405&#x27; clone is a crossing of an English &quot;U.&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot; and a French &quot;U. minor&quot;.

In the Netherlands a new program has been initiated. From the old proving grounds of the Dorschkamp Research Institute, 10 fourth-generation hybrids survive in a DED-ridden area. These have been tested and some have a very high level of resistance. At Noordplant Nursery new hybrids have been tested since 2013.

===Species and species cultivars===

====North America====

Ten resistant American elm cultivars are now in commerce in North America. No cultivar is immune to DED; even highly resistant cultivars can become infected, particularly if already stressed by drought or other environmental conditions where the disease prevalence is high. With the exception of &#x27;Princeton&#x27;, no trees have yet been grown to maturity; trees cannot be said to be mature until they have reached an age of 60 years.

Notable cultivars include:
* &#x27;Princeton&#x27;, is a cultivar selected in 1922 by Princeton Nurseries for its landscape merit. By coincidence, this cultivar was found to be highly resistant in inoculation studies carried out by the USDA in the early 1990s. As trees planted in the 1920s still survive, the properties of the mature plant are well known. However, &#x27;Princeton&#x27; has not proven resistant in Europe, where the main vector of the disease—the larger elm bark beetle, &quot;Scolytus scolytus&quot;—is capable of introducing far more fungal spores into the tree; many of the 50 trees planted at Highgrove House in the south-west of England in 2006 had died from Dutch elm disease by 2011.
* &#x27;American Liberty&#x27;, is, in fact, a set of six cultivars of moderate to high resistance produced through selection over several generations starting in the 1970s. Although &#x27;American Liberty&#x27; is marketed as a single variety, nurseries selling the &quot;Liberty Elm&quot; actually distribute the six cultivars at random and thus, unfortunately, the resistance of any particular tree cannot be known. One of the cultivars, &#x27;Independence&#x27;, is covered by patent (U. S. Plant patent 6227). The oldest &#x27;American Liberty&#x27; elm was planted in about 1980.
* &#x27;Valley Forge&#x27;, released in 1995, has demonstrated the highest resistance of all the clones to Dutch elm disease in controlled USDA tests.
* &#x27;Lewis and Clark&#x27; = , released in 2004 to commemorate the bicentenary of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition, was cloned from a tree found growing in North Dakota which had survived unscathed when all around had succumbed to disease.

In 2007, the Elm Recovery Project of the University of Guelph Arboretum in Ontario, Canada, reported that cuttings from healthy surviving old elms surveyed across Ontario had been grown to produce a bank of resistant trees, isolated for selective breeding of highly resistant cultivars.

The University of Minnesota USA is testing various elms, including a huge now-patented century-old survivor known as &quot;The St. Croix Elm&quot;, which is located in a Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN suburb (Afton) in the St. Croix River valley—a designated National Scenic Riverway.

The slippery or red elm &quot;U. rubra&quot; is marginally less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than the other American species, but this quality seems to have been largely ignored in American research. No cultivars were ever selected, although the tree was used in hybridization experiments (see above).

In 1993, Mariam B. Sticklen and James L. Sherald reported the results of NPS-funded experiments conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees. In 2007, AE Newhouse and F Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization. By 2013, researchers in both New York State and North Carolina were conducting field trials of genetically engineered DED-resistant American elms.

====Europe====
Among European species, there is the unique example of the European white elm &quot;U. laevis&quot;, which has little innate resistance to DED, but is eschewed by the vector bark beetles and only rarely becomes infected. Recent research has indicated it is the presence of certain organic compounds, such as triterpenes and sterols, which serves to make the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease.

In Europe the testing of clones of surviving field elms for innate resistance has been carried out since the 1990s by national research institutes, with findings centrally assessed and published. The first results of this ongoing project suggest that in some countries a very small number of native field elm genotypes have comparatively high levels of tolerance to DED. In Spain, for example, of around 5,000 native elms evaluated to 2013, some 25 genotypes (0.5% of those tested) fall into this category; and it is now hoped that the controlled crossing of the best seven of these (genetically and aesthetically) will produce &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; hybrids with effective &#x27;field resistance&#x27; and market appeal. Similar results are beginning to emerge in trials on surviving field elms in Greece.

===== United Kingdom =====
Much of the work in the United Kingdom is by the Forestry Commission&#x27;s research arm, which has had Dutch elm disease on its agenda since the 1920s. In 1994 a Research Information Note (no 252) was published, written by John Gibbs, Clive Brasier and Joan Webber, and in 2010 a Pathology Advisory Note, as well as throughout the period a stream of more academic papers: notable results have been the observation that the progress of the disease through Scotland has been quite slow, and that genetic engineering has been tried to improve the resistance of the English elm.

In England the Conservation Foundation had been propagating, distributing and planting clones of surviving indigenous elms, including field elms (but not the highly susceptible English elm), as part of a scheme to return elms to city and countryside. The Foundation was running two elm programmes: the &#x27;Great British Elm Experiment&#x27; and &#x27;Ulmus londinium&#x27;, an elm programme for London – these use saplings cultivated through micropropagation from mature parent elms found growing in the British countryside: parent trees are monitored for disease, while saplings were offered free to schools and community groups, who are asked to monitor their trees&#x27; progress on the Foundation&#x27;s online elm map; in London, places with &#x27;elm&#x27; in their name were offered a sapling – in an attempt to find out why some elms have survived while others succumbed to Dutch elm disease. Both these projects have been discontinued.

The spread of DED to Scotland has focussed attention on a small number of wych elms &quot;U. glabra&quot; surviving in areas of high infectivity, prompting the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh to begin a programme of selecting trees, with a view to determining innate resistance (2009). The Garden is raising and distributing in Scotland seedlings derived from controlled crosses of rare survivors in these areas (2023).

In 2001–2004, English elm &quot;U. minor&quot; &#x27;Atinia&#x27; was genetically engineered to resist disease, in experiments at Abertay University, Dundee, Scotland, by transferring antifungal genes into the elm genome using minute DNA-coated ball bearings. However, owing to reservations to GM developments, there are no plans to release the trees into the countryside.

In Spain, the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, charged with discovering disease-resistant elms for use in forestry, has raised and patented seven cultivars of the field elm &quot;Ulmus minor,&quot; although two have subsequently been found to have Siberian elm &quot;U. pumila&quot; DNA, the species introduced to Spain in the 16th century. Although none have been released to commerce (2020), the clone &#x27;Ademuz&#x27;, pure &quot;U. minor&quot;, has been imported into the UK since 2014, and widely planted there.

==Possible earlier occurrences==

===The &#x27;Elm Decline&#x27;===
From analysis of fossil pollen in peat samples, it is apparent that elms, an abundant tree in prehistoric times, all but disappeared from northwestern Europe during the mid-Holocene period around 4000 BC, and to a lesser extent around 1000 BC. This roughly synchronous and widespread event has come to be known as the &#x27;Elm Decline&#x27;. When first detected in the mid-20th century, the decline was attributed to the impact of forest-clearance by Neolithic farmers, and of elm-coppicing for animal fodder, though the numbers of settlers could not have been large. The devastation caused recently by DED has provided an alternative explanation. Examination of subfossil elm wood showing signs of the changes associated with the disease has suggested that a form of DED &quot;may&quot; have been responsible. Fossil finds from this period of elm bark beetles support this theory. A consensus today is that the Elm Decline was probably driven by both factors.

===Historic period===
A less devastating form of the disease, caused by a different fungus, had possibly been present in north-west Europe for some time. Dr Oliver Rackham of Cambridge University presented evidence of an outbreak of elm disease in north-west Europe, c. 1819–1867. &quot;Indications from annual rings [a reference to the dark staining in an annual ring in infected elms] confirm that Dutch elm disease was certainly present in 1867,&quot; he wrote, quoting contemporary accounts of diseased and dying elms, including this passage in Richard Jefferies&#x27; 1883 book, &quot;Nature near London&quot;:

There is something wrong with elm trees. In the early part of this summer, not long after the leaves were fairly out upon them, here and there a branch appeared as if it had been touched with red-hot iron and burnt up, all the leaves withered and browned on the boughs. First one tree was thus affected, then another, then a third, till, looking round the fields, it seemed as if every fourth or fifth tree had thus been burnt. [...] Upon mentioning this I found that it had been noticed in elm avenues and groups a hundred miles distant, so that it is not a local circumstance.

Earlier still, Rackham noted, &quot;The name &quot;Scolytus destructor&quot; was given to the great bark beetle on evidence, dating from c. 1780, that it was destroying elms around Oxford.&quot;

In Belgium, elm die-back and death was observed in 1836 and 1896 in Brussels, and in 1885–1886 in Ghent. In the later outbreaks the die-back was attributed to the elm bark beetle.

It has been suggested that &quot;for thousands of years elms have flourished in natural balance with the &quot;scolytidae&quot;, combating occasional infections of Dutch elm disease.&quot;

Sir Thomas Browne, writing in 1658, noted in &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; an elm disease that was spreading through English hedgerows, and described symptoms reminiscent of DED.

<text>Mosbach (; South Franconian: &quot;Mossbach&quot;) is a town in the north of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is the seat of the Neckar-Odenwald district and has a population of approximately 25,000 distributed in six boroughs: Mosbach Town, Lohrbach, Neckarelz, Diedesheim, Sattelbach and Reichenbuch.

==Geography==
Mosbach is located about 35 km east of Heidelberg, south of the Odenwald mountains at a height of 134-354m at the confluence of the Neckar and the Elz. The town is part of the conservation area Neckartal-Odenwald Nature Park and the UNESCO Bergstrasse-Odenwald Nature Park.

==History==
The settlement of Mosbach developed around the Benedictine monastery of Mosbach Abbey (&quot;Monasterium Mosabach&quot;), the first written record of which dates from the 9th century. In 1241 rights and privileges had been granted to Mosbach as an Imperial free city. These rights were lost in 1362 when Mosbach became part of the Electorate of the Palatinate. With the division of the lands of King Rupert in 1410, Mosbach became the capital of a small principality known as Palatinate-Mosbach as the inheritance for his son Otto I. With the death of his brother John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt 1443, the territory of Palatinate-Neumarkt was added in a personal union to Palatinate-Mosbach creating the territory of Palatinate-Mosbach-Neumarkt. This principality was dissolved with the death of Count Palatine Otto II in 1499. The city and adjoining territory reverted to the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Mosbach became the capital of the administrative district of &quot;Oberamt Mosbach&quot;. In 1806 the city was made part of the Grand Duchy of Baden. In World War II, the Mosbach area was the location of a Daimler-Benz underground airplane engine factory, codenamed &quot;Goldfisch&quot;. It was occupied by the 289th Combat Engineer Battalion in the immediate postwar period.

==Twin towns and sister cities==

Mosbach is twinned with:

* Budapest II, Hungary
* Château-Thierry, France
* Finike, Turkey
* Lymington, England, United Kingdom
* Rosolina, Italy
==Points of interest==
Historic sites include:
* the historic town centre with the pedestrian area and timber-framed houses, such as:
** the Palm House built in 1610, which is the town&#x27;s emblem
** the Salzhaus, which is the oldest timber-framed house
* old town hall with tower
* the former collegiate church, now a parish church, of which the nave is used by the Protestants, and the chancel by the Roman Catholics
* the &quot;Tempelhaus&quot; in Neckarelz, which has the character of both a castle and a church.

Mosbach lies on two &quot;heritage&quot; routes:
* the &quot;Burgenstraße&quot; (&quot;“Castle Road”&quot;), linking many historic castles
* the &quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot; (&quot;“German Half-timbered Road”&quot;), joining the locations of many of the best German half-timbered buildings

==Notable people born in Mosbach==
*TM Garret, German-American human-rights activist
*Franz Müller, German film director, screenwriter and producer

<text>The .38 Special, also commonly known as .38 S&amp;W Special (not to be confused with .38 S&amp;W), .38 Smith &amp; Wesson Special, .38 Spl, .38 Spc (pronounced &quot;thirty-eight special&quot;), or 9×29mmR is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith &amp; Wesson. 

The .38 Special was the standard service cartridge for the majority of United States police departments from the 1920s to the 1990s. It was also a common sidearm cartridge used by United States military personnel in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In other parts of the world, it is known by its metric designation of 9×29.5mmR or 9.1×29mmR.

Known for its accuracy and manageable recoil, the .38 Special remains one of the most popular revolver cartridges in the world more than a century after its introduction. It is used for recreational target shooting, formal target competition, personal defense, and small-game hunting.

== Overview ==
The .38 Special was designed and entered production in 1898 as an improvement over the .38 Long Colt which, as a military service cartridge, was found to have inadequate stopping power against the charges of Filipino Muslim warriors during the Philippine–American War. Upon its introduction, the .38 Special was originally loaded with black powder, but the cartridge&#x27;s popularity caused manufacturers to offer smokeless powder loadings within a year of its introduction.

Despite its name, the caliber of the .38 Special cartridge is actually .357 inches (36 caliber/9.07 mm), with the &quot;.38&quot; referring to the approximate diameter of the loaded brass case. This came about because the original 38-caliber cartridge, the .38 Short Colt, was designed for use in converted .36-caliber cap-and-ball Navy revolvers, which had untapered cylindrical firing chambers of approximately diameter that required heeled bullets, the exposed portion of which was the same diameter as the cartridge case.

Except for case length, the .38 Special is identical to the .38 Short Colt, .38 Long Colt, and .357 Magnum. This nearly identical nature of the three rounds allows a .38 Special round to be safely fired in revolvers chambered for .357 Magnum. It also allows .38 Short Colt and .38 Long Colt rounds to be safely fired in revolvers chambered for .38 Special. Thus, the .38 Special round and revolvers chambered for it have a unique versatility. However, the longer and more powerful .357 Magnum cartridge will usually not chamber and fire in weapons rated specifically for .38 Special (e.g., all versions of the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10), which are not designed for the greatly increased pressure of the magnum rounds. Both .38 Special and .357 Magnum will chamber in Colt New Army revolvers in .38 Long Colt due to their straight walled chambers, but this should not be done under any circumstances, due to dangerous pressure levels up to three times what the New Army is designed to withstand.

== History ==
The .38 Special was designed and produced in 1898 to be a higher-velocity round, with better penetration properties than the .38 Long Colt that was in government service in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. The .38 Long Colt revolver round would not penetrate the shields of the insurgent Philippine Moro warriors, and the government contracted with Smith &amp; Wesson for a new revolver round. The .38 Special held a minimum of 21 grains of black powder, 3 grains more than the then-current .38 Long Colt, and muzzle velocity (with a 158 grain bullet) was 100–150 feet per second greater.

During the late 1920s, in response to demands for a more effective law-enforcement version of the cartridge, a new standard-velocity loading for the .38 Special was developed by Western Cartridge Company. This .38 Special variant, which incorporated a round-nosed lead &#x27;Lubaloy&#x27; bullet, was named the .38 Super Police. Remington-Peters also introduced a similar loading. Testing revealed that the longer, heavier .357-calibre bullet fired at low velocity tended to &#x27;keyhole&#x27; or tumble upon impact, providing more shock effect against unprotected personnel. At the same time, authorities in Great Britain, who had decided to adopt the .38 caliber revolver as a replacement for their existing .455 service cartridge, also tested the same bullet in the smaller .38 S&amp;W cartridge. This cartridge was called the .38 S&amp;W Super Police or the 38/200. Britain later adopted the 38/200 as its standard military handgun cartridge.

In 1930, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced a large-frame 38 Special revolver with a 5-inch barrel and fixed sights intended for police use, the Smith &amp; Wesson 38/44 Heavy Duty. The following year, a new high-power loading called the .38 Special Hi-Speed with a metal-tip bullet was developed for these revolvers in response to requests from law enforcement agencies for a handgun bullet that could penetrate auto bodies and body armor. That same year, Colt Firearms announced that their Colt Official Police would also handle &#x27;high-speed&#x27; .38 Special loadings. The 38/44 high-speed cartridge came in three bullet weights: , , and , with either coated lead or steel jacket, metal-piercing bullets. The media attention gathered by the 38/44 and its ammunition eventually led Smith &amp; Wesson to develop a completely new cartridge with a longer case length, in 1934. This was the .357 Magnum.

During World War II, some U.S. aircrew (primarily Navy and Marine Corps) were issued .38 Special S&amp;W Victory revolvers as sidearms for use in the event of a forced landing. In May 1943, a new .38 Special cartridge with a , full-steel-jacketed, copper flash-coated bullet meeting the requirements of the Hague Convention was developed at Springfield Armory and adopted for the Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers. The new military .38 Special loading propelled its bullet at a standard from a revolver barrel. During the war, many U.S. naval and Marine aircrew were also issued red-tipped 38 Special tracer ammunition using either a bullet for emergency signaling purposes.

In 1956, the U.S. Air Force adopted the &quot;Cartridge, Caliber 38, Ball M41&quot;, a military variant of the .38 Special cartridge designed to conform to Hague Convention rules. The original 38 M41 ball cartridge used a 130-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet, and was loaded to an average pressure of only , giving a muzzle velocity of approximately from a barrel. This ammunition was intended to prolong the life of S&amp;W M12 and Colt Aircrewman revolvers equipped with aluminum cylinders and frames, which were prone to stress fractures when fired with standard 38 Special ammunition. 
By 1961, a slightly revised M41 38 cartridge specification known as the &quot;Cartridge, Caliber 38 Ball, Special, M41&quot; had been adopted for U.S. armed forces using 38 Special caliber handguns. The new M41 &quot;Special&quot; cartridge used a 130-grain FMJ bullet loaded to a maximum allowable pressure of for a velocity of approximately in a solid test barrel, and about from a revolver barrel. The M41 ball cartridge was first used in .38 Special revolvers carried by USAF aircrew and Strategic Air Command security police, and by 1961 was in use by the U.S. Army for security police, dog handlers, and other personnel equipped with 38 Special caliber revolvers. A variant of the standard M41 cartridge with a semi-pointed, unjacketed lead bullet was later adopted for CONUS (Continental United States) police and security personnel. At the same time, .38 Special tracer cartridges were reintroduced by the US Navy, Marines, and Air Force to provide a means of emergency signaling by downed aircrew. Tracer cartridges in .38 Special caliber of different colors were issued, generally as part of a standard aircrew survival vest kit.

A request for more powerful .38 Special ammunition for use by Air Police and security personnel resulted in the &quot;Caliber 38 Special, Ball, PGU-12/B High Velocity&quot; cartridge. Issued only by the U.S. Air Force, the PGU-12/B had a greatly increased maximum allowable pressure rating of 20,000 psi, sufficient to propel a 130-grain FMJ bullet at from a solid test barrel, and about 950–1,000 ft/s from a revolver barrel. The PGU-12/B &quot;High Velocity&quot; cartridge differs from M41 &quot;Special&quot; ammunition in two important respects—the &quot;PGU-12/B&quot; is a much higher-pressure cartridge, with a bullet deeply set and crimped into the cartridge case.

In response to continued complaints over ineffectiveness of the standard .38 Special 158-grain cartridge in stopping assailants in numerous armed confrontations during the 1950s and 1960s, ammunition manufacturers began to experiment with higher-pressure (18,500 CUP) loadings of the .38 Special cartridge, known as 38 Special +P (+P or +P+ designation indicates that the cartridge is using higher pressures, therefore it is overpressure ammunition). In 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investigation introduced a new .38 Special +P loading that became known as the &quot;FBI Load&quot;. The FBI Load combined a more powerful powder charge with a 158-grain unjacketed soft lead semi-wadcutter hollow-point bullet designed to readily expand at typical .38 Special velocities obtained in revolvers commonly used by law enforcement. The FBI Load proved very satisfactory in effectively stopping adversaries in numerous documented shootings using 2- to 4-inch barreled revolvers. The FBI Load was later adopted by the Chicago Police Department and numerous other law enforcement agencies.

Demand for a .38 Special cartridge with even greater performance for law enforcement led to the introduction of the +P+ .38 Special cartridge, first introduced by Federal and Winchester. Originally labeled &quot;For Law Enforcement Only&quot;, +P+ ammunition is intended for heavier-duty .38 Special and .357 Magnum revolvers, as the increased pressure levels can result in accelerated wear and significant damage to firearms rated for lower-pressure .38 Special loadings (as with all .38 Special loadings, the .38 Special +P+ can also be fired safely in .357 Magnum revolvers).

== Performance ==

Due to its black-powder heritage, the .38 Special is a low-pressure cartridge, one of the lowest in common use today at 17,000 psi. By modern standards, the .38 Special fires a medium-sized bullet at rather low speeds. In the case of target loads, a bullet is propelled to only . The closest comparisons are the 380 ACP, which fires much lighter bullets slightly faster than most .38 Special loads; the 9×19mm Parabellum, which fires a somewhat lighter bullet significantly faster; and the .38 Super, which fires a comparable bullet considerably faster. All of these cartridges are usually found in semi-automatic pistols.

The higher-pressure .38 Special +P loads at 20,000 psi offer about 20% more muzzle energy than standard-pressure loads, which places them between the .380 ACP and the 9mm Parabellum; similar to that of the 9×18mm Makarov. A few specialty manufacturers&#x27; +P loads for this cartridge can attain even higher energies than that, especially when fired from longer barrels, producing energies in the range of the 9mm Parabellum. These loads are generally not recommended for older revolvers or ones not specifically &quot;+P&quot; rated.

All of the above specifications for 38 loadings, and the .357 Magnum, are applicable when fired from a barreled revolver. The velocity is reduced when using barreled guns. Power (muzzle energy) will, of course, decrease accordingly.

Although only a few US police departments now issue or authorize use of the .38 Special revolver as a standard-duty weapon, the caliber remains popular with some police officers for use in short-barreled revolvers carried when off duty or for undercover-police investigations. It is also widely used in revolvers purchased for civilian home defense or for concealed carry.

<text>The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry is a 1973 book by Harold Bloom on the anxiety of influence in writing poetry. It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new &quot;revisionary&quot; or antithetical approach to literary criticism. Bloom&#x27;s central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintain with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that &quot;the poet in a poet&quot; is inspired to write by reading another poet&#x27;s poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of &#x27;strong&#x27; poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an &quot;agon&quot; (a vain attempt by a writer to resolve the conflict between his ideas and those of a much more influential predecessor), Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios, which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric.

Before writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Burns, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In &quot;The Anxiety of Influence&quot; and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom later changed his mind, and the most recent editions of &quot;The Anxiety of Influence&quot; include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called &quot;six revisionary ratios&quot; by Bloom. They are &quot;clinamen&quot;, &quot;tessera&quot;, &quot;kenosis&quot;, &quot;daemonization&quot;, &quot;askesis&quot;, and &quot;apophrades&quot;.

==Six revisionary ratios==
Bloom introduces his six revisionary ratios in the following manner, which he consistently applies in this book as well as his successor volume titled &quot;A Map of Misreading&quot;.

* Clinamen – Bloom defines this as &quot;poetic misreading or misprision proper&quot;. The poet makes a swerve away from the precursor in the form of a &quot;corrective movement&quot;. This swerve suggests that the precursor &quot;went accurately up to a certain point&quot;, but should have swerved in the direction that the new poem moves. Bloom took the word &quot;clinamen&quot; from Lucretius, who refers to swerves of atoms that make change possible. 
* Tessera – Bloom defines this as &quot;completion and antithesis&quot;. The author &quot;completes&quot; his precursor&#x27;s work, retaining its terms but meaning them in a new sense, &quot;as though the precursor had failed to go far enough&quot;. The word &quot;tessera&quot; refers to a fragment that, together with other fragments, reconstitutes the whole; Bloom is referring to ancient mystery cults, who would use &quot;tessera&quot; as tokens of recognition.
* Kenosis – Bloom defines this as a &quot;breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions&quot;, in other words &quot;a movement toward discontinuity with the precursor&quot;. The poet humbles himself, &quot;as though he were ceasing to be a poet&quot;, but does so in such a way as to empty out the precursor poem too, so that the later poet is not deflated as much as may seem. Bloom took the word &quot;kenosis&quot; from St. Paul, who uses it to refer to Jesus accepting his own reduction from divine to human status.
* Daemonization – Bloom defines this as a &quot;movement towards a personalized Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor’s Sublime&quot;. The author suggests that the powers in the precursor poem actually derive from something beyond it; the poet does so &quot;to generalize away the uniqueness of the earlier work&quot;. Bloom took the term daemonization from Neoplatonism, where it refers to an adept being aided by an intermediary, who is neither divine nor human.
* Askesis – Bloom defines this as a &quot;movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude&quot;. The author curtails the impression of his/her own &quot;human and imaginative endowment&quot; in order to separate themselves from others and stress his/her own individuality. The poet does this in such a way as to do the same to the precursor, whose limitations and individuality are also emphasized, separating him/her from the later poet. Bloom took the word &quot;askesis&quot; (asceticism) from the pre-Socratic philosophers.
* Apophrades – Bloom defines this as the “return of the dead”. The poet, toward the end of his/her life, opens up his poem – this time deliberately rather than naturally – to the precursor&#x27;s influence. But this deliberateness creates the uncanny effect that the precursor&#x27;s work seems to be derivative of the later poet. Bloom took the word &quot;apophrades&quot; from the Athenian concept of the days on which the dead return to reinhabit the houses in which they once lived.

<text>Bernard Lortie (born c. 1951) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada was a member of the Chenier Cell of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) who were responsible for a decade of bombings and armed robberies in the province of Quebec.

During what became known as the October Crisis, on October 5, 1970, members of the FLQ&#x27;s Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Bernard Lortie, along with Chenier Cell leader Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose, and Francis Simard, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec Vice Premier and Cabinet Minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

On November 6, 1970, Bernard Lortie was arrested when the police raided the hiding place of the FLQ&#x27;s Chenier cell. Although the other three members escaped the raid, they were later captured in St-Luc, Quebec in late December. All four members were charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pierre Laporte. For his part in the kidnapping and murder, Bernard Lortie was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was granted parole by the Canadian Parole Board after seven years.

<text>The Warped Tour is a touring rock music festival that toured the United States and Canada each summer from 1995 until 2019, and returned in 2025 for its 30th anniversary. By 2015, Warped was the largest traveling music festival in the United States and the longest-running touring music festival in North America. Internationally, the festival stopped in Australia from 1998–2002 and again in 2013, as well as the United Kingdom in 2012 and 2015.

Following the first Warped Tour, the skateboard shoe manufacturer Vans became the festival&#x27;s title sponsor, when it then became known as the Vans Warped Tour.

Warped Tour was conceived by Kevin Lyman as an electric alternative rock festival, but later began focusing on punk rock music. Although it was primarily a punk rock festival, it covered diverse genres over the years.

Lyman said that the 2018 Vans Warped Tour would be the final, full cross-country run. On December 18, 2018, Lyman revealed details for the tour&#x27;s 25th anniversary, with only three events in 2019.

In November 2019, rumors spread that Chris Fronzak planned to bring back the Warped Tour after Lyman&#x27;s retirement. On October 4, 2020, Fronzak confirmed his intent to be involved in the return of Warped Tour; however, &quot;for legal reasons it (could not) come back for &#x27;three years or so&#x27;&quot;. In 2024, Lyman confirmed that Warped Tour would return in 2025, with the lineup being announced from January to February.

==Overview==
Band performance times and sets were posted on an inflatable installation and were available in print for purchase from an on-site information stand.

Every year had a &quot;BBQ Band&quot;. In exchange for the privilege of playing on the tour, the BBQ Band prepared the post-show barbecue for the bands and crew most evenings. Past BBQ Bands included the Dropkick Murphys, Art of Shock, and &quot;The Fabulous Rudies&quot;. Similarly, one band, Animo (formerly DORK), was permitted for four years to play on the tour in exchange for working on the setup crew. The &quot;BBQ Band&quot; for the 2016 tour was Reckless Serenade.

The tour began as a skate punk and third-wave ska tour but later came to feature largely pop punk and metalcore acts. Some hardcore and street punk bands also participated, such as the Casualties, the Unseen and Anti-Flag.

The tour was not set up in a single fixed format; each show venue dictated a different layout. The event was set up in early morning and struck late the same day. Heading into Canada, a bus transported supplies while another bus held equipment not needed during the brief jaunt over the border.

Citing issues like transportation problems for minors and audience demographics trending younger each year, Kevin Lyman decided to let parents attend Warped Tour performances for free beginning in 2013. Parents had their own adult day care, known as Reverse Day Care. Grown-ups could spend the day waiting for their children in the Reverse Day Care tent, which offered ample seating, as well as fans or cooling devices to keep parents occupied during the festival.

==History==

The Warped Tour was created in 1995 by Kevin Lyman and Ray Woodbury, president of RK Diversified Entertainment, in production with the short-lived &quot;Warp Magazine&quot; and Creative Artists Agency. The tour began June 21 at the Idaho Center in Boise, Idaho, and ended August 18 in Detroit, Michigan.

In 2009, the two main stages were condensed into one and bands were given 40-minute sets, as opposed to the traditional 30 minutes across the previous two stages. Despite this, the tour decided to bring back the two main stages concept with 35-minute sets instead for the 2012 tour and beyond.

In 2012, the Warped Tour traveled to London, the first time the tour had left North America or Australia since 2002. In the UK and Europe, Warped Tour was operated by English promoter Kilimanjaro Live. The Warped Tour returned to London in 2015.

===Warped Tour 1996===

The tour usually was held at outdoor venues, though on rare occasions it was held indoors. In 1996, due to problems with the event venue, the show was forced to move indoors to The Capitol Ballroom nightclub in Washington, D.C.

1996 was the first year for Vans as a sponsor; they remained the main sponsor thereafter.

===Warped Tour 1997===
In 1997, the Vans Warped Tour went international and included venues in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States.

===Warped Tour 1999===

In an October 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, Lyman mentioned the possibility of adding more dates in the coming years, saying &quot;If it works, we’ll look to the future to do more.&quot;

==Legacy==
Warped Tour became a launching pad for many up-and-coming artists. The festival was credited with bringing unknown artists like Black Veil Brides, Avenged Sevenfold, Blink-182, Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Paramore, Machine Gun Kelly, Bebe Rexha, Katy Perry, and Yelawolf to the spotlight.

The Warped Tour gave artists like will.i.am and The Black Eyed Peas an opportunity and venue to perform. Black Eyed Peas were featured on the 1999 Vans Warped Tour. According to will.i.am, the Black Eyed Peas were the first group not categorized as &quot;punk&quot; to play at Warped Tour.

==Music lessons==
Musicians on the Vans Warped tour gave lessons. Percussive Marketing Council teamed up with the Vans Warped Tour and offered free drum lessons Lesson Lab tent to concert goers. These music lessons were for those who were learning to play drums for the first time. The lessons used electronic drum sets and acoustic drum sets. According to PMC Advisory Board Member Billy Cuthrell, having drum teachers from other percussion stores is the &quot;key&quot; to the free lessons program.

In 2005, the Vans Warped tour incorporated a multiple level stage that consisted of two levels for the band Street Drum Corps.

Music education was a big part of the Vans Warped Tour. Throughout the years, the Warped Tour used the John Lennon Bus to achieve this. The John Lennon Bus, essentially a mobile studio, was started by Brian Rothschild and Yoko Ono in 1968. The goal of the John Lennon Bus was to offer music education from performing artists to people, particularly young people, who attended the Warped Tour. Brian Roschild was executive director of the John Lennon Bus. Artists like Eminem and Bowling For Soup visited the tour bus. Other celebrities to use the bus included Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, Natasha Bedingfield, and John Legend.

==Battle of the Bands==
The Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands took place at Warped Tour every year. Over 10,000 bands tried out for the battle of the bands in 2005. The bands performed at their local Warped tour date and were judged by music industry professionals. If the bands did well in the competition, they were invited to perform as a side stage act on the Ernie Ball Stage of the Vans Warped Tour.

==Reception and controversies==

&quot;Warped Tour is a place for teenage kids to go and hear all their favorite bands in one day,&quot; says Rob Pasalic, guitarist for The Saint Alvia Cartel. &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t make sense for it to be the same tour in 2007 as it was in 1997. These are the bands that kids like, and the tour is smart enough to grow and adapt to that. You still get bands like Bad Religion playing, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s lost all its roots.&quot;

Joe Queer of The Queers stated that

You play music because there&#x27;s something inside of you that says you have to play music. Now you get bands like Fall Out Boy that are basically created in the studio. The Warped Tour changed it. Fuck it. I just don&#x27;t like that shit. All the guys in the bands remind me of the jocks I hated in high school. To me a punk gig is a small sweaty club with the audience right in your face knocking over the mic stand and boogying off the energy.

Keith Morris said that &quot;These kids that are [playing] on the Warped Tour, they should have no choice but to go into the military, and go off to some desert somewhere and spend some time in the desert, rather than having some big, ultra mega record company giving them lots of money and paying for their hotels and buses, making sure their hair is trendy, and that they are wearing the proper clothes that all the kids like and wear, and all that fun shit.&quot; Morris&#x27; band the Circle Jerks would later appear on the 2007 edition of the tour.

In 2013, Oliver Sykes, lead vocalist of Bring Me the Horizon, took to Twitter to announce that he was no longer allowed to start a mosh pit/wall of death. Kevin Lyman took to Twitter as well to say that audience members could create mosh pits and walls of death, but that someone in the audience had to initiate them rather than any band member because then they would be taking responsibility for any injuries, which could then lead to costly lawsuits.

On 1 July 2015, it was announced that Jake McElfresh&#x27;s music act Front Porch Step would play the Nashville, Tennessee, tour stop. Many bands including The Wonder Years, Senses Fail, Handguns, and Beartooth asked attendees to boycott McElfresh&#x27;s set. The Wonder Years&#x27; lead singer Dan &quot;Soupy&quot; Campbell, who was supposed to perform after Front Porch Step on the Acoustic Basement Stage, asked fans to go see Man Overboard at 1:15 pm, the time the acoustic set would take place. Lyman responded by saying,

He was only supposed to be here long enough to play his show but the weather today has been putting us behind schedule. He wasn&#x27;t added to the tour, so those claims that he was &#x27;added to sell tickets&#x27; are completely groundless.

He also said because McElfresh had still not been formally charged with misconduct, he agreed to have him perform. &quot;If he was a danger to anyone, he simply would not have been here.&quot;

On July 11, 2016, Vans Warped Tour announced that Virginia pro-life organization Rock for Life would be among the vendors on their 41 tour dates. Rock for Life were known for co-opting punk aesthetics with their logo of a fetus playing a guitar and T-shirts with the phrase &quot;All Lives Matter&quot;. Bands such as Safe to Say and Old Wounds spoke out against the organization, with Safe to Say replying to Rock for Life&#x27;s tweet, saying

Yes. Everyday. We are a pro choice band. A tent telling young women what to do with their body has no place here.

On June 26, 2017, a video surfaced that showed the punk rock band The Dickies verbally abusing a crowd member after protests against the band, including signs that said &quot;Our teenage girls don&#x27;t need to be subjected to derogatory jokes by a disgusting old man&quot; and &quot;Punk isn&#x27;t predatory&quot; took place. While Lyman initially said that the band was no longer on the Warped Tour roster, he released a statement on 1 July that said the band had not been kicked off of the tour and that the altercation was between the band&#x27;s frontman, Leonard Graves Phillips, and a member of the touring party.

I thought it was time to put the facts out since I have watched false information floating around. A video has been circulating of a confrontation between Leonard from the Dickies and a fan. Fact – it was not a fan, but a member of the touring party. The member of the touring party was standing next to the PA with a sign protesting some of the things they found offensive about the band&#x27;s jokes, and props on stage. During one of the last songs they went towards the barricade and directed the sign at the band. After a verbal barrage from Leonard, the member of the touring party threw the sign at Leonard, and left the area. I do not condone verbal or physical violence, whatsoever. The Dickies, last day of the tour was that Sunday, which had always been scheduled. These are the facts of what took place and this is why I ask anyone who has an issue with anyone else on tour, to come sit under my tent with me and express their views diplomatically. On this year&#x27;s tour we have many people who may not agree with each other, but as humans we should be able to express our points of view in a civil manner. If we have any hope to progress as a society, communication will be key in moving forward.

===Band conflicts===

A few bands have left the tour due to conflicts they had with the tour or other bands:
* Both D12 and Esham were kicked out of the 2001 tour. D12 allegedly attacked Esham because he mentioned Eminem&#x27;s daughter in his song &quot;Chemical Imbalance&quot;. Eminem was not present during this incident.
* The band Guttermouth was supposedly removed from the Warped Tour 2004 for insulting Simple Plan. The band later stated that they left on their own because &quot;... &#x27;10 or so&#x27; unnamed bands didn&#x27;t jibe with Guttermouth&#x27;s way of doing business, and in some cases, threatened them with violence&quot;.
* The band Slaves was kicked off the tour in 2015 after lead singer Jonny Craig sexually assaulted and harassed a female merchandise table worker.
* The band Islander was kicked off the tour after Mikey Carvajal jumped into a backline drum kit onstage and damaged it during their live set in Denver on July 1, 2018.

==Sponsorship==
The Vans Warped Tour was sponsored by Vans, and in the final years Journeys joined as sponsor. Kevin Lyman was offered sponsorship from Calvin Klein before eventually working with Vans. The tour also was sponsored by Samsung, which enabled the bands and fans to interact with one another. The schedule for the day was sent out to fans on the day of their show. Samsung also sponsored a reverse day care for the Warped tour, which let parents cool off while their children watched their favorite bands. Warped Tour also partnered with other technology companies like Cingular Wireless, Apple Computer and others. This enabled these companies to reach to younger audiences. The communications manager from Memorex said that Warped Tour let them reach a younger demographic because of the music that these people are &quot;passionate about.&quot; At one point in time, Warped Tour also provided internet access to attendees while at the festival. Chaos Mobile was formed by Kevin Lyman and John Reese of Freeze Artist Management.

==Activism and philanthropy==
Activism was a major component of the Vans Warped Tour and allowed for non-profit organizations such as Invisible Children, To Write Love on Her Arms, Shirts for a Cure, Keep a Breast Foundation, and Hope for the Day to advocate about their causes. Other causes presented at Warped Tour were Music Saves Lives and Earth Echo. Earth Echo promoted recycling and provided a solar-powered stage. Keep A Breast was another organization on the Vans Warped Tour. Keep A Breast educates women about breast cancer and preventative measures against the disease. The organization worked in conjunction with the Girlz Garage on the Vans Warped Tour. People who donated to the cause were given T-shirts signed by artists on the tour to spread awareness of breast cancer.

Since 2001, the traveling tour was affiliated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), including food vendors and booths that distributed information about animal rights and veganism.

In March 2016, it was announced that Warped Tour would team up with A Voice for the Innocent to address the issue of sex crimes in the music scene. The Vans Warped Tour contributed 25 cents from every ticket sold to an organization called Hollywood Heart. Warped Tour also gave money to the relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina. Warped Tour and the Taste of Chaos (a festival) worked together to contribute $500,000.

==Musical equipment==
Bands on the Warped Tour often brought their own musical equipment, but Industrial Sound also provided equipment for band use, according to lead sound engineer Daniel Bonneau. He also said that the bands had to do line checks instead of traditional soundchecks.

==Official compilation albums==
An official Warped Tour compilation CD was released annually by SideOneDummy Records to coincide with the start of the tour. Before 1998, official releases were handled by Vans via Uni Distribution in 1996 and Epitaph Records in 1997, respectively. The compilation included songs by numerous artists performing on the tour that year. The first few compilations had varying titles, but starting in 2001 the series used a standard title with the format &quot;Warped Tour &lt;year&gt; Tour Compilation&quot;. In 2002, the compilation expanded onto two CDs, totaling 50 artists, a format which the series followed in all its subsequent years. The Warped Tour compilation album in 2002 charted at number 55.

In addition, the digital music service Rhapsody.com released a regular &quot;Warped Tour Bootleg Series&quot;, with each entry focusing on a single artist&#x27;s performances on the tour. Bootleg Series artists included Matchbook Romance, My Chemical Romance, Bedouin Soundclash, MxPx, The Starting Line, Millencolin, Avenged Sevenfold, Gogol Bordello, Motion City Soundtrack, The Casualties, Anti-Flag, Less Than Jake, Rise Against, Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts, Helmet, and The Academy Is...

<text>Fred. Olsen &amp; Co. is a holding company based in Oslo, Norway. The company was founded as a shipping firm by Petter Olsen in 1848. Today the company manages the Olsen family&#x27;s interests in a variety of sectors including logistics, energy and consumer goods.

==History==

The company was founded by Petter Olsen (1821–1899) in 1848 and, by his death, the company had 16 ships with offices in Hvitsten. Petter&#x27;s son Thomas Fredrik &quot;Fred&quot; Olsen (1857–1933) or Fred. Olsen, whom the company is named after, took the company from a small business with a few boats into a powerful multinational shipping and shipbuilding business. He had a vision of providing high-quality service on a network of lines, at first domestically and, afterwards, internationally. To do this required steamships, of which the first was acquired in 1897. By 1914, the first motor ship was put in use on the South America line. In World War I, 23 of the company&#x27;s 44 ships were sunk.

After the first Fred. Olsen&#x27;s death, his sons Rudolf Olsen and Thomas Fredrik Olsen took over the company. During their leadership, the company expanded, even entering the aviation business with its own airline Fred. Olsen Flyselskap in addition to later partial ownerships of Det Norske Luftfartselskap, Scandinavian Airlines System, Widerøe, and Sterling Airlines. During World War II, the company&#x27;s ships were in Allied service, though 28 were lost – about half the fleet. Rudolf died in 1951 and Thomas suffered ill health from 1955, eventually dying in 1969.

Thomas&#x27;s son, also named Fred. Olsen (born 1 January 1929), is now in control of the company, after becoming director in 1955. In the early 1970s, Fred. Olsen entered the offshore business, with Dolphin drilling rigs and part of Saga Petroleum. The Saga shares were sold in 1991 while Dolphin is now part of Fred. Olsen Energy. Fred. Olsen also had a major share in the construction and engineering company Aker and currently owns Timex Corporation.

The company has also periodically entered the tanking business, operating a total of 40 ships since 1920. In 1973, it sold its tanking interests but reentered the industry again in 1986, creating the publicly listed company First Olsen Tankers in 1993 that was repurchased in 1999. Fred. Olsen Renewables has been involved in wind power since 1997 with wind farms in Norway, Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 1980, it was involved in Nimslo, a company making 3D cameras, which later went bankrupt.

Fred. Olsen is today owned by Anette S. Olsen, the fifth generation of the family and daughter of Fred. Olsen. She took over ownership of Fred. Olsen &amp; Co. in 1995 and has since been CEO, though Fred. Olsen has remained Chairman.

At the end of 2008, Fred. Olsen sold its part of Comarit and is no longer a stockholder of the Moroccan passenger carrier.

<text>WebMacro is a framework for developing Java Servlets. It enforces a Model-View-Controller framework on a project allowing for a clean separation of concerns in the design. In particular, WebMacro keeps program source code absolutely separate from presentation HTML code. WebMacro is open source software. 

WebMacro was initially created and designed by Justin Wells at Semiotek Inc. in the mid-2000, when the project was taken over by a team at SourceForge. Extensive discussions of WebMacro on the Java Servlet-Interest mailing list at that time may have been influential in Sun Microsystems decision to move their Java Server Pages product to a Model-View-Controller architecture.

WebMacro can also be used to generate arbitrary text output from templates (one of its uses is automated code generation).

The template language is very similar to the language used in Apache Velocity and there is an automated script to perform the migration. 

The Apache Velocity project was started as a clean room re-implementation by Jon Scott Stevens, Geir Magnusson and Jason van Zyl after agreement could not be reached on adoption of the Apache License. 

The current version of WebMacro is BSD licensed.

<text>The takbīr (, , ) is the name for the Arabic phrase &quot;&quot; (, , ).

It is a common Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims and Arabs around the world: in formal Salah (prayer), in the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer), in Hajj, as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress or joy, or to express resolute determination or defiance. The phrase is the official motto of Iran and Iraq. It is also used by Orthodox Arab Christians as an expression of faith.

==Etymology==

The Arabic word () means &quot;big&quot; from the Semitic root &#x27;. A cognate word for this root exists in Hebrew as (). The Arabic word () is the elative form (&quot;bigger, biggest&quot;) of the adjective (&quot;big&quot;). When used in the it is usually translated as &quot;biggest&quot;, but some authors translate it as &quot;bigger&quot;. The term &#x27; itself is the stem II verbal noun of the root , meaning &quot;big&quot;, from which &quot;akbar&quot; &quot;bigger&quot; is derived. The form &quot;&quot; is a nominative of &quot;Allah&quot;, meaning &quot;God&quot;.

The is sometimes translated into English as &quot;God is greater&quot;, which is short for &quot;God is greater than all&quot; (). It is an example of an Arabic idiom where an incomplete sentence, abbreviated because of its familiarity, is considered grammatically correct.

==Usage in Islamic rituals==
This phrase is recited by Muslims in many different situations.

===In prayer===
The phrase is said during each stage of both salah (obligatory prayers, performed five times a day), and nafl (supererogatory prayers, performed at will). The call to prayer by the &quot;muezzin&quot; to those outside the mosque (&quot;adhan&quot;) and the call to those inside to line up for the commencement of prayer (&quot;iqama&quot;) also contain the phrase.

While there are many short prayers like it, the is used more frequently than any other.

===Following births and deaths===
The phrase is used after the birth of a child as a means of praising God. It is also part of Islamic funeral and burial customs.

===During the Eid Festival and the Hajj===
During the festival of Eid al-Adha and the days preceding it, Muslims recite the &quot;&quot;. This is particularly the case on the Day of Arafah.

===During the halal slaughter of animals===
In the process of pronouncing the name of God while performing Dhabihah one must say .

==Other social usage==

The expression &quot; can be used in a variety of situations, from celebrations to times of grief.

In a historical account by someone who was present both at the birth of the ruler Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr (7th century) and at his funeral, the author observes that &quot; was said on both occasions.

===In times of joy and gratitude===
The &quot;&quot; can be used to express joy or surprise. It is also used as applause in religious contexts, such as after a Quran recital, as other forms of applause are considered less appropriate.

It is used to celebrate an election win.
As a multi-purpose phrase, it is sometimes used by Arab football commentators as an expression of amazement, or even as a football chant.

===In battle===
Historically, the &#x27; has been used as a cry of victory during battle. Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s 8th century &quot;Life of Muhammed&quot; narrates two occasions when Muhammad proclaimed the &#x27; during battle.

===Iran===
During the Iranian Revolution of 1979, it was shouted from rooftops in Iran during the evenings as a form of protest. The &quot;&quot; was later adopted as the official motto of Iran. This practice returned in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, which protested the election results.

===Usage by extremists and terrorists===

The phrase has been used as a battle cry by Islamic extremists and terrorists. However, this usage has been denounced by other Muslims.

Professor Khaled A. Beydoun, author of &quot;The New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims&quot; (2023), writes that the association of the phrase &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; with terrorism has been exacerbated by mass media and television pundits. He adds that films and shows also utilize it as a cinematic trope further cementing the association.

===In politics===
In India, Asaduddin Owaisi, president of the AIMIM and Abu Taher Khan, representing TMC, after being elected as Members of the Indian Parliament, ended their oath with the slogan of &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;.

===Usage by Christians ===
The phrase (Allah; meaning God in English) is only used by Arab Christians in third person view, and is rarely mentioned during prayers or church service. The Palestinian Christians use Allah in their prayer to refer to the creator of the world, and the takbir as an expression of their faith. The use of Takbir has been defended by Theodosios Hanna, the Palestinian Orthodox Archbishop of Sebastia.

==Use on flags==
===Afghanistan===
The Afghan constitution that came into force on January 4, 2004, required that &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; be inscribed on the Flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. After the 2021 Taliban offensive, the flag of the first emirate was readopted, and thus the &quot;takbīr&quot; removed from the flag.

===Iran===
&quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; is written in stylized form across the bottom of the green stripe and the top of the red stripe of the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran, adopted in 1980.

===Iraq===
The phrase &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; is written on the center of the flag of Iraq.

During the Gulf War in January 1991, Saddam Hussein held a meeting with top military commanders, where it was decided to add the words &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; (described as the Islamic battle cry) to Iraq&#x27;s flag to boost his secular regime&#x27;s religious credentials, casting himself as the leader of an Islamic army. Hussein described the flag as &quot;the banner of jihad and monotheism&quot;.

In 2004, the US-picked Iraqi Governing Council approved a new flag for Iraq that abandoned symbols of Hussein&#x27;s regime, such as the words &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot;. In January 2008, however, Iraq&#x27;s parliament passed a law to change the flag by leaving in the phrase, but changing the calligraphy of the words &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot;, which had been a copy of Hussein&#x27;s handwriting, to a Kufic script. The Iraqi flag under Hussein had each of the two words of the phrase written in one of the spaces between the stars on the central band; the 2008 flag, while leaving the phrase in, removes the stars.

===Other uses===
A resistance movement that fought British rule in Waziristan, Pakistan, used a red flag bearing &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; in white letters.

The flag used by the Houthis in Yemen also includes bearing &quot;Allāhu akbar&quot; in green letters.

<doc id="173121" wikidata="Q965753" url="?curid=173121" title="Claddagh ring">
<text>A Claddagh ring () is a traditional Irish ring in which a heart represents love, the crown stands for loyalty, and two clasped hands symbolize friendship. The design and customs associated with it originated in Claddagh, County Galway. Its modern form was first produced in the 17th century. Claddagh rings have been used as engagement and wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe. The oldest surviving examples of the Claddagh ring have been forged by Bartholomew Fallon.

==Description==
The Claddagh ring belongs to a group of European finger rings called fede rings. The name derives from the Italian phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;hands [joined] in faith&quot; or &quot;hands [joined] in loyalty&quot;). This group dates to Ancient Rome, where the gesture of clasping hands meant pledging vows. Cut or cast in bezels, they were used as engagement and wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe to signify &quot;plighted troth&quot;.

In recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, corresponding with its popularity as an emblem of Irish identity.

==Origins==
Galway has produced Claddagh rings continuously since at least 1700, but the name &quot;Claddagh ring&quot; was not used before the 1830s. Although there are various myths and legends around the origin of the Claddagh ring, it is almost certain that it originated in or close to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway.

As an example of a maker, Bartholomew Fallon was a 17th-century Irish goldsmith, based in Galway, who made Claddagh rings until circa 1700. His name first appears in the will of one Dominick Martin, also a jeweller, dated 26 January 1676, in which Martin willed Fallon some of his tools. Fallon continued working as a goldsmith until 1700. His are among the oldest surviving examples of the Claddagh ring, in many cases bearing his signature.

There are many legends about the origins of the ring, particularly concerning Richard Joyce, a silversmith from Galway &quot;circa&quot; 1700, who is said to have invented the Claddagh design. Legend has it that Joyce was captured and enslaved by Algerian Corsairs around 1675 while on a passage to the West Indies; he was sold into slavery to a Moorish goldsmith who taught him the craft. King William III sent an ambassador to Algeria to demand the release of any and all British subjects who were enslaved in that country, which at the time would have included Richard Joyce. After fourteen years, Joyce was released and returned to Galway and brought along with him the ring he had fashioned while in captivity: what we&#x27;ve come to know as the Claddagh. He gave the ring to his sweetheart, married, and became a goldsmith with &quot;considerable success&quot;. His initials are in one of the earliest surviving Claddagh rings, but there are three other rings also made around that time bearing the mark of goldsmith Thomas Meade.

The Victorian antiquarian Sir William Jones described the Claddagh, and gives Chambers&#x27; &quot;Book of Days&quot; as the source, in his book &quot;Finger-Ring Lore&quot;. Jones says: 

An account written in 1906 by William Dillon, a Galway jeweller, claimed that the &quot;Claddagh&quot; ring was worn in the Aran Isles, Connemara and beyond. Knowledge of the ring and its customs spread within Ireland and Britain during the Victorian period, and this is when its name became established. Galway jewellers began to market it beyond the local area in the 19th century. Further recognition came in the 20th century.

==Usage and symbolism==
The Claddagh&#x27;s distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart and usually surmounted by a crown. These elements symbolize the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). A &quot;Fenian&quot; Claddagh ring, without a crown, is a slightly different take on the design but has not achieved the level of popularity of the crowned version. Claddagh rings are relatively popular among the Irish and those of Irish heritage, such as Irish Americans, as cultural symbols and as friendship, engagement, and wedding rings.

While Claddagh rings are sometimes used as friendship rings, they are most commonly used as engagement and wedding rings. Mothers sometimes give these rings to their daughters when they come of age. There are several mottos and wishes associated with the ring, such as: &quot;Let love and friendship reign.&quot; In Ireland, the United States, Canada, and other parts of the Irish diaspora, the Claddagh is sometimes handed down mother-to-eldest daughter or grandmother-to-granddaughter.

According to Irish author Colin Murphy, a Claddagh ring is traditionally worn with the intention of conveying the wearer&#x27;s relationship status:
#On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is single and might be looking for love.
#On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is in a relationship; someone &quot;has captured their heart&quot;
#On the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is engaged.
#On the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is married.

There are other localized variations and oral traditions, in both Ireland and the Irish diaspora, involving the hand and the finger on which the Claddagh is worn. Folklore about the ring is relatively recent, not ancient, with the lore about them almost wholly based in oral tradition; there is &quot;very little native Irish writing about the ring&quot;, hence, the difficulty today in finding any scholarly or non-commercial source that explains the traditional ways of wearing the ring.

== Modern usage ==
The Claddagh ring can be seen on the fingers of political figures, Hollywood icons, and literary figures. Public figures including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton have worn the Claddagh ring. Kennedy and his wife received theirs on a trip to Galway in 1963. Reagan and Clinton both received the rings as a gift from Ireland. Royalty, such as Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandria were seen wearing the Claddagh ring after 1849 when they traveled to Ireland. After visiting Ireland with his wife, Walt Disney was seen wearing the Claddagh ring. It is also apparent on the Partners Statue in Disney World. On the statue his ring was facing outward, although he was married.

The ring can be found on actors such as Maureen O&#x27;Hara and John Wayne, who received their rings during the movie &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. Peter O&#x27;Toole and Daniel Day-Lewis were frequently seen wearing the Claddagh ring, as well as Mia Farrow and Gabriel Byrne. Jim Morrison and Patricia Kennealy completed their Celtic wedding with Claddagh rings.

In the television show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, the Claddagh ring is seen when Angel presents the ring to Buffy as a birthday present.

<text>Claddagh () is an area close to the centre of Galway city, where the River Corrib meets Galway Bay. It was formerly a fishing village, just outside the old city walls. It is just across the river from the Spanish Arch, which was the location of regular fish markets where the locals supplied the city with seafood as recently as the end of the 19th century.

The original village of thatched cottages was razed in the 1930s and replaced by a council-housing scheme.

The Claddagh is most famous internationally for the Claddagh ring, which is popular among those of Irish heritage as both a friendship and wedding ring. This traditional design consists of two clasped hands holding a crowned heart, and symbolises love, friendship and loyalty.

The Claddagh area contains a national school, community centre and a Catholic church as well as the new Claddagh Arts Centre.

* Thomas Grady, recipient of the Victoria Cross.
* Bobby Beggs, Dublin-born Gaelic footballer who later played for Galway.

<text>Galway Bay (Irish: &quot;Loch Lurgain&quot; or &quot;Cuan na Gaillimhe&quot;) is a bay on the west coast of Ireland, between County Galway in the province of Connacht to the north and the Burren in County Clare in the province of Munster to the south; Galway city is on the northeast side. The bay is about long and from to in breadth. The Aran Islands (&quot;Oileáin Árann&quot;) are to the west across the entrance and there are numerous small islands within the bay. To the west of Galway, the rocks are granite but to the south they are limestone.

The approaches to the bay between the Aran Islands and the mainland are as follows:
* the North Sound (&quot;An Súnda ó Thuaidh&quot;) lies between Inishmore and Leitir Mealláin in Connemara; known as &quot;Bealach Locha Lurgan&quot; in Irish. 
* Gregory&#x27;s Sound (&quot;Súnda Ghríoghóra&quot;) lies between Inishmore and Inishmaan; known as &quot;Bealach na h-Áite&quot; in Irish.
* Foul Sound (&quot;An Súnda Salach&quot;) lies between Inishmaan and Inisheer; known as &quot;Bealach na Fearbhaighe&quot; in Irish.
* South Sound (&quot;An Súnda ó Theas&quot;), known as &quot;Bealach na Finnise&quot; in Irish, lies between Inisheer and County Clare.

Galway Bay is famous for its unique traditional sailing craft, the Galway hooker.

==Special Area of Conservation==
The coastal parts of Galway Bay have been designated a Special Area of Conservation. This is because of the wide range of important habitat types which include intertidal mud and sandflats, other littoral habitats, coastal lagoons, saltmarshes, turloughs, vegetated cliffs, calcareous grassland and limestone pavements. Galway Bay offers habitat to common seals and otters, and is an important ornithological site for seabirds, waders and waterfowl.

The lagoons are slightly brackish and have a diverse flora, including tasselweed and the algae &quot;Chaetomorpha linum&quot;, &quot;Chara canescens&quot; and &quot;Lamprothamnion papulosum&quot;, all of which are lagoon specialists. There are areas of fen dominated by great fen-sedge and black bog-rush, with common reed, purple moor-grass, bogbean and long-stalked yellow-sedge. The turlough at Ballinacourty forms a temporary lake of about in winter. Wetland species found near the exit-hole of the turlough include amphibious bistort, marsh bedstraw and marsh cinquefoil, with silverweed, water mint and creeping bent in the less frequently flooded places near the edge; sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.) dominate the rest of the area.

The orchid-rich grassland occurs on the flanks of some low drumlin hills to the west of Galway City. The plants here are calcium-loving species including kidney vetch, harebell, spring gentian, yellow-wort, greater knapweed, common spotted-orchid, lesser twayblade, pyramidal orchid and some scrubby juniper. An unusual feature of the saltmarshes is that, beside thrift, lax-flowered sea lavender, red fescue, common scurvygrass, common saltmarsh-grass, saltmarsh rush and sea rush, dwarf brown seaweeds are present among the vegetation.

==Drowning tragedy of 1902==
On 4 May 1902, eight fishermen from a nearby village lost their lives while sailing on Galway Bay, near Kilcolgan. Seven (Patrick Folan, Patrick Burns, Patrick McDonagh, John Barrett, Michael Burke, Michael Dwyer and Stephen Hynes) drowned; Patrick Walsh swam to shore at nearby Kilcolgan, but died of exhaustion on the beach. A fundraising campaign was organised for the families of the drowned fishermen.

<text>Athenry (; ) is a town in County Galway, Ireland, which lies east of Galway city. Some of the attractions of the medieval town are its town wall, Athenry Castle, its priory and its 13th-century street-plan. The town is also well known by virtue of the song &quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot;. The town is in a townland, civil parish and barony of the same name.

==History==
Athenry&#x27;s name derives from the ford (&#x27;Áth&#x27;) crossing the river Clarin just east of the settlement. It was originally called &#x27;Áth na Ríogh&#x27; (&#x27;Ford of the Kings&#x27;) because it was the home area of the Cenél nDéigill kings of Soghan, whose leading lineage were the Ó Mainnín. On some medieval maps of English origin the town is called Kingstown.

Originally, Soghan was surrounded by Uí Maine to the east, Aidhne to the south, and Maigh Seola to the west. However, after 1135, and by 1152, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair forcibly incorporated it into the newly created trícha cét of Clann Taidg, ruled by lords such as Fearghal Ó Taidg an Teaghlaigh, who expelled the Ó Mainnín family. In the 1230s the Ó Taidg an Teaghlaigh family were in turn displaced by Meyler de Bermingham.

The earliest remaining building in the town is Athenry Castle which was built sometime before 1240 by Meyler de Bermingham. In 1241, the Dominican Priory was founded, and became an important center for learning and teaching. It was ostensibly closed during the Protestant Reformation but survived until being desecrated and burned during the Mac an Iarla wars of the 1560s–80s, and was finally vandalised by Cromwellians in the 1650s. The medieval walls around Athenry are among the most complete and best preserved in Ireland, with 70% of the original circuit still standing, along with some of the original towers and the original North gate. The remains of the Lorro Gate were partially unearthed in 2007 during the redevelopment of road works in the area.

In the centre of the town is the &#x27;square&#x27;; markets were held from the 17th century onwards and where the town&#x27;s late 15th century &#x27;Market Cross&#x27; is still located. The monument, which is of Tabernacle or Lantern type, is the only one of its kind in Ireland, and the only medieval cross in the country still standing in situ. A heritage centre now occupies the remains of the mid-13th century St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church adjacent to the town Square. The original medieval church is largely destroyed, but in 1828 a Church of Ireland church was built into its chancel.

In 1791, Jean Antoine Coquebert de Montbret visited the town, which he described as:
Moyode Castle is another tall 16th-century fortified tower house of the Dolphin family, which went to the Persse family. The castle is now restored and inhabited and is located from the town of Athenry.

In 1863, a late Bronze Age shield was found in the vicinity of Athenry, and is now held in the British Museum&#x27;s collection.

==Economy and transport==
===Transport===
By road, Athenry is served by the M6 motorway which links Galway city to Dublin. By rail, it is served by the Athenry railway station, which opened on 1 August 1851 and lies on the Galway–Dublin main line of the Irish rail network. The town is at the junction of the Galway–Dublin line, and the partially complete the Western Railway Corridor (Limerick–Sligo).

===Industry===
In December 2017, funding was announced for a &quot;Food Innovation Hub&quot; in Athenry, projected by its promoters to create 360 jobs within 3 years, and to cost in the region of €3.9m.
==Sport==
Athenry is home to the Gaelic Athletic Association St. Mary Club, which has won three All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship titles.

Athenry Athletics Club has a juvenile and a senior section. The club has produced two Olympic sprinters, Martina McCarthy and Paul Hession. McCarthy represented Ireland in the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics and Hession competed in the men&#x27;s 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Athenry is also home to Athenry F.C., founded in 1971. The club reached the 2006 final of the FAI Junior Cup, and the following year it became the Galway &amp; District League champions for the first time, repeating the same achievement during the 2007–08, 2009–10, and 2014–15 seasons. In 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2016, Athenry also won the Connacht Junior Cup title.

Athenry is also home of the Athenry Golf Club and Athenry Judo Club.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Athenry is twinned with the town of Quimperlé in Brittany (France) and, since 2013, Renews-Cappahayden, Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada).
