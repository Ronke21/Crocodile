<text>Degenerate art ( was a term adopted in the 1920s by the Nazi Party in Germany to describe modern art. During the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art, including many works of internationally renowned artists, was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany on the grounds that such art was an &quot;insult to German feeling&quot;, un-German, Freemasonic, Jewish, or Communist in nature. Those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions that included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art.

&quot;Degenerate Art&quot; also was the title of a 1937 exhibition held by the Nazis in Munich, consisting of 650 modernist artworks that the Nazis had taken from museums, that were poorly hung alongside graffiti and text labels mocking the art and the artists. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria.

While modern styles of art were prohibited, the Nazis promoted paintings and sculptures that were traditional in manner and that exalted the &quot;blood and soil&quot; values of racial purity, militarism, and obedience. Similar restrictions were placed upon music, which was expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences; disapproved music was termed degenerate music. Films and plays were also censored.

==Theories of degeneracy==

The term (or &quot;degeneracy&quot;) had gained currency in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author Max Nordau devised the theory presented in his 1892 book &quot;Degeneration&quot;. Nordau drew upon the writings of the criminologist Cesare Lombroso, whose &quot;The Criminal Man&quot;, published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were &quot;born criminals&quot; whose atavistic personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of modern art, explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. He attacked Aestheticism in English literature and described the mysticism of the German composer Richard Wagner and the Symbolist movement in French literature as a product of mental pathology. Explaining the painterliness of Impressionism as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish and a key figure in the Zionist movement (Lombroso was also Jewish), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German Nazis during the Weimar Republic as a rallying point for their antisemitic and racist demand for Aryan purity in art.

Belief in a Germanic spirit—defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, and noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the Nazis; Richard Wagner explored such ideas in his writings. Beginning before World War I, the well-known German architect and painter Paul Schultze-Naumburg&#x27;s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture, supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s belief that classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art. Schultze-Naumburg subsequently wrote such books as &#x27; (&quot;The art of the Germans. Its nature and its works&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Art and Race&quot;), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless ideals of classical beauty, while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form. By reproducing examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, he graphically reinforced the idea of modernism as a sickness. Alfred Rosenberg developed this theory in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;), published in 1933, which became a best-seller in Germany and made Rosenberg the Party&#x27;s leading ideological spokesman.

== Weimar reactionism ==
The early 20th century was a period of wrenching changes in the arts. The development of modern art at the beginning of the 20th century, albeit with roots going back to the 1860s, denoted a revolutionary divergence from traditional artistic values to ones based on the personal perceptions and feelings of the artists. Under the Weimar government of the 1920s, Germany emerged as a leading center of the &quot;avant-garde&quot;. It was the birthplace of Expressionism in painting and sculpture, of the atonal musical compositions of Arnold Schoenberg, and the jazz-influenced work of Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill. Films such as Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) and F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) brought Expressionism to cinema.

In the visual arts, such innovations as Fauvism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism—following Symbolism and Post-Impressionism—were not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art, which many resented as elitist, morally suspect, and too often incomprehensible. Artistic rejection of traditional authority, intimately linked to the Industrial Revolution, the individualistic values of the Age of Enlightenment and the advance of democracy as the preferred form of government, was exhilarating to some. However, it proved extremely threatening to others, as it took away the security they felt under the older way of things.

Wilhelm II, who took an active interest in regulating art in Germany, criticized Impressionism as &quot;gutter painting&quot; () and forbade Käthe Kollwitz from being awarded a medal for her print series &quot;A Weavers&#x27; Revolt&quot; when it was displayed in the Berlin Grand Exhibition of the Arts in 1898. In 1913, the Prussian house of representatives passed a resolution &quot;against degeneracy in art&quot;.

The Nazis viewed the culture of the Weimar period with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from a conservative aesthetic taste and partly from their determination to use culture as a propaganda tool. On both counts, a painting such as Otto Dix&#x27;s &quot;War Cripples&quot; (1920) was anathema to them. It unsparingly depicts four badly disfigured veterans of the First World War, then a familiar sight on Berlin&#x27;s streets, rendered in caricatured style. (In 1937, it would be displayed in the Degenerate Art exhibition next to a label accusing Dix—himself a volunteer in World War I—of &quot;an insult to the German heroes of the Great War&quot;.)

Art historian Henry Grosshans says that Hitler &quot;saw Greek and Roman art as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [seen as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler even though only Liebermann, Meidner, Freundlich, and Marc Chagall, among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew.&quot; The supposedly &quot;Jewish&quot; nature of all art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented &quot;depraved&quot; subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race. By propagating the theory of degeneracy, the Nazis combined their antisemitism with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.

==Nazi purge==
Once in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes. Various Weimar-era art personalities, including Renner, Huelsenbeck, and the Bauhaus designers, were marginalized.

In 1930 Wilhelm Frick, a Nazi, became Minister for Culture and Education in the state of Thuringia. By his order, 70 mostly Expressionist paintings were removed from the permanent exhibition of the Weimar Schlossmuseum in 1930, and the director of the König Albert Museum in Zwickau, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was dismissed for displaying modern art.

Hitler&#x27;s rise to power on 30 January 1933, was quickly followed by the censorship of modern art: book burnings were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, and curators who had shown a partiality for modern art were replaced by Party members. On April 1, 1933, Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels publicly attacked in Volksparole the most important dealer of modern art, Alfred Flechtheim, who, like many dealers and collectors of &quot;degenerate art&quot;, was Jewish. In September 1933, the (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with Joseph Goebbels, Hitler&#x27;s (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) in charge. Sub-chambers within the Culture Chamber, representing the individual arts (music, film, literature, architecture, and the visual arts) were created; these were membership groups consisting of &quot;racially pure&quot; artists supportive of the Party, or willing to be compliant. Goebbels made it clear: &quot;In future only those who are members of a chamber are allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfill the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded.&quot; By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.

As dictator, Hitler gave his personal taste in art the force of law to a degree never before seen. Only in Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, where Socialist Realism was the mandatory style, had a modern state shown such concern with regulation of the arts. In the case of Germany, the model was to be classical Greek and Roman art, regarded by Hitler as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.

Nonetheless, during 1933–1934 there was some confusion within the Party on the question of Expressionism. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach and Erich Heckel exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, &quot;We National Socialists are not unmodern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters.&quot; However, a faction led by Alfred Rosenberg despised the Expressionists, and the result was a bitter ideological dispute, which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich. This edict left many artists initially uncertain as to their status. The work of the Expressionist painter Emil Nolde, a committed member of the Nazi party, continued to be debated even after he was ordered to cease artistic activity in 1936. For many modernist artists, such as Max Beckmann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and Oskar Schlemmer, it was not until June 1937 that they surrendered any hope that their work would be tolerated by the authorities.

Although books by Franz Kafka could no longer be bought by 1939, works by ideologically suspect authors such as Hermann Hesse and Hans Fallada were widely read. Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment. Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most Hollywood films could be screened, including &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. While performance of atonal music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. Benny Goodman and Django Reinhardt were popular, and leading British and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played &quot;swing&quot; rather than the banned jazz.
==&quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; exhibit==
 
By 1937, the concept of degeneracy was firmly entrenched in Nazi policy. On 30 June of that year Goebbels put Adolf Ziegler, the head of (Reich Chamber of Visual Art), in charge of a six-man commission authorized to confiscate from museums and art collections throughout the Reich, any remaining art deemed modern, degenerate, or subversive. These works were then to be presented to the public in an exhibit intended to incite further revulsion against the &quot;perverse Jewish spirit&quot; penetrating German culture.

Over 5000 works were seized, including 1052 by Nolde, 759 by Heckel, 639 by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and 508 by Max Beckmann, as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, James Ensor, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh. The exhibit, featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of 32 German museums, premiered in Munich on 19 July 1937, and remained on view until 30 November, before traveling to 11 other cities in Germany and Austria.

The exhibit was held on the second floor of a building formerly occupied by the Institute of Archaeology. Viewers had to reach the exhibit by means of a narrow staircase. The first sculpture was an oversized, theatrical portrait of Jesus, which purposely intimidated viewers as they literally bumped into it in order to enter. The rooms were made of temporary partitions and deliberately chaotic and overfilled. Pictures were crowded together, sometimes unframed, usually hung by cord.

The first three rooms were grouped thematically. The first room contained works considered demeaning of religion; the second featured works by Jewish artists in particular; the third contained works deemed insulting to the women, soldiers and farmers of Germany. The rest of the exhibit had no particular theme.

There were slogans painted on the walls. For example:
* Insolent mockery of the Divine under Centrist rule
* Revelation of the Jewish racial soul
* An insult to German womanhood
* The ideal—cretin and whore
* Deliberate sabotage of national defense
* German farmers—a Yiddish view
* The Jewish longing for the wilderness reveals itself—in Germany the Negro becomes the racial ideal of a degenerate art
* Madness becomes method
* Nature as seen by sick minds
* Even museum bigwigs called this the &quot;art of the German people&quot;

Speeches of Nazi party leaders contrasted with artist manifestos from various art movements, such as Dada and Surrealism. Next to many paintings were labels indicating how much money a museum spent to acquire the artwork. In the case of paintings acquired during the post-war Weimar hyperinflation of the early 1920s, when the cost of a kilogram loaf of bread reached 233 billion German marks, the prices of the paintings were of course greatly exaggerated. The exhibit was designed to promote the idea that modernism was a conspiracy by people who hated German decency, frequently identified as Jewish-Bolshevist, although only 6 of the 112 artists included in the exhibition were in fact Jewish.

The exhibition program contained photographs of modern artworks accompanied by defamatory text. The cover featured the exhibition title—with the word , meaning art, in scare quotes—superimposed on an image of Otto Freundlich&#x27;s sculpture .

A few weeks after the opening of the exhibition, Goebbels ordered a second and more thorough scouring of German art collections; inventory lists indicate that the artworks seized in this second round, combined with those gathered prior to the exhibition, amounted to 16,558 works.

Coinciding with the exhibition, the &quot;Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung&quot; (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as Arno Breker and Adolf Wissel. At the end of four months had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby &quot;Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung&quot;.

== Fate of the artists and their work ==
 Avant-garde German artists were branded both enemies of the state and a threat to German culture. Many went into exile. Max Beckmann fled to Amsterdam on the opening day of the exhibit. Max Ernst emigrated to America with the assistance of Peggy Guggenheim. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner committed suicide in Switzerland in 1938. Paul Klee spent his years in exile in Switzerland, yet was unable to obtain Swiss citizenship because of his status as a degenerate artist. A leading German dealer, Alfred Flechtheim, died penniless in exile in London in 1937.

Other artists remained in internal exile. Otto Dix was dismissed from his professorship in Dresden in 1933. He then retreated to the countryside to paint unpeopled landscapes in a meticulous style that would not provoke the authorities. The Reichskulturkammer forbade artists such as Edgar Ende and Emil Nolde from purchasing painting materials. Those who remained in Germany were forbidden to work at universities and were subject to surprise raids by the Gestapo in order to ensure that they were not violating the ban on producing artwork; Nolde secretly carried on painting, but using only watercolors (so as not to be betrayed by the telltale odor of oil paint). Although officially no artists were put to death because of their work, those of Jewish descent who did not escape from Germany in time were sent to concentration camps. Others were murdered in the Action T4 (see, for example, Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler).

After the exhibit, only the most valuable paintings were sorted out to be included in the auction held by Galerie Theodor Fischer (auctioneer) in Luzern, Switzerland, on 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National. The sale consisted of artworks seized from German public museums; some pieces from the sale were acquired by museums, others by private collectors such as Maurice Wertheim who acquired the 1888 self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh that was seized from the Neue Staatsgalerie in Munich belonging to today&#x27;s Bavarian State Painting Collections. Nazi officials took many for their private use: for example, Hermann Göring took 14 valuable pieces, including a Van Gogh and a Cézanne. In March 1939, the Berlin Fire Brigade burned about 4,000 paintings, drawings and prints that had apparently little value on the international market. This was an act of unprecedented vandalism, although the Nazis were well used to book burnings on a large scale.

A large amount of &quot;degenerate art&quot; by Picasso, Dalí, Ernst, Klee, Léger and Miró was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of 27 July 1942, in the gardens of the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris. Whereas it was forbidden to export &quot;degenerate art&quot; to Germany, it was still possible to buy and sell artworks of &quot;degenerate artists&quot; in occupied France. The Nazis considered indeed that they should not be concerned by Frenchmen&#x27;s mental health. As a consequence, many works made by these artists were sold at the main French auction house during the occupation.

The couple Sophie and Emanuel Fohn, who exchanged the works for harmless works of art from their own possession and kept them in safe custody throughout the National Socialist era, saved about 250 works by ostracized artists. The collection survived in South Tyrol from 1943 and was handed over to the Bavarian State Painting Collections in 1964.

After the collapse of Nazi Germany and the invasion of Berlin by the Red Army, some artwork from the exhibit was found buried underground. It is unclear how many of these then reappeared in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, where they still remain.

In 2010, as work began to extend an underground line from Alexanderplatz through the historic city centre to the Brandenburg Gate, a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the &quot;Rote Rathaus&quot;. These included, for example, the bronze cubist-style statue of a female dancer by the artist Marg Moll, and are on display at the Neues Museum.

== Listing ==

The (Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) compiled a 479-page, two-volume typewritten listing of the works confiscated as &quot;degenerate&quot; from Germany&#x27;s public institutions in 1937–38. In 1996 the Victoria and Albert Museum in London acquired the only known surviving copy of the complete listing. The document was donated to the V&amp;A&#x27;s National Art Library by Elfriede Fischer, the widow of the art dealer Heinrich Robert (&quot;Harry&quot;) Fischer. Copies were made available to other libraries and research organisations at the time, and much of the information was subsequently incorporated into a database maintained by the Freie Universität Berlin.

A digital reproduction of the entire inventory was published on the Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s website in January 2014. The V&amp;A&#x27;s publication consists of two PDFs, one for each of the original volumes. Both PDFs also include an introduction in English and German. An online version of the inventory was made available on the V&amp;A&#x27;s website in November 2019, with additional features. The new edition uses IIIF page-turning software and incorporates an interactive index arranged by city and museum. The earlier PDF edition remains available too.

The V&amp;A&#x27;s copy of the full inventory is thought to have been compiled in 1941 or 1942, after the sales and disposals were completed. Two copies of an earlier version of Volume 1 (A–G) also survive in the German Federal Archives in Berlin, and one of these is annotated to show the fate of individual artworks. Until the V&amp;A obtained the complete inventory in 1996, all versions of Volume 2 (G–Z) were thought to have been destroyed. The listings are arranged alphabetically by city, museum and artist. Details include artist surname, inventory number, title and medium, followed by a code indicating the fate of the artwork, then the surname of the buyer or art dealer (if any) and any price paid. The entries also include abbreviations to indicate whether the work was included in any of the various exhibitions (see Degenerate Art Exhibition) or (see The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)).

The main dealers mentioned are Bernhard A. Böhmer (or Boehmer), Karl Buchholz, Hildebrand Gurlitt, and Ferdinand Möller. The manuscript also contains entries for many artworks acquired by the artist Emanuel Fohn, in exchange for other works.

== 21st-century reactions ==
Neil Levi, writing in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, suggested that the branding of art as &quot;degenerate&quot; was only partly an aesthetic aim of the Nazis. Another was the confiscation of valuable artwork, a deliberate means to enrich the regime.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;A Picasso&quot;, a play by Jeffrey Hatcher based loosely on actual events, is set in Paris 1941 and sees Picasso being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of degenerate art.

In the 1964 film &quot;The Train&quot;, a German Army colonel attempts to steal hundreds of &quot;degenerate&quot; paintings from Paris before it is liberated during World War II.

The telephone box is a familiar sight on the streets of the United Kingdom, its associated Crown Dependencies, British Overseas Territories and Malta. Despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years, the traditional British red telephone kiosk can still be seen in many places throughout the UK, and in current or former British colonies around the world. The colour red was chosen to make them easy to spot.

From 1926 onwards, the fascias of the kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown, representing the British government. The red phone box is often seen as a British cultural icon throughout the world. In 2006, the K2 telephone box was voted one of Britain&#x27;s top 10 design icons, which included the Mini, Supermarine Spitfire, London tube map, World Wide Web, Concorde and the AEC Routemaster bus. In 2009, the K2 was selected by the Royal Mail for their &quot;British Design Classics&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.

Many of the phone box designs are protected by trade mark registrations and copyright, held by British Telecommunications plc. In 2019, the prototype K2, located at Burlington House in London since 1924, was listed to Grade II* in &quot;recognition of its iconic design status&quot;.

== Design history ==
=== K1 ===
The first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the United Kingdom Post Office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated K1 (Kiosk No.1). The Post Office had taken over almost all of the country&#x27;s telephone network in 1912. Some local authorities refused to give permission for the K1; Eastbourne Corporation insisted that the kiosks could only be installed if they had thatched roofs. The design of the K1 was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes. As of 2021, there remain fourteen K1 boxes in the UK, including seven that are in museums and museum collections. A further two remain in the Republic of Ireland. Seven of the UK&#x27;s fourteen have been listed at Grade II by Historic England, some of them still located on British streets, including one situated in Trinity Market in Kingston-upon-Hull, and another in Bembridge High Street, Isle of Wight.

=== K2 ===
The red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the London Metropolitan Boroughs which had hitherto resisted the Post Office&#x27;s effort to erect K1 kiosks on their streets.

The Royal Fine Art Commission was instrumental in the choice of the British standard kiosk. Because of widespread dissatisfaction with the GPO&#x27;s design, the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923, but the results were disappointing. The Birmingham Civic Society then produced a design of its own—in reinforced concrete—but it was informed by the Director of Telephones that the design produced by the Office of the Engineer-in-Chief was preferred; as the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; commented, &quot;no one with any knowledge of design could feel anything but indignation with the pattern that seems to satisfy the official mind&quot;. The Birmingham Civic Society did not give up and, with additional pressure from the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Town Planning Institute and the Royal Academy, the Postmaster General was forced to think again; and the result was that the RFAC organised a limited competition.
The organisers invited entries from three respected architects and, along with the designs from the Post Office and from The Birmingham Civic Society, the Fine Arts Commission judged the competition and selected the design submitted by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. The invitation had come at the time when Scott had been made a trustee of Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum: his design for the competition was in the classical style, but topped with a dome reminiscent of those designed by Soane for his own family mausoleum in St Pancras Old Churchyard, and for the mausoleum for Sir Francis Bourgeois at Dulwich Picture Gallery, both in London. However, Gavin Stamp thinks it &quot;unlikely&quot; that Scott was directly inspired by either of these precedents, arguing instead that &quot;a dome above segmental curves is, in fact, a logical solution to the geometrical problem of designing a sculptural termination to a square pillar when a flat top is not suitable&quot;.
The original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around London. That of Scott&#x27;s design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed, in the left entrance arch to the Royal Academy at Burlington House. In 2019, it was listed to Grade II* in &quot;recognition of its iconic design status&quot;.

The Post Office chose to make Scott&#x27;s winning design in cast iron (Scott had suggested mild steel) and to paint it red (Scott had suggested silver, with a &quot;greeny-blue&quot; interior) and, with other minor changes of detail, it was brought into service as the Kiosk No.2 or K2. From 1926 K2 was deployed in and around London and the K1 continued to be erected elsewhere.

=== K3 ===
The K3, introduced in 1929, again by Giles Gilbert Scott, was similar to the K2 but was constructed from reinforced concrete and intended for nationwide use. Cheaper than the K2, it was still significantly more costly than the K1 and so that remained the choice for low-revenue sites. The standard colour scheme for both the K1 and the K3 was a light stone colour, with red glazing bars. A rare surviving K3 kiosk can be seen beside the Penguin Beach exhibit at ZSL London Zoo, where it has been protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and restored to its original colour scheme. There is another in use at Rhynd in Perthshire.
=== K4 ===
The K4 (designed by the Post Office Engineering Department in 1927) incorporated a post box and machines for buying postage stamps on the exterior. Only a single batch of 50 K4 kiosks were built. Some contemporary reports said the noise of the stamp-machines in operation disturbed phone-users, and the rolls of stamps in the machines became damp and stuck together in wet weather. This has been widely repeated (including by Stamp) but Johannessen chose not to, having found no evidence to support the story. Ten survive with four in public use at Frodsham, Warrington, Whitley Bay and near Tunstall, East Riding of Yorkshire. A fine example of a K4 may also be found outside the station building at Bewdley on the Severn Valley Railway. There is a fully restored K4 (including correct telephone and coin operations) at the Bury Transport Museum, Greater Manchester.

=== K5 ===
The K5 was a metal-faced plywood construction introduced in 1934 and designed to be assembled and dismantled and used at exhibitions. It is not known how many were produced, and there is little evidence they ever reached more than prototype stage. A replica (constructed using the original drawings) can be seen at the Avoncroft Museum (Bromsgrove, Worcestershire), as part of its National Telephone Kiosk Collection.

=== K6 ===

In 1935 the K6 was designed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of George V. It was consequently sometimes known as the &quot;Jubilee&quot; kiosk. It went into production in 1936. The K6 was the first red telephone kiosk to be extensively used outside London, and many thousands were deployed in virtually every town and city, replacing most of the existing kiosks and establishing thousands of new sites. In 1935 there had been 19,000 public telephones in the UK: by 1940, thanks to the K6, there were 35,000.

The design was again by Scott, and was essentially a smaller and more streamlined version of the K2, intended to be produced at a considerably cheaper cost, and to occupy less pavement space. The principal differences between the two designs were:
* Size. The K6 was tall and weighed 13.5 cwt (0.69 tonnes). This compared with and 1.25 tons (1.27 tonnes) for the K2.
* Elements of the design were simplified and streamlined, in keeping with the &quot;moderne&quot; aesthetics of the 1930s. The Grecian fluting was removed from the door and window surrounds, and the previously separate pediment and frieze were merged.
* The Crown motif (see below), which had previously been pierced through the ironwork to give ventilation, was now embossed in bas-relief. A new, separate ventilation slot was provided.
* A new glazing pattern was introduced. The door and two glazed sides of the K2 each had 18 equal-sized panes of glass arranged in 6 rows of 3. In the K6 the number of rows was increased to 8, and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side. This improved visibility, and gave a more horizontal appearance to the windows, again in keeping with &quot;moderne&quot; principles.
The K6 has since become a British icon, but it was not universally loved at the start. The red colour caused particular local difficulties and there were many requests for less visible colours. The Post Office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty. Ironically, some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red. The paint colour used most widely today is known as &quot;currant red&quot; and is defined by a British Standard, BS381C-Red539.

==== Kiosk installation: the early years ====
With continued demand for K6 kiosks, siting them was more widespread than ever before. A purpose built kiosk trailer was designed from 1953 to reduce the running costs of cranes.

==== Numbers installed ====
The K6 was the most prolific kiosk in the UK and its growth, from 1935, can be seen from the BT archives:

=== Manufacture ===
The K1 and the later K3 concrete kiosks were produced at various (and largely unrecorded) locations, around the country. This made quality control and supervision of the manufacturing process difficult, when compared to the GPO&#x27;s experience with cast-iron post boxes, and was an important aspect of the GPO&#x27;s move towards cast-iron telephone kiosks. Over the years, five foundries were involved in this work for the Post Office. Lion Foundry in Kirkintilloch, MacFarlane (Saracen Foundry), and Carron Ironworks near Falkirk all produced batches of the K2, the K6 and the K8. Carron produced the single batch of K4 kiosks. The other two manufacturers were McDowall Steven and Bratt Colbran, both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-war Mk1 K6.

Many kiosks have been fitted with replacement backs; unmodified examples usually have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside at the bottom of their back panel. The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel. These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, the year of manufacture is also included. The non-BT K6 kiosks erected later, usually painted black, are for the most part new castings from new manufacturers.

=== Crown ===
From 1926 onwards, the fascias of Post Office kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown, representing the British government, of which the Post Office was an agency. The design was initially the &quot;Tudor Crown&quot;, then in widespread use in government service. The same crown was used in all parts of the United Kingdom and British Empire. On the K2, the design was pierced through the ironwork, and acted as a ventilation hole. On the K6, a separate ventilation slot was provided, and the crown was embossed in bas-relief.

In 1953 the new Queen, Elizabeth II, decided to replace the Tudor Crown in all contexts with a representation of the actual crown used for most English, and later British, coronations, St Edward&#x27;s Crown; it began to appear on the fascias of K6 kiosks.

St Edward&#x27;s Crown was initially used on kiosks in all parts of the United Kingdom. However, in Scotland, following protests over the use of English insignia, the Post Office (like other government agencies there) began to use, from 1955, a representation of the actual Crown of Scotland. To accommodate the two different designs of crown on K6 kiosks, the fascia sections were cast with a slot in them, into which a plate bearing the appropriate crown was inserted before the roof section was fitted.

The crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box. However, since the early 1990s, when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised, British Telecom picked out the crowns (on both K2s and K6s) in gold paint.

Kiosks installed in Kingston upon Hull were not fitted with a crown, as those kiosks were installed by the Hull Corporation (later Hull City Council, then Kingston Communications). All boxes in Hull were also painted in cream.

=== Modernisation – K7 &amp; K8 ===

In 1959 architect Neville Conder was commissioned to design a new box. The K7 design went no further than the prototype stage. K8, introduced in 1968, was designed by Bruce Martin. It was used primarily for new sites; around 11,000 were installed, replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair. The K8 retained a red colour scheme, but it was a different shade of red: a slightly brighter &quot;Poppy Red&quot;, which went on to become the standard colour across all kiosks.

The K8 featured a single large glass panel on two sides and the door. While improving visibility and illumination inside the box, these were vulnerable to damage. There were two versions, the Mk1 and the Mk2, differing mainly in the detail of the roof and the surround of the &#x27;TELEPHONE&#x27; opals.

In order to create a new box with easier access, lower maintenance and brighter lighting, the Post Office introduced a prototype run of &quot;Croydon&quot; telephone boxes from 1972, so-named as they were erected in Croydon. The Croydon boxes, painted bright yellow with a black handset silhouette, were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes. However, although the trials were successful, the quality of the materials and design made it too expensive for the Post Office to mass-produce, and the design was not adopted.

=== Privatisation and the KX series ===
In 1980, in preparation for privatisation, Post Office Telephones was rebranded as British Telecom (BT). In February 1981, it was announced that all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow, which was BT&#x27;s new corporate colour. There was an immediate public outcry; the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; launched a campaign &quot;against the yellow peril&quot; and questions were asked in Parliament. In the House of Lords, the Earl of Gowrie, the Minister of State for Employment, called on BT &quot;to abandon this ridiculous scheme&quot;. In the House of Commons, Mark Lennox-Boyd MP asked Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher if she would treat the decision &quot;with the greatest possible dismay&quot;. Thatcher, who was responsible for the privatisation, would only say that she could &quot;see my honourable Friend&#x27;s point&quot;. Shortly afterwards, BT announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours &quot;as an experiment&quot; and that no final decision had been reached.

After privatisation in 1982, British Telecom introduced the KX100, a more utilitarian design, which began to replace most of the existing boxes. The KX100 was one of a series of designs, including the wheelchair-accessible open-sided KX200, and the triangular-footprint KX300. In January 1985, Nick Kane, the Director of Marketing for BT Local Communications Services announced that the old red telephone boxes would be replaced because they &quot;...no longer meet the needs of our customers. Few people like to use them. They are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and cannot be used by handicapped people&quot;. This time, BT did not relent, despite another vociferous campaign.

Many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status. Several thousand others were left on low-revenue mostly rural sites, but many thousands of recovered K2 and K6 boxes were sold off. Some kiosks have been converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes. In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes were used to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes. In January 2020 it was estimated that 8,000 traditional red telephone boxes remained in public service. The KX+, better known as the KX100 PLUS, introduced in 1996 had a domed roof reminiscent of the familiar K2 and K6. Subsequent designs departed significantly from the old-style red boxes. BT followed the KX series with the Multi.phone in 1999 and the ST6 in 2007.

=== InLinkUK ===

BT is one of the partners in InLinkUK, a communications service intended to replace over 1,000 payphones in major UK cities. The InLink stations, renamed &quot;Street Hubs&quot; by BT after InLinkUK Ltd failed, provide free public Wi-Fi, phone calls and device charging.

== Later use ==
In 1990, phone boxes peaked at about 100,000. In 2021, 21,000 remained in use. Regulator Ofcom was to protect 5,000 public phone boxes around the UK from closure where there are high accident rates—e.g. mountain rescue—or poor mobile telephone coverage. Some are required to have battery support in case of power cuts. Ofcom&#x27;s criteria to protect a phone box from removal are: its location is not covered by all four main mobile networks; or it is located at an accident or suicide hotspot; or at least 52 calls have been made from it over the past 12 months; or exceptional circumstances require a public call box. BT and Kcom, which maintain phone boxes, could propose to remove boxes that did not meet one of these criteria, subject to formally consulting local communities first. After Storm Arwen in 2021 communities lost power and mobile phone service, and reported that they wished they still had their phone box.
Payphone use had dropped from about 800 million minutes in 2002 to 7 million in 2020, as 96% of UK adults had a mobile phone. In the year to May 2020 about 5 million calls were made from phone boxes, with 150,000 to emergency services, 25,000 to protection service ChildLine, and 20,000 to the suicide protection service Samaritans.

As organisations can buy a red phone box for £1 for other uses, over 6,000 have been converted to community libraries, to house public defibrillators, and for other purposes. One has been converted into an aquarium. Some boxes are rented out for an initial fee of thousands of pounds, then perhaps £400 a month—box with plenty of passing traffic can be a good place to make sales from.

Phone boxes have always been unprofitable, even in their heyday, and more so following the collapse in usage; vandalism was common, and boxes full of money an invitation to theft.

=== Adoption ===
Little-used red telephone boxes can be adopted by parish councils in England for other uses. Some examples are shown below. The kiosk may be used for any legal purpose other than telephony and the contract of sale includes the following clause 5.5.4:
The buyer shall covenant not to sell, lease or license the Goods to a competitor to the Seller nor to permit a competitor to install electronic communications apparatus (as defined in schedule 2 of the Telecommunications Act 1984) within the Goods or itself (as the Buyer) shall not install, provide or operate any form of electronic communications apparatus (as defined in schedule 2 of the Telecommunications Act 1984) within the Goods.
It is likely that BT wishes to prohibit the kiosk from being re-used for electronic communications because they retain trade mark rights in the boxes in relation to telecommunication services and such use might be assumed to be provided by BT, which would confuse consumers as to the source of the services provided. In the US, there is an active movement seeking new telecom uses for little-used telephone booths, for example as wi-fi hotspots.

=== Libraries ===

During 2009 a K6 in the village of Westbury-sub-Mendip in Somerset was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village. Similar libraries now exist in the villages of North Cadbury in Somerset, Great Budworth in Cheshire and other locations. One such box was donated by Cumbernauld&#x27;s town twinning association and installed as a library in Bron, France. The Telephone Box Book Exchange in Cutnall Green opened in June 2016.

Another K6 stands in Barga, Italy, where it is used as a BookCrossing library. It was donated in 2008 by a couple from Edinburgh, Scotland.

In Vittoriosa, Malta a K6 has also been converted into a mini-library.

=== Art gallery ===
Also in 2009, the town of Settle in North Yorkshire established the Gallery on the Green in a K6, which had been adopted by the Parish Council. The Gallery has featured a range of exhibitions of both notable artists and photographers (Tessa Bunney, Martin Parr, Mariana Cook) and local community groups. Its most famous contributor was Brian May, with his stereoscopic photography show &#x27;A Village Lost and Found&#x27;.

=== Defibrillator ===

Following a competition by a Girl Guide unit in 2011 to find a use for their local disused telephone box in Glendaruel, Argyll, it has been fitted with a defibrillator. The equipment can be accessed only by following instructions from the Scottish Ambulance Service during an emergency call. The conversion of the box was paid for by BT under the Adopt A Kiosk scheme and the defibrillator was supplied by the Community Heartbeat Trust. Similar installations have been made in many other places, including Loweswater, Cumbria, Auchenblae, Aberdeenshire, Withernwick, East Riding of Yorkshire, and Witney, Oxfordshire.

=== Other ===
In 2010, in the village of Brookwood, Surrey, a project was initiated to restore and preserve the sole remaining K6 kiosk in the village. The kiosk had been adopted by Woking Borough Council in 2009 and a group of residents set about restoring the kiosk. This was achieved through private donations and sponsorship from local businesses. A blog detailed the restoration.

, remanufactured units were offered for sale by X2Connect.

From October 2014, several of London&#x27;s disused K6 telephone boxes have been painted green and converted to free mobile phone chargers named Solarboxes. They have been considered an outdoor kiosk alternative to indoor chargers such as the Chargebox.

== Usage elsewhere ==

Several of these distinctive telephone boxes have been installed on the Norman, Oklahoma, campus of the University of Oklahoma, where they continue to serve their originally intended function. Elsewhere in the United States, a few have also been installed in downtown Glenview, Illinois, and Glencoe, Illinois. There is also one outside the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. A red telephone box can also be found on the Courthouse Square in Oxford, Mississippi. Two are in use in Tennessee: one is on the square in Collierville, Tennessee, and the other is located next to Pepper Palace in The Village Shops shopping centre in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. A telephone box sits outside The Poppy &amp; Parliament restaurant on the courthouse square in Huntsville, Alabama.
A red telephone box is in use in the student centre of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition, there is a red telephone box outside the town building (town hall/police station/post office) in the tiny mountain town of Rowe, Massachusetts, which is an original installation dating back to when the town of Rowe first got telephone service. Two red telephone boxes are on display at the World Showcase area of Disney&#x27;s Epcot in Orlando, Florida, one located in the United Kingdom area and one in the Canada area. One is on display at English Gardens – A Place for Weddings in Winter Park close to downtown Orlando. An original K6 can also be found outside the Allied Building in Treasure Island, Florida. There are also a few red boxes at the Ellenton Outlet Mall, just off I-75, near Bradenton, Florida. These still have their original STD code cards in place and have working US payphone equipment. There is a red telephone box in Westminster, Maryland on the corner of West Main Street and Rt. 27 outside Johanson&#x27;s Dining House. In Lake Havasu City, Arizona, a few K6s arrived when the old London Bridge was preserved there.
Australia and New Zealand each had their own design of red telephone box, and some examples have been preserved in sensitive or historic sites. A brief and colourful campaign was run to &quot;save&quot; the red telephone box in New Zealand by the Wizard of New Zealand. Many K3 phone boxes survive in Portugal, where they were exported by the Anglo-Portuguese Telephone Company, and where the climate was less harmful to their concrete fabric than in Britain. They are a common sight, for example, in the city of Porto. British K6 phone boxes are to be found, painted green, in the centre of Kinsale, a historic town in County Cork in the Republic of Ireland. Red telephone boxes are also found across Malta, some islands of the West Indies such as Antigua, Barbados, as well as in Cyprus, showing that the colonial influence is still present. In France, boxes can also be found on the border of Saint-Maurice (rue de Gravelle), close to Paris, and in the centre of the town of Chinon. In Germany, some stands in the towns of Bad Münstereifel, Bielefeld and Eppingen. Thames Town, an imitation English town on the outskirts of Shanghai, China includes red telephone boxes. In 2008, K6 telephone boxes were imported from the United Kingdom to the Israeli city of Petah Tikva and installed on its main street, Haim Ozer.

===Kingston upon Hull=== 
Kingston upon Hull ran a municipal telephone system from 1904. There were several such municipal services in the UK, but whereas most had been brought under the Post Office monopoly by 1913, Hull&#x27;s, being very efficient, was allowed to remain under the control of Hull Corporation (the city council). As a result, although the Corporation used K6 kiosks, they were painted cream and had the crown omitted from the design. The Hull telephone system was privatised in 1999 and taken over by Kingston Communications (KC; later renamed KCOM Group in 2007). In about 2007 KC removed many of the cream K6 boxes. After public complaints at the loss of heritage it was agreed that about 125 of the boxes would be retained, and they remain in use. KC also allocated limited numbers (around 1,000) for sale to the public and many were sold off even before they had been removed from service. Hull also continues to use K8 and KX100 PLUS kiosks, and in the past has used other non-GPO/BT designs. In 2023 Historic England designated nine of the cream boxes as Grade II listed structures.

=== Crown Dependencies ===

The telephone services of the Crown Dependencies were split at various times from the GPO.

==== Guernsey ====
Guernsey Telecoms painted its kiosks yellow with white window frames; they were repainted in blue when the company was sold to Cable and Wireless in 2002.

==== Jersey ====
Jersey Telecom used locally made kiosks, painted in just yellow, or cream and yellow.

==== Isle of Man ====
Manx Telecom has left its kiosks in the red colour used by its predecessors British Telecom and the GPO. The telephone box in Cregneash was temporarily painted green, but this was only for a film and the phone box is now red again.

=== Overseas territories ===
==== Cyprus ====
At least one red telephone box is present in Dhekelia.

==== Gibraltar ====
Gibtelecom operates red kiosks of various vintages.

== UK cultural landmark ==
=== Appearance in popular culture ===

A cultural icon of the UK, the red telephone box has appeared in British pop culture. In music it has featured in Adele&#x27;s video for the 2015 single &quot;Hello&quot;, the front cover of One Direction&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, and the back cover of David Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1972). It was the subject of the 1980 single &quot;Red Frame/White Light&quot; by OMD. It also featured in Peter Gabriel’s 1993 tour Secret World Live, being on stage for the opening of the show, and used in the song &quot;Come Talk to Me&quot;. A phone receiver also features on the live album cover.

In film it features in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thriller &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) when Frank (John Longden) reveals a glove that Alice (Anny Ondra) left behind at the scene of a murder inside the phone box of her father’s tobacco store. It appears in a scene in the 1955 black comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; where a motley gang of crooks led by Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness) cram into one. In the gangland drama &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), Jack Carter (Michael Caine) makes a critical call from a phone box in his hometown. In the cult black comedy &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987), Withnail (Richard E. Grant) calls his agent from a telephone box, and complains about its coin-operated system. A red phone box near Scotland Yard appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007) as Harry Potter and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry of Magic.

In 2016, British chef Gordon Ramsay opened a British-themed fish restaurant in the Las Vegas Strip, with the doors to the entrance resembling the red telephone box.

=== Use in contemporary art ===

==== &quot;Out of Order&quot; ====
Scottish sculptor David Mach created the permanent public work &quot;Out of Order&quot; in 1989 in Kingston upon Thames, London. It takes the form of a row of twelve K6 telephone boxes, the first one upright, the others gradually falling over like dominoes. It was originally intended that the last upright box was to contain a working telephone.

==== BT Artboxes ====

In 2012, BT helped celebrate the 25th anniversary of the UK&#x27;s free-phone charity ChildLine by commissioning eighty artists to design and decorate full-sized K6 replicas. These were displayed in public spaces across London and then auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s as BT Artboxes. Artists included Peter Blake, Willie Christie, David Mach, Denis Masi, Zaha Hadid and Ian Ritchie.

<doc id="174881" wikidata="Q219141" url="?curid=174881" title="Zombie (cocktail)">
<text>The zombie is a Tiki cocktail made of fruit juices, liqueurs, and various rums. It first appeared in late 1934, invented by Donn Beach at his Hollywood &quot;Don the Beachcomber&quot; restaurant. It was popularized on the East coast soon afterwards at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==History==
Legend has it that Donn Beach originally concocted the zombie to help a hung-over customer get through a business meeting. The customer returned several days later to complain that he had been turned into a zombie for his entire trip. Its smooth, fruity taste works to conceal its extremely high alcoholic content. &quot;Don the Beachcomber&quot; restaurants limited their customers to two zombies apiece because of their potency, which Beach said could make one &quot;like the walking dead.&quot;

According to the original recipe, the zombie cocktail included three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and &quot;Don&#x27;s Mix&quot;, a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice.

Beach was very cautious with the recipes of his original cocktails. His instructions for his bartenders contained coded references to ingredients, the contents of which were only known to him. Beach had reason to worry; a copy of the zombie was served at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair by a man trying to take credit for it named Monte Proser (later of the mob-tied Copacabana).

Beach&#x27;s original recipes for the zombie and other Tiki drinks have been published in &quot;Sippin&#x27; Safari&quot; by Jeff &quot;Beachbum&quot; Berry. Berry researched the origins of many Tiki cocktails, interviewing bartenders from Don the Beachcomber&#x27;s and other original Tiki places and digging up other original sources. &quot;Sippin&#x27; Safari&quot; details Beach&#x27;s development of the zombie with three different recipes dating from 1934 to 1956.

The zombie was occasionally served heated (a drink more commonly known today as the I.B.A. hot zombie), as outlined by the Catering Industry Employee (CIE) journal: &quot;Juice of 1 lime, unsweetened pineapple juice, bitters, 1 ounce heavily bodied rum, 2 ounces of Gold Label rum, 1 ounce of White Label rum, 1 ounce of apricot-flavored brandy, 1 ounce of papaya juice&quot;

The cocktail is named in the lyrics for the song &quot;Haitian Divorce&quot; on the 1976 album &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; by Steely Dan.

== Preparation ==
Preparing a cocktail consists of adding a glass of ice and all ingredients to a shaker or juicer (except for Rum 151, if it&#x27;s included in the recipe at all), shaking the closed shaker vigorously for five seconds, and serving in a glass. Then pour the 151 rum over the mixture so that it lies on top of the other ingredients, and finally, garnish the glass with a slice of some fruit of your choice. 

== Options ==
One variation on the recipe is to keep the base of the various rum, brandy, and Bacardi varieties and substitute orange, pineapple, lemon, and grenadine juices for the pineapple and papaya juices. Another version is based on giving up brandy and substituting juices from sweeter flavors to more citrusy ones like lemon, pineapple and papaya. 

The zombie voodoo cocktail is a variation of the classic zombie cocktail. It contains unique ingredients like absinthe and blackberries that give it a distinctive flavor. This version retains the tropical base of the original zombie, but takes on a slightly different flavor thanks to the added ingredients.

==Tiki culture influence==
Due to the popularity of the cocktail during the Tiki craze, from the 1930s, and the fact that Beach kept his recipe secret and occasionally altered it, there are many variations of the zombie served at other restaurants and bars (some tasting nothing like the original cocktail). The word &quot;zombie&quot; also began to be used at other tiki themed establishments, such as at the Zombie Hut and &quot;Zombie Village&quot;.

Trader Vic also listed a recipe for the zombie in his 1947 &quot;Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot;. Other competitors created drinks linked to the zombie. At Stephen Crane&#x27;s Chicago Kon-Tiki Ports restaurant they featured a drink on the menu called &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;: &quot;Makes the dead walk and talk. For those who want immediate action - meet the first cousin to the famous &#x27;zombie&#x27;. Demerara 151 rum. 90¢.&quot;

<text>Becan (Spanish: Becán) is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Becan is located near the center of the Yucatán Peninsula, in the present-day Mexican state of Campeche, about 150 km (93.2 mi) north of Tikal. The Maya sites of Balamku, Calakmul, Chicanna and Xpuhil are nearby. The name &quot;Becan&quot; was bestowed on the site by archaeologists who rediscovered the site, meaning &quot;ravine or canyon formed by water&quot; in Yukatek Maya, after the site&#x27;s most prominent and unusual feature, its surrounding ditch.

==History==
Archaeological evidence shows that Becan was occupied in the middle Preclassic Maya period, about 550 BCE, and grew to a major population and ceremonial center a few hundred years later in the late Preclassic. The population and scale of construction declined in the early classic (c 250 CE), although it was still a significant site, and trade goods from Teotihuacan have been found. A ditch and ramparts were constructed around the site at this time. There is a ditch that runs the circumference of the city which covers approximately 25 hectares (61.7 acres). Around 500 the population again increased dramatically and many large new buildings were constructed, mostly in the &quot;Rio Bec&quot; style of Maya architecture. Construction of major buildings and elite monuments stopped about 830, although ceramic evidence show that the site continued to be occupied for some time thereafter, although the population went into decline and Becan was probably abandoned by about 1200.

The site was first documented in the archaeological literature in 1934 by archaeologists Karl Ruppert and John Denison on an expedition to the region sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who named it &quot;Becan&quot; after the conspicuous ditch surrounding the center of the city; the ancient name of the site is not known. From 1969 to 1971 archaeological excavations were made at Becan sponsored by Tulane University and the National Geographic Society.

In 1984, while conducting research at the site, one of Mexico&#x27;s &quot;most important archeologists&quot;, , fell from the pyramid at Becán, becoming paralyzed. On 13 July 2001, at a homage paid to Piña by the National Museum of Anthropology, it was announced that Lucía Campaña, had discovered a pre-Hispanic tomb in the ninth building at the site, the previous day.

<doc id="174883" wikidata="Q826716" url="?curid=174883" title="Catastrophism">
<text>In geology, catastrophism is the theory that the Earth has largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.
This contrasts with uniformitarianism (sometimes called gradualism), according to which slow incremental changes, such as erosion, brought about all the Earth&#x27;s geological features. The proponents of uniformitarianism held that the present was &quot;the key to the past&quot;, and that all geological processes (such as erosion) throughout the past resembled those that can be observed today. Since the 19th-century disputes between catastrophists and uniformitarians, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the scientific consensus accepts that some catastrophic events occurred in the geologic past, but regards these as explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Proponents of catastrophism proposed that each geological epoch ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as major floods and the rapid formation of major mountain chains. Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred became extinct, to be replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of Noah&#x27;s flood.

The French scientist Georges Cuvier (17691832) popularised the concept of catastrophism in the early 19th century; he proposed that new life-forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
In the early development of geology, efforts were made in a predominantly Christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of Creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was &quot;stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the Greeks&quot;, an example being Plutarch&#x27;s account of the Ogygian flood.

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French anatomist and paleontologist Georges Cuvier. His motivation was to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession that he and others were observing in the fossil record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to Noah&#x27;s flood. Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the French Revolution, avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings. Cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on Earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.

By contrast in Britain, where natural theology was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including William Buckland and Robert Jameson interpreted Cuvier&#x27;s work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier&#x27;s introduction into English, publishing it under the title &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot;. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier&#x27;s revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world. Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier&#x27;s work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration. Eventually, Buckland abandoned flood geology in favor of the glaciation theory advocated by Louis Agassiz, following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time, or as the concept came to be known deep time, were found in the writing of James Hutton, sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist Charles Lyell built upon Hutton&#x27;s ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth&#x27;s features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland. One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism observes the existence of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that Earth&#x27;s history is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism (&quot;The present is the key to the past&quot;) and gradualism (&quot;geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time&quot;) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists&#x27; rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with religion and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered miraculous rather than natural events.

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 J Harlen Bretz published a paper on the channeled scablands formed by glacial Lake Missoula in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the Penrose Medal; the Geological Society of America&#x27;s highest award.

===Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s views===

In the 1950s, Immanuel Velikovsky propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet Venus is a former &quot;comet&quot; which was ejected from Jupiter and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current orbit. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical plagues of Egypt, the biblical reference to the &quot;Sun standing still&quot; for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth&#x27;s rotation), and the sinking of Atlantis. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky&#x27;s conjectures.

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent geomorphological thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===

In 1980, Walter and Luis Alvarez published a paper suggesting that a asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the non-avian dinosaurs, leaving behind the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). In 1990, a candidate crater marking the impact was identified at Chicxulub in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. These events sparked a wide acceptance of a scientifically based catastrophism with regard to certain events in the distant past. 

Since then, the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Moon-formation===

Modern theories also suggest that Earth&#x27;s anomalously large moon was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in &quot;Icarus&quot; in 1975, William K. Hartmann and Donald R. Davis proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large planetesimal early in Earth&#x27;s formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the Moon, thus explaining the Moon&#x27;s lesser density and lack of an iron core. The impact theory does have some faults; some computer simulations show the formation of a ring or multiple moons post impact, and elements are not quite the same between the Earth and Moon.

<doc id="174892" wikidata="Q982102" url="?curid=174892" title="Ishi">
<text>Ishi ( – March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the Native American Yahi people from the present-day state of California in the United States. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Widely described as the &quot;last wild Indian&quot; in the U.S., Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern North American culture, and was the last known Native manufacturer of stone arrowheads. In 1911, aged 50, he emerged at a barn and corral, from downtown Oroville, California.

&quot;Ishi&quot;, which means &quot;man&quot; in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: &quot;I have none, because there were no people to name me&quot;, meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf.

Anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, took Ishi in, studied him, and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was depicted and discussed in multiple films and books, notably the biographical account &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961.

==Biography==
===Early life===

In 1865, the Yahi were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of them were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was popularly believed to be extinct. Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848–55, the Yahi probably numbered several hundred, while the total Yana in the larger region numbered around 3,000.

The gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining damaged water supplies and killed fish; deer became scarcer. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. The northern Yana group went extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of Redding Rancheria) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, who set bounties of 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head on the natives. In 1865, settlers attacked a group of Yahi while they were asleep.

Richard Burrill wrote, in &quot;Ishi Rediscovered&quot;: 
In 1908, a group of surveyors came across the camp inhabited by two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his mother, and a woman who was either a relative or Ishi&#x27;s wife. The former three fled while the elderly woman tried to hide herself, as she was crippled and unable to flee. The surveyors ransacked the camp, taking fur capes, arrows, bows, and nets. When Ishi appeared near Oroville three years later, he was alone and communicated through mime that his three companions had all died, his uncle and mother by drowning.

===Arrival into European American society===
After the 1908 encounter, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness. It is unknown exactly when the rest of his family died. Starving and alone, Ishi, at around the age of 50, emerged on August 29, 1911, at the Charles Ward slaughterhouse back corral near Oroville after forest fires in the area. He was found pre-sunset by Floyd Hefner, son of the next-door dairy owner (who was in town), who was &quot;hanging out&quot;, and who went to harness the horses to the wagon for the ride back to Oroville, for the workers and meat deliveries. Witnessing slaughterhouse workers included Lewis &quot;Diamond Dick&quot; Cassings, a &quot;drugstore cowboy&quot;. When Sheriff J.B. Webber arrived, he directed Adolph Kessler, a 19-year-old slaughterhouse worker, to handcuff Ishi, who smiled and complied.

The &quot;wild man&quot; caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. University of California, Berkeley anthropology professors read about him and &quot;brought him&quot; to the &quot;Affiliated Colleges Museum&quot; (1903–1931), in an old law school building on the University of California&#x27;s Affiliated Colleges campus on Parnassus Heights, San Francisco. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked as a janitor and lived at the museum the remaining five years of his life.

In October 1911, Ishi, Sam Batwi, T. T. Waterman, and A. L. Kroeber, went to the Orpheum Opera House in San Francisco to see Lily Lena (Alice Mary Ann Mathilda Archer, born 1877), the &quot;London Songbird,&quot; known for &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot; costume changes. Lena gave Ishi a piece of gum as a token.

On May 13, 1914, Ishi, Thomas Talbot Waterman, Alfred L. Kroeber, Saxton Pope, and Saxton Pope Jr. (11 years old), took Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Cascade Limited&quot; overnight train, from the Oakland Mole and Pier to Vina, California, on a trek in the homelands of the Deer Creek area of Tehama county, researching and mapping for the University of California, fleeing on May 30, 1914, during the Lassen Peak volcano eruption.

Waterman and Kroeber, director of the museum, studied Ishi closely and interviewed him at length in an effort to reconstruct Yahi culture. He described family units, naming patterns, and the ceremonies he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older survivors in his group. He identified material items and showed the techniques by which they were made.

In February 1915, during the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, Ishi was filmed in the Sutro Forest with the actress Grace Darling for Hearst-Selig News Pictorial, No. 30.

In June 1915, for three months, Ishi lived in Berkeley with Waterman and his family.

In the summer of 1915, Ishi was interviewed on his native Yana language, which was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects. These wax cylinders have had the sound recovered by Carl Haber&#x27;s and Vitaliy Fadeyev&#x27;s optical IRENE technology.

===Death===
Lacking acquired immunity to common diseases, Ishi was often ill. He was treated by Pope, a professor of medicine at UCSF. Pope became a close friend of Ishi, and learned from him how to make bows and arrows in the Yahi way. He and Ishi often hunted together. Ishi died of tuberculosis on March 25, 1916. It is said that his last words were, &quot;You stay. I go.&quot; Kroeber, who was in New York at the time of Ishi&#x27;s death, tried to prevent an autopsy on his body, sending letters and telegrams strongly stating his objections. He believed Yahi tradition called for the body to remain intact. But Pope performed the autopsy, per hospital protocol.

Ishi&#x27;s brain was preserved and his body cremated, in the mistaken belief that cremation was the traditional Yahi practice. His friends placed several items with his remains before cremation: &quot;one of his bows, five arrows, a basket of acorn meal, a boxfull of shell bead money, a purse full of tobacco, three rings, and some obsidian flakes.&quot; Ishi&#x27;s remains, in a deerskin-wrapped Pueblo Indian pottery jar, were interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma, California, near San Francisco. Kroeber sent Ishi&#x27;s preserved brain to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. It was held there until August 10, 2000, when the Smithsonian repatriated it to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes. This was in accordance with the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989 (NMAI). According to Robert Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural History, &quot;Contrary to commonly-held belief, Ishi was not the last of his kind. In carrying out the repatriation process, we learned that as a Yahi–Yana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California.&quot; His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place.

==Archery==
Ishi used thumb draw and release with his short bows.&lt;ref name=&quot;archerylibrary/Pope/1923/chapter02_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thebicyclingguitarist/ishi/bow&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible multi-ethnicity==
Steven Shackley of UC Berkeley learned in 1994 of a paper by Jerald Johnson, who noted morphological evidence that Ishi&#x27;s facial features and height were more typical of the Wintu and Maidu. He theorized that under pressure of diminishing populations, members of groups that were once enemies had intermarried to survive. Johnson also referred to oral histories of the Wintu and Maidu that told of the tribes&#x27; intermarrying with the Yahi. The theory is still debated, and this remains unresolved.

In 1996, Shackley announced work based on a study of Ishi&#x27;s projectile points and those of the northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi&#x27;s production was more typical of points of the Nomlaki or Wintu tribes, and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi had been of mixed ancestry, and related to and raised among members of another of the tribes. He based his conclusion on a study of the points made by Ishi, compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures.

Among Ishi&#x27;s techniques was the use of what is known as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes. This is known to be a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes. Shackley suggests that Ishi learned the skill directly from a male relative of one of those tribes. These people lived in small bands, close to the Yahi. They were historically competitors with and enemies of the Yahi.

==Similar case==
Ishi&#x27;s story has been compared to that of Ota Benga, an Mbuti pygmy from Congo. His family had died and were not given a mourning ritual. He was taken from his home and culture. During one period, he was displayed as a zoo exhibit. Ota shot himself in the heart with a borrowed pistol on March 20, 1916, five days before Ishi&#x27;s death.

<doc id="174895" wikidata="Q2448370" url="?curid=174895" title="Bo Lundgren">
<text>Bo Axel Magnus Lundgren (born 11 July 1947) is a Swedish politician who served as the leader of the Moderate Party from 1999 to 2003. Lundgren also served as Minister for Sports from 1991 to 1994 and Director-General of the Swedish National Debt Office from 2004 to 2013.

Lundgren served as Minister for Fiscal and Financial Affairs from 1991 to 1994 in the government of Carl Bildt, with responsibility mainly for financial markets, taxation and housing. The country faced a severe financial crisis after the bursting of a speculation bubble which had developed in the 1980s. The Swedish government&#x27;s management of the crisis attracted international attention, especially after the late 2000s recession. Lundgren testified to the US Congressional Oversight Panel in 2009 and was also called to the European Parliament and the Irish Parliament to speak about management of financial crises.

==Early life, education, and personal life==
Bo Lundgren was born in Kristianstad to Alf Lundgren (1913-1985) and Inez Nilsson (1918-2003). He earned a degree in business and administration from Lund University in 1972, and began training as a Reserve Officer in the Swedish Army. He served from 1972 to 1978, and reached the rank of Captain.

Lundgren received an honorary doctorate from Lund University in 2010. He resides in Lund with his wife and two children.

==Political career==
Lundgren first became active in politics by becoming a board member of the Moderate Party&#x27;s county association in Kristianstad in 1969, and later became leader of the Moderate Youth League in Kristianstad from 1971–1974. He became a member of the Riksdag in 1976, representing his home constituency of Skåne Northern and Eastern.

Lundgren later served as Minister for Sports under Prime minister Carl Bildt from 1991 to 1994.

===Leader of the Moderate Party===

In 1999, he succeeded Bildt as party leader and became leader of the opposition. He brought the party into the 2002 Swedish general election, becoming the coalitions candidate for Prime Minister.

During the elections, Lundgren was perceived to be a technocratic politician who put too much emphasis on budget numbers and tax cuts, which might have contributed to the party&#x27;s poor showing that year. He was criticised for promising to cut taxes by 130 billion Swedish kronor, a vision that according to his opponents might have jeopardised the welfare state, although the number seems to have been calculated by political opponents.

He resigned one year later after the party&#x27;s poor results in 2002. He was succeeded by Fredrik Reinfeldt, who helped move the party to the political centre during Lundgrens time as leader.

==Career after politics==
Lundgren served as director general of the Swedish National Debt Office (Riksgäldskontoret) from 2004 to 2013. He played a further role in the government&#x27;s response to the late 2000s recession, along with Stefan Ingves the head of Sveriges Riksbank, which included the nationalisation of Carnegie Investment Bank. After leaving the Debt Office, he was appointed chairman of Sparbanken Öresund as well as of some other institutions.

Lundgren is still respected among many Moderates for his principled stand on issues as a leader, especially since Fredrik Reinfeldt has been pursuing more centrist policies.

Currently, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

<text>The hartree (symbol: &quot;E&quot;h), also known as the Hartree energy, is the unit of energy in the atomic units system, named after the British physicist Douglas Hartree. Its CODATA recommended value is = 

The hartree is approximately the negative electric potential energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state and, by the virial theorem, approximately twice its ionization energy; the relationships are not exact because of the finite mass of the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and relativistic corrections.

The hartree is usually used as a unit of energy in atomic physics and computational chemistry: for experimental measurements at the atomic scale, the electronvolt (eV) or the reciprocal centimetre (cm−1) are much more widely used.

<text>Mayapan (Màyapáan in Modern Maya; in Spanish Mayapán) is a Pre-Columbian Maya site a couple of kilometers south of the town of Telchaquillo in Municipality of Tecoh, approximately 40 km south-east of Mérida and 100 km west of Chichen Itza; in the state of Yucatán, Mexico. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucatán Peninsula during the Late Post-Classic period from the 1220s until the 1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 15,000–17,000 people, and the site has more than 4,000 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside.

The site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was done by a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue.

==Layout==

Mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers (about 1.6 square miles) and has over 4000 structures, most of them residences, packed into this compound within the city walls. Built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions. The stone perimeter wall has twelve gates, including seven major gates with vaulted entrances. The wall is 9.1 km (about 5.65 miles) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner.

The ceremonial center of the site is located in Square Q of the city&#x27;s grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure. The ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples, colonnaded halls, oratories, shrines, sanctuaries, altars, and platforms (for oration, dancing, or stela display). A.L. Smith, an archeologist with the Carnegie Institute, estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city.
According to Dr. Gregory Simons survey outside the city walls, there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people. His survey results are posted online at www.mayapanperiphery.net. People living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture, animal-raising, and specialized activities such as lime production. Russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall, revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape.

The Temple of Kukulcan, a large pyramid also known as the Castillo, is the main temple in Mayapan. It is located immediately to the east of the Cenote Ch&#x27;en Mul, which has caves radiating from it. In form, the Temple of Kukulcan (Structure Q-162 on the site map) is a radial four-staircase temple with nine terraces; it is generally similar to the Temple of Kukulcan at the earlier site of Chichen Itza. However, the Mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at Chichen Itza, and the city&#x27;s buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other Mayan cities. For example, most or all of the vaulted roofs in Mayapan have collapsed, while many of the better-built buildings at Chichen Itza remain intact. Other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones, which are unusual for the Maya area and are also linked to the deity Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl in his wind god (Ehecatl) aspect. Unlike Chichen Itza, Mayapan has no ballcourts.

The extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures, with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer. The houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards. Houses were built haphazardly without organized streets. Lanes wind among the residences and walls. The residential areas of the site contain many cenotes, perhaps as many as 40. Settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous.

==Historical overview==
The ethnohistorical sources – such as Diego de Landa&#x27;s &quot;Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan&quot;, compiled from native sources in the 16th century – recount that the site was founded by Kukulcan (the Mayan name of Quetzalcoatl, the Toltec king, culture hero, and demigod) after the fall of Chichen Itza. He convened the lords of the region, who agreed to found a new capital at Mayapan. The lords divided the towns of Yucatán among them, and chose the chief of the Cocom family as their leader.

The ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of Mayapan (Roys 1962). These histories are often confusing, chronologically implausible, and difficult to reconcile. For example, some sources say that the Maya revolted in 1221 against the Maya-Toltec lords of Chichen Itza. After a short civil war, the lords of various powerful cities and families met to restore a central government to Yucatán. They decided to build a new capital city near the town of Telchaquillo, hometown of Hunac Ceel, the general who defeated the rulers of Chichen Itza. The new city was built within a defensive wall and named &quot;Mayapan&quot;, meaning &quot;Standard of the Maya people&quot;.

The chief of the Cocom family, a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against Chichen, was chosen to be king, and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to Mayapan to play parts in the government (and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities). Mexican mercenaries from Tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power. Another family, the Xiu, may have been living in the Mayapan area prior to the arrival of the Cocom; the Xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from Uxmal. This arrangement lasted for over 200 years. (An alternative account is given in a Maya chronicle from the Colonial era, claiming that Mayapan was contemporary with Chichen Itza and Uxmal and allied with those cities, but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely.)

Mayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern Yucatán, and trade partners that extended directly to Honduras, Belize, and the Caribbean island of Cozumel, and indirectly to Mexico. Though Mayapan was ruled by a council, the &quot;Jalach winik&quot; and the &quot;aj k’in&quot; (the highest ruler, and the high priest) dominated the political sphere. Below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities. The range of classes went from the nobility, down to slaves, with intermediary classes in between. The social climate of Mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles, which were often arranged by kinship (Pugh 2009; Milbrath 2003). In 1441, Ah Xiu Xupan of the powerful noble family of Xiu became resentful of the political machinations of the Cocom rulers and organized a revolt. As a result, all of the Cocom family, except one who was away in Honduras conducting trade, were killed, Mayapan was sacked, burned, and abandoned, all the larger cities went into decline, and Yucatán devolved into warring city-states.

Archaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation. Excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center.

==Excavations and investigations==

In 1841 John L. Stephens was the first to document parts of the Mayapan site with two important illustrations. The first was of the Q-152 round temple, and the second was of the Pyramid of Kukulkan. He was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of Mayapan. The first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by R.T. Patton. These surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall, and were the basis of later maps (Russell 2008).

In the 1950s, archaeologists of the Carnegie Institution, including A. L. Smith, Robert Smith, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Edwin Shook, Karl Ruppert and J. Eric Thompson conducted five years of intensive archeological investigations at Mayapan. Their work was published in a mimeographed series of &quot;Current Reports&quot;. The &quot;Current Reports&quot; have recently been republished in their entirety by the University of Colorado Press (John Weeks 2009). The final report was published by the Carnegie Institution as &quot;Mayapan, Yucatan, Mexico&quot;, by H. E. D. Pollock, Ralph L. Roys, A. L. Smith, and Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1962, Publication 619). Robert Smith published a two-volume monograph on &quot;The Pottery of Mayapan&quot; in 1971 (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 66, Harvard University).

In the early 1990s, Clifford T. Brown of Tulane University carried out excavations in the residential zones of Mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research. Several years later, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) of Mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist Carlos Peraza Lope. This work continues to the present. It has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts, murals, stuccoes, and architectural elements.

From 2001 to 2009, further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of Dr. Marilyn Masson from the State University New York at Albany, Carlos Peraza Lope of INAH, and Timothy S. Hare of Morehead State University. This &quot;Economic Foundations of Mayapan&quot; (PEMY) Project performed mapping, surface survey and collection, test-pitting, and horizontal excavation across the city. Major findings of this project include the identification of diverse occupational specialization among the city&#x27;s commoners, who worked as craftsmen, conscripted military personnel, farmers, and domestic servants. Great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence. This project has also identified a probable major market plaza in Square K (between the site center and major north gate D); Richard Terry, Bruce Dahlin, and Daniel Bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality. In 2008 and 2009, the PEMY project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate (Gate H), known as &quot;Itzmal Ch&#x27;en,&quot; as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city.

==Chronology==
===Before Mayapan===
* Some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures. Shook in 1954 said that there may have been a Puuc &quot;city&quot; somewhere near Mayapan prior to its post-classical settlement. The mixture of Puuc pot shards in the lower parts of Mayapan lots may support this, but it is a very small percentage of the material (2% in most cases and no more than 4% in others).

===Site chronology based on ceramics===
* According to Robert Smith, the ceramicist for the Carnegie Institution, there were two ceramic phases in Mayapan: &quot;hocaba,&quot; which he said started around A.D. 1200 and may have included types named Mama Red and Navula Unslipped, more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements. (Milbrath and Pereza argue that the Hocaba phase starts in A.D. 1100, which fits better with the chronology of the southern lowland sites.) The second phase is &quot;Tases&quot;, which has some overlapping typology with the &quot;Hocaba&quot; phase.

===Site chronology based on radiocarbon dates===

====Middle Preclassical Date====
:In an alley fill between the Templo Redondo and an adjoining hall, some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540–820 B.C. But, most of the pottery in this fill was post-classical. Researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found.

====Terminal Classical Dates====
:A burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical &quot;solare&quot; dated between A.D. 600 and A.D. 780. The burial appeared to be a secondary interment, and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall. There was no pottery with the burial; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots.

:Charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to A.D. 770-1020. Researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found. The construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age.

===Early Mayapan occupation===
* Three separate samples form the frame for early Mayapan occupation. These dates are A.D. 990–1170. However, two of these dates come from inexact sources. One was burned copal found in an unknown structure (apparently the label had eroded off of the structure); the researchers inferred that it was Q-95. The early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in Mayapan&#x27;s early history.
* Carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be Q-97 (again the label had eroded) dated from A.D. 990–1180.
* Charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site&#x27;s main pyramid was dated A.D. 1020–1170. This sample was found in reliable context and is presumably the most accurate. It is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in Mayapan started earlier than A.D. 1200.

===Late Mayapan occupation===
* Mayapan&#x27;s settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins. The fall of the city is tentatively dated around A.D. 1461, based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date. (Lope et al. 2006). According to Diego de Landa Calderon (1524–1579), the city was abandoned following the country&#x27;s enslavement by a certain chieftain of the Yucatecan nation (in collusion with a garrison of Mexica Indians), and which abuse eventually led to internecine war, culminating in the city&#x27;s demise in &quot;circa&quot; 1441.

==Agriculture and animals==
Milpa, or mixed, fields may have been cultivated when Mayapan was inhabited. There is evidence that the area around Mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture. Cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area, making them essential to support agriculture. Researchers have suggested that Mayapan was an import/export center, and that they often traded luxury goods, such as cotton, salt, and honey, for products of obsidian and metal, which they would have forged. (Paris 2008) (Melbrath &amp; Peraza 2003:29). Today farmers use mixed fields, called the milpa fields, to cultivate maize, beans, squash, watermelons, mangoes, papayas and other crops. Also, citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents (Russell 2008:16).

Faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition. A study done by M.A. Masson and C. Peraza Lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens, one located in the monumental center by some houses, and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound. The largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from: white-tailed deer (23%), dog (4.4%), turkey (12.9%), and iguana (10.2%). The combined contributions of fish make up around 1.2% of the samples. These percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains. Primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize.

In the settlement zone, researchers found: white-tailed deer (8.4%), dog (1.4%), turkey (5.3%), iguana (14.5%), and fish (3.6%). Both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites, but they were consumed in small amounts (less than 1.5%). While excavating, the researchers noted many fish skeletons, but few fish heads. They concluded that the fish were being traded into Mayapan, and not collected near the site. If the fish had been prepared at the site, the heads would have been common refuse. Within the ceremonial center, numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains.(M.A. Masson, C. Peraza Lope 2008).

==Trade==

Mayapan was a major capital in the Yucatán, and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes, as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region. A wide variety of goods were traded, including maize, honey, salt, fish, game, cloth, and birds.

===Peten===
Zacpeten on Lake Salpeten – Incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at Mayapan. The temple assemblages at Zacpeten are very similar to those at Mayapan. Topoxte in Lake Yaxha, Peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers. Topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to Mayapan. Also, tiny “dwarf” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at Mayapan. The two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time; which may suggest a connection between their governments.

===Highland Guatemala===
Architectural and artifact connections are seen between Mayapan and the Utatlan in highland Guatemala. Examples are similar temple assemblages, the presence of skull imagery and squatting figures, extensive and lavish use of stucco combined with crude masonry, and effigy figure censers.

===Yucatan East Coast===
This region also shows apparent influence of Mayapan, in similar temple assemblages, similarities in architecture, effigy censers at some sites, and parallels between architectural decoration at Mayapan and some east coast sites. The east coast sites exported products such as cotton, salt, and honey from the Yucatán. Sites in Guatemala traded back cacao. El Chayal in Guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at Mayapan.

===Aztecs, Central Mexico, and the Campeche Coast===
The presence of Matillas Fine Orange ceramics in Mayapan suggests trade with Tabasco. This area may have mediated trade between Mayapan and the rest of Central Mexico. Sculptures and murals at Mayapan suggest that there was contact between Mayapan and the rising Aztec empire. Some Mayapan figures showed details of Aztec dress, and what appears to be an Aztec deity is carved on an altar in Mayapan.

This evidence suggests a: “circum-Yucatecan trade route that linked Mayapan to Peten, northern Belize, and east-coast sites in the Late Postclassic period.” (Melbrath &amp; Peraza Lope 2003:24–31)

==Symbolism==
* The symbolism present in Mayapan is particularly significant, partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes. There are many similarities between the murals in Mayapan and the art and iconography of the Aztec and Mixteca-Puebla regions. Symbols that they have in common include:
:* the sun disc (there are varying interpretations of what this represents
::* Could represent the sun god
::* However, the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior, and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god.
:* representations of Quetzalcoatl
:* murals in structure Q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in Mixteca-Puebla traditions. The dentition of the reptile indicate that they are serpents. There are similar representations found at Coba and on some pottery in Cholula dated to circa 1350–1550 AD.

(Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado Kú. 2010)

* Serpent iconography is very common at Mayapan, serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the Cocom lineage like the Castillo (Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado Kú 2010). In contrast depictions of the rain god Chaac are common to the temples related to the Xiu lineage. (Milbrath 2009:583) There are also depictions of the Monkey-man god
* Most of the iconography in Mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls, stone carving, or carved stone covered in plaster.

==Evidence of inequality==
Directionality may have played a role in the representation of inequality among the powerful factions of Mayapan. East and west were of primary importance because it represented the track of the sun through the sky. The east was associated with: life, males, and heat; whereas the west was associated with: death, females, and cold. This has led many sources to believe that the Itza and the Xiw may have been associated with east and west. There was very little evidence for obvious separation of residence between classes. This is mostly due to the residential center of Mayapan being located around the concentration of the water filled cenotes. Most residences are tandem structures made of several building within a separating wall. Many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings; the size of these residential buildings, relative to each other, suggests that some of them were for slaves. The integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields. Some sources indicate that the analysis of oratorios or god-houses (large house-like shrines) show boundaries that were known to the people of Mayapan. This is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratorios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of Mayapan. Unfortunately there is very little skeletal evidence found in this region because of the composition of the soil. The goods found in different house structures do suggest different levels of social status, mainly in regard to the specialization of housing structures. There are at least two examples of obsidian workshops in Mayapan. The strongest evidence for inequality in Mayapan is found in the presence of deep shafts full of sacrificial victims, this suggests that the noble class had enough power to condemn some people to death.

==Abandonment==
The site of Mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century. There has been some dispute over when the actual abandonment took place. However, written records state that the site was abandoned in A.D. 1441. There appear to be several contributing factors to the abandonment of Mayapan. Around A.D. 1420 a riot was started by the Xius against the Cocom which culminated in the death of nearly all (if not in fact all) of the Cocom lineage. Pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining Xiu inhabitants. There were several sources of evidence to support this interpretation. Evidence of burned wood was found inside of structure Y-45a as well as burned roofing material on many of the other structures that was dated to around the time of the collapse in K’atun 8 Ahau (roughly A.D. 1441–1461). A mass grave in the main plaza, and bodies in a burial shaft covered in ash were dated to around the collapse and showed signs of violence, some of the bodies still had large flint knives in their chests or pelvises, suggesting ritualized sacrifice. Smashed vessels litter the floors of the Y-45a complex that date to around A.D. 1270–1400, prior to the documented collapse of Mayapan. A vessel bearing the glyph K’atun 8 Ahau was found on the floor of this complex. From this they have posited that the complex was abandoned finally when the city fell (Lope 2006; Milbrath 2003). After A.D. 1461 there is little evidence of altars and burial cists being constructed after 1461, suggesting that the site had been abandoned by this point (Lope 2006). Very little evidence has been found to support later usage of Mayapan. Copal from an altar was found in the Templo Redondo compound that may suggest later pilgrimages to the Castillo de Kukulkan. However, these samples date to the industrial era and may not be valid, so any assumptions based on this evidence would also not be valid (Lope 2006:168).

<doc id="174906" wikidata="Q2123264" url="?curid=174906" title="Quincunx">
<text>A quincunx ( ) is a geometric pattern consisting of five points arranged in a cross, with four of them forming a square or rectangle and a fifth at its center. The same pattern has other names, including &quot;in saltire&quot; or &quot;in cross&quot; in heraldry (depending on the orientation of the outer square), the five-point stencil in numerical analysis, and the five dots tattoo. It forms the arrangement of five units in the pattern corresponding to the five-spot on six-sided dice, playing cards, and dominoes. It is represented in Unicode as or (for the die pattern) .

==Historical origins of the name==
The quincunx was originally a coin issued by the Roman Republic , whose value was five twelfths (&quot;quinque&quot; and &quot;uncia&quot;) of an as, the Roman standard bronze coin. On the Roman quincunx coins, the value was sometimes indicated by a pattern of five dots or pellets. However, these dots were not always arranged in a quincunx pattern.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) dates the first appearances of the Latin word in English as 1545 and 1574 (&quot;in the sense &#x27;five-twelfths of a pound or as; i.e. 100 old pence). The first citation for a geometric meaning, as &quot;a pattern used for planting trees&quot;, dates from 1606. The OED also cites a 1647 reference to the German astronomer Kepler for an astronomical/astrological meaning, an angle of 5/12 of a whole circle. When used to describe a tree-planting pattern, the same word can also refer to groups of more than five trees, arranged in a square grid but aligned diagonally to the dimensions of the surrounding plot of land; however, this article considers only five-point patterns and not their extension to larger square grids.

==Examples==
Quincunx patterns occur in many contexts:

* In heraldry, groups of five elements (&quot;charges&quot;) are often arranged in a quincunx pattern. This arrangement is called, in heraldic terminology, &quot;in saltire&quot; for its usual orientation with the sides of the square vertical or horizontal, or &quot;in cross&quot; when the square is diagonally oriented. The flag of the Solomon Islands features this pattern, with its five stars representing the five main island groups in the Solomon Islands. Another instance of this pattern occurred in the flag of the 19th-century Republic of Yucatán, where it signified the five departments into which the republic was divided. The coat of arms of Portugal includes both orientations of the same patterns, nested within each other.
* Quincunxes are used in modern computer graphics as a pattern for multisample anti-aliasing. Quincunx antialiasing samples scenes at the corners and centers of each pixel. These five sample points, in the shape of a quincunx, are combined to produce each displayed pixel. However, samples at the corner points are shared with adjacent pixels, so the number of samples needed is only twice the number of displayed pixels.
* In numerical analysis, the quincunx pattern describes the two-dimensional five-point stencil, a sampling pattern used to derive finite difference approximations to derivatives. The five points of the five-point stencil are arranged directly above, below, and to the two sides of the center point, rather than (as in quincunx sampling) diagonally with respect to it.
* In Khmer architecture, the towers of a temple, such as Angkor Wat, are sometimes arranged in a quincunx to represent the five peaks of Mount Meru.
* A quincunx is one of the quintessential designs of Cosmatesque inlay stonework.
* A quincuncial map is a conformal map projection that maps the poles of the sphere to the centre and four corners of a square, thus forming a quincunx.
* The points on each face of a unit cell of a face-centred cubic lattice form a quincunx.
* The quincunx as a tattoo is known as the five dots tattoo. It has been variously interpreted as a fertility symbol, a reminder of sayings on how to treat women or police, a recognition symbol among the Romani people, a group of close friends, standing alone in the world, or time spent in prison (with the outer four dots representing the prison walls and the inner dot representing the prisoner). Thomas Edison, whose many inventions included an electric pen which later became the basis of a tattooing machine created by Samuel O&#x27;Reilly, had this pattern tattooed on his forearm.
* The first two stages of the Saturn V super heavy-lift rocket had engines in a quincunx arrangement.
* A baseball diamond forms a quincunx with the four bases and the pitcher&#x27;s mound.

==Literary and symbolic references==
Various literary works use or refer to the quincunx pattern:
*&quot;Quincunx&quot; (1564) was the name of the political treatise by a Polish-Ruthenian writer Stanisław Orzechowski: here, the five points symbolized five pillars of Polish state, with the Church at the very top.
*&quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;, or &quot;The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered&quot;, is an essay by Sir Thomas Browne, published in 1658. Browne elaborates upon evidence of the quincunx pattern in art, nature and mystically as evidence of &quot;the wisdom of God&quot;. Although writing about the quincunx in its geometric meaning, he may have been influenced by English astrology, as the astrological meaning of &quot;quincunx&quot; (unrelated to the pattern) was introduced by the astronomer Kepler in 1604. The Victorian critic Edmund Gosse complained that &quot;gathering his forces it is Quincunx, Quincunx, all the way until the very sky itself is darkened with revolving Chess-boards&quot;, while conceding that &quot;this radically bad book contains some of the most lovely paragraphs which passed from an English pen during the seventeenth Century&quot;. 
* James Joyce uses the term in &quot;Grace&quot;, a short story in &quot;Dubliners&quot; of 1914, to describe the seating arrangement of five men in a church service. Lobner argues that in this context the pattern serves as a symbol both of the wounds of Christ and of the Greek cross.
* Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;The Avignon Quintet&quot; is arranged in the form of a quincunx, according to the author; the final novel in the sequence is called &quot;Quinx&quot;, the plot of which includes the discovery of a quincunx of stones.
* &quot;The Quincunx&quot; is the title of a lengthy and elaborate novel by Charles Palliser set in 19th-century England, published in 1989; the pattern appears in the text as a heraldic device, and is also reflected in the structure of the book.
* In the first chapter of &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot;, W. G. Sebald&#x27;s narrator cites Browne&#x27;s writing on the quincunx. The quincunx in turn becomes a model for the way in which the rest of the novel unfolds.
* Séamus Heaney describes Ireland&#x27;s historical provinces as together forming a quincunx, as the Irish word for province &quot;cúige&quot; (literally: &quot;fifth part&quot;) also explicates. The five provinces of Ireland were Ulster (north), Leinster (east), Connacht (west), Munster (south) and Meath (center, and now a county within Leinster). More specifically, in his essay &quot;Frontiers of Writing&quot;, Heaney creates an image of five towers forming a quincunx pattern within Ireland, one tower for each of the five provinces, each having literary significance.
* Early African American scientist Benjamin Banneker describes a dream in which he is asked to measure the shape of the soul after death. The answer is &quot;quincunx&quot;. Research locates his ancestry in Senegal, where the quincunx is a common religious symbol.

<doc id="174907" wikidata="Q1476964" url="?curid=174907" title="Covert channel">
<text>In computer security, a covert channel is a type of attack that creates a capability to transfer information objects between processes that are not supposed to be allowed to communicate by the computer security policy. The term, originated in 1973 by Butler Lampson, is defined as channels &quot;not intended for information transfer at all, such as the service program&#x27;s effect on system load,&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;legitimate&quot; channels that are subjected to access controls by COMPUSEC.

==Characteristics==
A covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system (typically, read and write), and therefore cannot be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems. Covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems, and can often be detected by monitoring system performance. In addition, they suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and low data rates (typically, on the order of a few bits per second). They can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies.

Covert channels are distinct from, and often confused with, legitimate channel exploitations that attack low-assurance pseudo-secure systems using schemes such as &quot;steganography&quot; or even less sophisticated schemes to disguise prohibited objects inside of legitimate information objects. The legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel.

Covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control. Covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels. By contrast, secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels, so distinguishing both is important. Analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse. Because this amounts to analysis of large amounts of software, it was shown as early as 1972 to be impractical. Without being informed of this, some are misled to believe an analysis will &quot;manage the risk&quot; of these legitimate channels.

===TCSEC criteria===

The Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) was a set of criteria, now deprecated, that had been established by the National Computer Security Center, an agency managed by the United States&#x27; National Security Agency.

Lampson&#x27;s definition of a &quot;covert channel&quot; was paraphrased in the TCSEC specifically to refer to ways of transferring information from a higher classification compartment to a lower classification. In a shared processing environment, it is difficult to completely insulate one process from the effects another process can have on the operating environment. A covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition (such as free space, availability of some service, wait time to execute) that can be detected by a receiving process.

The TCSEC defines two kinds of covert channels:
*Storage channels - Communicate by modifying a &quot;storage location&quot;, such as a hard drive.
*Timing channels - Perform operations that affect the &quot;real response time observed&quot; by the receiver. 
The TCSEC, also known as the &quot;Orange Book&quot;, requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a B2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class B3.

== Timing channels ==
The use of delays between packets transmitted over computer networks was first explored by Girling for covert communication. This work motivated many other works to establish or detect a covert communication and analyze the fundamental limitations of such scenarios.

==Identifying covert channels==
Ordinary things, such as existence of a file or time used for a computation, have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates. Covert channels are not easy to find because these media are so numerous and frequently used.

Two relatively old techniques remain the standards for locating potential covert channels. One works by analyzing the resources of a system and other works at the source-code level.

==Eliminating covert channels==
The possibility of covert channels cannot be eliminated, although it can be significantly reduced by careful design and analysis.

The detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users.
For example, a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific, timed pattern that can be detected by another program, and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits, forming a covert channel.
Since it is unlikely that legitimate users will check for patterns of file opening and closing operations, this type of covert channel can remain undetected for long periods.

A similar case is port knocking.
In usual communications the timing of requests is irrelevant and unwatched.
Port knocking makes it significant.

==Data hiding in OSI model==

Handel and Sandford presented research where they study covert channels within the general design of network communication protocols. They employ the OSI model as a basis for their development in which they characterize system elements having potential to be used for data hiding. The adopted approach has advantages over these because standards opposed to specific network environments or architectures are considered.

Their study does not aim to present foolproof steganographic schemes. Rather, they establish basic principles for data hiding in each of seven OSI layers. Besides suggesting the use of the reserved fields of protocols headers (that are easily detectable) at higher network layers, they also propose the possibility of timing channels involving CSMA/CD manipulation at the physical layer.

Their work identifies covert channel merit such as:
* Detectability: Covert channel must be measurable by the intended recipient only.
* Indistinguishability: Covert channel must lack identification.
* Bandwidth: number of data hiding bits per channel use.

Their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes, covert channel capacity estimation, effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility. Moreover, the generality of the techniques cannot be fully justified in practice since the OSI model does not exist per se in functional systems.

==Data hiding in LAN environment by covert channels==

As Girling first analyzes covert channels in a network environment. His work focuses on local area networks (LANs) in which three obvious covert channels (two storage channel and one timing channel) are identified. This demonstrates the real examples of bandwidth possibilities for simple covert channels in LANs. For a specific LAN environment, the author introduced the notion of a wiretapper who monitors the activities of a specific transmitter on LAN. The covertly communicating parties are the transmitter and the wiretapper. The covert information according to Girling can be communicated through any of following obvious ways:

# By observing the addresses as approached by the transmitter. If total number of addresses a sender can approach is 16, then there is a possibility of secret communication having 4 bits for the secret message. The author termed this possibility as covert storage channel as it depends in what is sent (i.e., which address is approached by the sender).
# In the same way, the other obvious storage covert channel would depend on the size of the frame sent by the sender. For the 256 possible sizes, the amount of covert information deciphered from one size of the frame would be of 8 bits. Again this scenario was termed as the covert storage channel.
# The third scenario presented uses the presence or absence of messages. For instance, &quot;0&quot; for an odd message time interval, &quot;1&quot; for even.

The scenario transmits covert information through a &quot;when-is-sent&quot; strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel. The time to transmit a block of data is calculated as function of software processing time, network speed, network block sizes and protocol overhead. Assuming block of various sizes are transmitted on the LAN, software overhead is computed on average and novel time evaluation is used to estimate the bandwidth (capacity) of covert channels are also presented. The work paves the way for future research.

==Data hiding in TCP/IP Protocol suite by covert channels==

Focusing on the IP and TCP headers of TCP/IP Protocol suite, an article published by Craig Rowland devises proper encoding and decoding techniques by utilizing the IP identification field, the TCP initial sequence number and acknowledge sequence number fields. These techniques are implemented in a simple utility written for Linux systems running version 2.0 kernels.

Rowland provides a proof of concept as well as practical encoding and decoding techniques for exploitation of covert channels using the TCP/IP protocol suite. These techniques are analyzed considering security mechanisms like firewall network address translation.

However, the non-detectability of these covert communication techniques is questionable. For instance, a case where sequence number field of TCP header is manipulated, the encoding scheme is adopted such that every time the same alphabet is covertly communicated, it is encoded with the same sequence number.

Moreover, the usages of sequence number field as well as the acknowledgment field cannot be made specific to the ASCII coding of English language alphabet as proposed, since both fields take into account the receipt of data bytes pertaining to specific network packet(s).

After Rowland, several authors in academia published more work on covert channels in the TCP/IP protocol suite, including a plethora of countermeasures ranging from statistical approaches to machine learning. The research on network covert channels overlaps with the domain of network steganography, which emerged later.

<doc id="174908" wikidata="Q5508846" url="?curid=174908" title="Functional predicate">
<text>In formal logic and related branches of mathematics, a functional predicate, or function symbol, is a logical symbol that may be applied to an object term to produce another object term.
Functional predicates are also sometimes called mappings, but that term has additional meanings in mathematics.
In a model, a function symbol will be modelled by a function.

Specifically, the symbol &quot;F&quot; in a formal language is a functional symbol if, given any symbol &quot;X&quot; representing an object in the language, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is again a symbol representing an object in that language.
In typed logic, &quot;F&quot; is a functional symbol with &quot;domain&quot; type T and &quot;codomain&quot; type U if, given any symbol &quot;X&quot; representing an object of type T, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a symbol representing an object of type U.
One can similarly define function symbols of more than one variable, analogous to functions of more than one variable; a function symbol in zero variables is simply a constant symbol.

Now consider a model of the formal language, with the types T and U modelled by sets T] and U] and each symbol &quot;X&quot; of type T modelled by an element [&quot;X&quot;] in T].
Then &quot;F&quot; can be modelled by the set
:formula_1
which is simply a function with domain T] and codomain U].
It is a requirement of a consistent model that [&quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)] = [&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;)] whenever [&quot;X&quot;] = [&quot;Y&quot;].

==Introducing new function symbols==
In a treatment of predicate logic that allows one to introduce new predicate symbols, one will also want to be able to introduce new function symbols. Given the function symbols &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, one can introduce a new function symbol &quot;F&quot; ∘ &quot;G&quot;, the &quot;composition&quot; of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, satisfying (&quot;F&quot; ∘ &quot;G&quot;)(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;G&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)), for all &quot;X&quot;.
Of course, the right side of this equation doesn&#x27;t make sense in typed logic unless the domain type of &quot;F&quot; matches the codomain type of &quot;G&quot;, so this is required for the composition to be defined.

One also gets certain function symbols automatically.
In untyped logic, there is an &quot;identity predicate&quot; id that satisfies id(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot; for all &quot;X&quot;.
In typed logic, given any type T, there is an identity predicate idT with domain and codomain type T; it satisfies idT(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot; for all &quot;X&quot; of type T.
Similarly, if T is a subtype of U, then there is an inclusion predicate of domain type T and codomain type U that satisfies the same equation; there are additional function symbols associated with other ways of constructing new types out of old ones.

Additionally, one can define functional predicates after proving an appropriate theorem.
(If you&#x27;re working in a formal system that doesn&#x27;t allow you to introduce new symbols after proving theorems, then you will have to use relation symbols to get around this, as in the next section.)
Specifically, if you can prove that for every &quot;X&quot; (or every &quot;X&quot; of a certain type), there exists a unique &quot;Y&quot; satisfying some condition &quot;P&quot;, then you can introduce a function symbol &quot;F&quot; to indicate this.
Note that &quot;P&quot; will itself be a relational predicate involving both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.
So if there is such a predicate &quot;P&quot; and a theorem:
: For all &quot;X&quot; of type T, for some unique &quot;Y&quot; of type U, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;),
then you can introduce a function symbol &quot;F&quot; of domain type T and codomain type U that satisfies:
: For all &quot;X&quot; of type T, for all &quot;Y&quot; of type U, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) if and only if &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

==Doing without functional predicates==
Many treatments of predicate logic don&#x27;t allow functional predicates, only relational predicates.
This is useful, for example, in the context of proving metalogical theorems (such as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems), where one doesn&#x27;t want to allow the introduction of new functional symbols (nor any other new symbols, for that matter).
But there is a method of replacing functional symbols with relational symbols wherever the former may occur; furthermore, this is algorithmic and thus suitable for applying most metalogical theorems to the result.

Specifically, if &quot;F&quot; has domain type T and codomain type U, then it can be replaced with a predicate &quot;P&quot; of type (T,U).
Intuitively, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) means &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;Y&quot;.
Then whenever &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) would appear in a statement, you can replace it with a new symbol &quot;Y&quot; of type U and include another statement &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).
To be able to make the same deductions, you need an additional proposition:
: For all &quot;X&quot; of type T, for some unique &quot;Y&quot; of type U, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).
(Of course, this is the same proposition that had to be proven as a theorem before introducing a new function symbol in the previous section.)

Because the elimination of functional predicates is both convenient for some purposes and possible, many treatments of formal logic do not deal explicitly with function symbols but instead use only relation symbols; another way to think of this is that a functional predicate is a &quot;special kind of&quot; predicate, specifically one that satisfies the proposition above.
This may seem to be a problem if you wish to specify a proposition schema that applies only to functional predicates &quot;F&quot;; how do you know ahead of time whether it satisfies that condition?
To get an equivalent formulation of the schema, first replace anything of the form &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) with a new variable &quot;Y&quot;.
Then universally quantify over each &quot;Y&quot; immediately after the corresponding &quot;X&quot; is introduced (that is, after &quot;X&quot; is quantified over, or at the beginning of the statement if &quot;X&quot; is free), and guard the quantification with &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).
Finally, make the entire statement a material consequence of the uniqueness condition for a functional predicate above.

Let us take as an example the axiom schema of replacement in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.
(This example uses mathematical symbols.)
This schema states (in one form), for any functional predicate &quot;F&quot; in one variable:
:formula_2 
First, we must replace &quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) with some other variable &quot;D&quot;: 
:formula_3 
Of course, this statement isn&#x27;t correct; &quot;D&quot; must be quantified over just after &quot;C&quot;: 
:formula_4 
We still must introduce &quot;P&quot; to guard this quantification: 
:formula_5 
This is almost correct, but it applies to too many predicates; what we actually want is: 
:formula_6 
This version of the axiom schema of replacement is now suitable for use in a formal language that doesn&#x27;t allow the introduction of new function symbols. Alternatively, one may interpret the original statement as a statement in such a formal language; it was merely an abbreviation for the statement produced at the end.

<doc id="174910" wikidata="Q856330" url="?curid=174910" title="Cracker (food)">
<text>A cracker is a flat, dry baked biscuit typically made with flour. Flavorings or seasonings, such as salt, herbs, seeds, or cheese, may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top before baking. Crackers are often branded as a nutritious and convenient way to consume a staple food or cereal grain.
Crackers can be eaten on their own, but can also accompany other food items such as cheese or meat slices, fruits, dips, or soft spreads such as jam, butter, peanut butter, or mousse. Bland or mild crackers are sometimes used as a palate cleanser in food product testing or flavor testing, between samples. Crackers may also be crumbled and added to soup. The modern cracker is somewhat similar to nautical ship&#x27;s biscuits, military hardtack, , and sacramental bread. Other early versions of the cracker can be found in ancient flatbreads, such as lavash, pita, matzo, flatbrød, and crispbread. Asian analogues include &quot;papadum&quot;, &quot;senbei&quot; and &quot;num kreab&quot;.

The characteristic holes found in many crackers are called &quot;docking&quot; holes. The holes are poked in the dough to stop overly large air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking.

==Names==
In American English, the name &quot;cracker&quot; usually refers to savory or salty flat biscuits, whereas the term &quot;cookie&quot; is used for sweet items. Crackers are also generally made differently: crackers are made by layering dough, while cookies, besides the addition of sugar, usually use a chemical leavening agent, may contain eggs, and in other ways are made more like a cake. In British English, crackers are sometimes called water biscuits.

==Types==
Crackers come in many shapes and sizes, such as round, rectangular, triangular, or irregular. Crackers sometimes have cheese or spices as ingredients, or even chicken stock.

Saltines and oyster crackers are often used in or served with soup. Similar crackers include cream crackers and water biscuits.

Cheese crackers are prepared using cheese as a main ingredient. Commercial examples include Cheez-It, Cheese Nips and Goldfish.

Graham crackers and digestive biscuits are also treated more like cookies than crackers, although they were both invented for their supposed health benefits, and modern graham crackers are sweet. Similarly, animal crackers are crackers in name only. Animal crackers and Graham crackers may have docking holes.

==Brands==
Cracker brands include Bremner Wafers, Captain&#x27;s Wafers, Cheese Nips, Club Crackers, Goldfish crackers, In a Biskit, Jacob&#x27;s, Ritz Crackers, Town House crackers, Triscuit, TUC, and Wheat Thins.

<doc id="174914" wikidata="Q757568" url="?curid=174914" title="Atomic units">
<text>The atomic units are a system of natural units of measurement that is especially convenient for calculations in atomic physics and related scientific fields, such as computational chemistry and atomic spectroscopy. They were originally suggested and named by the physicist Douglas Hartree.
Atomic units are often abbreviated &quot;a.u.&quot; or &quot;au&quot;, not to be confused with similar abbreviations used for astronomical units, arbitrary units, and absorbance units in other contexts.

== Motivation ==
In the context of atomic physics, using the atomic units system can be a convenient shortcut, eliminating symbols and numbers and reducing the order of magnitude of most numbers involved.
For example, the Hamiltonian operator in the Schrödinger equation for the helium atom with standard quantities, such as when using SI units, is 
: formula_1
but adopting the convention associated with atomic units that transforms quantities into dimensionless equivalents, it becomes
: formula_2
In this convention, the constants , , , and all correspond to the value (see &quot;&quot; below). 
The distances relevant to the physics expressed in SI units are naturally on the order of , while expressed in atomic units distances are on the order of (one Bohr radius, the atomic unit of length). An additional benefit of expressing quantities using atomic units is that their values calculated and reported in atomic units do not change when values of fundamental constants are revised, since the fundamental constants are built into the conversion factors between atomic units and SI.

== History ==
Hartree defined units based on three physical constants:

Here, the modern equivalent of is the Rydberg constant , of is the electron mass , of is the Bohr radius , and of is the reduced Planck constant . Hartree&#x27;s expressions that contain differ from the modern form due to a change in the definition of , as explained below.

In 1957, Bethe and Salpeter&#x27;s book &quot;Quantum mechanics of one-and two-electron atoms&quot; built on Hartree&#x27;s units, which they called atomic units abbreviated &quot;a.u.&quot;. They chose to use , their unit of action and angular momentum in place of Hartree&#x27;s length as the base units. They noted that the unit of length in this system is the radius of the first Bohr orbit and their velocity is the electron velocity in Bohr&#x27;s model of the first orbit.

In 1959, Shull and Hall advocated atomic units based on Hartree&#x27;s model but again chose to use as the defining unit. They explicitly named the distance unit a &quot;Bohr radius&quot;; in addition, they wrote the unit of energy as and called it a Hartree. These terms came to be used widely in quantum chemistry.

In 1973 McWeeny extended the system of Shull and Hall by adding permittivity in the form of as a defining or base unit. Simultaneously he adopted the SI definition of so that his expression for energy in atomic units is , matching the expression in the 8th SI brochure.

== Definition ==
A set of base units in the atomic system as in one proposal are the electron rest mass, the magnitude of the electronic charge, the Planck constant, and the permittivity. In the atomic units system, each of these takes the value 1; the corresponding values in the International System of Units are given in the table.

===Table notes===
*

== Units ==
Three of the defining constants (reduced Planck constant, elementary charge, and electron rest mass) are atomic units themselves – of action, electric charge, and mass, respectively. Two named units are those of length (Bohr radius ) and energy (hartree ).

== Conventions ==
Different conventions are adopted in the use of atomic units, which vary in presentation, formality and convenience.

=== Explicit units ===
* Many texts (e.g. Jerrard &amp; McNiell, Shull &amp; Hall) define the atomic units as quantities, without a transformation of the equations in use. As such, they do not suggest treating either quantities as dimensionless or changing the form of any equations. This is consistent with expressing quantities in terms of dimensional quantities, where the atomic unit is included explicitly as a symbol (e.g. , , or more ambiguously, ), and keeping equations unaltered with explicit constants.
* Provision for choosing more convenient closely related quantities that are more suited to the problem as units than universal fixed units are is also suggested, for example based on the reduced mass of an electron, albeit with careful definition thereof where used (for example, a unit , where for a specified mass ).

=== A convention that eliminates units ===
In atomic physics, it is common to simplify mathematical expressions by a transformation of all quantities: 
* Hartree suggested that expression in terms of atomic units allows us &quot;to eliminate various universal constants from the equations&quot;, which amounts to informally suggesting a transformation of quantities and equations such that all quantities are replaced by corresponding dimensionless quantities. He does not elaborate beyond examples.
* McWeeny suggests that &quot;... their adoption permits all the fundamental equations to be written in a dimensionless form in which constants such as , and are absent and need not be considered at all during mathematical derivations or the processes of numerical solution; the units in which any calculated quantity must appear are implicit in its physical dimensions and may be supplied at the end.&quot; He also states that &quot;An alternative convention is to interpret the symbols as the numerical measures of the quantities they represent, referred to some specified system of units: in this case the equations contain only pure numbers or dimensionless variables; ... the appropriate units are supplied at the end of a calculation, by reference to the physical dimensions of the quantity calculated. [This] convention has much to recommend it and is tacitly accepted in atomic and molecular physics whenever atomic units are introduced, for example for convenience in computation.&quot;
* An informal approach is often taken, in which &quot;equations are expressed in terms of atomic units simply by setting &quot;. This is a form of shorthand for the more formal process of transformation between quantities that is suggested by others, such as McWeeny.

== Physical constants ==
Dimensionless physical constants retain their values in any system of units. Of note is the fine-structure constant , which appears in expressions as a consequence of the choice of units. For example, the numeric value of the speed of light, expressed in atomic units, is 

== Bohr model in atomic units ==
Atomic units are chosen to reflect the properties of electrons in atoms, which is particularly clear in the classical Bohr model of the hydrogen atom for the bound electron in its ground state:
* Mass = 1 a.u. of mass
* Charge = −1 a.u. of charge
* Orbital radius = 1 a.u. of length
* Orbital velocity = 1 a.u. of velocity
* Orbital period = 2&quot;π&quot; a.u. of time
* Orbital angular velocity = 1 radian per a.u. of time
* Orbital momentum = 1 a.u. of momentum
* Ionization energy = a.u. of energy
* Electric field (due to nucleus) = 1 a.u. of electric field
* Lorentz force (due to nucleus) = 1 a.u. of force

<text>The Go-Go&#x27;s are an American all-female rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1978. Except for short periods when other musicians joined briefly, the band has had a relatively stable lineup consisting of Charlotte Caffey on lead guitar and keyboards, Belinda Carlisle on lead vocals, Gina Schock on drums, Kathy Valentine on bass, and Jane Wiedlin on rhythm guitar. 

The quintet emerged from the L.A. punk rock scene of the late 1970s and in 1981 released their debut album &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;. A first for an all-female band writing their material and playing their instruments, the LP topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and remains an achievement yet to be matched. &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; is considered one of the &quot;cornerstone albums of US new wave&quot; (AllMusic), having broken barriers and paved the way for a host of other new American acts. It yielded two of the Go-Go&#x27;s four biggest Hot 100 hits—&quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; (no. 20) and &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; (no. 2)—and, after a long and steady climb, reached number one in the chart dated March 6, 1982. The album stayed at the top for six consecutive weeks, eventually selling over two million copies. The group, credited as simply Go-Go&#x27;s on all of their US releases, was nominated for the Best New Artist award at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards.

Two more albums followed: &quot;Vacation&quot; (1982)—whose title track reached no. 8 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100—and &quot;Talk Show&quot; (1984), which included the hits &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (no. 11) and &quot;Turn to You&quot; (no. 32). The Go-Go&#x27;s have sold more than seven million records worldwide.

The Go-Go&#x27;s broke up in 1985, with each member embarking on a solo career and Carlisle being the most successful, having several top-5 singles through the late 1980s. They reconvened several times in the 1990s, releasing a new album in 2001, &quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, and touring. They received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. Though the band&#x27;s 2016 performances were billed as a farewell tour, the band remained active on an ad hoc basis for several years afterward. &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, a musical featuring the songs of the Go-Go&#x27;s, ran on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre from 2018 to 2019. The group was inducted into the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021. While the band announced their disbandment shortly after the Rock Hall induction, they have reunited several times for events, including an induction to the California Hall of Fame. They&#x27;ve also been announced as part of the bill for the May 2025 Cruel World concert festival in Pasadena, California.

==History==
===Original incarnation (1978–1980)===
Formed in Los Angeles in 1978 as the Misfits by Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle (vocals), Jane Wiedlin (guitar, background vocals), the Go-Go&#x27;s also included Margot Olavarria on bass and Elissa Bello on drums.

They were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community. They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name &quot;Dottie Danger&quot;, had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. After Carlisle became temporarily ill, she separated from the Germs before ever playing a gig.

The band began playing gigs at punk venues such as The Masque and the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles and the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco alongside bands such as X, Fear, the Plugz and the Controllers. Charlotte Caffey (lead guitar, keyboards, background vocals) was added later in 1978, and in the summer of 1979, Gina Schock replaced Bello on drums. With these lineup changes, the group began moving towards their more familiar power pop sound.

The group frequently met at a Denny&#x27;s on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and it was there they chose the band&#x27;s name.

In late 1979, the band recorded a five-song demo at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, and in 1980, they supported the British ska revival groups Madness and The Specials in both Los Angeles and England. The Go-Go&#x27;s subsequently spent half of 1980 touring England, earning a sizable following and releasing the demo version of &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; on Stiff Records, which became a minor UK hit.

In December 1980, original bassist Olavarria fell ill and was replaced with Kathy Valentine, who had played guitar in bands such as Girlschool and the Textones. Valentine had not previously played bass guitar. Carlisle also related in her autobiography, &quot;Lips Unsealed&quot;, that according to the band&#x27;s view, another reason for Olavarria&#x27;s dismissal from the Go-Go&#x27;s was that she frequently missed rehearsals, due largely to her dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s move away from punk and toward pop. In late 1982, Olavarria sued the remaining band members for wrongful removal. The lawsuit was settled in 1984. Olavarria later joined Martin Atkins&#x27; band Brian Brain.

===Career peak (1981–1983)===

The Go-Go&#x27;s signed to I.R.S. Records in April 1981. The following year, they toured with The Police on the Ghost in the Machine Tour. Their debut album, &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;, was a surprise hit: it topped the U.S. charts for six weeks in 1982 and eventually received a double platinum certification. The album was also successful outside the U.S., charting at No. 2 in Canada, where it received a platinum certification, and No. 27 in Australia. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 413 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; and a new version of &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; were popular singles in North America in early 1982. During this period, the Go-Go&#x27;s started building a fanbase.

In 1982, the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

The follow-up album, &quot;Vacation&quot;, received mixed reviews and sold less than &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;. However, the album was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned another Top 10 U.S. hit with the title track. Other singles released from the album were &quot;Get Up and Go&quot; and &quot;This Old Feeling&quot;, neither of which made it into the Top 40. In 1983, &quot;Vacation&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Packaging. During the album&#x27;s promotion, the group went on hiatus when Schock underwent surgery for a congenital heart defect.

===&quot;Talk Show&quot; and initial breakup (1984–1985)===

In 1984, the group returned with the Martin Rushent-produced album &quot;Talk Show&quot;. The album tracks &quot;Head over Heels&quot; and &quot;Turn to You&quot; were both Top 40 hits in the US. Despite the favorable reception, the album sold less than the previous two, not reaching the top 10 and not receiving any certification.

Personality conflicts and creative differences within the group were also taking a toll, as were drug addiction problems for some band members. Wiedlin announced her departure from the group in October 1984. The band sought a replacement, selecting Paula Jean Brown (of Giant Sand) as their new bass guitarist, with Valentine moving to rhythm guitar. This lineup debuted at the 1985 Rock in Rio festival, playing two shows, but Carlisle and Caffey soon realized their hearts were no longer in the group and decided to disband the Go-Go&#x27;s in May 1985.

===Reunions and lawsuit (1990–1999)===
In 1990, the Go-Go&#x27;s classic lineup (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Valentine, and Wiedlin) reunited to play a benefit concert for the California Environmental Protection Act, a 1990 ballot initiative. The band also entered the studio with producer David Z to re-record a cover of &quot;Cool Jerk&quot; for a greatest hits compilation.

In 1994, the same lineup got together again to release a two-disc retrospective entitled &quot;Return to the Valley of The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, featuring three new recordings. The single &quot;The Whole World Lost Its Head&quot; peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts and &quot;bubbled under&quot; on the US charts at No. 108, and became the band&#x27;s first and only Top 40 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 29. The band toured again to promote the release; ex-Bangle Vicki Peterson stood in on several dates for Caffey, who was pregnant.

In 1997, Schock sued the other group members, claiming that she had not been adequately paid for her contributions since 1986 and that a songwriting agreement with Caffey had been breached. The suit was resolved by 1999 and the Go-Go&#x27;s toured regularly from 1999 onward.

===&quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot; (2000–2009)===
In 2001, the band (still with the &quot;classic&quot; lineup) released an album of new material, &quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;. Green Day&#x27;s lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single, &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, which peaked at No. 22 on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Top 40 chart. The album was well received by critics and peaked at number 57 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band also released a DVD of their reunion concert in Central Park.

Also in 2001, the Go-Go&#x27;s, along with artists Elton John, Billy Joel, David Crosby and Paul Simon, performed at the concert &quot;An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson&quot; at Radio City Music Hall, hosted by the TNT network.

In 2002 the Go-Go&#x27;s recorded the theme song for the WB comedy series &quot;Do Over&quot;. Written by Charlotte Caffey, Kathy Valentine, and Jane Wiedlin, the track was recorded in Los Angeles for the show, which premiered on Sept. 19 on the network.

In 2004 the band hosted a concert in Costa Mesa together with The Motels.

===Farewell tour, departure of Kathy Valentine and Broadway musical (2010–2019)===

In February 2010, Carlisle announced that the 2010 tour would be billed as the &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;, but this tour was canceled when Wiedlin injured her knee while hiking near her home in Northern California, requiring surgery and up to a year of recovery time.

After 2010, the idea of a farewell tour seemed to have been abandoned, with the Go-Go&#x27;s touring frequently. In 2011, the Go-Go&#x27;s announced the &quot;Ladies Gone Wild&quot; tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;. They toured the US in 2012, with Abby Travis subbing for an injured Valentine during the latter part of the tour.

On March 8, 2013, the group&#x27;s official website said &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; had led to the departure of bassist Valentine. On May 24, Valentine sued her former bandmates for &quot;breach of fiduciary duty and abuse of control...in an attempt to deprive [her] of her position and interest in the group&quot;. Officially a quartet (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, and Wiedlin—Travis continued to play bass, but was not an official group member), the Go-Go&#x27;s continued on, playing a series of tour dates in 2013 and 2014, including several double bills with the B-52&#x27;s.

In 2014, the band was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame. That same year, Valentine&#x27;s lawsuit against her former bandmates was settled out of court.
On March 21, 2016, plans for a Go-Go&#x27;s farewell tour (minus Valentine) were officially announced. A band statement said: &quot;After a 38-year run, we are gearing up for one last blast of a summer tour&quot;.

Valentine rejoined the band to perform their first show together as a quintet in six years at New York&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom on January 31, 2018, to announce the Broadway dates of their new musical, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;. The new musical—which premiered at New York&#x27;s Hudson Theatre in the summer of 2018—features the band&#x27;s hits (including &quot;Get Up and Go&quot; and &quot;Lust to Love&quot;) as well as Carlisle&#x27;s solo hits &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;. The musical had a preview at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015.

===Documentary movie, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, reunion tour (2020–2025)===
In 2020, a documentary movie about the band premiered at Sundance, directed by Allison Ellwood after the band saw her work on the 2013 &quot;History of the Eagles&quot; documentary. In the US, the movie was seen on television on Showtime. The documentary features the formation and rise of the band through the 1980s breakup, skipping the lawsuits and reunions through the 1990s-2010s, ending with a 2019 reunion. On July 31, 2020, the Go-Go&#x27;s released their first new song in 19 years, &quot;Club Zero&quot;, which is featured in the documentary.

In January 2020, the band, which was to include Kathy Valentine, announced an 11-date reunion tour scheduled to begin in June 2020 however in May 2020 the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On October 30, 2021, the band was inducted by longtime fan Drew Barrymore into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

On December 14, 2021, the band performed a special show, with most of the audience being contest winners, at the Whisky a Go Go to celebrate their induction. Clem Burke filled in on drums for Gina Schock. On December 27, 2021, the band postponed a short West Coast tour scheduled for the first week of January 2022 due to a COVID-19 case involving someone on the tour.

After playing six US dates in March 2022 (in Reno and several stops in California), the band announced plans for a 2022 UK tour with Billy Idol to start in June 2022. However, due to Billy Idol&#x27;s illness, the tour had to be postponed, and the band could no longer participate in the tour.

In 2023, Belinda Carlisle declared that the group had disbanded, noting &quot;we felt there was something to be said about leaving on a high note and it doesn&#x27;t get much bigger than being inducted into the Hall of Fame. That&#x27;s kind of the pinnacle. After that, we felt it was time.&quot; Their last show was their performance in San Diego on March 31, 2022.

The band reunited in Sacramento on February 7, 2024 to be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, and &quot;played a short, rowdy, acoustic set&quot; at the afterparty. 

On October 21, 2024, the band announced via their official Instagram page that they were reuniting to play the Cruel World Festival, which will be held on May 17, 2025 in Pasadena, CA.

<doc id="174926" wikidata="Q244616" url="?curid=174926" title="George Grenville">
<text>George Grenville (14 October 1712 – 13 November 1770) was a British Whig statesman who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain, during the early reign of the young George III. He served for only two years (1763-1765), and attempted to solve the problem of the massive debt resulting from the Seven Years&#x27; War. He instituted a series of measures to increase revenue to the crown, including new taxes and enforcement of collection, and sought to bring the North American colonies under tighter crown control. 

Born into an influential political family, Grenville first entered Parliament in 1741 as an MP for Buckingham. He emerged as one of Cobham&#x27;s Cubs, a group of young members of Parliament associated with Lord Cobham. In 1754, Grenville became Treasurer of the Navy, a position he held twice until 1761. In October 1761 he chose to stay in government and accepted the new role of Leader of the Commons causing a rift with his brother-in-law and political ally William Pitt who had resigned. Grenville was subsequently made Northern Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty by the new prime minister Lord Bute. On 8 April 1763, Lord Bute resigned, and Grenville assumed his position as prime minister. 

His government tried to bring public spending under control and pursued an assertive policy over the North American colonies and colonial settlers. His best-known policy is the Stamp Act, a long-standing tax in Great Britain which Grenville extended to the colonies in America, but which instigated widespread opposition in Britain&#x27;s American colonies and was later repealed. Grenville had increasingly strained relations with his colleagues and the King. In 1765, he was dismissed by George III and replaced by Lord Rockingham. For the last five years of his life, Grenville led a group of his supporters in opposition and staged a public reconciliation with Pitt.

Grenville married Elizabeth Wyndham, the granddaughter of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, the great-great-grandson of Lady Katherine Grey, who was herself a great-granddaughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, and sister of Lady Jane Grey.

==Early life: 1712-1741 ==
=== Family ===

George Grenville was born at Wotton House on 14 October 1712. He was the second son of Sir Richard Grenville and Hester Temple (later the 1st Countess Temple). He was one of five brothers, all of whom became MPs. His sister Hester Grenville married the leading political figure William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. His elder brother was Richard Grenville, later the 2nd Earl Temple. It was intended by his parents that George Grenville should become a lawyer.

=== Education ===
Grenville was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, but did not graduate.

==Early political career: 1741-1756 ==
===Member of Parliament===
He entered Parliament in 1741 as one of the two members for Buckingham, and continued to represent that borough for the next twenty-nine years until his death. He was disappointed to be giving up what appeared to be a promising legal career for the uncertainties of opposition politics.

In Parliament, he subscribed to the &quot;Boy Patriot&quot; party, which opposed Sir Robert Walpole. In particular he enjoyed the patronage of his uncle Lord Cobham, the leader of a faction that included George Grenville, his brother Richard, William Pitt and George Lyttelton that became known as Cobham&#x27;s Cubs.

===Administration===
In December 1744 he became a Lord of the Admiralty in the administration of Henry Pelham. He allied himself with his brother Richard and with William Pitt (who became their brother-in-law in 1754) in forcing Pelham to give them promotion by rebelling against his authority and obstructing business. In June 1747, Grenville became a Lord of the Treasury.

In 1754 Grenville was made Treasurer of the Navy and Privy Councillor. Along with Pitt and several other colleagues he was dismissed in 1755 after speaking and voting against the government on a debate about a recent subsidy treaty with Russia which they believed was unnecessarily costly, and would drag Britain into Continental European disputes. Opposition to European entanglements was a cornerstone of Patriot Whig thinking.

He and Pitt joined the opposition, haranguing the Newcastle government. Grenville and Pitt both championed the formation of a British militia to provide additional security rather than the deployment of Hessian mercenaries favoured by the government. As the military situation deteriorated following the loss of Minorca, the government grew increasingly weak until it was forced to resign in Autumn 1756.

==In Government: 1756-1763==
===Treasurer of the Navy===
Pitt then formed a government led by the Duke of Devonshire. Grenville was returned to his position as Treasurer of the Navy, which was a great disappointment as he had been expecting to receive the more prestigious and lucrative post of Paymaster of the Forces. This added to what Grenville regarded as a series of earlier slights in which Pitt and others had passed him over for positions in favour of men he considered no more talented than he was. From then on Grenville felt a growing resentment towards Pitt, and grew closer to the young Prince of Wales and his advisor Lord Bute who were both now opposed to Pitt.

In 1758, as Treasurer of the Navy, he introduced and carried a bill which established a fairer system of paying the wages of seamen and supporting their families while they were at sea which was praised for its humanity if not for its effectiveness. He remained in office during the years of British victories, notably the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 for which the credit went to the government of which he was a member. However his seven-year-old son died after a long illness and Grenville remained by his side at their country house in Wotton and rarely came to London.

In 1761, when Pitt resigned upon the question of the war with Spain, and subsequently functioned as Leader of the House of Commons in the administration of Lord Bute. Grenville&#x27;s role was seen as an attempt to keep someone closely associated with Pitt involved in the government, in order to prevent Pitt and his supporters actively opposing the government. However, it soon led to conflict between Grenville and Pitt. Grenville was also seen as a suitable candidate because his reputation for honesty meant he commanded loyalty and respect amongst independent MPs.

===Northern Secretary===

In May 1762, Grenville was appointed Northern Secretary, where he took an increasingly hard line in the negotiations with France and Spain designed to bring the Seven Years&#x27; War to a close.

Grenville demanded much greater compensation in exchange for the return of British conquests, while Bute favored a more generous position which eventually formed the basis of the Treaty of Paris. In spite of this, Grenville had now become associated with Bute rather than his former political allies who were even more vocal in their opposition to the peace treaty than he was. In October he was made First Lord of the Admiralty. Henry Fox took over as Leader of the Commons, and forced the peace treaty through parliament.

Bute&#x27;s position grew increasingly untenable as he was extremely unpopular, which led to him offering his resignation to George III on several occasions. Bute was the target of the radical John Wilkes&#x27;s criticism and satire. He was ridiculed in Wilkes&#x27; newspaper &quot;The North Briton&quot;, a stereotypical reference to the prime minister&#x27;s Scottish heritage.

==Prime Minister: 1763-1765 ==

=== Appointment ===
Bute&#x27;s intention to resign was genuine, and the hostile press attacks and the continuing unpopularity of his government finally led to King George III to reluctantly accept his resignation. Though the king was unsure whom should be appoint to the position and Bute highly recommended that the King should appoint Grenville as the new prime minister. Despite the King&#x27;s disapproval and distrust of his ministers, he considered appointing Grenville to office.

When Grenville was asked about becoming the new prime minister, he agreed only on the condition that Bute would not take an active part in politics and be barred from voicing policies for the government. The King agreed and thus appointed Grenville as new prime minister. George III assured Grenville that &quot;he meant to put his government solely into his hand&quot;. Grenville set to work and formed his government on 16 April 1763. He appointed two of his trusted allies Lord Halifax and Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont as Northern Secretary and Southern Secretary respectively. He also appointed the Lord Northington as Lord High Chancellor, Lord Granville as Lord President of the Council as well.

=== Domestic issues ===
==== Arrest of John Wilkes ====
House of Commons was thrown into doubt by the first case involving the Member of Parliament John Wilkes, a radical reformer and political activist who promoted parliamentary representation and reform, whose critique of the former prime minister led to his resignation.
Wilkes was regarded by many as threat to the government and therefore was treated suspiciously. In 1763, it came to be one of Grenville&#x27;s first acts to prosecute Wilkes for publishing in &quot;The North Briton&quot; newspaper an article deriding King George III&#x27;s speech made on 23 April 1763. Wilkes was prosecuted for &quot;seditious libel&quot;. That was a massive tactical blunder by the secretaries of state, for it was perceived as a violation of individual liberty that raised the political discontent. 

After fighting a duel with a supporter of the Grenville ministry, Samuel Martin, Wilkes fled to France for asylum. Despite government officials calling on him to be arrested, Wilkes was later returned to England and was elected and re-elected by the Middlesex constituency. He was continually refused admission to parliament by parliament, and proved a problem to several successive governments.

==== Monetary debt ====
The time of the Seven Years&#x27; War was a tumultuous period in the history of Europe and was fought on a global conflict scale. Even though Great Britain defeated France and its allies and rose to the position as a dominant world power, the victory came at a great cost. In January 1763, Great Britain&#x27;s national debt was more than £122 million pounds, an enormous sum for the time. Interest on the debt was more than £4.4 million a year. Figuring out how to pay the interest alone absorbed the attention of the King and his ministers.

As Britain was trying to recover from the costs of the Seven Years&#x27; War and now in dire need of finances for the British army in the American colonies, Grenville&#x27;s most immediate task was to restore the nation&#x27;s finances. He also had to deal with the fall-out from Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, which erupted in North America in 1763. Although, initially, prominent measures of his government included the prosecution of John Wilkes, focus shifted from arresting radicals to paying off the national debt. The passing of the tax measures in America had proved to be a disaster and would lead to the first symptoms of alienation between American colonies and Great Britain.

=== Colonial reforms ===
 
==== Measures and taxes ====
Many of the acts passed by the British were perceived by the colonists as threatening to their liberties. Although not a part of the Grenville government&#x27;s programme, the issue was generally attributed to him by the colonists. Another one of the most controversial acts passed by Grenville was the Quartering Act on 15 May 1765. Enacted because of a request by Major General Thomas Gage, commander-in-chief in North America, to give better housing for his troops stationed in the colonies.
One of the more prominent measures of the Grenville&#x27;s government occurred in March 1765 when Grenville authored the Stamp Act 1765, enacted in November of that year. It was an exclusive tax placed on the colonies in America requiring that documents and newspapers be printed on stamped paper from London bearing an embossed revenue stamp that had to be paid for in British currency. It was met with general outrage and resulted in public acts of disobedience and rioting throughout the colonies in America.

===Foreign policy===
The signing of the treaty in February 1763 formally marked the conclusion of the Seven Years&#x27; War experienced by Britain and as such, foreign policy, along with military policy and diplomacy, no longer became the dominant concern of both domestic politics and government agenda. Focus thus shifted to seemingly more relevant issues such as the survival of the Grenville Ministry. But overall the British relations, after negotiating, with the French and the Spanish, remained hostile and suspicious of its enemies and that wariness concluded the entirety of Grenville&#x27;s policy.

When seemingly, the French and the Spanish began to support Britain&#x27;s colonial dissenters in the Americas and beyond and threatening British allies in the continent, promoting disputes and resentment from British politicians who viewed them as a violation of British sovereignty. Britain begun a process of isolation, when Britain had no allies in the continent and the allies it did have were weak or less significant in military or political might.

In disputes with Spain and France, Grenville managed to secure British objectives by deploying what was later described as gunboat diplomacy. During his ministry. Britain&#x27;s international isolation increased, as Britain failed to secure alliances with other major European powers, a situation that subsequent governments were unable to reverse leading to Britain fighting several countries during the American War of Independence without a major ally.

===Dismissal===
The King made various attempts to induce Pitt to come to his rescue by forming a ministry, but without success. George at last had recourse to Lord Rockingham. When Rockingham agreed to accept office, the king dismissed Grenville in July 1765. He never again held office.

The nickname of &quot;gentle shepherd&quot; was given him because he bored the House by asking over and over again, during the debate on the Cider Bill of 1763, that somebody should tell him &quot;where&quot; to lay the new tax if it was not to be put on cider. Pitt whistled the air of the popular tune (by Boyce) &quot;Gentle Shepherd, tell me where&quot;, and the House laughed. Though few surpassed him in knowledge of the forms of the House or in mastery of administrative details, he lacked tact in dealing with people and affairs.

==Later life: 1765-1770==
=== In Opposition ===
After a period of active opposition to the Chatham Ministry led by Pitt between 1766 and 1768, Grenville became an elder statesman during his last few years – seeking to avoid becoming associated with any faction or party in the House of Commons. He was able to oversee the re-election of his core group of supporters in the 1768 General Election. His followers included Robert Clive and Lord George Sackville and he received support from his elder brother Lord Temple.

In late 1768 he reconciled with Pitt and the two joined forces, re-uniting the partnership that had broken up in 1761 when Pitt had resigned from the government. Grenville was successful in mobilising the opposition during the Middlesex election dispute.

Grenville prosecuted John Wilkes and the printers and authors for treason and sedition for publishing a bitter editorial about King George III&#x27;s recent speech in &quot;The North Briton&quot; a weekly periodical. After losing the case Grenville lost favor from the public who regarded the act as an attempt to silence or control the press.

=== Advocate and critic ===
Although personally opposed to Wilkes, Grenville saw the government&#x27;s attempt to bar him from the Commons as unconstitutional and opposed it on principle.

Following a French invasion of Corsica in 1768 Grenville advocated sending British support to the Corsican Republic. Grenville was critical of the Grafton Government&#x27;s failure to intervene and he considered such weakness would encourage the French. In the House of Commons he observed &quot;For fear of going to war, you will make a war unavoidable&quot;.

In 1770 Grenville steered a bill concerning the results of contested elections, a major issue in the eighteenth century, into law – despite strong opposition from the government.

=== Death ===
Grenville died on 13 November 1770, aged 58. His personal following divided after his death, with a number joining the government of Lord North. In the long-term, the Grenvillites were revived by William Pitt the Younger who served as prime minister from 1783 and dominated British politics until his death in 1806. Grenville&#x27;s own son, William Grenville, later served briefly as prime minister. Grenville is buried at Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire

George Grenville&#x27;s post mortem was carried up by John Hunter who retained specimens in his collection which later became the Hunterian Museum. Subsequent analysis of these specimens published by the Royal College of Surgeons of England suggests that George Grenville was affected by Multiple myeloma at the time of his death.

==Legacy==
He was one of the relatively few prime ministers (others include Henry Pelham, William Pitt the Younger, Spencer Perceval, George Canning, Sir Robert Peel, William Ewart Gladstone, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Bonar Law, Ramsay MacDonald, Neville Chamberlain, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Heath, Sir John Major, Sir Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak) who never acceded to the peerage).

The town of Grenville, Quebec, was named after George Grenville. The town is in turn the namesake for the Grenville orogeny, a long-lived Mesoproterozoic mountain-building event associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Its record is a prominent orogenic belt which spans a significant portion of the North American continent, from Labrador to Mexico, and extends to Scotland.

==Family life==

In 1749 Grenville married Elizabeth Wyndham (1719 – 5 December 1769), daughter of Sir William Wyndham, and the granddaughter of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. Somerset did not approve of their marriage and consequently left Elizabeth only a small sum in his will.

The couple had four sons and four daughters. (One account states they had five daughters.)

# Richard Grenville (died 1759), died young
# George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham (17 June 1753 – 11 February 1813), father of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos
# Charlotte Grenville ( – 29 September 1830), married Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet (1749–1789) on 21 December 1771, and had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood
# Thomas Grenville (31 December 1755 – 17 December 1846), MP and bibliophile, died unmarried
# Elizabeth Grenville (24 October 1756 – 21 December 1842), married (as his second wife) John Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort (1751–1828), on 12 April 1787, and had three daughters
# William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville (25 October 1759 – 12 January 1834), later Prime Minister
# Catherine Grenville (1761 – 6 November 1796), married Richard Neville-Aldworth (1750–1825), afterwards Richard Griffin, 2nd Baron Braybrooke, on 19 June 1780, and had four children.
# Hester Grenville (before 1767 – 13 November 1847), married Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue, on 10 May 1782 and had nine children

At the time of his death in 1770, he was the heir presumptive to the Earldom of Temple held by his elder brother Richard (who had succeeded their mother in that title in 1752, but had no sons). When Richard died in 1779, George&#x27;s second (but eldest surviving) son, also George, therefore succeeded as 3rd Earl Temple, and was later created Marquess of Buckingham. His male line survived until the death of the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1889.

<text>Acer saccharinum, commonly known as silver maple, creek maple, silverleaf maple, soft maple, large maple, water maple, swamp maple, or white maple, is a species of maple native to the eastern and central United States and southeastern Canada. It is one of the most common trees in the United States.

Although the silver maple&#x27;s Latin name is similar, it should not be confused with &quot;Acer saccharum&quot;, the sugar maple. Some of the common names are also applied to other maples, especially &quot;Acer rubrum&quot;.

==Description==

The silver maple tree is a relatively fast-growing deciduous tree, commonly reaching a height of , exceptionally . Its spread will generally be wide. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about tall. It is often found along waterways and in wetlands, leading to the colloquial name &quot;water maple&quot;. It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees.
The leaves are simple and palmately veined, long and broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed. The autumn color is less pronounced than in many maples, generally ending up a pale yellow, although some specimens can produce a more brilliant yellow and even orange and red colorations. The tree has a tendency to color and drop its leaves slightly earlier in autumn than other maples.

The flowers are in dense clusters, produced before the leaves in early spring, with the seeds maturing in early summer. The fruit is a schizocarp of two single-seeded, winged samaras. The wing of each samara is about long. The fruit of this species is the largest among the maples native to its range. Although the wings provide for some transport by air, the fruit are heavy and are also transported by water. Silver maple and its close cousin red maple are the only &quot;Acer&quot; species which produce their fruit crop in spring instead of fall. The seeds of both trees have no epigeal dormancy and will germinate immediately. Seed production begins at 11 years of age and large crops are produced most years. Like most maples, silver maple can be variably dioecious (separate male or female trees) or monoecious (male and female flowers on the same tree) but dioecious trees are far more common. They can also change sex from year to year.

On mature trunks, the bark is gray and shaggy. On branches and young trunks, the bark is smooth and silvery gray.

==Cultivation and uses==

Wildlife uses the silver maple in various ways. In many parts of the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for squirrels during the spring, after many acorns and nuts have sprouted and the squirrels&#x27; food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for chipmunks and birds. The bark can be eaten by beaver and deer. The trunks tend to produce cavities, which can shelter squirrels, raccoons, opossums, owls and woodpeckers, and are frequented by carpenter ants. Additionally, the leaves serve as a source of food for species of Lepidoptera, such as the rosy maple moth (&quot;Dryocampa rubicunda&quot;).

The wood can be used as pulp for making paper. Lumber from the tree is used in furniture, cabinets, flooring, musical instruments, crates, and tool handles, because it is light and easily worked. Because of the silver maple&#x27;s fast growth, it is being researched as a potential source of biofuels. Silver maple produces a sweet sap but it is generally not used by commercial sugarmakers because its sugar content is lower than in other maple species.

Silver maple is often planted as an ornamental tree because of its rapid growth and ease of propagation and transplanting. It is highly tolerant of urban situations and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood which is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple&#x27;s root system is shallow and fibrous and easily invades septic fields and old drain pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, &quot;A. saccharinum&quot; may live up to 130 years but in urban environments often 80 or less.

Following World War&quot; &quot;II, silver maples were commonly used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially as a replacement for the blighted American elm. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings. Today the tree has fallen so far out of favor that some towns and cities have banned its use as a street tree.

Silver maple&#x27;s natural range encompasses most of the eastern US, the Midwestern US and southern Canada, that being Southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec. It is generally absent from the humid US coastal plain south of Maryland, so it is confined to the Appalachians in those states. It does not occur along the Gulf Coast or in Florida outside a few scattered locations in the panhandle.

It is commonly cultivated outside its native range, showing tolerance of a wide range of climates, and growing successfully as far north as central Norway. It also is in Anchorage, Alaska. It can thrive in a Mediterranean climate, as at Jerusalem and Los Angeles, if summer water is provided. It is also grown in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere: Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, the southern states of Brazil (and in a few low-temperature locations within the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais).

The silver maple is closely related to the red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;) and can hybridise with it. The hybrid is known as the Freeman maple (&quot;Acer × freemanii&quot;). The Freeman maple is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, combining the fast growth of silver maple with the less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of the red maple. The cultivar &quot;Acer × freemanii&quot; = &#x27;Jeffersred&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The silver maple is the favored host of the maple bladder gall mite &quot;Vasates quadripedes&quot;.

===Native American ethnobotany===
Native Americans used the sap of wild trees to make sugar, as medicine, and in bread. They used the wood to make baskets and furniture. An infusion of bark removed from the south side of the tree is used by the Mohegan as cough medicine. The Cherokee take an infusion of the bark to treat cramps, menstrual pains, dysentery, and hives. They boil the inner bark and use it with water as a wash for sore eyes. They take a hot infusion of the bark to treat measles. They use the tree to make baskets, for lumber, building material, and for carving.

<text>Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae. It is native to the hardwood forests of eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Sugar maple is best known for being the primary source of maple syrup and for its brightly colored fall foliage. It may also be called &quot;rock maple,&quot; &quot;sugar tree,&quot; &quot;sweet maple,&quot; or, particularly in reference to the wood, &quot;hard maple,&quot; &quot;birds-eye maple,&quot; or &quot;curly maple,&quot; the last two being specially figured lumber. 

== Description ==
&quot;Acer saccharum&quot; is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of , and exceptionally up to . A 10-year-old tree is typically about tall. As with most trees, forest-grown sugar maples form a much taller trunk and narrower canopy than open-growth ones.

The leaves are deciduous, up to long and wide, palmate, with five lobes and borne in opposite pairs. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the silver maple, however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow on some trees through orange to fluorescent red-orange on others. Sugar maples also have a tendency to color unevenly in fall. In some trees, all colors above can be seen at the same time. They also share a tendency with red maples for certain parts of a mature tree to change color weeks ahead of or behind the remainder of the tree. The leaf buds are pointy and brown-colored. The recent year&#x27;s growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.

The flowers are in panicles of five to ten together, yellow-green and without petals; flowering occurs in early spring after 30–55 growing degree days. The sugar maple will generally begin flowering when it is between 10 and 200 years old. The fruit is a pair of samaras (winged seeds). The seeds are globose, in diameter, the wing long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn, where they must be exposed to 45 days of temperatures below to break their coating down. Germination of &quot;A. saccharum&quot; is slow, not taking place until the following spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past.
It is closely related to the black maple, which is sometimes included in this species, but sometimes separated as &quot;Acer nigrum&quot;. The western sugar maple (&quot;Acer grandidentatum&quot;) and southern sugar maple ((&quot;Acer floridanum&quot;) are also treated as a varieties or subspecies of northern sugar maple by some botanists.

The sugar maple can be confused with the Norway maple, which is not native to America but is commonly planted in cities and suburbs, and they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the Norway maple has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the Norway maple has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the sugar maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway maple.


== Ecology ==
The sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the northern and Midwestern U.S. hardwood forests. Due to its need for cold winters, sugar maple is mostly found north of the 42nd parallel in USDA growing zones 3–5. It is less common in the southern part of its range (USDA Zone 6) where summers are hot and humid; there sugar maple is confined to ravines and moist flatlands. In the east, south of Maryland, it is limited to the Appalachians. In the west, Tennessee represents the southern limit of its range and Missouri its southwestern limit. Collection of sap for sugar is also not possible in the southern part of sugar maple&#x27;s range as winter temperatures do not become cold enough.

The minimum seed-bearing age of sugar maple is about 30 years. The tree is long-lived, typically 200 years and occasionally as much as 300.

Sugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates and requires a hard freeze each winter for proper dormancy. In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about and July temperatures about ; in southern parts, January temperatures average about and July temperatures average almost . Seed germination also requires extremely low temperatures, the optimal being just slightly above freezing, and no other known tree species has this property. Germination of sugar maple seed in temperatures above is rare to nonexistent.

&quot;Acer saccharum&quot; is among the most shade tolerant of large deciduous trees. Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the striped maple, a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. Sugar maple can tolerate virtually any soil type short of pure sand, but does not tolerate xeric or swampy conditions.

Sugar maples are deeper-rooted than most maples and engage in hydraulic lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it. 

The mushroom &quot;Pholiota squarrosoides&quot; is known to decay the logs of the tree.

Human influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple&#x27;s role as a street tree.

In some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the Norway maple. The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple&#x27;s replacement in those areas. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.

== Cultivation and uses ==
=== Maple syrup and other food use ===

The sugar maple is one of the most important Canadian trees, being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making maple syrup. Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar content and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two. In maple syrup production from &quot;Acer saccharum&quot;, the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark. The collected sap is then boiled. As the sap boils, the water evaporates and the syrup is left behind. Forty gallons of maple sap produces 1 gallon of syrup. In the southern part of their range, sugar maples produce little sap; syrup production is dependent on the tree growing in cooler climates.

Additionally, the samaras (seeds) can be soaked, and—with their wings removed—boiled, seasoned, and roasted to make them edible. The young leaves and inner bark can be eaten either raw or cooked.

=== Timber ===

The sapwood can be white, and smaller logs may have a higher proportion of this desirable wood. Bowling alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy wood grain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and &quot;birdseye maple&quot; forms, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with white ash. In recent years, because white ash has become threatened by emerald ash borer, sugar maple wood has increasingly displaced ash for baseball bat production. It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), grand pianos (rim), and drum shells. It is also often used in the manufacture of sporting goods.

Canadian maple, often referred to as &quot;Canadian hardrock maple&quot;, is prized for pool cues, especially the shafts. Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as &quot;sugar marks&quot;, which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood. The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration. Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it. The wood is also used in skateboards, gunstocks, and flooring for its strength. Canadian hardrock maple is also used in the manufacture of electric guitar necks due to its high torsional stability and the bright, crisp resonant tone it produces. If the grain is curly, with flame or quilt patterns, it is usually reserved for more expensive instruments. In high-end guitars this wood is sometimes Torrefied to cook out the Lignin resins, allowing the greater stability to climate &amp; environmental changes, and to enhance its tonal characteristics as the instrument&#x27;s resonance is more evenly distributed across the cellulose structure of the wood without the lignin.

=== Urban planting ===

Sugar maple was a favourite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful autumn colour. As noted above, however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile-induced pollution and was replaced by Norway maple and other hardier species. It is intolerant of road salt. Sugar Maples are commonly planted as a street tree in cities within the Mountain West region of the United States, usually a different cultivar such as the “Legacy” sugar maple. The shade and the shallow, fibrous roots may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep, well-drained loam is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of humus. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to boron. The species is also subject to defoliation when there are dense populations of larvae of Lepidoptera species like the rosy maple moth (&quot;Dryocampa rubicunda&quot;).

=== Use by Native Americans ===
The Mohegan use the inner bark as a cough remedy, and the sap as a sweetening agent, and to make maple syrup following the introduction of metal cookware by Europeans.

== Big trees ==

The United States national champion for &quot;Acer saccharum&quot; is located in Charlemont, Massachusetts. In 2007, the year it was submitted, it had a circumference of at above the ground&#x27;s surface, and thus a diameter at breast height of about . At that time the tree was tall with an average crown spread of . Using the scoring system of circumference in inches plus height in feet plus 25% of crown spread in feet resulted in a total number of 368 points at the National Register of Big Trees. A tree in Lyme, Connecticut, measured in 2012, had a circumference of , or an average diameter at breast height of about . This tree had been tall with a crown spread of , counting for a total number of 364 points.

== In popular culture ==

The sugar maple is the state tree of the US states of New York, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

It is depicted on the state quarter of Vermont, issued in 2001.

<text>Lincoln Barrington &quot;Sugar&quot; Minott (25 May 1956 – 10 July 2010) was a Jamaican reggae and dancehall singer, record producer and sound-system operator.

==Biography==
After working as a selector on the &quot;Sound of Silence Keystone&quot; sound system, and then his own &quot;Gathering of Youth&quot; system, he began his singing career as part of The African Brothers in 1969, along with Tony Tuff and Derrick Howard. The group released several singles in the first half of the 1970s on labels such as Micron and their own Ital label, and were an early example of the Rastafari movement&#x27;s influence on the Jamaican music scene, taking a clear lead from The Abyssinians. After recording &quot;Mysterious Nature&quot; for producer Rupie Edwards, the group recorded 1974&#x27;s &quot;No Cup No Broke&quot; for Studio One, breaking up shortly after.
Minott then teamed up with the producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd, as studio apprentice at Dodd&#x27;s Studio One, working as a singer, guitarist and percussionist, and soon began recording his own singles. Minott developed a talent for writing new songs to fit over existing rhythms (which at the time was common when singers performed live, but rare in the studio), often proving more popular than the original songs, pioneering an approach that would be central to the emerging dancehall style.

After a number of moderately successful hits for Studio One, such as &quot;Vanity&quot;, &quot;Hang On Natty&quot;, &quot;Mr. DC&quot;, and &quot;Jah Jah Children&quot;, his debut LP &quot;Live Loving&quot; made his name and increased his popularity, and is regarded as pioneering the dancehall style that would dominate the early 1980s. It was followed in 1979 with a second album, &quot;Showcase&quot;, which included his singles that had been omitted from the first album.

The &quot;Bittersweet&quot; album followed, and then the third album of 1979, &quot;Ghetto-ology&quot;, which saw a return to roots reggae. &quot;Roots Lovers&quot; (1980) saw a move towards lovers rock, which was a UK hit. He became a bigger star in the UK than in Jamaica, his self-produced &quot;Hard Time Pressure&quot; being a major UK reggae hit in 1980, leading Minott to relocate to the UK, where he became a focus for UK reggae.

Singles such as &quot;Run Come&quot;, &quot;Not for Sale&quot;, &quot;African Girl&quot;, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, &quot;In a Dis Ya Time&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Make It with You&quot; (with Carroll Thompson) were hits in the years that followed. &quot;Good Thing Going&quot; (a cover of a song originally recorded by Michael Jackson in 1971) was picked up for distribution by RCA and reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, leading to an album of the same name. The &quot;Herbman Hustling&quot; album saw a return to dancehall and roots reggae.

He released an album of recordings from Channel One Studios, &quot;With Lots Of Extra&quot; in 1983, collecting several hits from his time working with Winston Holness.

Returning to Jamaica, his &quot;Youth Promotion&quot; sound system performed regularly in Kingston&#x27;s Maxfield Park, featuring Jah Stitch and newcomers who had been nurtured by his organization such as Ranking Joe, Captain Sinbad, and Ranking Dread. His Black Roots label featured his productions of these artists plus others such as Barry Brown, Tenor Saw, Little John, Tony Tuff, Barrington Levy, Horace Andy, and one of his discoveries from England, Trevor Hartley. Minott also produced early works by Nitty Gritty, Junior Reid, Yami Bolo, Colourman, Daddy Freddy and Garnett Silk.

In 1980s he was working with producers in Jamaica including, Mikey Dread, George Phang, Sly and Robbie, Philip &quot;Fatis&quot; Burrell, Channel One, Prince Jammy, and Donovan Germain, as well as recording for United States–based Lloyd &quot;Bullwackie&quot; Barnes (the &quot;Wicked A Go feel It&quot; album from 1984). His biggest hits included &quot;Herbman Hustling&quot;, &quot;No Vacancy&quot;, &quot;Jamming in the Street&quot;, &quot;Rub A Dub Sound&quot;, &quot;Buy Off The Bar&quot;, &quot;Rydim&quot;, and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pickney&quot;.

He linked up with Sly and Robbie for 1984&#x27;s &quot;Rub a Dub Sound Style&quot; single, which is regarded as a prototype for the ragga style that developed in the mid-1980s. Sugar Minott continued to record on his Black Roots label, Youth Promotion Label and for Major and Independent labels. His albums receive increasingly exciting reviews. He released over 60 albums and hundreds of singles. He is one of the artists who appeared on the (2006) record, &quot;Radiodread&quot;, released by the Easy Star label, providing the guest vocals on the song &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot;.

Minott&#x27;s desire for independence led him to leave Studio One in 1978 and form his own Black Roots Records label and Youth Promotion organization, the latter with the aim of helping young singers from the same ghetto background as himself. Minott also ran the Youthman Promotion sound-system, giving young performers their first public exposure. Youthman Promotion has new selectors working alongside the veterans of Major Stitch, Ragga Steve and Drifter, Daddy Ants, Mr Shorty and Jimmy Knuckles. The selectors most recently added to the sound are DiGeneral Starry B in 2007, alongside Poochiny and Jr War, who were added in 2012. Ragga Steve has taken full control of the sound with Earl Minott in the UK.

Minott married music executive Maxine Stowe, niece of Clement Coxsone Dodd in 1993, she was then working at Columbia Records. They met At Coxsone’s Music City in Brooklyn, New York in 1978, where they collaborated and produced the album &quot;Roots Lovers&quot;. They have four children, Rachiim, Jahson, Candice and Osunya. Sugar has 13 children with one, Alton, predeceasing him. The other children are Tamar, Lincoln Jr., Daniel, Debbie, Andrew, Tamar Elaine, Kelly &amp; Linval.

==Death==
Minott died on 10 July 2010 at the University Hospital of the West Indies in St. Andrew Parish, Jamaica, after being admitted earlier that day. The cause of death remains undisclosed. He had been affected by a heart condition since early 2009, and cancelled several performances in May 2010 due to chest pains.

He is survived by his widow Maxine Stowe and 13 children, grandchildren, brothers, and sisters.

In May 2012, a charity concert was held at his former home commemorating his birthday, with Minott&#x27;s children (who include daughter Tamar, aka Pashon) joined by Bounty Killer, Sizzla, Beenie Man, Junior Reid, Ken Boothe and John Holt. Proceeds went to the Youthman Promotions Music Centre and other causes helping local poor people.

In 2019, he was honoured with a Reggae Gold award by the Jamaican government for his contributions as artist and producer.

<text>The Motorola 68008 is an 8/32-bit microprocessor introduced by Motorola in 1982. It is a version of 1979&#x27;s Motorola 68000 with an 8-bit external data bus, as well as a smaller address bus. The 68008 was available with 20 or 22 address lines (respective to 48-pin or 52-pin package) which allowed 1 MB or 4 MB address space versus the 16 MB addressable on the 68000. The 68008 was designed to work with lower cost and simpler 8-bit memory systems. Because of its smaller data bus, it was roughly half as fast as a 68000 of the same clock speed. It was still faster than competing 8-bit microprocessors, because internally the 68008 behaves identically to the 68000 and has the same microarchitecture.

Motorola ended production of the 68008 in 1996.

==Details==
The 68008 is an HMOS chip with about with a speed grade of . There are two versions of the chip. The original is in a 48-pin dual in-line package with a 20-bit address bus, allowing it to use up to 1 megabyte of memory. A later version is in a 52-pin plastic leaded chip carrier; this version has a 22-bit address bus and can support of RAM.

==Usages==
The Sinclair QL microcomputer and Luxor ABC 1600 use the 68008 as their main processor.

<doc id="174943" wikidata="Q423731" url="?curid=174943" title="Biographical evaluation">
<text>Biographical evaluation (; literally meaning&quot; &#x27;Knowledge of Men&#x27;, &quot;but more commonly understood as the &quot;Science of Narrators)&quot; refers to a discipline of Islamic religious studies within hadith terminology in which the narrators of hadith are evaluated. Its goal is to establish the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge, in order to distinguish authentic and reliable hadiths from unreliable hadiths. &#x27; is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as &#x27; (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.

== Significance ==
In his &quot;Introduction to the Science of Hadith&quot;, Ibn al-Salah, a renowned hadith specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, &#x27;Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,&#x27; Ibn al-Salah said, &quot;This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness.&quot; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the &quot;maintenance of the Shariah, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation&quot;.

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, Ali ibn al-Madini, an early authority on the subject, said, &quot;Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge.&quot;

== History ==
===Time of the Companions===
While many Companions narrated hadith, according to Ahmad ibn Hanbal there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: Abu Huraira, Abdullah ibn Umar, Aisha, Jabir ibn Abdullah, Ibn Abbas and Anas ibn Malik with Abu Huraira being the most prolific of them. According to Ibn al-Salah the most prolific narrators from the Companions was Abu Huraira followed by Ibn Abbas.

In spite of the Companions&#x27; efforts in narrating their hadith, there was no need for them to evaluate each other&#x27;s narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the Companions to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them. However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the Tabi&#x27;un with some criticism of specific individuals from them. and al-Baghdadi&#x27;s stance is contrary to modern approaches like historical criticism.

===After the Companions===
As for the Tabi&#x27;un, the generation following the Companions, their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for fabricating hadith, but, instead, due to heresy, such as the Kharijites, or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.

Evaluating the narrators of hadith began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad Ibn Sirin, &quot;They did not previously inquire about the &quot;isnad&quot;. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, &#x27;Name for us your narrators.&#x27; So the people of the Sunnah would have their hadith accepted and the people of innovation would not.&quot; The &quot;turmoil&quot; referred to is the conflicting ideology of the Shias after the passing of the Prophet, and later the Kharijites that had emerged at the time of the third Sunni Caliph Uthman ibn Affan&#x27;s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, Ali and Muawiyah. The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.

In the following generation, Tabi&#x27; al-Tabi&#x27;in, and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not authentic.

====Early specialists====
According to Ibn al-Salah, quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of hadith narrators was Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj, followed by Yahya ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Qattan and then Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in. Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: Ali ibn al-Madini and &#x27;Amr ibn &#x27;Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned Malik ibn Anas and Hisham ibn Urwah as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.

== Overview ==
===Narrator criteria===
A hadith is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith&#x27;s chain of narration; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the chain of narration of a particular hadith.

Hadith narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is &quot;sahih&quot; constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (&quot;al-ʻadālah&quot;), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (&quot;al-taqwā&quot;) and maintaining proper social graces (&quot;al-murūʼah&quot;). The second, precision (&quot;al-ḍabṭ&quot;), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (&quot;ḍabṭ al-ṣadr&quot;) refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (&quot;ḍabṭ al-kitāb&quot;) is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. Ibn Ḥajr identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic hadith when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith fabricated (&quot;Mawḍūʻ&quot;).
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith&#x27;s chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator&#x27;s hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator&#x27;s hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator&#x27;s standing in their narrating capabilities.
# Heresy, being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.

===Methods of evaluation===
Hadith scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator&#x27;s religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrate from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.

== Evaluation terminology ==
As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (&quot;taʻdīl&quot;) and those that constitute criticism (&quot;jarḥ&quot;). al-Suyūṭī gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that al-Dhahabi and Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-&#x27;Iraqi added an additional level and Ibn Ḥajr one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadrib 1/573-80&quot;&gt;&quot;Tadrib al-Rawi&quot;, by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, &quot;Dar al-&#x27;Asimah&quot;, Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#Ibn Ḥajr held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, &quot;the most established of the people&quot; (), or &quot;the most reliable of the people&quot; ().
#Al-&#x27;Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, &quot;reliably reliable&quot; (), or &quot;reliable, firm&quot; ().
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: &quot;reliable&quot; (), &quot;precise&quot; () or &quot;firm&quot; ().
#&quot;Trustworthy&quot; (&quot;ṣadūq&quot;) and &quot;worthy of trust&quot; () are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-&#x27;Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is &quot;respectable&quot; (&quot;shaykh&quot;) along with &quot;worthy of trust&quot; () according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, &quot;satisfactory in hadith&quot; (), meaning according to Ibn Ḥajr, this includes &quot;acceptable&quot; () meaning, when supported by other narrators.

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is &quot;soft in hadith&quot; (&quot;layyin al-ḥadīth&quot;) and, according to al-&#x27;Iraqi, &quot;they have spoken about him&quot; (&quot;takallamū fīhi&quot;). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is &quot;he is not strong&quot; (&quot;laysa bi l-qawī&quot;). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than &quot;he is not strong&quot; is &quot;weak in hadith&quot; (&quot;ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth&quot;), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: &quot;his hadith is rejected&quot; (&quot;rudd al-ḥadīth&quot;) and &quot;very weak&quot; (&quot;ḍaʻīf jiddan&quot;).
#The fifth includes terms such as: &quot;his hadith is abandoned&quot; (&quot;matrūk al-ḥadīth&quot;) and &quot;destroyed&quot; (&quot;hālik&quot;).
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: &quot;compulsive liar&quot; (&quot;kadhdhāb&quot;), &quot;he lies&quot; (&quot;yakdhib&quot;) and &quot;fabricator&quot; (&quot;waḍḍāʻ&quot;) among other terms.

<doc id="174945" wikidata="Q2101" url="?curid=174945" title="Elementary charge">
<text>The elementary charge, usually denoted by , is a fundamental physical constant, defined as the electric charge carried by a single proton (+1 e) or, equivalently, the magnitude of the negative electric charge carried by a single electron, which has charge −1 .

In the SI system of units, the value of the elementary charge is exactly defined as or 160.2176634 zeptocoulombs (zC). Since the 2019 revision of the SI, the seven SI base units are defined in terms of seven fundamental physical constants, of which the elementary charge is one.

In the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), the corresponding quantity is .

Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher&#x27;s oil drop experiment first directly measured the magnitude of the elementary charge in 1909, differing from the modern accepted value by just 0.6%. Under assumptions of the then-disputed atomic theory, the elementary charge had also been indirectly inferred to ~3% accuracy from blackbody spectra by Max Planck in 1901 and (through the Faraday constant) at order-of-magnitude accuracy by Johann Loschmidt&#x27;s measurement of the Avogadro number in 1865.

== As a unit ==

In some natural unit systems, such as the system of atomic units, &quot;e&quot; functions as the unit of electric charge. The use of elementary charge as a unit was promoted by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874 for the first system of natural units, called Stoney units. Later, he proposed the name &quot;electron&quot; for this unit. At the time, the particle we now call the electron was not yet discovered and the difference between the particle &quot;electron&quot; and the unit of charge &quot;electron&quot; was still blurred. Later, the name &quot;electron&quot; was assigned to the particle and the unit of charge &quot;e&quot; lost its name. However, the unit of energy electronvolt (eV) is a remnant of the fact that the elementary charge was once called &quot;electron&quot;.

In other natural unit systems, the unit of charge is defined as formula_1 with the result that 
formula_2
where is the fine-structure constant, is the speed of light, is the electric constant, and is the reduced Planck constant.

== Quantization ==

&quot;Charge quantization&quot; is the principle that the charge of any object is an integer multiple of the elementary charge. Thus, an object&#x27;s charge can be exactly 0 &quot;e&quot;, or exactly 1 &quot;e&quot;, −1 &quot;e&quot;, 2 &quot;e&quot;, etc., but not  &quot;e&quot;, or −3.8 &quot;e&quot;, etc. (There may be exceptions to this statement, depending on how &quot;object&quot; is defined; see below.)

This is the reason for the terminology &quot;elementary charge&quot;: it is meant to imply that it is an indivisible unit of charge.

=== Fractional elementary charge ===
There are two known sorts of exceptions to the indivisibility of the elementary charge: quarks and quasiparticles.
* Quarks, first posited in the 1960s, have quantized charge, but the charge is quantized into multiples of . However, quarks cannot be isolated; they exist only in groupings, and stable groupings of quarks (such as a proton, which consists of three quarks) all have charges that are integer multiples of &quot;e&quot;. For this reason, either 1 &quot;e&quot; or can be justifiably considered to be &quot;the quantum of charge&quot;, depending on the context. This charge commensurability, &quot;charge quantization&quot;, has partially motivated grand unified theories.
* Quasiparticles are not particles as such, but rather an emergent entity in a complex material system that behaves like a particle. In 1982 Robert Laughlin explained the fractional quantum Hall effect by postulating the existence of fractionally charged quasiparticles. This theory is now widely accepted, but this is not considered to be a violation of the principle of charge quantization, since quasiparticles are not elementary particles.

=== Quantum of charge ===
All known elementary particles, including quarks, have charges that are integer multiples of  &quot;e&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;quantum of charge&quot; is  &quot;e&quot;. In this case, one says that the &quot;elementary charge&quot; is three times as large as the &quot;quantum of charge&quot;.

On the other hand, all &quot;isolatable&quot; particles have charges that are integer multiples of &quot;e&quot;. (Quarks cannot be isolated: they exist only in collective states like protons that have total charges that are integer multiples of &quot;e&quot;.) Therefore, the &quot;quantum of charge&quot; is &quot;e&quot;, with the proviso that quarks are not to be included. In this case, &quot;elementary charge&quot; would be synonymous with the &quot;quantum of charge&quot;.

In fact, both terminologies are used. For this reason, phrases like &quot;the quantum of charge&quot; or &quot;the indivisible unit of charge&quot; can be ambiguous unless further specification is given. On the other hand, the term &quot;elementary charge&quot; is unambiguous: it refers to a quantity of charge equal to that of a proton.

=== Lack of fractional charges ===
Paul Dirac argued in 1931 that if magnetic monopoles exist, then electric charge must be quantized; however, it is unknown whether magnetic monopoles actually exist. It is currently unknown why isolatable particles are restricted to integer charges; much of the string theory landscape appears to admit fractional charges.

== Experimental measurements of the elementary charge ==
The elementary charge is exactly defined since 20 May 2019 by the International System of Units. Prior to this change, the elementary charge was a measured quantity whose magnitude was determined experimentally. This section summarizes these historical experimental measurements.

=== In terms of the Avogadro constant and Faraday constant ===
If the Avogadro constant &quot;N&quot;A and the Faraday constant &quot;F&quot; are independently known, the value of the elementary charge can be deduced using the formula
formula_3
(In other words, the charge of one mole of electrons, divided by the number of electrons in a mole, equals the charge of a single electron.)

This method is &quot;not&quot; how the &quot;most accurate&quot; values are measured today. Nevertheless, it is a legitimate and still quite accurate method, and experimental methodologies are described below.

The value of the Avogadro constant &quot;N&quot;A was first approximated by Johann Josef Loschmidt who, in 1865, estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas. Today the value of &quot;N&quot;A can be measured at very high accuracy by taking an extremely pure crystal (often silicon), measuring how far apart the atoms are spaced using X-ray diffraction or another method, and accurately measuring the density of the crystal. From this information, one can deduce the mass (&quot;m&quot;) of a single atom; and since the molar mass (&quot;M&quot;) is known, the number of atoms in a mole can be calculated: .

The value of &quot;F&quot; can be measured directly using Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis. Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis are quantitative relationships based on the electrochemical researches published by Michael Faraday in 1834. In an electrolysis experiment, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the electrons passing through the anode-to-cathode wire and the ions that plate onto or off of the anode or cathode. Measuring the mass change of the anode or cathode, and the total charge passing through the wire (which can be measured as the time-integral of electric current), and also taking into account the molar mass of the ions, one can deduce &quot;F&quot;.

The limit to the precision of the method is the measurement of &quot;F&quot;: the best experimental value has a relative uncertainty of 1.6 ppm, about thirty times higher than other modern methods of measuring or calculating the elementary charge.

=== Oil-drop experiment ===

A famous method for measuring &quot;e&quot; is Millikan&#x27;s oil-drop experiment. A small drop of oil in an electric field would move at a rate that balanced the forces of gravity, viscosity (of traveling through the air), and electric force. The forces due to gravity and viscosity could be calculated based on the size and velocity of the oil drop, so electric force could be deduced. Since electric force, in turn, is the product of the electric charge and the known electric field, the electric charge of the oil drop could be accurately computed. By measuring the charges of many different oil drops, it can be seen that the charges are all integer multiples of a single small charge, namely &quot;e&quot;.

The necessity of measuring the size of the oil droplets can be eliminated by using tiny plastic spheres of a uniform size. The force due to viscosity can be eliminated by adjusting the strength of the electric field so that the sphere hovers motionless.

=== Shot noise ===
Any electric current will be associated with noise from a variety of sources, one of which is shot noise. Shot noise exists because a current is not a smooth continual flow; instead, a current is made up of discrete electrons that pass by one at a time. By carefully analyzing the noise of a current, the charge of an electron can be calculated. This method, first proposed by Walter H. Schottky, can determine a value of &quot;e&quot; of which the accuracy is limited to a few percent. However, it was used in the first direct observation of Laughlin quasiparticles, implicated in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

=== From the Josephson and von Klitzing constants ===
Another accurate method for measuring the elementary charge is by inferring it from measurements of two effects in quantum mechanics: The Josephson effect, voltage oscillations that arise in certain superconducting structures; and the quantum Hall effect, a quantum effect of electrons at low temperatures, strong magnetic fields, and confinement into two dimensions. The Josephson constant is
formula_4
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. It can be measured directly using the Josephson effect.

The von Klitzing constant is
formula_5
It can be measured directly using the quantum Hall effect.

From these two constants, the elementary charge can be deduced:
formula_6

=== CODATA method ===
The relation used by CODATA to determine elementary charge was:
formula_7
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;α&quot; is the fine-structure constant, &quot;μ&quot;0 is the magnetic constant, &quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. Presently this equation reflects a relation between &quot;ε&quot;0 and &quot;α&quot;, while all others are fixed values. Thus the relative standard uncertainties of both will be same.

<doc id="174949" wikidata="Q939802" url="?curid=174949" title="Super Bowl XXXVII">
<text>Super Bowl XXXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2002 season. The Buccaneers defeated the Raiders by the score of 48–21, tied with Super Bowl XXXV for the seventh-largest Super Bowl margin of victory, winning their first-ever Super Bowl. The game was played on January 26, 2003, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California.

To date, this is the last Super Bowl to be played in the month of January, as all subsequent games have been played in February. It is also the last to have been played in the week following the conference championship games (the others being Super Bowls XVII, XXV, XXVIII, XXXIV, and XXXVI) and the last to be played at Qualcomm Stadium, which previously hosted Super Bowl XXII (then called Jack Murphy Stadium) and Super Bowl XXXII and was demolished in 2021. Since the NFL no longer has a team in San Diego after the Chargers relocated to Los Angeles in 2017, and the league has a policy not to award Super Bowls to metropolitan areas that do not have a team within them, Super Bowl XXXVII will be the last to be played in San Diego for the foreseeable future unless an NFL team returns to the area.

This was the first Super Bowl in which the league&#x27;s number one-ranked offense (Raiders) faced the league&#x27;s number one-ranked defense (Buccaneers). The game sometimes is referred to as the &quot;Gruden Bowl&quot;, because the primary storyline surrounding the game revolved around Jon Gruden. Gruden was the Raiders&#x27; head coach from 1998 to 2001, and as a result of a trade then became the Buccaneers head coach in 2002. Tampa Bay, &quot;Gruden&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; team&quot;, made their first Super Bowl appearance in team history after posting a regular season record. Oakland, &quot;Gruden&#x27;s &quot;old&quot; team&quot;, advanced to their fifth Super Bowl after an regular season. Super Bowl XXXVII is also referred to as the &quot;Pirate Bowl&quot; or &quot;Battle of the Pirates&quot;, due to both teams&#x27; pirate-themed mascots and logos.

The Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, offensive struggles from the Raiders, and a dominant defensive performance from Tampa throughout much of the game would unravel the juggernaut Raider offense. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 consecutive points to build a 34–3 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back named Super Bowl MVP.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
NFL owners originally voted to award Super Bowl XXXVII to San Francisco during their October 15, 1997 meeting in Washington, D.C. The 49ers had recently announced plans for a new stadium, and were awarded the Super Bowl contingent upon its completion. This was the second time the city had been awarded the Super Bowl on a conditional basis. In 1994, Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded to Candlestick Park, based on a comprehensive stadium renovation plan. However, when funding for those renovation plans fell through, the hosting duties were withdrawn. This time around, the San Francisco hosting committee had planned to pursue XXXVI, but due to logistical complications, switched their proposal to XXXVII. The owners awarded the game to San Francisco, and no other cities were considered. They skipped the awarding of XXXVI, and scheduled the bidding for that game for the spring of 1998.

The plans for the new stadium and mall at Candlestick Point never materialized. Rumors quickly began to spread that the league would pull the game from San Francisco if no progress was made on stadium funding/construction. Like they attempted to do three years earlier for XXXIII, the Raiders once again stepped in, offering to move the game over to Oakland. Oakland mayor Jerry Brown put his support behind the effort, but it was rejected by league officials. On March 17, 1999, the league passed a resolution officially withdrawing the game from San Francisco.

The NFL immediately reopened the bidding for the game. San Diego (Qualcomm Stadium), which had lost out on XXXVI, announced its interest. Miami (Pro Player Stadium) was the only other city in consideration after Oakland dropped their plan once and for all. San Diego went in as an early favorite. They had just received &quot;rave reviews&quot; for XXXII, and there was a desire to keep the game on the west coast. San Diego was awarded the game during the May 26, 1999, owners meeting at Atlanta, needing only one round of balloting. It was the last Super Bowl played in California until Super Bowl 50 at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara. It was also the final Super Bowl at Qualcomm Stadium before the Chargers relocated to Los Angeles in 2017, and before the facility was demolished in 2020.

===Oakland Raiders===
Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and head coach Jon Gruden was no exception. Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden.

As a result of Gruden&#x27;s departure, Raiders offensive coordinator Bill Callahan was promoted to head coach. Despite the loss of Gruden in 2002, the Raiders still managed to earn a share of the AFC&#x27;s best record at 11–5. The offense led the league in total passing yards (4,689) and ranked second in total yards gained (6,451).

Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon had an MVP season, completing 418 out of 618 passes for 4,689 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions. His 418 completions and his 10 games with over 300 passing yards were both NFL records. He also ran 50 times for 156 yards and three touchdowns. Jerry Rice, who was already the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in nearly every receiving record after 17 seasons, had a Pro Bowl season for the 13th time in his career 1,211 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. Gannon&#x27;s other weapons in passing game were 15-year veteran receiver Tim Brown (930 yards and two touchdowns) and young receiver Jerry Porter (688 yards and nine touchdowns). Multi-talented running back Charlie Garner was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with 962 yards and seven touchdowns, while also leading all NFL running backs in receiving with 91 receptions for 941 yards and another four touchdowns. Running back Tyrone Wheatley was also a contributor with 419 rushing yards, while fullback Zack Crockett provided both of them with solid blocking and scored eight touchdowns. Up front, their offensive line was led by two Pro Bowlers, guard Lincoln Kennedy and center Barret Robbins.

The Raiders&#x27; weakness was primarily on their defense, which ranked 25th in the league in passing yards allowed (3,787) and 12th in total yards (5,240). Veteran Pro Bowl safety Rod Woodson recorded a league-leading eight interceptions including two touchdowns. Up front, their line was anchored by defensive tackle Rod Coleman, who led the team with 11 sacks. Behind him, the team had a solid veteran linebacker, Bill Romanowski, who was playing in his fifth Super Bowl. Defensive back Tory James was also a big contributor with four interceptions.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Gruden had trouble getting the offense in sync during his first year as Tampa Bay&#x27;s head coach. In 2002, the Buccaneers ranked 25th in the league in total yards gained (5,222). Quarterback Brad Johnson made the Pro Bowl, completing 281 out of 451 passes for 3,049 yards, 22 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Running back Michael Pittman led the team in rushing with 718 yards and one touchdown, and added 477 receiving yards. Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott had 548 rushing yards and five touchdowns, and also had 242 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson led the team with 1,088 receiving yards and five touchdowns, while wide receiver Keenan McCardell had 670 receiving yards and six touchdowns.

The Buccaneers&#x27; defense was still the strength of the team, leading the NFL in total defense (252.8 yards per game), pass defense (155.6 yards per game), points allowed (12.3 points per game), passing touchdowns allowed (10), interceptions (31), and opponent passer rating (48.4). Brooks, Lynch, Sapp, and defensive end Simeon Rice all had Pro Bowl years. Brooks led the team with 87 tackles and excelled at pass coverage, recording five interceptions and four total touchdowns (an NFL record for a linebacker). The defense as a whole had nine total touchdowns during the regular season and playoffs. Rice led the team with 15.5 sacks. Sapp recorded 7.5 sacks and two interceptions. Cornerback Brian Kelly was also a big asset, leading the team with eight interceptions.

===Playoffs===
The second-seeded Buccaneers defeated the fourth-seeded San Francisco 49ers, 31–6, and the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles, 27–10, to make the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. The Buccaneers defense was dominant in both games. Meanwhile, the top-seeded Raiders were victorious against the fourth-seeded New York Jets, 30–10, and the second-seeded Tennessee Titans, 41–24. The Raiders won against the Titans through Gannon&#x27;s pass-oriented offense.

===Super Bowl pregame news===
The Raiders entered the game favored to win in their first Super Bowl in 19 years. They were also the first franchise to appear in the Super Bowl in four decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 2000s). However, much of the media hype surrounded the Gruden trade prior to the season. This forced league commissioner Paul Tagliabue to issue a statement that he might ban all future trades for coaches involving draft choices because it might compromise the draft.

A distraction for the Raiders was that starting center Barret Robbins went missing for most of the day before the Super Bowl. Hours before the game, he was admitted to a San Diego hospital, then spent time in rehab at the Betty Ford Clinic. He was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar disorder; it turned out that his disappearance was due to a manic episode. Robbins later said he had gone across the border and spent his missing time partying in Tijuana, Mexico, so disoriented that he thought the Raiders had already won the game and he was celebrating the victory. Backup Adam Treu (a former Pro Bowl-er) replaced Robbins.

The Buccaneers, as the designated home team, wore red jerseys and pewter pants. The kit is normally used at home for the second half of the season; the Buccaneers wear white at home during the first half due to the late summer-early autumn heat. The Raiders donned white jerseys with silver pants, the same combination they wore in Super Bowls XI and XV (both victories).

== Broadcasting==

The game was broadcast in the United States by ABC, with Al Michaels handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator John Madden. Madden became the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years, having called Super Bowl XXXVI on Fox and then moving to ABC after Pat Summerall retired. Melissa Stark and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, Baltimore Ravens head coach Brian Billick, and New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan.

The Super Bowl was the first of three major professional sports championship series ABC broadcast in 2003, as they would also broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals and the NBA Finals. Both the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup Finals ended up being hosted by Berman (who co-hosted the Stanley Cup Finals with John Saunders). The state of California ended up having representation in both Super Bowl XXXVII and the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals after the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim advanced to the latter. ABC&#x27;s lead NHL broadcast team of Gary Thorne, Bill Clement, and John Davidson mentioned all of these when they called the Stanley Cup Finals.

For its Super Bowl lead-out program, ABC aired an episode of &quot;Alias&quot; titled &quot;Phase One&quot;. Then after the break for late local news, the network premiered its new late night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

NBC, which did not hold any NFL television rights during this time between the 1998 and 2005 seasons, provided counter-programming against the halftime show, airing a live segment of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; from the comedy–variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featuring Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey.

Memorable television commercials that aired during the game included the &quot;Terry Tate: Office Linebacker&quot; Reebok ad and the Budweiser Zebra Referee. Adbowl ranked FedEx&#x27;s &quot;Castaway&quot; as the best commercial of the year.

On the radio side, the game was carried nationally by Westwood One. Marv Albert, in his first season as the network&#x27;s lead NFL voice, called the game with Boomer Esiason as his analyst. John Dockery and Warren Moon reported from the field. Locally, the Raiders&#x27; broadcast was carried by their then-flagship KSFO with Greg Papa as lead announcer and Tom Flores as analyst. The Buccaneers&#x27; then-flagship WDAE carried their broadcast, with Gene Deckerhoff as lead announcer and Scot Brantley as analyst.

==Entertainment==
===Pre-game ceremonies===
A pre-game concert featured a performance by Carlos Santana with guests Beyoncé Knowles and Michelle Branch. During its pre-game show, ABC also aired a pre-game concert outside of the stadium, which featured Bonnie Raitt, Goo Goo Dolls and Michael Bublé. French-Canadian singer Celine Dion performed &quot;God Bless America&quot;, while country group The Dixie Chicks performed the national anthem.

As the New England Patriots&#x27; did the previous year, both teams were introduced and entered as a team rather than individually by offensive and defensive starters, establishing this as the new standard practice. To honor the 30th anniversary of the 17–0 undefeated, perfect season of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the following members of that team appeared during the coin toss ceremony: Don Shula, Bob Griese, Larry Csonka, Larry Little, Jim Langer, Nick Buoniconti, Paul Warfield.

===Halftime show===
The Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show was headlined by Shania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting.

===Post-game ceremonies===
Bon Jovi appeared as part of the post-game ceremonies, performing &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; prior to the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and &quot;Everyday&quot; afterwards (most of the latter performance was not shown on ABC because the network cut to commercials).

==Game summary==

===First quarter===
The Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson&#x27;s pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. However, six plays later, defensive end Simeon Rice sacked quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski&#x27;s 40-yard field goal to give them a 3–0 lead.

Buccaneers running back Aaron Stecker returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 29-yard line, then appeared to fumble the ball while being tackled. Although the officials initially ruled that the ball was recovered by Oakland defensive back Eric Johnson, Tampa Bay challenged the call, and instant replay determined that both of Stecker&#x27;s knees were down, and the ball did not come loose until he hit the ground. Gruden and Stecker appeared upset at having to use a challenge so early in the game, when they both believed Stecker was clearly down.

On the first play of the drive, Brad Johnson completed an 11-yard pass to wide receiver Joe Jurevicius. Johnson&#x27;s next two passes were incomplete, but he then completed a 23-yard pass to Jurevicius on 3rd-and-10 to advance the ball to the Oakland 37-yard line. Running back Michael Pittman then rushed for a 23-yard gain to the 13-yard line. However, on the next three plays, the Raiders&#x27; defense limited the Buccaneers to a pair of incompletions and a 1-yard run by Stecker. Kicker Martín Gramática then made a 31-yard field goal to tie the game, 3–3. After the teams exchanged punts twice, with less than two minutes left in the quarter, a 17-yard punt return by cornerback Darrien Gordon gave Oakland the ball at their own 49-yard line. Gannon then threw an 8-yard pass to running back Charlie Garner to reach the Tampa Bay 43-yard line. However, on third down, safety Dexter Jackson intercepted Gannon&#x27;s pass at the 40-yard line and returned it 9 yards to near midfield.

===Second quarter===
Nine plays after the turnover, Gramática kicked his second field goal from 43 yards to give Tampa Bay a 6–3 lead.

Jackson intercepted another pass on the Raiders&#x27; next drive and returned it 25 yards to the Oakland 45-yard line, making him the first player ever to record two interceptions in the first half of the Super Bowl. However, the Buccaneers were unable to take advantage of the turnover and were forced to punt. Tampa Bay got a big assist from their punter Tom Tupa, who managed to pin Oakland all the way back at their own 11-yard line. The Raiders could not move the ball either, losing a yard on three plays with their ensuing drive. Tampa Bay wide receiver Karl Williams then returned Shane Lechler&#x27;s punt 25 yards, giving the Buccaneers great field position at Oakland&#x27;s 27-yard line. Aided by Pittman&#x27;s gains of 6 and 19 yards, the Buccaneers scored the first touchdown of the game on a 2-yard run by fullback Mike Alstott, increasing their lead to 13–3. After forcing the Raiders to punt, with 3:45 left in the half, Tampa Bay drove 77 yards in nine plays, assisted by a pair of catches by Alstott for 28 yards and four runs by Pittman for 20 yards. Johnson finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell to give the Buccaneers a 20–3 halftime lead.

===Third quarter===
Tampa Bay continued to dominate the game for most of the third quarter. The Buccaneers forced the Raiders to punt on the opening drive of the second half. Next, Tampa Bay marched 89 yards on a 14-play drive, which was highlighted by Johnson&#x27;s two passes to Jurevicius for 44 yards and took 7:52 off the clock. The drive ended with Johnson&#x27;s 8-yard touchdown pass to McCardell to increase their lead to 27–3. Then on the second play of Oakland&#x27;s ensuing drive, Buccaneers safety Dwight Smith intercepted Gannon&#x27;s pass and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, making the score 34–3 in favor of Tampa Bay.

After giving up 34 consecutive points, Oakland finally managed to drive 82 yards down the field, aided by a 25-yard reception by tight end Doug Jolley. The drive ended with a 39-yard touchdown completion from Gannon to wide receiver Jerry Porter. Although he was initially ruled as being out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call, and it was determined that Porter had both feet in the end zone when he caught the ball. Gannon was sacked by Simeon Rice on the two-point conversion attempt, but the Raiders had cut their deficit to 34–9.

===Fourth quarter===
The Raiders&#x27; touchdown seemed to fire up their defense, who forced the Buccaneers to a fourth down on their ensuing possession. On the second play of the final quarter, Oakland linebacker Tim Johnson blocked Tupa&#x27;s punt, and the ball flew high into the air and into the arms of Eric Johnson, who returned it 13 yards for a touchdown. Another two-point conversion failed when Gannon threw the ball over wide receiver Tim Brown&#x27;s head, but Tampa Bay&#x27;s lead was cut to 34–15.

Tampa Bay responded by moving the ball to the Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, featuring a 16-yard pass interference penalty against Woodson and a 24-yard run by Pittman, but during a 27-yard field goal attempt by Gramática, Tupa fumbled the snap, and Gramática attempted to run the ball himself before getting tackled by cornerback Tory James, giving the ball to Oakland on their own 22-yard line. After completing two passes to Jolley for 23 yards, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders&#x27; deficit to 34–21 and were only two touchdowns away from taking the lead. Oakland&#x27;s two-point conversion failed for the third straight time when Porter caught the ball out of bounds after being forced out by linebacker Nate Webster, but the officials deemed no interference, and therefore that part of the play was non-reviewable. Nonetheless, Oakland challenged the call, but the ruling stood, and they were charged a timeout.

In an attempt to prevent a Raiders comeback, the Buccaneers managed to run the clock down to 2:44 on their ensuing drive before being forced to punt. Then on 3rd-and-18 from the Oakland 29-yard line, linebacker Derrick Brooks cemented the Buccaneers&#x27; first Super Bowl title by intercepting a Gannon pass intended for wide receiver Marcus Knight and returning it 44 yards for a touchdown, giving the Buccaneers a 41–21 lead with only 1:18 left, and leading Buccaneers radio announcer Gene Deckerhoff to make his famous call: &quot;The dagger&#x27;s in, we&#x27;re gonna win the Super Bowl!&quot;. Five plays later, Smith intercepted another pass, which was deflected by defensive end Greg Spires, and returned it 50 yards for his second touchdown of the game with only two seconds remaining, capping off the scoring at 48–21. Smith&#x27;s two pick sixes made him the first player in Super Bowl history to score two defensive touchdowns. Raiders defensive lineman Chris Cooper returned Gramática&#x27;s kickoff 6 yards before being tackled by linebacker Jack Golden, ending the game. Gannon said after the game that his performance was &quot;nightmarish&quot;. With the win, Jon Gruden became, at 39, the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl, surpassing John Madden who won Super Bowl XI at the age of 40.

===Box score===






===Statistical overview===
Tampa Bay dominated Oakland, out-gaining them in total yards (365–269), rushing yards (150–19), first downs (24–11), offensive plays (76–60), and forced turnovers (5–1). As many sports fans and writers predicted, Gruden&#x27;s prior knowledge of the Raiders was a major factor. The most damaging piece of evidence is NFL Films footage of Tampa Bay defensive back John Lynch telling his teammates during the game that almost all of the plays ran by Oakland&#x27;s offense were plays that Gruden (who that week even played the part of &quot;Rich Gannon&quot; by playing quarterback with the scout-team offense) specifically told them to look out for. Better still for the Buccaneers was that Oakland hadn&#x27;t changed their audible-calling signals that Gruden himself had installed, thus tipping off plays repeatedly.

Johnson finished the game with 18 out of 34 completions for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 1 interception, along with 10 rushing yards. Pittman was the top rusher of the game with 129 yards. Alstott was the game&#x27;s second leading rusher with 15 yards and a touchdown, and had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Joe Jurevicius was the game&#x27;s leading receiver with 4 receptions for 78 yards. Keyshawn Johnson recorded 6 catches for 69 yards. Smith recorded 2 interceptions, 94 return yards, and 2 touchdowns. He also added another 23 yards on a kickoff return.

Gannon finished the game 24 out of 44 for 272 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was intercepted a Super Bowl record 5 times for a 48.9 passer rating. Garner was their leading rusher, but with only 10 yards, and caught 7 passes for 51 yards. Rice was the Raiders&#x27; leading receiver of the game with 5 catches for 77 yards and a touchdown. He became the first player to score touchdowns with two teams in Super Bowls (Ricky Proehl, Rob Gronkowski, and Muhsin Muhammad have since joined him). Wide receiver Marcus Knight returned 8 kickoffs for 143 yards.

Jerry Rice and Bill Romanowski joined Gene Upshaw as the only players to appear in Super Bowls in three decades. Rice played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX. Romanowski played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, XXXII, and XXXIII; the Raiders&#x27; loss prevented Romanowski from joining Charles Haley as the only NFL players at that time to earn 5 Super Bowl rings (Haley was also with the 49ers for Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV, and later earned rings when the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX). The Raiders became the first team to appear in Super Bowls under four head coaches. John Rauch coached them in Super Bowl II, John Madden (who himself called Super Bowl XXXVII on ABC), coached them in Super Bowl XI and Tom Flores coached them in Super Bowl XV and XVIII.

The teams combined for the most second half points in a Super Bowl with 46 (28 for Tampa Bay and 18 for Oakland) and the third most total points in a game with 69, tying Dallas and Buffalo who combined for 69 points in Super Bowl XXVII.

==Post-game riots==
In Oakland, after the Raiders&#x27; loss, riots broke out on the streets of East Oakland. Twelve cars were set on fire and 400 police officers were sent to the streets.

==Aftermath==
&quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; published a book by several staff writers called &quot;Pewter Power&quot; about the Buccaneers&#x27; winning season.

Both teams entered a period of decline after the Super Bowl that saw them enter lengthy playoff droughts. Neither made the playoffs in , as Tampa Bay finished 7–9 and Oakland finished 4–12. Furthermore, Tampa Bay finished 5–11 in 2004, becoming the first Super Bowl winning team to follow up with consecutive losing seasons. The Buccaneers had only two subsequent postseason appearances in 2005 and 2007 and did not win another playoff game until their Super Bowl-winning season in 2020. The Raiders went 14 seasons without a winning record or playoff appearance, not obtaining either again until 2016, and have not won a playoff game since this season. The 2002 season also marked the Raiders&#x27; final postseason victory in Oakland following their relocation to Las Vegas in 2020.

In January 2013, retired Raiders receiver Tim Brown accused coach Bill Callahan of deliberately throwing the game, stating that Callahan originally planned the Raiders&#x27; strategy around running the ball, since Oakland&#x27;s offensive line outweighed Tampa Bay&#x27;s defensive line by a significant amount. However, Brown claimed Callahan changed the game plan to a more pass-heavy strategy two days before the game. While Brown stopped short of saying he was sure Callahan ruined their game plan on purpose, he said, &quot;But the facts are what they are, that less than 36 hours before the game we changed our game plan. And we go into that game absolutely knowing that we have no shot. That the only shot we had if Tampa Bay didn&#x27;t show up.&quot; Brown also suggested the change contributed to Barret Robbins&#x27; mental breakdown, saying &quot;Barret Robbins begged Coach Callahan, &#x27;Do not do this to me. I don&#x27;t have time to make my calls, to get my calls ready. You can&#x27;t do this to me on Friday. We haven&#x27;t practiced full speed, we can&#x27;t get this done. I&#x27;m not saying one had anything to do with the other. All I&#x27;m saying is those are the facts of what happened Super Bowl week. So our ire wasn&#x27;t towards Barret Robbins, it was towards Bill Callahan. Because we feel as if he wouldn&#x27;t have did what he did, then Barret wouldn&#x27;t have done what he did.&quot;

Jerry Rice echoed Brown&#x27;s concerns, saying &quot;For some reason - and I don&#x27;t know why - Bill Callahan did not like me.&quot; &quot;In a way, maybe because he didn&#x27;t like the Raiders, he decided, &#x27;Maybe we should sabotage this a little bit and let Jon Gruden go out and win this one.&quot; Raiders linebacker Bill Romanowski disagreed, calling Brown&#x27;s accusations &quot;delusional&quot;.

&quot;I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown&#x27;s allegations and Jerry Rice&#x27;s support of those allegations,&quot; Callahan replied. &quot;To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegation. To suggest otherwise, especially at this time when it involves the Super Bowl, is ludicrous and defamatory. Any suggestion that I would undermine the integrity of the sport that I love and dedicated my life to, or dishonor the commitment I made to our players, coaches and fans, is flat out wrong. I think it would be in the best interests of all including the game America loves that these allegations be retracted immediately.&quot;

<doc id="174952" wikidata="Q700722" url="?curid=174952" title="The Bachelor (American TV series)">
<text>The Bachelor is an American dating and relationship reality television series that debuted on March 25, 2002, on ABC. For its first 25 seasons, the show was hosted by Chris Harrison. As the essence of the original &quot; The Bachelor&quot; franchise, its success resulted in several spin-offs including &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Pad&quot;, &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor Winter Games&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons – Ever!&quot;, &quot;The Golden Bachelor&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Bachelorette&quot;, as well as spawning many international editions of the shows.

On May 10, 2024, ABC renewed the series for a twenty-ninth season, which premiered on January 27, 2025.

==Production==
The series was created by Mike Fleiss. The &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; and other reunion specials were originally produced at Victory Studios in Los Angeles, California, and CBS Studio Center in Studio City, but are now taped at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. In the most recent run of The Bachelor, it brought in almost $86 million in advertising revenue.

==Plot==
The series follows a single bachelor who is given a list of romantic interests from which he must choose a fiancée. During the season, the bachelor eliminates candidates (see The elimination process) each week which finally results in his last choice receiving a marriage proposal. The participants travel to romantic and exotic locations for their dates, and the conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show.

The description above is simply a general guideline. In truth, the series occasionally deviates from its intended format, which can lead to drama and conflict among people involved in the show. They may include, among other events:
*An eliminated candidate returning to the show to plead her case to the bachelor.
*A non-contestant, usually with a history in the franchise, pleads to be considered as a candidate for the bachelor.
*A bachelor distributing more or fewer roses than planned.
*A bachelor eliminating a woman outside of the normal elimination process. For example, the bachelor may eliminate both women on a two-on-one date.
*The bachelor chooses to pursue a relationship with his final selection rather than propose marriage.

The sixth season was the only season to feature a twist in casting. Since producers could not unanimously decide between Byron Velvick and Jay Overbye for the next Bachelor, the 25 women at the time participating had to decide which bachelor would make the best husband. At the end of the first episode, Velvick was chosen.

Notable cases where the bachelor violated the premise of the show are Brad Womack, who selected neither of his final two women on his first season, and Jason Mesnick, who broke off his engagement in the &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; episode and several months later proposed (offscreen) to the first runner-up (Molly Malaney)—who he later married. Like Mesnick, Arie Luyendyk Jr. also broke off his engagement and during the &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; episode, he proposed to the first runner-up (Lauren Burnham)—to whom he is now married.

==The elimination process==

*In a &quot;The Women Tell All&quot; episode, the women who had been eliminated from the show participate in a talk show where they discuss their thoughts and experiences, and even juicy secrets not previously mentioned before now.
*The two remaining women separately meet with the bachelor&#x27;s family. At the end of the episode, one woman eventually exits the limo and is sent home, followed by the second woman who the bachelor proposes to by presenting the &quot;final rose&quot;.
*In an &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; episode that immediately follows, the bachelor, the finalist, and the runner-up participate in a talk show. The identity of the next season&#x27;s bachelor or bachelorette is often announced at the end of the episode.

If a woman decides she no longer wants to compete in the Bachelor, she can leave the competition at any moment. Occasionally, a woman gets taken off the show for violating a rule.

The bachelor has wide discretion in choosing how many and when to present the roses. For example, Sean Lowe presented several roses at his initial cocktail party.

It is common for contestants to be accused of not being on the show for the &quot;right reasons,&quot; with their aim not to establish a genuine relationship with the Bachelor but rather to garner fame or attention of some kind. These reasons include: become an influencer, become a cast member on Bachelor in Paradise, Dancing with the Stars, or the new Bachelorette, induce jealousy from an ex-boyfriend or other people in their personal life, or just to simply get free trips to exotic locations.

;Notes
==Questions of authenticity==
On February 26, 2009, in an exclusive interview between &quot;The Bachelor&quot; season 13 contestant Megan Parris and Steve Carbone, Megan commented that the producers edit the footage to create a fictional storyline:
On March 26, 2009, Megan Parris argued that not only was the show scripted, but that producers bullied contestants into saying things to the camera that contestants did not want to say. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing real about it,&quot; she said of the show&#x27;s trademark &quot;confessionals,&quot; in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. &quot;It is scripted,&quot; she said. &quot;They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you to say what they want you to say.&quot; Both ABC and Warner Bros., the studio that produces &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; had no comment.

On March 15, 2010, Mike Fleiss appeared on &quot;20/20&quot; and said that he develops contestants into characters who will cater to his audience&#x27;s tastes and that they &quot;need [their] fair share of villains every season.&quot; Fleiss has come under fire for admitting that &quot;The Bachelor&quot; has less to do with reality than it does making good television.

On February 24, 2012, during the taping of the &quot;Women Tell All&quot; episode of &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; a private conversation between contestant Courtney Robertson and a show producer went public when microphones were accidentally left on in between camera takes. The conversation revealed the producer had a role as a coach, encouraging Robertson to fake certain emotions for the camera.

The audience reactions for &quot;The Women Tell All&quot; episode are pre-recorded and inserted into the show later.

In December 2011, a producer of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; sued Steve Carbone, the proprietor of the website RealitySteve.com, for leaking unreleased information about the show, claiming Carbone encouraged contestants of both &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; to break their confidentiality agreements. Carbone has denied that the source of the leaks are current contestants. Despite the first two lawsuits in 2012 being settled out of court, a further lawsuit was presented against Carbone in 2017.

==Criticism==

The franchise has long been criticized for its lack of ethnic and cultural diversity, eventually prompting petitions and threats of boycott from the franchise&#x27;s only black lead at the time, Rachel Lindsay.
In June 2020, the show cast Matt James as its first black male lead for season 25. James was initially cast for Clare Crawley&#x27;s season of Bachelorette, which was delayed due to COVID-19. In June 2021, it was announced that long-time host Chris Harrison was stepping down permanently after widespread criticism of comments he had made which excused the past behavior of a cast member who had been accused of racism, saying he was not the &quot;&quot;woke&quot; police&quot;. Harrison acknowledged, &quot;By excusing historical racism, I defended it.&quot;

The show has been criticized for stigmatizing virginity, thus reflecting the patriarchal masculinity stereotypes.

==Spin-offs==
The program&#x27;s success has led to the creation of various spin-off series;
*The Bachelorette premiered in 2003 as a female counterpart of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, featuring a pool of men competing for a single bachelorette (who is usually a former contestant of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;). The series first ran from 2003 to 2005, before returning in 2008 after a hiatus.
*Bachelor Pad ran from 2010 to 2012, featuring previous contestants of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; competing in challenges and eliminations to for a chance to win a $250,000 grand prize. In 2013, it was replaced by a similar series, Bachelor in Paradise. 
** The fourth season of &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; called into question about the future of its production following an issue of possible misconduct on the set. The fourth season premiered on August 8, 2017. Two contestants, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson were involved in an explicit sexual encounter in the pool during the filming of the show and were caught on tape. A producer onset administered a complaint which stated either one or both contestants may have been too drunk to give proper consent for the sexual encounter. This prompted Warner Bros. to start an internal investigation and both contestants to seek legal counsel. Production of the show was halted on June 11, 2017, and all contestants were asked to go home until further notice. Allegations were made against both contestants about their intoxication and actions thereafter but ended with broadcast statements from both contestants during a talk show that it was all a misunderstanding and the two have remained friends since the incident. The show was given the green light to resume filming on June 21, 2017; neither Olympios nor Jackson returned to production.
* The weddings of Trista Rehn (the 1st Bachelorette), Jason Mesnick (13th Bachelor), Ashley Hebert (the 7th Bachelorette), and Sean Lowe (the 17th Bachelor) were broadcast as television specials. Rehn&#x27;s vow-renewal ceremony upon her 10-year anniversary was also broadcast. &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; season 2 couple Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert&#x27;s wedding was also broadcast as a television special in February 2016. The wedding of Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist (&quot;The Golden Bachelor&quot;) was televised as a live special on January 4, 2024. 
* Sister network Freeform premiered two docusoaps focusing on alumni from the series, Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After? premiered in October 2016, which showcased the relationship of Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell following season 20 of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; on their plans for marriage and Bushnell&#x27;s new life in Denver. But then, the couple eventually parted ways on May 15, 2017. In March 2017, Freeform premiered &quot;The Twins: Happily Ever After&quot;, which featured Haley and Emily Ferguson from season 20 of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;.
*The Bachelor Winter Games premiered on February 13, 2018, as a winter sports-themed spin-off (airing against the 2018 Winter Olympics), with a similar format to &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; featuring contestants from domestic and international alumni of the franchise, and winter sports challenges. The series was won by Ashley Iaconetti (United States) and Kevin Wendt (Canada), after finishing first in a figure skating competition among the final four couples. In 2020, ABC announced plans to produce a summer counterpart—The Bachelor Summer Games—which would have presumably aired against the 2020 Summer Olympics. On March 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which itself caused the 2020 Olympics to be postponed to 2021), it was reported that the series had been cancelled and would not be part of the 2020–21 TV season.
*Bachelor Live was a short-lived season 20 after-show hosted by Chris Harrison, discussing events in episodes with cast members and celebrity fans.
*Bachelor Live on Stage was announced on January 23, 2019, during the Men Tell All episode. A local Bachelor would go through group date challenges and coveted one-on-ones with local ladies in the audience. Audience members and hosts would assist the Bachelor. Ben Higgins and Becca Kufrin are slated to host the planned 63 stop tour starting in Mesa, Arizona on February 13, 2020, with the tour interrupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota on March 11, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused subsequent shows have been postponed including the scheduled final stop in Austin, Texas on May 17, 2020, the dates were initially rescheduled to January 24, 2021, in Cleveland, Ohio before postponed for the second time in 2022 due to the temporary closure of entertainment venues and the second wave of the virus in late 2020. It was announced on October 27, 2021, that it would resume on March 16, 2022, in Peoria, Illinois after more than two years of entertainment closures in related to the pandemic. Kufrin returned as host and now be the sole host of the show. In February 2022, it was announced that former &quot;Bachelorette&quot; contestants James Bonsall (season 17), Rick Leach (season 18), Connor Brennan (season 17), Ivan Hall (season 16), Justin Glaze (season 17), Andrew Spencer (season 17), and Rodney Matthews (season 18) would all be joining the tour as special guests for different tour stops.
*The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart premiered on April 13, 2020, which featured a cast of musicians and related figures, participating in music-related challenges and dates.
* The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons – Ever!, aired in 2020 as a replacement for &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, featuring recaps of previous seasons.

==Parodies==

The show was parodied in S1E5 of the Comedy Central TV show &quot;Nathan for You&quot;. 
Ben Stiller produced a web spoof of the series titled &quot;Burning Love&quot;.

In 2013, ABC&#x27;s late-night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; has parodied the series as &quot;The Baby Bachelor&quot;, a sketch where the titular role is given to host Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s three-year-old nephew Wesley. Later episodes featured follow-up sketches with similar parodies of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; and &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot;.

The Fox network produced a show, &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, based on the premise that the bachelor was a millionaire heir, when in reality, he was not.

On June 1, 2015, Lifetime began airing &quot;Unreal&quot;, a scripted drama about a producer who works on &quot;Everlasting&quot;, a fictional reality series similar to &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. It is based on Sarah Gertrude Shapiro&#x27;s short film &quot;Sequin Raze&quot; and her experience as a field producer on &quot;The Bachelor&quot;.

The series was parodied in the third season of the reality series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; as &quot;The Bitchelor&quot;, where a titular challenge featured the drag performers portraying contestants on a &quot;Bachelor&quot;-like show with Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman playing the bachelor.

<doc id="174953" wikidata="Q3278334" url="?curid=174953" title="The Bachelorette (American TV series)">
<text>The Bachelorette is an American reality television dating game show that debuted on ABC on January 8, 2003. The show is a spin-off of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and the staple part of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; franchise. The first season featured Trista Rehn, the runner-up from the first season of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a husband among 25 bachelors. The 2004 season of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; again took a runner-up from the previous season of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. After last airing on February 28, 2005, the series returned to ABC during the spring of 2008, following an absence of three years, and has since become an annual staple of the network&#x27;s summer programming.

For its first 16 seasons the show was hosted by Chris Harrison. JoJo Fletcher took on temporary hosting duties during season 16 when Harrison was isolating having taken his son to college.

In March 2021, the show announced it would air two seasons for the first time ever. The seventeenth season debuted on June 7, 2021, with former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe as hosts. The eighteenth season premiered on October 19, 2021, with Adams and Bristowe returning as co-hosts.

In March 2022, it was announced that there would be two Bachelorettes in one season. The 19th season premiered on July 11, 2022, with Jesse Palmer as host. Although season 11 featured two Bachelorettes in the first episode, and season 16 featured two consecutive Bachelorettes within a season, this marked the first time that two women led concurrently for the entire season.

On February 10, 2024, ABC renewed the series for a twenty-first season, which premiered on July 8, 2024. On February 7, 2025, it was announced that the show will be on hiatus for the summer 2025 television season.

==Plot==
All of the rules are adapted from the rules of its parent show, &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. As the name implies, it is essentially a gender-swapped version of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;: the series revolves around a single bachelorette, usually a former contestant from a recent &quot;Bachelor&quot; season, and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25, though sometimes more) which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette. The show starts with the bachelorette standing in front of the mansion and greeting each male contestant individually, as they make an entrance to the bachelorette. After each rose ceremony, at least one contestant does not receive a rose and goes home; therefore, the pool of contenders gets smaller, and eventually leaves the bachelorette to decide between two contestants in the final rose ceremony.

For the final selection, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette. Unlike its parent show, the first sixteen seasons of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; have ended with a proposal which the bachelorette either accepted or declined. The series has resulted in five marriages to date: Trista Rehn&#x27;s to Ryan Sutter, Ashley Hebert&#x27;s to JP Rosenbaum, Desiree Hartsock&#x27;s to Chris Siegfried, Rachel Lindsay&#x27;s to Bryan Abasolo, and JoJo Fletcher&#x27;s to Jordan Rodgers. The first two weddings were broadcast on ABC. Season 16 was the only season that did not hold an &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; special due to circumstances over the COVID-19 pandemic and Christmas holiday.

=== Casting ===
Season 11 was the first season to feature a twist in casting. Since producers could not unanimously decide between &quot;The Bachelor&quot; Season 19 contenders Kaitlyn Bristowe and Britt Nilsson, the 25 men participating had to decide which bachelorette would make the best wife. In the end, more men voted for Kaitlyn, and Britt was sent home on the first night.

Season 13 was the first season to have an African-American contestant, Rachel Lindsay, as the lead in the entire &quot;Bachelor&quot; franchise. Season 16 was the first season to feature two bachelorettes. Clare Crawley was initially cast, but left the show after becoming engaged to contestant Dale Moss. Tayshia Adams was then brought in to complete the season.

In March 2021, after host Chris Harrison announced he was &quot;stepping away&quot; from the franchise, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe were announced as co-hosts for season 17. In June 2021, a day after the season 17 premiere, Harrison announced he was leaving the franchise altogether.

Season 19 was the third season to feature two Bachelorettes, Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia; however, it was the first season to feature both leads for the entire season. 

Season 21 will be the first season to have an Asian-American contestant, Jenn Tran, as the lead in the entire &quot;Bachelor&quot; franchise history.

==Questions of authenticity==
&quot;Family Guy&quot; parodied the show&#x27;s authenticity in the episode &quot;Brian the Bachelor&quot; on June 26, 2005.

&quot;The Bachelorette&quot; season 4 winner, Jesse Csincsak, commented that contestants must follow producers&#x27; orders and that a storyline was fabricated in the editing room.

On March 15, 2010, &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; creator Mike Fleiss appeared on &quot;20/20&quot; to confess that he developed the show&#x27;s contestants into characters that catered to his audience&#x27;s tastes, and that they &quot;need [their] fair share of villains every season&quot;. Fleiss has come under fire for admitting that &quot;The Bachelor&quot; has less to do with reality than it does making good television.

By season 7 of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, some believed that actors were being hired by ABC to play specific roles on the show. Some viewers were becoming tired of the show&#x27;s scripted nature and speaking out.

In 2018, Amy Kaufman published a book titled, &quot;Bachelor Nation: Inside the World of America&#x27;s Favorite Guilty Pleasure&quot;. This book provided insight on some of the manipulation tactics that producers employ in order to create drama and garner controversy as a ratings ploy.

==Setting==
Much like the parent show, the first two seasons were filmed in a luxurious house in Los Angeles County, California, and &quot;Villa De La Vina&quot; in Agoura Hills, California, for later seasons. Since the fifth season, the third and remaining episodes filmed around the world. Episodes have been filmed throughout the United States, Canada, Spain, Iceland, Turkey, Portugal, Thailand, China (Hong Kong only), Bermuda, England, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Ireland. In season 3, filming was located in New York City; Charlotte, North Carolina, for season 8, where Emily Maynard lived, so that she could stay with her daughter Ricki during production. In addition to Villa De La Vina mansion, the contestants in seasons 4 and 5 lived in a bunkhouse close to the mansion.

Due to the concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, when the mansion was strictly restricted for filming purposes, the sixteenth and seventeenth seasons filmed entirely within the United States being isolated on a quarantine type bio-secure bubble atmosphere around a single location at the hotel or resort they rented by production. While the eighteenth season filmed mostly in the United States, some quarantine restrictions being lifted with limited travel. In the twenty-first season, the mansion was not used for filming purposes unrelated to the then-existing pandemic above, they used the Hummingbird Nest Ranch in Santa Susana, California previously appeared in the spin-off series &quot;The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart&quot;.

==Seasons==

==Reunion==
On April 10, 2019, it was announced that a two-hour special titled &quot;Bachelorette Reunion: The Biggest Bachelorette Reunion in Bachelor History Ever!&quot; would premiere on May 6, 2019. Bachelorettes from seasons 2 and 3, Meredith Phillips and Jen Schefft didn&#x27;t make an appearance during the reunion special. Although host Chris Harrison claimed Meredith Phillips was unavailable to attend, Reality Steve reported her sending him the text &quot;No, I was never contacted or spoke to anyone. I didn&#x27;t even know the show was happening.&quot; in regards to the reunion. Schefft couldn&#x27;t make it due to a long-planned family vacation.

<text>In atomic physics, the Bohr magneton (symbol ) is a physical constant and the natural unit for expressing the magnetic moment of an electron caused by its orbital or spin angular momentum.
In SI units, the Bohr magneton is defined as
formula_1
and in the Gaussian CGS units as
formula_2
where
* is the elementary charge,
* is the reduced Planck constant,
* is the electron mass,
* is the speed of light.

==History==
The idea of elementary magnets is due to Walther Ritz (1907) and Pierre Weiss. Already before the Rutherford model of atomic structure, several theorists commented that the magneton should involve the Planck constant &quot;h&quot;. By postulating that the ratio of electron kinetic energy to orbital frequency should be equal to &quot;h&quot;, Richard Gans computed a value that was twice as large as the Bohr magneton in September 1911. At the First Solvay Conference in November that year, Paul Langevin obtained a value of formula_3. Langevin assumed that the attractive force was inversely proportional to distance to the power formula_4 and specifically formula_5

The Romanian physicist Ștefan Procopiu had obtained the expression for the magnetic moment of the electron in 1913. The value is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Bohr–Procopiu magneton&quot; in Romanian scientific literature. The Weiss magneton was experimentally derived in 1911 as a unit of magnetic moment equal to joules per tesla, which is about 20% of the Bohr magneton.

In the summer of 1913, the values for the natural units of atomic angular momentum and magnetic moment were obtained by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr as a consequence of his atom model. In 1920, Wolfgang Pauli gave the Bohr magneton its name in an article where he contrasted it with the magneton of the experimentalists which he called the Weiss magneton.

==Theory==
A magnetic moment of an electron in an atom is composed of two components. First, the orbital motion of an electron around a nucleus generates a magnetic moment by Ampère&#x27;s circuital law. Second, the inherent rotation, or spin, of the electron has a spin magnetic moment.

In the Bohr model of the atom, for an electron that is in the orbit of lowest energy, its orbital angular momentum has magnitude equal to the reduced Planck constant, denoted &quot;ħ&quot;. The Bohr magneton is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment of an electron orbiting an atom with this angular momentum.

The spin angular momentum of an electron is &quot;ħ&quot;, but the intrinsic electron magnetic moment caused by its spin is also approximately one Bohr magneton, which results in the electron spin &quot;g&quot;-factor, a factor relating spin angular momentum to corresponding magnetic moment of a particle, having a value of approximately 2.

<doc id="174956" wikidata="Q255595" url="?curid=174956" title="Ossuary">
<text>An ossuary is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeletal remains. They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary (&quot;os&quot; is &quot;bone&quot; in Latin). The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than possible in coffins. The practice is sometimes known as grave recycling.

==Persian ossuaries==

In Persia, the Zoroastrians used a deep well for this function from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it &quot;astudan&quot; (literally, &quot;the place for the bones&quot;). There are many rituals and regulations in the Zoroastrian faith concerning the &quot;astudans&quot;.

==Jewish ossuaries==

During the Second Temple period, Jewish burial customs were varied, differing based on class and belief. For the wealthy, one option available included primary burials in burial caves, followed by secondary burials in ossuaries. These bone boxes were placed in smaller niches of the burial caves, on the benches used for the desiccation of the corpse, or even on the floor. These ossuaries are almost exclusively made of limestone, roughly 40% of which are decorated with intricate geometrical patterns. Many ossuaries, plain or decorated, feature inscriptions identifying the deceased. These inscriptions are the chief scholarly source for identifying naming conventions in this region during this period.Among the best-known Jewish ossuaries of this period are: an ossuary inscribed &#x27;Simon the Temple builder&#x27; in the collection of the Israel Museum; one inscribed &#x27;Yehohanan ben Hagkol&#x27; that contained an iron nail in a heel bone suggesting crucifixion; another, (owned by André Lemaire), inscribed &#x27;James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus&#x27;, the authenticity of which has been debated by scholars; and ten ossuaries recovered from the Talpiot Tomb in 1980, several of which are reported to have names recorded in the New Testament. 

Geographically, ossuaries are almost exclusively associated with tombs in and around Jerusalem; however, caches of contemporaneous ossuaries have been discovered in Jericho.

There is ongoing scholarly disagreement as to the function and origin of ossuary burial. Some argue that this form of burial was born out of a theological shift in ideas about purity. Specifically, in the Mishnah and Talmud, Jewish sages from the period are depicted debating the methods and beliefs around ossuary burial. The perspectives they espouse are connected to the Pharisaic tradition; as such, it is speculated that ossuaries were developed by elite members of the Pharisaic religious school before spreading to other sects.

Others argue that material conditions of the elite have more influence on ossuaries use and form during this period. An increase in wealth among the urban elite in Jerusalem and Jericho, coupled with a building boom that created a surplus of stonemasons, allowed for new kinds of burial to evolve. It has been observed that ossuaries follow philosophically with Greco-Roman ideas of individuality in death and physically with Hellenistic forms of chest burial; as such, ossuaries may be an elite imitation of imperial burial modes that did not violate Jewish cultural norms.

The custom of secondary burial in ossuaries, on a whole, did not persist among Jews past the Second Temple period nor appear to exist widely among Jews outside the Land of Israel. There are, of course, exceptions to every trend: after the destruction of the Second Temple, poor imitations of ossuaries made of clay were created in Galilee; the last stone ossuaries are found in the Beth She&#x27;arim necropolis and date from the late third century CE; and at least one ossuary dating from the Second Temple period has been discovered in Alexandria.

==In Christianity==

=== Roman Catholic ossuaries ===

Many examples of ossuaries are found within Europe, including the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome, Italy; the Martyrs of Otranto in south Italy; the Fontanelle cemetery and Purgatorio ad Arco in Naples, Italy; the San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan, Italy; the Brno Ossuary and the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic; the Czermna Skull Chapel in Poland; and the Capela dos Ossos (&quot;Chapel of Bones&quot;) in Évora, Portugal. The village of Wamba in the province of Valladolid, Spain, has an impressive ossuary of over a thousand skulls inside the local church, dating from between the 12th and 18th centuries. A more recent example is the Douaumont ossuary in France, which contains the remains of more than 130,000 French and German soldiers that fell at the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The Catacombs of Paris represents another famous ossuary.

The catacombs beneath the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, Peru also contain an ossuary.

==== Largest ossuary ====

The skeletal remains of six million people lie, neatly arranged, in catacombs (also known as ossuaries or charnel houses) beneath the streets of Paris, France. The city has an estimated of tunnels and pathways, of which are packed tightly with the bones of those re-interred from the city&#x27;s overflowing cemeteries in the late 1700s.

=== Eastern Orthodox ossuaries ===
The use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with special reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is a &quot;temple of the Holy Spirit&quot;, having been sanctified and transfigured by Baptism, Holy Communion and the participation in the mystical life of the Church. In Orthodox monasteries, when one of the brethren dies, his remains are buried (for details, see Christian burial) for one to three years, and then disinterred, cleaned and gathered into the monastery&#x27;s charnel house. If there is reason to believe that the departed is a saint, the remains may be placed in a reliquary; otherwise the bones are usually mingled together (skulls together in one place, long bones in another, etc.). The remains of an abbot may be placed in a separate ossuary made out of wood or metal.

The use of ossuaries is also found among the laity in the Greek Orthodox Church. The departed will be buried for one to three years and then, often on the anniversary of death, the family will gather with the parish priest and celebrate a &quot;parastas&quot; (memorial service), after which the remains are disinterred, washed with wine, perfumed, and placed in a small ossuary of wood or metal, inscribed with the name of the departed, and placed in a room, often in or near the church, which is dedicated to this purpose.

<text>Karl Mannheim (born Károly Manheim, 27 March 1893 – 9 January 1947) was a Hungarian sociologist and a key figure in classical sociology as well as one of the founders of the sociology of knowledge. Mannheim is best known for his book &quot;Ideology and Utopia&quot; (1929/1936), in which he distinguishes between partial and total ideologies, the latter representing comprehensive worldviews distinctive to particular social groups, and also between ideologies that provide support for existing social arrangements, and utopias, which look to the future and propose a transformation of society.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
Karl Mannheim was born 27 March 1893 in Budapest, to a Hungarian father, a textile merchant, and German mother, both of Jewish descent. His early education was in that city, he studied philosophy and literature at the University of Budapest, though he also went to Berlin (where he studied with Georg Simmel) and Paris to further his education, returning to Hungary around the start of the First World War. He obtained a PhD from the University of Budapest, and further qualifications from the University of Heidelberg.

=== Academic career ===
During the War he was involved in a number of influential intellectual circles: the Galileo Circle founded by Karl Polanyi in which Michael Polanyi also participated, the Social Science Association organised by Oscar Jászi, and the Sonntagskreis or &#x27;Sunday Circle&#x27; led by György Lukács. In the brief period of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, in 1919, Mannheim taught in the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Budapest thanks to the patronage of his friend and mentor Lukács, whose political conversion to communism he did not share. Both Mannheim and Lukács were forced into exile after the rise of Horthy as Regent of Hungary. Mannheim chose exile in Germany and was there from 1920 to 1933.

In 1921, he married psychologist Juliska Károlyné Lang, better known as Julia Lang. Though she is often unacknowledged, Lang collaborated with Mannheim on many of his works, and along with a number of Mannheim&#x27;s students, put together many of his works to be published posthumously.

After an unsuccessful attempt to gain a sponsor to teach philosophy in Heidelberg, Mannheim began work in 1924 under the German sociologist Alfred Weber, the brother of well-known sociologist Max Weber, and Emil Lederer. In 1926, Mannheim had his habilitation accepted by the faculty of social sciences, thus satisfying the requirements to teach classes in sociology at Heidelberg. Mannheim was chosen over other competitors for the post, one of whom was Walter Benjamin. From 1929 to 1933, he served as a professor of sociology and political economy at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Norbert Elias and Hans Gerth worked as his assistants from spring 1930 until spring 1933, with Elias as the senior partner. Greta Kuckhoff, who later became a prominent figure in the DDR, was his administrative assistant in Frankfurt, leaving early in 1933 to study at the London School of Economics (LSE) and prepare for Mannheim&#x27;s emigration there.

In 1933, Mannheim was ousted from his professorship under the terms of the anti-Semitic law to purge the civil service and was forced into exile. After fleeing the Nazi regime and settling in Britain, Mannheim became a lecturer in sociology at the London School of Economics, under a program to assist academic exiles.

In 1941, Sir Fred Clarke, Director of the Institute of Education at the University of London, invited him to teach sociology at the institute on a part-time basis in conjunction with his declining role at LSE under wartime conditions. In January 1946 he was appointed as the first sociology professor at the Institute of Education, a position he held until his death in London a year later. During his time in England, Mannheim played a prominent role in &#x27;The Moot&#x27;, a Christian discussion group of which T.S. Eliot was also a member, concerned with the role of religion and culture in society, which was convened by J. H. Oldham. He also gained a position of influence through his editorship of the Routledge International Library of Sociology and Social Reconstruction (later the International Library of Sociology).
Mannheim&#x27;s life, one of intellectual and geographical migration, falls into three main phases: Hungarian (to 1919), German (1919–1933), British (1933–1947). Among his valued interlocutors were György Lukács, Oszkár Jászi, Georg Simmel, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Karl Marx, Alfred and Max Weber, Max Scheler, and Wilhelm Dilthey. In his work, he sought variously to synthesize elements derived from German historicism, Marxism, phenomenology, sociology, and Anglo-American pragmatism.

===Death===
Mannheim died in London on January 9, 1947, at the age of 53 due to a congenitally weak heart. Shortly before his death, he was invited to be director of UNESCO, an offer he was unfortunately not able to accept. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes were placed in the columbarium there in an urn, and later mixed with those of his wife. He was originally placed opposite Sigmund Freud as a planned pairing, but Freud was later relocated.

== Sociological work ==

=== Hungarian phase (1919) ===
Mannheim was a precocious scholar and an accepted member of several influential intellectual circles in Budapest. In the autumn of 1915, he was the youngest founding member of the Sonntagskreis (Sunday Circle) alongside Béla Balázs, Lajos Fülep, and György Lukács, where a wide range of literary and philosophical topics were discussed. Some discussion focused on the enthusiasms of German diagnosticians of cultural crisis, but also the novels of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the writings Søren Kierkegaard and of the German mystics. He also participated in the Social Science Association, which was founded by Oszkár Jászi in 1919 and was interested above all in French and English sociological writings. Mannheim&#x27;s Hungarian writings, notably his doctoral dissertation &quot;Structural Analysis of Epistemology,&quot; anticipate his lifelong search for &quot;synthesis&quot; between these currents.

According to the sociologist Longhurst, the Sonntagskreis &quot;rejected any &#x27;positivist&#x27; or &#x27;mechanist&#x27; understanding of society and was dissatisfied with the existing political arrangements in Hungary. The way forward was seen to be through the spiritual renewal entailed in a revolution in culture&quot;. The group members were discontented with the political and intellectual composition of Hungary, but &quot;they rejected a materialist Marxist critique of this society. Hungary was to be changed by a spiritual renewal led by those who had reached a significant level of cultural awareness&quot;. Yet they did not exclude Marxist themes and Mannheim&#x27;s work was influenced by Lukács&#x27; later turn to Marxism, for example he credits Marx as a key source of the sociology of knowledge.

=== German phase (1919–1933) ===
In this second phase, Mannheim turned from philosophy to sociology, to inquire into the roots of culture. In the early part of his stay in Germany, Mannheim published his doctoral dissertation &quot;Structural Epistemology of Knowledge&quot;, which discusses his theory of the structure of epistemology, the &quot;relations between the knower, the known and the to be known…for Mannheim based on psychology, logic and ontology&quot;. Sociologist Brian Longhurst explains that his work on epistemology represents the height of his early &quot;idealist&quot; phase, and transition to hermeneutic &quot;issues of interpretation within culture&quot;.

In this essay, Mannheim introduces &quot;the hermeneutic problem of the relationship between the whole and the parts&quot;. He considers the differences between art, the natural sciences, and philosophy &quot;with respect to truth claims&quot;, stating that science always tries to disprove one theory, where art never does this and can coexist in more than one worldview; philosophy falls in between the two extremes. Mannheim posits the &quot;danger of relativism&quot;, in which the historical process yields cultural products: &quot;if thought to be relative to a historical period, it may be unavailable to a historical period&quot;

Mannheim&#x27;s ambitious attempt to promote a comprehensive sociological analysis of the structures of knowledge was treated with suspicion by some members of the Frankfurt School, based in the Institute for Marxism directed by Max Horkheimer. They saw the rising popularity of the sociology of knowledge as neutralization and betrayal of Marxism. Arguments between Mannheim and Horkheimer played out in faculty forums, like the Kant Gesellschaft and Paul Tillich&#x27;s Christian Socialist discussion group.

Horkheimer&#x27;s Institute at the time was best known for the empirical work it encouraged, and several of Mannheim&#x27;s doctoral students used its resources. While the conflict between Mannheim, Adorno and Horkheimer looms large in retrospect, Mannheim&#x27;s most active contemporary competitors were in fact other academic sociologists, notably the proto-fascist Leipzig professor, Hans Freyer, and the proponent of formal sociology and leading figure in the profession at the time, Leopold von Wiese.

==== Theory of the sociology and of knowledge, sociology of culture ====

Mannheim&#x27;s theory on the sociology of knowledge is based on some of the epistemological discoveries of Immanuel Kant. Sociology of knowledge is known as a section of the greater field known as the sociology of culture. The idea of sociology of culture is defined as the relationship between culture and society.

There are two main branches of sociology of culture: a moderate branch and a radical branch. The moderate branch is represented by Max Scheler, who believed that social conditions do not affect the content of knowledge. The radical branch, on the contrary, highlighted that society is determined by all aspects of culture. When it came to the sociology of knowledge, Mannheim believed that it established a dependence of knowledge on social reality. Though Mannheim was far from being a Marxist, sociology of knowledge was largely based on Marx&#x27;s theories regarding classes.

Mannheim&#x27;s central question of the sociology of knowledge, which tried to understand the relationship between society and knowledge, demonstrated his endeavors to solve the issue of &quot;historical nature and unity of mind and life.&quot; Mannheim affirmed the sociology of knowledge as an &quot;extrinsic interpretation and sets apart from the immanent interpretation of thought products.&quot; The immanent interpretation is based on one&#x27;s understanding of intellectual content, which is limited to theoretical content of knowledge and the extrinsic interpretation is based on the capability to understand manifestations.

Knowing the difference between these two types of interpretations helped Mannheim create a place for the sociology of knowledge in the scientific system, thus leaving the sociology of knowledge to stand opposite of the traditional human sciences and to interpret knowledge through an exploration of social reality. Mannheim claimed that the sociology of knowledge has to be understood as the visionary expression of &quot;historical experience which has social reality at its vital center.&quot;

In 1920, a series of his essays were published in Germany under the name &quot;Essays in Sociology of Knowledge.&quot; These essays focused on the search for the meaning behind social reality, the notion of &quot;truth&quot; and the role of the empirical intellectual in search for these truths. Another collection of his essays, &quot;Essays in Sociology of Culture&quot;, was posthumously published in 1956. It basically served to merge his concern with social reality and democracy. According to Mannheim, ideology was linked to a notion of reality, meanwhile culture focuses more so on the mind of the individual and how it perceives that reality, both, however, &quot;still concerned with the role of the intelligentsia.&quot;

==== &quot;Ideology and Utopia&quot; (1929) ====
==== Mannheim and macro-sociology ====

Mannheim&#x27;s work was written mostly through a macrosociological lens. While writing &quot;Ideology and Utopia&quot; Mannheim&#x27;s fundamental questions were &quot;why does man behave differently in the framework of different social group and class structures.&quot; In answering this question, his intellectual contribution to sociology was focused more on social problems than sociological problems. The consolidation of his work focused on topics such as &quot;social stability, social groups and the psychic differentials corresponding to social status or class cleavages.&quot; To Mannheim the public was essential and fundamental to a democratic society. Therefore, assuring that not one ideology dictate all of the public is vital for the preservation of democracy.

=== British phase (1933–1947) ===
In his British phase Mannheim attempted a comprehensive analysis of the structure of modern society by way of democratic social planning and education. Mannheim&#x27;s first major work published during this period was &quot;Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction&quot; 1935, in which he argues for a shift from the liberal order of laissez-faire capitalism, &quot;founded on the unregulated trade cycle, unextended democracy, free competition and ideas of competitive individualism&quot; to planned democracy.

In &quot;Diagnosis of Our Time&quot;, Mannheim expands on this argument and expresses concern for the transition from liberal order to planned democracy, according to Longhurst, arguing &quot;...the embryonic planned democratic society can develop along democratic or dictatorial routes...as expressed in the totalitarian societies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union&quot;. His work was admired more by educators, social workers, and religious thinkers than it was by the small community of British sociologists. His books on planning nevertheless played an important part in the political debates of the immediate post-war years, both in the United States and in several European countries.

==Legacy==
Mannheim&#x27;s sociological theorizing has been the subject of numerous book-length studies, evidence of an international interest in his principal themes. Mannheim was not the author of any work he himself considered a finished book, but rather of some fifty major essays and treatises, most later published in book form. In Spain his theories were followed by Artur Juncosa Carbonell.

The nuclear magneton is the natural unit for expressing magnetic dipole moments of heavy particles such as nucleons and atomic nuclei.

Due to neutrons and protons having internal structure and not being Dirac particles, their magnetic moments differ from :
: &quot;μ&quot; =  &quot;μ&quot;
: &quot;μ&quot; =  &quot;μ&quot;

The magnetic dipole moment of the electron, which is much larger as a consequence of much larger charge-to-mass ratio, is usually expressed in units of the Bohr magneton, which is calculated in the same fashion using the electron mass. The result is larger than by a factor equal to the proton-to-electron mass ratio, about 1836.

<doc id="174967" wikidata="Q1585773" url="?curid=174967" title="Rukmini">
<text>Rukmini (, ) is a Hindu goddess and the first queen of Krishna. She is described as the chief of Krishna&#x27;s wives in Dvārakā. Rukmini is revered as the avatar of Lakshmi and is venerated primarily in Warkari, and Haridasa tradition, and additionally in Sri Vaishnavism.

Rukmini is mainly worshipped in Maharashtra and South India. The people of Maharashtra venerate her with Vithoba (a regional form of Krishna) and call her Rakhumai. In South India, she is worshipped along with Krishna and his and his other primary consort Satyabhama. Her birthday is celebrated every year on the occasion of Rukmini Ashtami.

==Etymology and epithets==
The name &quot;Rukmini&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Rukma&quot; which means &#x27;Radiant&#x27;, &#x27;Clear&#x27; or &#x27;Bright&#x27;. The name can also mean &#x27;decorated with gold ornaments&#x27;. Other names and epithets include:
*&quot;Shree&quot; – Lakshmi, Mother Goddess of the universe 
*&quot;Ruciranana&quot; – One Who Has A Beautiful Face, Expanding Like A Lotus Flower
*&quot;Vaidarbhi&quot; – She Who Is From The Kingdom Of Vidarbha
*&quot;Bhaishmi&quot; – Daughter of Bhishmaka
*&quot;Rakhumai&quot; – Mother Rukmini
*&quot;Chiryauvana&quot; – One Who Is Forever Young
*&quot;Pradyumna Janani&quot; – Mother of Pradyumna

==Legends==
===Birth===
According to the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and other &quot;Puranic&quot; scriptures, Princess Rukmini was born to Bhishmaka—the king of Vidarbha kingdom, belonging to the Bhoja dynasty. She had five elder brothers—Rukmi, Rukmaratha, Rukmabahu, Rukmakesa and Rukmanetra. Puranas such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, &quot;Bhagavata Purana,&quot; and &quot;Padma Purana&quot; praise her as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, the wife of God Vishnu.

===Marriage to Krishna===
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates that Rukmini once heard about Krishna and his heroic deeds, such as slaying the tyrant king Kamsa, and opposing the evil king Jarasandha. She fell in love with him and desired to marry him. The episode of &quot;Rukmini Kalyanam,&quot; and the devotion of Rukmini towards her desired husband is narrated by the sage Shuka to King Parikshit.

Rukmini&#x27;s parents rejoiced and gave their permission, but Rukmi – who was an ally of Jarasandha – strongly opposed it. Instead, he proposed that she marry his friend Shishupala— the crown prince of Chedi Kingdom, and a cousin of Krishna. Bhishmaka agreed, and a distressed Rukmini immediately sent for a trusted Brahmin and asked him to deliver a message to Krishna. In the message, she wrote to Krishna about her love and asked him to abduct her when she visited the temple of Goddess Ambika (Parvati) before her wedding. Krishna, having received the message in Dvaraka, told the messenger to inform Rukmini that he had received her letter and would come to make her his wife. Krishna then immediately set out for Vidarbha with Balarama, his elder brother.

Meanwhile, in Vidarbha&#x27;s capital Kundina, Bhishmaka had prepared for Rukmini&#x27;s marriage. Rukmini grew anxious as she observed the host of kings, wondering if the Brahmin she had dispatched had not reached safely or not, and if the Almighty would assist her in her efforts. Her face grew pale and her thoughts grew distressed as she shunned herself from the rest of the world. Her sorrow of Krishna not having yet arrived to marry her yet was so immense that she refused to eat, sing to her parrot, or play her lyre. Shishupala, along with his allies including Jarasandha had arrived. Krishna and Balarama had also arrived, and Bhishmaka welcomed them. At the palace, Rukmini had lost all hope, but the messenger turned up and informed that Krishna had accepted her request. The next day, she went to the temple to offer her prayers to Ambika. As she proceeded towards the wedding venue, she saw Krishna and he soon swept her into his chariot with him. All of Jarasandha&#x27;s forces quickly started chasing them, but they were repulsed by Balarama and his army.

Rukmi chased after Krishna and Rukmini. He challenged Krishna to a fight, but was easily overpowered by the former. Rukmini begged Krishna to spare her brother&#x27;s life, and the latter agreed. However, he shaved Rukmi&#x27;s hair and moustache as a mark of punishment, and let him go free. Krishna and Rukmini reached Dvaraka, where they were welcomed with great pomp and ceremony, followed by a wedding.

According to the Skanda Purana, Rukmini was 8 years old when she married Krishna. 

It is stated in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (Krishna Janma Khanda, Chapter 105, Verses 9–14) she had reached puberty and was ready for marriage according to her father. 

In the Bhagavata Purana (Dasama Skandha, Chapter 53, Verse 51), she has been described as having budding breasts.

In the Harivamsa, a supplement to Mahabharata, (Vishnu Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 35-40), it is stated about Rukmini that &quot;her lips, eyes and the corners were coppery, thighs, hips and breast were plump, her body was tall but thin and beautiful; her countenance was like the moon, her nails were red; eye-brows were charming, hairs were curling and black and her beauty was highly picturesque. Her face was beautified by rows of equal and white teeth.&quot; 

===Krishna&#x27;s ruse===
The Bhagavata Purana describes an episode through the sage Shuka where the yet unwed Rukmini takes a bejewelled whisk and starts fanning her prospective husband Krishna, wearing an expensive girdle and a dazzling necklace. Even though he is pleased, Krishna points to the fact that the princess had been desired by a number of handsome and energetic monarchs and states that he was not their equal, and that he had also almost lost his realm rescuing her. He remarks that she had not been far-sighted in choosing him as her groom and that she must now instead choose a Kshatriya like her. Rukmini&#x27;s heart shuddered, her red nails scratched the floor, and tears flowed from her eyes that were decorated with collyrium. She fell to the floor, her hair dishevelled. Krishna swiftly raised her back to her feet and assures her that he was merely joking, as householders do with their beloved. Her fear of abandonment seeping away from her, the princess eulogises him, praising his glories and addressing him as her atman, her sense of self. Krishna praises her single-minded devotion to him.

===Married life and children===

Though Krishna married many other women, Rukmini remained his chief consort and the queen of Dvaraka. When she longed for a child, Krishna flew to Kailash upon his mount Garuda, and expressed his wife&#x27;s desire to Shiva. Obliging, Shiva blessed Rukmini to be the bearer of the new incarnation of Kamadeva, whom he had previously immolated with his third eye. Thus was Pradyumna born. Many scriptures have mentioned that Rukmini and other wives of Krishna lived like sisters.

The Bhagavata Purana and Vishnu Purana states that Rukmini and Krishna had ten sons—Pradyumna, Charudeshna, Sudeshna, Charudeha, Sucharu, Charugupta, Bhadracharu, Charuchandra, Vicharu, and Charu. In the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, Rukmini&#x27;s sons are Pradyumna, Charudeshna, Charuchandra, Charugarbha, Sudangstra, Druma, Sushena, Charugupta, Charuvinda, and Chharuvahu. A different listing is found in &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, where Pradyumna, Charudeshna, Sucharu, Charuvesa, Yasodhana, Charusravas, Charuyasas, and Sambhu are Rukmini&#x27;s sons. Vishnu Puran also mentioned that Rukmini had a daughter named Charumati.

===Tale of the scales===
According to a folktale of Odisha, the divine sage Narada once arrived in Dvaraka and asked for Krishna to be given to him as alms. Krishna&#x27;s 8 queens requested him to take anything else and Narada asked them to give wealth equal to Krishna&#x27;s weight. They arranged for a big scale (Tulabharama) to be put up. Satyabhama put all of her coins, gems and jewellery on the scale, but it doesn&#x27;t budge. Other wives gave their jewels, but it was of no use. At last, Rukmini came and put a single leaf of Tulasi on the scale and chanted that it represented her love for Krishna. The scales then became balanced. Though this story is absent in the main scriptures pertaining to Krishna&#x27;s life, it is often repeated to enunciate the worth of Rukmini&#x27;s love over Satyabhama&#x27;s material wealth. The only known versions of this story are from Padma Purana and Devi Bhagvata Purana, where Satyabhama succeeds in weighing Krishna normally with gold items.

===Meeting Sudama===
In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, another well-known incident in Rukmini&#x27;s married life is narrated. When Krishna&#x27;s childhood friend, Sudama, visited Dvaraka, Rukmini welcomed Sudama and gave him food. She and Krishna fanned him as he rested from his long journey. This type of devotion is a characteristic of Rukmini, an attribute of her that is prevalent.

===Durvasa&#x27;s curse===
According to the Skanda Purana, the famously short-tempered sage Durvasa met Krishna and Rukmini when he was on a pilgrimage. Durvasa asked the couple to be yoked onto his chariot while he held the reins. In the process of pulling the chariot forward, Rukmini grew exhausted and requested Krishna for water. Krishna struck his foot against the ground causing a spring of the Ganga river to appear. Observing her quench her thirst without seeking his permission, the infuriated Durvasa cursed her to be separated from her beloved Krishna. Rukmini grew perturbed and started to cry. To pacify her, Krishna blessed her with the boon that if his devotees were to only see him and not her, they would receive only half the merit.

Despite this consolation, Rukmini grew distressed due to her separation from her consort and fell unconscious. The sea-god and the sage Narada arrived to comfort her. Narada informed her that her husband - a manifestation of Vishnu - was the Supreme Being himself, he rhetorically wondered how she could expect to keep his company in an exclusive garden. The sea affirmed the divine sage&#x27;s words, promising her that as the companion of Vishnu, she would always retain her permanence in his being. The goddess Bhagirathi, the personification of the Ganga, produced a richly-endowed forest on the spot, laden with fruits and flowers, quickly to be frequented by the inhabitants of Dvaraka. Durvasa vengefully burnt the forest with his powers. Rukmini grew depressed and contemplated giving up her human form. Krishna arrived and stopped her. She felt ashamed and furious with herself even as her husband reassured her of his devotion. The repentant Durvasa begged Krishna to reunite with Rukmini, and the deity consented, blessing the sage with virtue as well as saluting the river Ganga, who then became the liberator of sorrows.

===Death===
After the disappearance of Krishna following the Yadu massacre in the Mausala Parva, Rukmini, along with Jambavati, self-immolated herself on the funeral pyre.

== Iconography ==
In many texts, the Brahman dispatched by Rukmini to request Krishna to elope with her on her svayamvara describes the princess poetically as bearing beautiful hands, braided tresses, and a face that resembles the moon. She is consistently described as beautiful in other accounts.

Rukmini as mentioned in Hindu traditions, stands for the majesty and wealth of Krishna. Vadiraja Tirtha in &quot;Rukminisha Vijaya&quot;, describes her as Krishna&#x27;s supreme beloved consort. In south Indian iconographic tradition, Rukmini, along with Satyabhama, appear as the primary consorts of Krishna.

According to the &quot;Vaikhanasagama&quot;, Rukmini should be depicted on the right side of Krishna, her image golden-yellow in complexion. Her hair is supposed to be tied up in a fashionable knot, and should also be adorned with flowers. Her right arm should be hanging down, and she should hold a lotus in her left hand. She is supposed to be adorned with various ornaments.

== Literature and symbolism ==
Rukmini in Hinduism, is revered as the goddess of fortune, and mostly appears alongside her husband Krishna. An avtara of Lakshmi, she is the chief and most beloved consort of Krishna, in various scriptures and text of Hindu traditions.

Rukmini finds her mention in &quot;Gopala Tapani Upanishad&quot; (as Krishna&#x27;s other consort), in the &quot;Garga Samhita&quot; (as Queen of Dvaraka), in &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (as Krishna&#x27;s chief queen), in &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;, in &quot;Harivaṃśa&quot; that centres upon Dvaraka, and in &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, mainly in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; and the &quot;Mausala Parva&quot;. Rukmini is the central character of the text, &quot;Rukminisha Vijaya&quot;, that talks about her and Krishna&#x27;s life before marriage and ends with their marriage. She also appears in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and &quot;Padma Purana&quot; (as an avatar of Lakshmi).

The &quot;Brihad Bhagavatamrita&quot; offers the following adulations to Rukmini, identifying her with Lakshmi and Krishna as the Supreme God, the source of all avatars. It states that she assumes partial avatars to accompany Krishna&#x27;s avatars like Vamana and serves Krishna as his &quot;perfectly complete divine consort&quot;. The &quot;Narada Purana&quot; instructs a devotee on the manner of offering worship to Krishna, offering precedence to the role of Rukmini in his devotion. Rukmini is worshipped with Krishna on his left-hand side; she is equated with Rajas. The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; describes the process of the worship of the goddess with Krishna. A devotee is said to acquire wish fulfillment, male progeny and physical beauty by pleasing Rukmini.

== Worship and festivals ==
Rukmini&#x27;s worship as the consort of Krishna precedes his association with his other consorts Radha. According to D.C. Sircar, a sculpture from Paharpur in northern Bengal, attributed to the sixth or seventh century, represents Krishna and his consort, which he concludes is likely Rukmini. Her identification with Radha is rendered unlikely by the historian, since, &quot;we have no undoubted reference to Radha in genuine epigraphic or literary records of an early date&quot;.

Rukmini is mainly worshipped in west and south Indian states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Her kingdom, Vidarbha, is believed to be located in present-day Maharashtra. Along with Vithoba (a regional form of Krishna), Rukmini is worshipped as &quot;Rakhumai&quot; in the Pandharpur region. Rukmini is worshipped as the chief goddess in Divya Desam temples like Pandava Thoothar Perumal Temple, Parthasarathy Temple; with Krishna being the primary deity. She is also worshipped with her co-wife Satyabhama in temples like Thirukkavalampadi, Venugopalaswamy Temple and Rajagopalaswamy Temple.

===Festivals===

<text>SimEarth: The Living Planet is a life simulation game, the second designed by Will Wright, published in 1990 by Maxis. In &quot;SimEarth&quot;, the player controls the development of a planet. English scientist James Lovelock served as an advisor and his Gaia hypothesis of planet evolution was incorporated into the game. Versions were made for the Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga, IBM PC, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega CD, and TurboGrafx-16. It was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console. In 1996, several of Maxis&#x27; simulation games were re-released under the &quot;Maxis Collector Series&quot; with greater compatibility with Windows 95 and differing box art, including the addition of &quot;Classics&quot; beneath the title. SimEarth was re-released in 1997 under the &quot;Classics&quot; label.

== Gameplay ==
In &quot;SimEarth&quot;, the player can vary a planet&#x27;s atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc., then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve. In the “Random Planet” game setting, the game is a software toy, without any required goals. The big (and difficult) challenge is to evolve sentient life and an advanced civilization, culminating in that species leaving the planet in an exodus. The development stages of the planet can be restored and repeated, until the planet &quot;dies&quot; ten billion years after its creation, the estimated time when the Sun will become a red giant and kill off all of the planet&#x27;s life.

There are also eight scenarios that do have goals, the first three (Aquarium, Cambrian Earth, and 1990 Earth) involving managing the evolution and development of Earth in different stages, the next four (Mars, Venus, Ice Planet, and Dune) involving terraforming other planets to support life, and the final scenario (Earth 2XXX) involving rescuing life and civilization on a future Earth from self-replicating robots and nuclear warfare and giving the player the option of causing a great flood to help achieve this goal. In addition, there is another game mode besides Random Planet and Scenario mode, called Daisy World, where the only biome on the planet is daisies, which change their color relative to the temperature.

The game models the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock (who assisted with the design and wrote an introduction to the manual), and one of the options available to the player is the simplified &quot;Daisyworld&quot; model.

The player&#x27;s control of the planet in the game is quite comprehensive; display panels allow the player to regulate everything from atmospheric gases, with percentages to three decimal places, to the rate of continental drift, to the rate of reproduction and mutation of lifeforms. In addition, the player is given options to place equipment or items that interfere with the planet&#x27;s development, such as oxygen generators, which increase the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, and the monolith, a take on the one found in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which aids in increasing the intelligence of a lifeform through extraterrestrial influence.

The list of disasters ranges from natural occurrences, such as hurricanes and wildfires, to population-dependent disasters, such as diseases and pollution. Effects on the planet may be minor or major depending on the current conditions. Volcanic eruptions, for example, increase the amount of dust in the atmosphere, lowering global temperature; earthquakes in a body of water may produce tsunamis; and the shortage of nuclear fuel for a nuclear power-dependent civilization may potentially trigger nuclear war and nuclear winter.

Global warming can cause the planet&#x27;s ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise, but if a planet gets very hot, the oceans boil away until there are none left, only land. A planet without any water can have oceans form if hit by an &quot;ice meteor&quot; (a comet). Many things have to be kept within a certain balanced range for a planet to be able to support multicellular animal life; outside this range, only single-celled lifeforms, plants, robots, and lifeforms that have been civilized can survive. This excludes most lifeforms in this game since most are multicellular animals that are not civilized.

All player-triggered actions have a cost specified in &quot;energy units&quot; or &quot;omega (Ω) units&quot;; for example, 50 energy units are required to lay down a single terrain square, while 500 units are required to lay down a terraforming device. The energy budget is determined by the level of development of the planet, and the chosen difficulty level; on the lowest difficulty level, the energy budget is unlimited.

Gameplay itself can be somewhat mystifying; species may thrive or die out for no apparent reason. Mass extinctions, however, are often followed by periods of renewed evolutionary diversification, allowing the player to experiment with new sets of species and ecosystems.

===Taxa===
A feature of the game is that all taxa of multicellular animals are on an equal footing, and thus it is possible to evolve, for example, sapient molluscs. The two single-celled lifeform taxa, prokaryotes and eukaryotes (or bacteria and amoebas, in the SNES version) are treated specially. Some examples of animal taxa include radiates and cetaceans as well as more known organisms such as fishes and birds. As an Easter egg, there is also machine life, which can appear if a city of the highest technology level (Nanotech Age) is destroyed by a nuclear explosion. Machine life can thrive in any biome or environmental conditions, generally out-competing any other lifeforms present, and can itself eventually evolve intelligence and build cities. Additionally, there are Carniferns, which are mutated, carnivorous plants, which can occur only naturally. Having an abundance of insects allows for these life-forms to develop. Carniferns are able to develop intelligence just as animals can. In addition to the familiar types, the long-extinct &quot;trichordates&quot; are included. The game states that &quot;We [the game&#x27;s developers] felt sorry for them, and are giving them a chance for survival in &quot;SimEarth&quot;.&quot; Dinosaurs are another included taxon.

===Civilization===
Once an organism on the SimEarth planet becomes sentient and develops civilization, it will gradually go through different stages of development with each successive stage being more technologically advanced than the last.

* Stone Age, characterized by the use of stone tools and paleolithic lifestyles.
* Bronze Age, characterized by the use of bronze tools, the invention of farming, the development of writing, and urbanization.
* Iron Age, characterized by the use of iron tools and is slightly more advanced than the Bronze Age.
* Industrial Age, characterized by rapid industrialization and improving living standards. This stage is where resources are being rapidly consumed. Once this stage is achieved, energy requirements are high and global warming starts to threaten the planet&#x27;s habitability.
* Atomic Age, characterized by the use of nuclear energy.
* Information Age, associated with the mass use of telecommunications technologies and computers.
* Nanotech Age, the most challenging stage to reach due to depleting resources and the growing threat of global warming. It is associated with the use of nanotechnology and interplanetary space travel.

It is only possible for one species to reach sentience at a time on the planet. If the current sentient species becomes extinct, another species can achieve sentience. Once the sentient species reaches advanced Nanotech Age, they will begin the Exodus and launch all of their population into space. This entirely removes that species from the world, allowing other species to reach sentience.

==Development==
Will Wright was introduced to James Lovelock by Stewart Brand, a former editor of &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; who lived near Wright, upon hearing about &quot;SimEarth&quot;. Lovelock advised the development team behind &quot;SimEarth&quot;, and particularly assisted with geophysical models. Lovelock stated in regards to the Gaia model that &quot;Attempts to model the Earth through simple sciences such as biology or biochemistry fail because the models are oversensitive to initial conditions and prone to chaotic disturbance.&quot; Gaia models link biology and geology however, which Lovelock claimed are &quot;for some reason stable and able to resist perturbations.&quot; Lovelock expressed that &quot;SimEarth&#x27;s&quot; simulation has &#x27;a degree of realism&#x27; despite it being &quot;little more than a game&quot;, and he expressed that he hadn&#x27;t seen or been involved in any computer simulations of nature on the scale of &quot;SimEarth&quot; at the time, noting that many professional climate models at the time didn&#x27;t take clouds, the ocean, or biology into account.

==Reception==

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;SimEarth&quot; &quot;absolutely fascinating&quot;. The reviewer wished that the game had more &quot;SimCity&quot;-like visual feedback, but stated that it was superior to the predecessor because of larger scope and greater replayability. It won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Awards for Best Secondary Education Program and Best Simulation Program.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A− and wrote that &quot;While it&#x27;s never too early to teach kids to respect the biosphere, the same may not be true of introducing them to complicated simulations such as &quot;Simearth: The Living Planet&quot; (&quot;FCI, for Super NES&quot;), which has more variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) than a polynomial equation. There&#x27;s something to be said for this, though: A task as simple as &#x27;growing a daisy&#x27;—one option offered here—requires knowing far more than which button to push to cream the bad guy.&quot;

&quot;The One&quot; gave the MS-DOS version of &quot;SimEarth&quot; an overall score of 95%, and expressed that the game is fun &#x27;regardless of whether you know what you&#x27;re doing or not&#x27;, and said that experimenting with the simulation is &quot;hours of fun&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; praised &quot;SimEarth&#x27;s&quot; substantial gameplay, expressing that the game has &quot;near-infinite variations with which to experiment.&quot; &quot;The One&quot; noted the game as having &quot;tremendous educational possibilities&quot;, but simultaneously being fun and engaging.

<doc id="174976" wikidata="Q56247062" url="?curid=174976" title="Buddhahood">
<text>In Buddhism, Buddha (, which in classic Indic languages means &quot;awakened one&quot;) is a title for those who are spiritually awake or enlightened, and have thus attained the supreme goal of Buddhism, variously described as awakening or enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;), &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; (&quot;blowing out&quot;), and liberation (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;). A Buddha is also someone who fully understands the &quot;Dhārma&quot;, the true nature of all things or phenomena (&quot;dhārmata&quot;), the ultimate truth. Buddhahood (Sanskrit: &quot;buddhatva&quot;; or ; ) is the condition and state of being a Buddha. This highest spiritual state of being is also termed sammā-sambodhi (Sanskrit: &quot;samyaksaṃbodhi&quot;; &quot;full, complete awakening&quot;) and is interpreted in many different ways across schools of Buddhism.

The title of &quot;Buddha&quot; is most commonly used for Gautama Buddha, the historical founder of Buddhism, who is often simply known as &quot;the Buddha&quot;. The title is also used for other sentient beings who have achieved awakening or enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;) and liberation (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;), such as the other human Buddhas who achieved enlightenment before Gautama; members of the Five Buddha Families such as Amitābha; and the bodhisattva Maitreya, known as the &quot;Buddha of the future who will attain awakening at a future time.&quot;

In Theravāda Buddhism, a Buddha is commonly understood as a being with the deepest spiritual wisdom about the true nature of reality, who has transcended rebirth and all causes of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;). He is also seen as having many miraculous and magical powers. However, a living Buddha has the limitations of a physical body, will feel pain, get old, and eventually die like other sentient beings. In Mahāyāna Buddhism however, a Buddha is considered to be a transcendent being, who is all-knowing, immeasurably powerful, with an eternal lifespan. His wisdom light is said to pervade the cosmos, and his great compassion and skillful means are limitless. This transcendent being is not understood as having a normal physical human body; instead, Mahāyāna Buddhism defends a kind of docetism, in which Gautama Buddha&#x27;s life on earth was a magical display which only appeared to have a human body.

A sentient being who is on the path to become a Buddha is called a &quot;bodhisattva&quot;. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, Buddhahood is the universal goal and all Mahāyānists ultimately aim at becoming a Buddha, in order to benefit and liberate all sentient beings. Thus, Buddhahood is the goal for all the various spiritual paths found in the various Mahāyāna traditions (including Tantric Buddhism, Zen, and Pure Land). This contrasts with the common Theravādin goal of individual liberation, or arhatship.

==Definition==


Buddhahood is the state of an awakened being, who, having found the path of cessation of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;) (as originated from attachment to fetters and hindrances, distorted perception and thinking) is in the state of &quot;no-more-Learning&quot;.

Buddhism is devoted primarily to awakening or enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;), &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; (&quot;blowing out&quot;), and liberation (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;) from all causes of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;) due to the existence of sentient beings in &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (the cycle of compulsory birth, death, and rebirth) through the threefold trainings (ethical conduct, meditative absorption, and wisdom). Classical Indian Buddhism emphasized the importance of the individual&#x27;s self-cultivation (through numerous spiritual practices like keeping ethical precepts, Buddhist meditation, and worship) in the process of liberation from the defilements which keep us bound to the cycle of rebirth. According to the standard Buddhist scholastic understanding, liberation arises when the proper elements (&quot;dhārmata&quot;) are cultivated and when the mind has been purified of its attachment to fetters and hindrances that produce unwholesome mental factors (various called defilements, poisons, or fluxes).

There is a broad spectrum of opinion on the nature of Buddhahood, its universality, and the method of attaining Buddhahood among the various schools of Buddhism. The level to which this manifestation requires ascetic practices varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, Buddhahood is the universal goal and all Mahāyānists ultimately aim at becoming a Buddha, in order to benefit and liberate all sentient beings. While most Mahāyāna Buddhist schools accept the bodhisattva ideal, in which it takes aeons to reach Buddhahood, not all agree that everyone can become a Buddha or that the path to Buddhahood must necessarily take aeons.

In Theravāda Buddhism, &quot;Buddha&quot; refers to one who has reached awakening or enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;) through their own efforts and insight, without a teacher to point out the &quot;Dhārma&quot;. A &quot;samyaksaṃbuddha&quot; (&quot;full, complete Buddha&quot;) re-discovers the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path to awakening on their own, and then teaches these to others after his awakening. A &quot;pratyekabuddha&quot; (&quot;solitary Buddha&quot;) also reaches &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; through his own efforts, but is unable or unwilling to teach the &quot;Dhārma&quot; to others. An &quot;arhat&quot; (&quot;saint&quot;) needs to follow the teaching of a Buddha to attain &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;, and may also preach the &quot;Dhārma&quot; after attaining &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;. In one instance the term &quot;Buddha&quot; is also used in Theravādin literature to refer to all who attain &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;, using the term &quot;śrāvakabuddha&quot; to designate an &quot;arhat&quot;, someone who depends on the teachings of a Buddha to attain &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;. In this broader sense it is equivalent to the arhat.

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, a Buddha is seen as a transcendent being who has extensive powers, such as omniscience, omnipotence, and whose awakened wisdom (&quot;buddha-jñana&quot;) is all pervasive. This view can be found in numerous Mahāyāna texts, such as the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;. Mahāyāna buddhology mainly understands the Buddha through the &quot;three bodies&quot; (&quot;Trikāya&quot;) framework. In this framework, the historical Buddha or other Buddhas who appear human are understood docetically as magical &quot;transformation bodies&quot; (&quot;Nirmāṇakāya&quot;). Meanwhile, the &quot;real&quot; or ultimate Buddha is the &quot;Dharmakāya&quot;, the body of ultimate reality. Thus, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (&quot;Analysis of the Jeweled Lineage&quot;), a key Mahāyāna treatise, defines the Buddha as &quot;the uncompounded (&quot;asamskrta&quot;), and spontaneous (&quot;anabhoga&quot;) Dharmakāya&quot; and as &quot;self-enlightened and self-arisen wisdom (&quot;jñana&quot;), compassion and power for the benefit of others.&quot; This ultimate awakened reality is understood and interpreted in numerous different ways by the different Mahāyāna schools.

The doctrine of Buddha-nature (&quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;) in Mahāyāna Buddhism also consider Buddhahood to be a universal and innate property which is immanent in all sentient beings. Most Buddhists do not consider Gautama Buddha to have been the only Buddha. The Pāli Canon refers to many previous ones (see list of the named Buddhas), while the Mahāyāna texts additionally have many Buddhas of celestial origin (see Amitābha or Vairocana as examples; for lists of many thousands of Buddha names, see &quot;Taishō Tripiṭaka&quot;, numbers 439–448).

==Views about the Buddhas==
=== A Buddha as a supreme person ===
The Theravāda Buddhist tradition generally sees the Buddha as a supreme person who is neither a God in the theistic sense, nor a deva, nor a regular human. Thus, the Buddha is seen as a very special and unique class of persons called a &quot;great person&quot; (&quot;mahāpurisa&quot;).

Andrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human. Instead, he is seen as having many supranormal powers (&quot;siddhi&quot;), such as the superknowledges (&quot;abhijñā&quot;), the capacity for a very long lifespan, as well as the thirty-two marks of a great man.

In the Pāli Canon, the Buddha is depicted as someone between a human and a divine being. He has a human body that decays and dies, and he was born from human parents (though some sources depict this as a miraculous birth). The most important element of a Buddha is that they have attained the supreme spiritual goal: &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;. This is what makes him supreme and what grants him special powers. This view of the Buddhas a supreme person with many superpowers, but which has a physical body that has many limitations of a human form was also shared by other early Buddhist schools, like the Sarvāstivāda and the Dharmaguptaka.

In the Pāli Canon, the Buddha is asked whether he was a deva or a human, and he replies that he had eliminated the deep-rooted unconscious traits that would make him either one, and should instead be called a Buddha: one who had grown up in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus flower grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.

The Pāli Canon also states that Gautama Buddha is known as being a &quot;teacher of the gods and humans&quot;, superior to both the gods (devas) and humans since he has attained the highest liberation, whereas the gods are still subject to attachment, ignorance, anger, fear, and sorrow. In the &quot;Madhupindika Sutta&quot; (MN 18), Buddha is described in powerful terms, such as the &quot;Lord of the &quot;Dhārma&quot;&quot; and the bestower of immortality.

Similarly, in the &quot;Anuradha Sutta&quot; (SN 44.2), Gautama Buddha is described as the &quot;supreme man&quot; and the &quot;attainer of the superlative attainment&quot;. Because he has attained the highest spiritual knowledge, the Buddha is also identified with the &quot;Dhārma&quot; (the most fundamental reality) In the &quot;Vakkali Sutta&quot; (SN 22.87).

===A Buddha as a transcendent and supramundane being===
In the early Buddhist schools, the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarded the buddhas as being characterized primarily by their supramundane (&quot;lokottara&quot;) nature. The Mahāsāṃghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats. Of the 48 special theses attributed by the Indian scholar Vasumitra to the Mahāsāṃghika sects of Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, and Kukkuṭika, 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to Vasumitra, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind. Yao Zhihua writes:

A doctrine ascribed to the Mahāsāṃghikas is, &quot;The power of the tathāgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited.&quot; According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and immeasurably powerful, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means. For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the Dharmakāya.

As in Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous Buddhas throughout the ten directions. In the Mahāsāṃghika &quot;Lokānuvartana Sūtra&quot;, it is stated, &quot;The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions.&quot; It is also stated, &quot;All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma.&quot; The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward Buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot;, which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas.

Guang Xing writes that the &quot;Acchariyābbhūtasutta&quot; of the Majjhima Nikāya along with its Chinese Madhyamāgama parallel is the most ancient source for the Mahāsāṃghika view. The sutra mentions various miracles performed by Buddha Śākyamuni before his birth and after. The Chinese version even calls him Bhagavan, which suggests the idea that the Buddha was already awakened before descending down to earth to be born.

Similarly, the idea that the lifespan of a Buddha is limitless is also based on ancient ideas, such as the &quot;Mahāparinirvānasūtra&#x27;s&quot; statement that the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan is as long as an eon (kalpa) but that he voluntarily allowed his life to end. Another early source for the Mahāsāṃghika view that a Buddha was a transcendent being is the idea of the thirty-two major marks of a Buddha&#x27;s body. Furthermore, the &quot;Simpsapa sutta&quot; states that the Buddha had way more knowledge than what he taught to his disciples. The Mahāsāṃghikas took this further and argued that the Buddha knew the dharmas of innumerable other Buddhas of the ten directions.

==== Buddhahood in Mahāyāna Buddhism ====

Mahāyāna Buddhism generally follows the Mahāsāṃghika ideal of the Buddha being a transcendent and all-knowing (sarvajña) being with unlimited spiritual powers. Guang Xing describes the Buddha in Mahāyāna as an omnipotent and almighty divinity &quot;endowed with numerous supernatural attributes and qualities&quot;. Mahāyāna cosmology also includes innumerable Buddhas who reside in innumerable buddha fields (&quot;buddha kshetra&quot;). The Mahāyāna &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; for example, says the lifespan of the Buddha is immeasurable. It also says that the Buddha actually achieved Buddhahood countless eons (&quot;kalpas&quot;) ago and has already been teaching the Dharma through his numerous manifestations (&quot;nirmana&quot;) for eons.

In spite of this transcendent nature, Mahāyāna also affirms the immanent nature of Buddhahood in all beings (through the doctrine of Buddha-nature, which is seen as something that all beings have). This view of an immanent Buddha essence in all normal human beings is common throughout East Asian Buddhism.

The myriad Buddhas are also seen as active in the world, guiding all sentient beings to Buddhahood. Paul Williams writes that the Buddha in Mahāyāna is &quot;a spiritual king, relating to and caring for the world&quot;. This view entails a kind of docetism regarding the &quot;historical&quot; Buddha, Shakyamuni. His life and death were a &quot;mere appearance,&quot; like a magic show; in reality, the Buddha still exists and is constantly helping living beings.

Because of this transcendental view, Mahāyāna Buddhologies have sometimes been compared to various types of theism (including pantheism) by different scholars. There is disagreement among scholars regarding this issue, as well on the general relationship between Buddhism and theism.

Since Buddhas remain accessible, a Mahāyānist can direct prayers to them, as well as experience visions and revelations from them. This has been very influential in the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism. Furthermore, a Mahāyāna devotee can also aspire to be reborn in a Buddha&#x27;s Pure Land or Buddha field (&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;), where they can strive towards Buddhahood in the best possible conditions. This practice is the central element of East Asian Pure Land Buddhism.

===The Buddha as just a wise human===

Some modern Buddhists have argued that the Buddha was just a human being, albeit a very wise one. This is a common view in Buddhist modernism, which sought to teach a form of Buddhism that was modern, rational and scientific. One figure who sees Buddha as mainly human is Thích Nhất Hạnh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk in the Zen tradition, who states that &quot;Buddha was not a god. He was a human being like you and me, and he suffered just as we do.&quot;

In a similar fashion, Jack Maguire, a Western monk of the Mountains and Rivers Order in New York, writes that Buddha is inspirational based on his humanness:

==Nature of the Buddha==
The various Buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha. All Buddhist traditions hold that a Buddha is fully awakened and has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of craving, aversion and ignorance. A Buddha is no longer bound by saṃsāra, and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life.

Most schools of Buddhism have also held that the Buddha was omniscient. However, the early texts contain explicit repudiations of making this claim of the Buddha.

Mahāyāna buddhology expands the powers of a Buddha exponentially, seeing them as having unlimited lifespan and all-pervasive omniscient wisdom, as omnipotent, and as able to produce an infinite number of magical manifestations (nirmanakayas) as well as being able to produce pure lands (heaven-like realms for bodhisattvas).

=== The classic superknowledges ===
The Early Buddhist texts (and other later sources as well) contain a classic list of &quot;supernormal knowledges&quot; (Skt. &quot;abhijñā&quot;, Pali: &quot;abhiññā&quot;) that a Buddha has attained through spiritual practice.

There is an ancient list of &quot;six classes of superknowledge&quot; (Pali: chalabhiññā, Skt. ṣaḍabhijña) that Buddhas have which are found in various Buddhist sources. These are:

# &quot;Higher powers&quot; (P: &quot;iddhi,&quot; S: &quot;ṛddhi&quot;), such as walking on water and through walls; flight, becoming invisible and creating mind made bodies.
# &quot;Divine ear&quot; (Pali: &quot;dibbasota&quot;), that is, clairaudience which extends in the human realm as well as into the other realms, like the realms of the gods (devas).
# &quot;Mind-penetrating knowledge&quot; (&quot;cetopariyañāa&quot;), that is, telepathy;
# &quot;Remember one&#x27;s former abodes&quot; (&quot;pubbenivāsanussati&quot;), recalling one&#x27;s own past lives stretching back eons into the past.
# &quot;Divine eye&quot; (&quot;dibbacakkhu&quot;), that is, knowing others&#x27; karmic destinations (where they will be reborn); and,
# &quot;Knowledge of the destruction of the mental pollutants&quot; (&quot;āsavakkhaya&quot;), which is the eradication of all negative mental states and the ending of suffering. This knowledge is the &quot;liberation of the mind&quot; (Pali: &quot;cetovimutti&quot;, Skt. &quot;cittavimukti&quot;).

=== Miraculous displays ===

Buddhist texts include numerous stories of the Buddha&#x27;s miracles, which include displays of the &quot;abhiññās,&quot; healings, elemental magic (such as manipulating fire and water), and various other supernatural phenomena, traveling to higher realms of Buddhist cosmology, and others.

One of the most famous of these miracles was the Twin Miracle at Sāvatthī, in which the Buddha emitted fire from the top of his body and water from his lower body simultaneously, before alternating them and then expanding them to illuminate the cosmos.

Mahayana sutras contain even more extensive miracles. In the &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;, the Buddha display the true pure nature of his &quot;buddha field&quot; to everyone on earth, who suddenly beholds the world as a perfect world filled with jewels and other majestic features. Likewise, in the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha shakes the earth and shines a beam of light which illuminates thousands of &quot;buddha-fields&quot;.

===Ten epithets of a Buddha===
Some Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having ten characteristics (Ch./Jp. 十號). These characteristics are frequently mentioned in the Pāli Canon as well as in other early Buddhist sources as well as in Mahayana texts, and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries. The ten epithets are:
# Thus gone, thus come (Skt: &quot;&quot;)
# Worthy one (Skt: &quot;arhat&quot;)
# Perfectly self-enlightened (Skt: &quot;)
# Perfected in knowledge and conduct (Skt: &quot; )
# Well gone (Skt: &quot;sugato&quot;)
# Knower of the world (Skt: &quot;lokavidu&quot;)
# Unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed (Skt: &quot;)
# Teacher of the gods and humans (Skt: &quot;)
# The Enlightened One (Skt: buddha)
# The Blessed One or fortunate one (Skt: &quot;bhagavat&quot;)

The tenth epithet is sometimes listed as &quot;The World Honored Enlightened One&quot; (Skt. &quot;Buddha-Lokanatha&quot;) or &quot;The Blessed Enlightened One&quot; (Skt. &quot;Buddha-Bhagavan&quot;).

=== Acts of a Buddha ===

According to various Buddhist texts, upon reaching Buddhahood each Buddha performs various acts (&quot;buddhacarita&quot;) during his life to complete his duty as a Buddha.

The Mahayana tradition generally follows the list of &quot;Twelve Great Buddha Acts&quot; (Skt. &quot;dvadaśabuddhakārya&quot;). These are:

# A Buddha must descend from Tushita heaven and transfer his throne to the next future Buddha.
# A Buddha must enter his mothers womb.
# A Buddha must be born (generally accompanied by miracles).
# A Buddha must master numerous arts and skills in his youth.
# A Buddha must live in the palace and enjoy his life with his wife.
# A Buddha must make a great departure from his palace and become a renunciant (sramana).
# A Buddha must practice asceticism.
# A Buddha must sit under a buddha tree (like the bodhi tree) on a bodhimanda (place of awakening)
# A Buddha must defeat the demonic forces of Mara.
# A Buddha must attain and manifest full awakening.
# A Buddha must give his first sermon, and thus turn the wheel of the Dharma.
# A Buddha must die and pass into Nirvana, demonstrating liberation and impermanence.

The Pali suttas do not have such a list, but the Theravada commentarial tradition lists 30 obligatory acts of a Buddha.

=== Attributes of a Buddha in Mahāyāna ===

Various Mahayana sutras and treatises contain explanations of the nature of a Buddha and the various attributes which Buddhas are said to have. These attributes are significantly different and more exalted than the way a Buddha is understood in non-Mahayana Buddhism.

Some of the key attributes of Buddhahood in Mahayana buddhology include:

* Triple body (Trikāya): This is the central Mahayana buddhological theory which states that a Buddha has three aspects, or functions (Sanskrit: vṛṭṭis): the &quot;Dharmakāya&quot; (Sanskrit; Dharma body, the ultimate reality, the true nature of all things), the &quot;Sambhogakāya&quot; (the body of self-enjoyment, a blissful divine body with infinite forms and powers) and the &quot;Nirmāṇakāya&quot; (manifestation body, the body which appears in the everyday world and presents the semblance of a human body).
* Eternity and Immutability: In its ultimate aspect (i.e. &quot;Dharmakāya&quot;), Buddhahood is said to be unchanging, non-arising, un-created, eternal, permanent (nitya) and unceasing. Various sources like the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; also indicate the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan (ayus) is also immeasurable or eternal (&quot;ever enduring, never perishing&quot;). Furthermore, in Mahayana, Buddhahood is also understood as timeless, beyond any concept of past, present or future, since any concept of time is a mental construction.
* Beyond thought: A Buddha has no thoughts or ordinary cognition (samjña), he does not plan, conceptualize, think (amanasikāra). His mind is beyond all mental proliferation (nisprapañca). Instead, Buddhahood naturally and spontaneously manifests myriad skillful means to benefit all beings in an automatic manner without any thought or planning. Thus he is said to have a mind which is no-mind (Sanskrit: acitta) or without discrimination (nirvikalpa).
* Wordless Teaching: Various sutras, like the &quot;Tathāgataguhya Sūtra,&quot; state that the Buddha &quot;has never once uttered a single word&quot; since Buddha is always in a state of meditative samadhi. In spite of this, the Buddha manifests innumerable skillful means that magically appears to all sentient beings as various teachings appropriate specifically for them, in whatever language or sound they can understand.
* All-knowing wisdom: Buddha&#x27;s knowledge and wisdom is said to be all-knowing (Sanskrit: sarvajña), i.e. omniscient. This is because a Buddha knows the true nature of all reality as well as all phenomena (dharmas).
* All-pervasive: Sutras like the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; state that Buddha&#x27;s light and wisdom is all pervasive and omnipresent throughout out the cosmos. As such, Buddhahood is present everywhere, including in the minds of all beings as buddha-nature. However, most beings do not detect Buddha&#x27;s presence, because their minds are deluded and clouded over by defilements.
* Measureless Power: Buddha&#x27;s power (anubhāva, adhiṣṭhāna) is said to be immeasurably vast, though not claimed to be omnipotent per se. This power is able to influence and help liberate sentient beings in different ways. Furthermore, the &quot;power of the [Buddha&#x27;s] past vows&quot; (pūrva-praṇidhāna-vaśa) can help living beings who call on the Buddha&#x27;s aid by helping them be reborn in a Pure Land. This idea, also called &quot;other-power&quot;, is central to Pure Land Buddhism.
* Great Compassion: Buddha&#x27;s great compassion (mahākaruṇā) and kindness (maitrī) is universal and embraces all beings in the universe. It is due to this great compassion that the Buddha works to liberate all beings, and will unceasingly continue to manifest immeasurable numbers of emanation bodies (&quot;nirmāṇakāyas&quot;) and skillful means in order to save all beings.
* Skillful Means (Upaya): Buddha&#x27;s compassion and love manifests as Buddha&#x27;s skillful means which take immeasurably many forms. For example, Buddha may appear as a human, any deva, animal, etc. In order to liberate all different types of beings, the Buddha also teaches many paths to awakening (such as the three vehicles), many teachings (such as the three turnings) and many methods of spiritual cultivation.
* Inconceivability: In numerous sources, the Buddha is seen as being inconceivable (acintya), beyond all concepts, indescribable by language, unable to grasped by thought or intellectual understanding. One of the names of the Buddha Amitabha is Acintyaprabha, &quot;Inconceivable Light&quot;.
* Purity: Buddhahood is totally beyond the defilements (kleśa) and thus perfectly pure (viśuddhi), unstained (anāśrava), and undefiled (akleśa). 
* Non-dual: While Buddhahood is said to transcend the suffering of samsara (the conditioned world), it is also not separate from samsara either, and thus is non-dual (advaya) with the world of suffering. This due to the Mahayana doctrine of &quot;non-abiding nirvana&quot; (apratiṣṭhita-nirvana, also &quot;not-fixed&quot; or &quot;non-localized&quot;), which holds that nirvana is not a state of total transcendence separated from the world, but is also able to freely operate in the world of suffering, ecompassing the entire cosmos and being immanent within it.

== Lists of Buddhas ==
=== The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity ===
In the earliest strata of Pali Buddhist texts, especially in the first four Nikayas, only the following seven Buddhas, The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity (&quot;Saptatathāgata&quot;), are explicitly mentioned and named (see for example SN 12.4 to SN 12.10). Four of these are from the current &quot;kalpa&quot; (Pali: kappa, meaning eon or &quot;age&quot;) called the good eon (&quot;bhaddakappa&quot;) and three are from past eons. 
# Vipassī (lived ninety-one &quot;kalpas&quot; ago)
# Sikhī (lived thirty-one &quot;kalpas&quot; ago)
# Vessabhū (lived thirty-one &quot;kalpas&quot; ago in the same &quot;kalpa&quot; as Sikhī)
# Kakusandha (the first Buddha of the current good eon)
# Koṇāgamana (the second Buddha of the current eon)
# Kassapa (the third Buddha of the current eon)
# Gautama (the fourth and present Buddha of the current eon)

One sutta called &quot;Chakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta&quot; from an early Buddhist text called the Digha Nikaya also mentions that following the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, a Buddha named Maitreya is predicted to arise in the world.

However, according to a text in the Theravada Buddhist tradition from a later stratum (between 1st and 2nd century BCE) called the &quot;Buddhavamsa,&quot; twenty-one more Buddhas were added to the list of seven names in the early texts. Theravada tradition maintains that there can be up to five Buddhas in a &quot;kalpa&quot; or world age and that the current &quot;kalpa&quot; has had four Buddhas, with the current Buddha, Gotama, being the fourth and the future Buddha Metteyya being the fifth and final Buddha of the &quot;kalpa&quot;. This would make the current aeon a &quot;bhadrakalpa&quot; (fortunate aeon). In some Sanskrit and northern Buddhist traditions however, a &quot;bhadrakalpa&quot; has up to 1,000 Buddhas, with the Buddhas Gotama and Metteyya also being the fourth and fifth Buddhas of the &quot;kalpa&quot; respectively.

The Koṇāgamana Buddha, is mentioned in a 3rd-century BCE inscription by Ashoka at Nigali Sagar, in today&#x27;s Nepal. There is an Ashoka pillar at the site today. Ashoka&#x27;s inscription in the Brahmi script is on the fragment of the pillar still partly buried in the ground. The inscription made when Emperor Asoka at Nigali Sagar in 249 BCE records his visit, the enlargement of a stupa dedicated to the Kanakamuni Buddha, and the erection of a pillar.

According to Xuanzang, Koṇāgamana&#x27;s relics were held in a stupa in Nigali Sagar, in what is now Kapilvastu District in southern Nepal.

The historical Buddha, Gautama, also called Shakyamuni (&quot;Sage of the Shakyas&quot;), is mentioned epigraphically on the Pillar of Ashoka at Rummindei (Lumbini in modern Nepal). The Brahmi script inscription on the pillar gives evidence that Ashoka, emperor of the Maurya Empire, visited the place in 3rd-century BCE and identified it as the birth-place of the Buddha.

=== The last 28 Buddhas of Theravāda (aṭavīsi Buddha) ===

The Pali literature of the Theravāda tradition includes tales of 28 previous Buddhas. In countries where Theravāda Buddhism is practiced by the majority of people, such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, it is customary for Buddhists to hold elaborate festivals, especially during the fair weather season, paying homage to the last 28 Buddhas described in the &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot;. The &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot; is a text which describes the life of Gautama Buddha and the 27 Buddhas who preceded him, along with the future Metteyya Buddha. The Buddhavamsa is part of the &quot;Khuddaka Nikāya&quot;, which in turn is part of the &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot;. The &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot; is one of three main sections of the &quot;Pāli Canon&quot;.

The first three of these Buddhas—Taṇhaṅkara, Medhaṅkara, and Saraṇaṅkara—lived before the time of Dīpankara Buddha. The fourth Buddha, Dīpankara, is especially important, as he was the Buddha who gave &quot;niyatha vivarana&quot; (prediction of future Buddhahood) to the Brahmin youth who would in the distant future become the bodhisattva Gautama Buddha. After Dīpankara, 25 more noble people (&quot;ariya-puggala&quot;) would attain enlightenment before Gautama, the historical Buddha.

Many Buddhists also pay homage to the future Buddha, Metteyya. According to Buddhist scripture, Metteyya will be a successor of Gautama who will appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure &quot;Dharma&quot;. The prophecy of the arrival of Metteyya is found in the canonical literature of all Buddhist sects (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), and is accepted by most Buddhists as a statement about an event that will take place when the &quot;Dharma&quot; will have been forgotten on &quot;Jambudvipa&quot; (the terrestrial realm, where ordinary human beings live).
== Mahāyāna Buddhas ==

Mahāyāna Buddhists venerate numerous Buddhas that are not found in early Buddhism or in Theravada Buddhism. They are generally seen as living in other realms, known as buddha-fields (Sanskrit: &quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;) or pure lands (Ch: 淨土; p: &quot;Jìngtǔ&quot;) in East Asian Buddhism. They are sometimes called &quot;celestial Buddhas&quot; since they are not from this earth.

Some of the key Mahāyāna Buddhas are:

* Akshobhya (&quot;the Imperturbable&quot;), appears in various sutras like the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra.&quot; His buddha-field is Abhirati (lit. &quot;The Joyous&quot;). 
* Amitābha (Amida Buddha, .&quot;Infinite Light&quot;), the principal Buddha of Pure Land Buddhism. His buddha-field is called Sukhāvatī (&quot;Blissful&quot;).
* Amoghasiddhi (&quot;Infallible Success&quot;)
* Bhaiṣajyaguru (&quot;Medicine guru&quot;) also known as &quot;Medicine Buddha&quot;, the healing Buddha. His pure land is Vaiḍūryanirbhāsa (&quot;Pure Beryl Light&quot;).
* Ratnasambhava (&quot;Jewel Born&quot;)
* Vairocana (&quot;the Illuminator&quot;), a key figure in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot;. He is the central Buddha in Huayan Buddhism, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon. His pure land is known as the Padmagarbhalokadhātu (the lotus treasury world) and also as &quot;Densely Arrayed Akaniṣṭha&quot; (&quot;Ghanavyūhakaniṣṭha&quot;).
* Prabhūtaratna (&quot;Many Treasures&quot;), an ancient Buddha who appears in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;
* Samantabhadra, a Buddha who is mentioned in the &quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra,&quot; which states that the bodhisattva Akṣayamati is said to be from the Buddha field of Samantabhadra.
* Lokeśvararāja, a past Buddha who is mentioned in the &quot;Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life&quot;
* Budai (Jp: Hotei), the fat laughing Buddha, usually seen in China and often mistaken as &quot;the&quot; Buddha in western culture. This figure is believed to be a representation of a medieval Chinese monk who is associated with Maitreya, the future Buddha.
Some Mahāyāna sutras also contain long lists of Buddhas which are used in different ways. One popular list of Buddhas is the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which is found in the &quot;Sutra of the Three Heaps&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Triskandhadharmasutra&quot;). This sutra is popular in Tibetan Buddhist rites of confession.

The &quot;Bhadrakalpikasūtra&quot; contains a list of one thousand and four Buddhas and discusses their deeds. Most of these are Buddhas of the future.

=== In Vajrayana ===
In Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana, Esoteric Buddhism) which includes Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, Shingon, and Nepalese Buddhism, one finds some of the same Mahayana Buddhas along with other strictly tantric Buddha figures that are unique to Vajrayana.

==== Five Tathāgatas ====
There are five primary Buddhas known as the &quot;Five Tathagathas&quot;: Vairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, and Amoghasiddhi. Each is associated with a different consort, direction, aggregate (or, aspect of the personality), emotion, element, color, symbol, and mount.

The Five Tathagatas and some of their associated elements are:

==== Adibuddha ====
There is also the Vajrayana idea of the Adi-Buddha, the &quot;first Buddha&quot; to attain Buddhahood. Variously named as Vajradhara, Samantabhadra and Vairocana, the first Buddha is also associated with the concept of Dharmakaya.

==== Female Buddhas ====
Buddhist Tantra also includes several female Buddhas, such as Tara, the most popular female Buddha in Tibetan Buddhism, who comes in many forms and colors. In several tantric sources, each of the main five Buddhas is paired with a vidyarajñi (wisdom queen) or prajña consort. They are:

* Ākāśadhātvīśvarī (&quot;The Sovereign Lady of the Sphere of Infinite Space&quot;), the prajñā of Vairocana
* Locanā, the prajñā of Akṣobhya
* Māmakī (&quot;Mine-maker&quot;), the prajñā of Ratnasambhava
* Paṇḍāravāsinī (&quot;White Robed One&quot;), the prajñā of Amitabha
* Tārā (&#x27;Star&quot;), sometimes associated with Amoghasiddhi, sometimes Amitabha

There are also feminine counterparts to the Adi-Buddha figure, and both are often depicted in union (yab-yum). As such, in the Nyingma school for example, the Adi-buddha Samantabhadra is paired with a vidya called Samantabhadri, and in Sarma schools, Vajradhara is paired with a supreme female Buddha as well (Prajñaparamita, Vajradhatu Ishvari, or Vajrayogini).

==== Fierce Buddhas ====
In the Buddhist tantras, there are various fierce deities which are tantric forms of the Buddhas. These may be fierce (Tibetan: &quot;trowo&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;krodha&quot;) Buddha forms or semi-fierce, and may appear in sexual union with a female Buddha or as a &quot;solitary hero&quot;. The &quot;Heruka&quot; (Tb. &quot;khrag &#x27;thung&quot;, lit. &quot;blood drinker&quot;) are enlightened masculine beings who adopt fierce forms to help beings. They include Yamāntaka, Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, Mahākāla, and Vajrakīlaya. &quot;Dakini&quot; (Tb. &quot;khandroma&quot;, &quot;sky-goer&quot;) are their feminine counterparts, sometimes depicted with a heruka and sometimes as independent deities. The most prevalent wrathful &quot;dakini&quot; are Vajrayogini, Vajravārāhī, Nairātmyā, and Kurukullā.

During the tantric period, Buddhist mythology overlapped with Hindu mythology. Akshobhya, for example, acquires a fierce Tantric form that is reminiscent of the fierce form of the Hindu god Mahākāla; in this form he became known by the Buddhist names Heruka, Hevajra, or Samvara. He is known in Japan in this guise as &quot;Fudō&quot; (&quot;Imperturbable&quot;). The Hindu god Bhairava, a fierce bull-headed divinity, was adopted by Tantric Buddhists as &quot;Vajrabhairava&quot;. Also called &quot;Yamāntaka&quot; (&quot;Slayer of Death&quot;) and identified as the fierce expression of the gentle Mañjuśrī, he was accorded quasi-Buddha rank.

==== Others ====
Some historical figures are also seen as Buddhas, such as the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, Tibetan historical figures like Padmasambhava, Tsongkhapa and Kukai.

==Depictions of the Buddhas in art==


Buddhas are frequently represented in the form of statues and paintings. Commonly seen postures include:
* The Seated Buddha in the Lotus position
* Buddha seated on a throne
* The Reclining Buddha (usually depicts his final nirvana)
* The Standing Buddha
* A walking Buddha with one step forward
* The emaciated Buddha, which shows Siddhartha Gautama during his extreme ascetic practice of starvation.
* The baby Buddha (usually pointing upwards).

In Theravada Buddhism, the Buddha is always depicted as a monastic shown with hair and he is always shown wearing the simple monk&#x27;s robe (called a kāṣāya). In Mahayana Buddhism, a Buddha is often also depicted with monastic robes, however some Buddhas are also depicted with different forms of clothing, such as princely or kingly attire, which can include crowns and jewels.

It is common to depict the Buddha accompanied by other figures. In Theravada, it is common to have him flanked by his two main disciples, Moggallana and Sariputta. In Mahayana Buddhism, it is more common to have him surrounded by bodhisattvas, like Manjushri, Samantabhadra and Avalokiteshvara.

The Buddha may also be depicted with various accessories, such as a victory banner (dhvaja), a lotus seat, and a begging bowl.

===Special characteristics of a Buddha&#x27;s body===
Most depictions of a Buddha contain a certain number of &quot;marks&quot; (lakṣaṇa), which are considered the signs of his nobility and his enlightenment. The exactly design and style of these features vary regionally but most often they are elements of list of thirty-two physical characteristics of the Buddha called &quot;the signs of a great man&quot; (Skt. mahāpuruṣa lakṣaṇa).

Some of the most obvious features which can be found in many buddha statues include:

* The &quot;uṣṇīṣa,&quot; a protuberance on the top of the head which symbolizes superb wisdom.
* The &quot;ūrṇā&quot;, or ūrṇākośa, a spiral tuft of hair or circular dot between the eyebrows.
* Dharma wheels on the soles of his feet and on his hands
* Other auspicious symbols on his body (such as lotuses, swastikas, endless knots, etc.)
* Long earlobes, symbolizing denoting superb perception
* Unnaturally long arms and long thin fingers
* Golden skin

===Hand-gestures===
The poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as asanas and mudras, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the &quot;Vajra&quot; (or &quot;Chi Ken-in&quot;) mudra, which is popular in Japan and Korea but rarely seen in India. Others are more common; for example, the &quot;Varada&quot; (Wish-Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the &quot;Abhaya&quot; (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.

<text>A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below.

The term &quot;piano trio&quot; is also used for jazz trios, where it most commonly designates a pianist accompanied by bass and drums, though guitar or saxophone may figure as well.

==Form==

Works titled &quot;Piano Trio&quot; tend to be in the same overall shape as a sonata. Initially this was in the three movement form, though some of Haydn&#x27;s have two movements. Mozart, in five late works, is generally credited with transforming the accompanied keyboard sonata, in which the essentially optional cello doubles the bass of the keyboard left hand, into the balanced trio which has since been a central form of chamber music. With the early 19th century, particularly Beethoven, this genre was felt to be more appropriate to cast in the four movement form. Piano trios that are set in the Sonata tradition share the general concerns of such works for their era, and often are reflective directly of symphonic practice with individual movements laid out according to the composer&#x27;s understanding of the sonata form.

In the Classical era, home music-making made the piano trio a very popular genre for arrangements of other works. For example, Beethoven transcribed his first two symphonies for piano trio. Thus a large number of works exist for the arrangement of piano, violin and violoncello which are not generally titled or numbered as piano trios, but which are nonetheless part of the overall genre. These include single movements as well as sets of variations such as Beethoven&#x27;s Variations on &#x27;Ich bin der Schneider Kakadu&#x27; Op. 121a and Variations in E flat major Op. 44.

After the Classical era, works for piano and two instruments continue to be written which are not presented as in the sonata tradition, or are arrangements of other works. Many of these individual works are popular on concert programs, for example Suk&#x27;s Elegie.

For individual articles treating works for piano trio, see :Category:Compositions for piano trio.

==The role of the three instruments==

The piano trios of the Classical era, notably those of Haydn, are dominated by the piano part. The violin plays the melody only a certain amount of the time, and when it does, is often doubled by the piano. The cello part is very much subordinated, usually just doubling the bass line in the piano. It is thought that this practice was related to the sonority of the instruments of Haydn&#x27;s day: the piano was fairly weak and &quot;tinkling&quot; in tone, and benefited from the tonal strengthening of other instruments. Mozart&#x27;s five late (K. 496 and later) trios are generally felt to mark the assured arrival of the form, attentive to balanced voices and three-part dialogue.

Beethoven&#x27;s trios continued the compositional objectives inaugurated by Mozart. The new idea of equality was never implemented completely; the extent to which it is realized varies from one composition to the next, as well as among movements within a single composition. Certainly, by the mid-nineteenth century, all three instruments had been modified to have a very powerful sound, and each can hold its own in a modern ensemble.

The earlier trios are now frequently performed and recorded using authentic instruments, of the kind for which they were originally written. Such performances restore the sonic balance the composer would have expected, and have proven popular.

==Other combinations==
Some rather rare combinations of instruments have nonetheless inspired a few outstanding works.

*Haydn wrote three trios for flute, cello and piano (H. 15/15-17), a combination for which Carl Maria von Weber also wrote one work (op. 63).
*Beethoven wrote his Trio in G major, WoO 37 (1786) for flute, bassoon and piano.
*Mikhail Glinka wrote his &quot;Trio pathétique&quot; in D minor for clarinet, bassoon and piano, although is also performed with a violin or cello substituting the clarinet or the bassoon, respectively.
*Francis Poulenc&#x27;s Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano op. 43 (1926).
*The Horn-violin-piano trio is exemplified by Brahms&#x27; Trio Op. 40 in E flat and György Ligeti&#x27;s 1982 Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano.
*Trios with clarinet include masterpieces such as Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Kegelstatt Trio&quot; and works by Beethoven, Brahms and Bartók; many more works are listed in Clarinet-violin-piano trio, Clarinet-viola-piano trio and Clarinet-cello-piano trio.
*Ignaz Lachner wrote all of his six piano trios for violin, viola and piano.
*The jazz trio formation of saxophone, piano and percussion has been taken up as an alternative &quot;piano trio&quot; in the field of contemporary classical music, initially by Trio Accanto who since 1994 have commissioned more than 100 works for this combination. Several other trios have been formed to perform this repertoire.

<text>The New Zealand electricity market (NZEM) is a decentralised electricity market regulated by the Electricity Industry Participation Code administered by the Electricity Authority (EA). The authority was established in November 2010 to replace the Electricity Commission.

==Overview==
Until 1987, New Zealand had a centrally run system of providers of generation, transmission, distribution, and retailing. Reform has since led to the separation of the monopoly elements from the contestable elements to create competitive markets in energy retailing and generation. Regulation has also been imposed on the natural monopolies of transmission and distribution. 

Since about 2000, the market is split as follows: regulation, administration, generation, market clearing, transmission, distribution, metering and retail.

The wholesale market for electricity operates under the Electricity Industry Participation Code (EIPC), and is overseen by the market regulator, the Electricity Authority. Trade takes place at more than 200 pricing nodes across New Zealand. Generators can make offers to supply electricity at grid injection points, while retailers and some major industrial users make bids to withdraw &quot;offtake&quot; electricity at grid exit points. The market uses a locational marginal pricing auction which takes generators&#x27; offers and retailers&#x27; bids, and computes final prices and quantities at each node. These auctions are held every half-hour for a total of 48 trading periods each day.

In addition to the core wholesale spot market there are two associated markets. A hedge market for CFD financial contracts is operated by the ASX Australian Stock Exchange, and an FTR market for Financial Transmission Rights is operated by Energy Market Services, a business unit of Transpower. These markets are linked to wholesale market prices at select locations, allowing market participants to manage their basis risk.

The Electricity Authority contracts out the services required to run the electricity market. The Reconciliation Manager who reconciles all metered quantities, the Pricing Manager who determines the final prices at each node and Clearing and Settlement Manager who pays generators for their generation at the market clearing price and invoices all retailers for their offtake, are all contracted to New Zealand Exchange (NZX), who acquired the previous service provider M-co in June 2009.

The owner of the national transmission grid is Transpower, a state-owned enterprise. Transpower is also the System Operator, responsible for ensuring real time electricity supply security and quality. Transpower is the market scheduler, predicting demand to help generators make offers, as well as the dispatcher, in charge of matching demand and supply in real time.

Distribution of electricity from the grid exit points to the end consumers&#x27; premises is the responsibility of about 30 distributors, also known as lines companies, who have monopoly control of the lines services on their networks. Ownership of distributors is through trust-owned companies, such as Auckland Energy Consumer Trust, and public companies. Some major industrial users are directly connected to the grid, such as New Zealand Steel and the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter.
There are four major generators: Contact Energy, Genesis Energy, Mercury Energy, Meridian Energy. These four together produce about 90% of New Zealand&#x27;s electricity. Meridian Energy, Genesis Energy and Mercury Energy are 51% majority owned by the New Zealand government, while Contact is a 100% publicly traded company. An important feature of the New Zealand market is that all the major generators also own retailing arms. The companies are thus commonly known as &quot;gentailers&quot; (generator–retailers.) Proceeding 2021 TrustPower was also a gentailer until selling their retail arm to Mercury under the TrustPower brand and re-branding the remaining generation business as Manawa Energy. Manawa is now NZ&#x27;s largest independent electricity generator, representing around 5% of the New Zealand generation capacity.

Retailers purchase electricity from the wholesale market, and on-sell it to consumers. Competition for retail customers varies across the country but since 1999, when full retail competition was introduced, customers have switched at a rate between 9% and 14% per annum. Consumer NZ, with support from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, provides a website called Powerswitch that enables consumers to compare electricity and gas prices from different retailers and to switch suppliers.

MBIE published a useful chronology of reforms up to 2015.

==Wholesale spot market==

Electricity is traded at a wholesale level in a spot market. The market operation is managed by several service providers under agreements with the Electricity Authority. The physical operation of the market is managed by Transpower in its role as system operator.

Generators submit offers through a Wholesale Information and Trading System (WITS). Each offer covers a future half-hour period (called a trading period) and is an offer to generate a specified quantity at that time in return for a nominated price. The System Operator (Transpower) uses a scheduling, pricing and dispatch (SPD) system to rank offers, submitted through WITS, in order of price, and selects the lowest-cost combination of offers from the generators to satisfy demand.

The market pricing principle is known as bid-based security-constrained economic dispatch with nodal prices.

The highest-priced bid offered by a generator required to meet demand for a given half-hour sets the spot price for that trading period.

Electricity spot prices can vary significantly across trading periods, reflecting factors such as changing demand (e.g. lower prices in summer when demand is subdued) and supply (e.g. higher prices when hydro lakes and inflows are below average). Spot prices can also vary significantly across locations, reflecting electrical losses and constraints on the transmission system (e.g. higher prices in locations further from generating stations).

Trades take place at approximately 285 nodes (grid injection points and grid exit points) across New Zealand every half-hour. Generators make offers to supply electricity at 59 grid injection points (GIPs) at power stations, while retailers and major users make bids to buy electricity at 226 grid exit points (GXPs) on the national grid.

Final prices at each node, taking account of grid losses and constraints, are processed and confirmed the following day.

All electricity generated is required to be traded through the central pool, with the exception of small generating stations of less than 10MW. Bilateral and other hedge arrangements are possible, but function as separate financial contracts. Trading develops by bids (purchaser/demand) and offers (generator/supply) for 48 half-hour periods for each pricing nodes on the national grid.

Bids and offers start 36 hours before the actual real-time consumption or trading period. Up to four hours (pre-dispatch) before the trading period starts a new forecast price is calculated to guide participants in the market. From four hours to the start of the trading period every half-hour a dispatch price is calculated and communicated. One hour before the start of the trading period bids and offers can no longer be revised (with some exceptions) and the new prices reflect Transpower&#x27;s adjustments in load forecasts and system availability.

During each half-hour period Transpower publishes a new real-time price every five minutes, and a time-weighted 30-minute average price. The real-time prices are used by some large direct-connect consumers to adapt their demand. The prices are however guidelines only as the final prices are calculated ex-post—normally around 10:00am the following day, unless there are irregularities or disputes. Using the offer prices as established two hours before the trading period and volumes as established during the trading period. Differences between forecast, dispatch, real-time and final prices can be significant.

== Market abuse ==

=== Studies ===
In 2009, the Commerce Commission released a report by Stanford economist Frank Wolak on the ability of the four largest electricity suppliers to exercise unilateral market power in the wholesale electricity market and the economic rents (any payment in excess of the cost of production) that may have resulted. Using empirical industrial organization techniques, Wolak estimates these rents to be $4.3billion over the 7 years he studied when compared with a perfectly competitive market. The methodology he used and the results are also described in a working paper. His report was criticised for aspects of its methodology, with the Electricity Technical Advisory Group (ETAG), Ministry of Economic Development, claiming that there is no evidence of the sustained exercise of market power. The Commerce Commission decided not to act. Rex Ahdar, University of Otago, later opined that competition law in New Zealand is inherently ill-suited to tackling a network industry such as electricity.

An agent-based model (ABM) developed at Auckland University was used to analyse the New Zealand wholesale electricity market. The model suggests considerable market abuse and quantified the combined market rents for 2006 and 2008 to be $2.6billion, when compared with a perfectly competitive market as counterfactual.

In terms of residential electricity prices, a 2015 report found these were twice as high under retail competition.

=== Incidents ===
There have been long-standing concerns about the potential for market abuse under nodal pricing, particularly when the transmission system becomes congested.

Genesis Energy was &quot;net pivotal&quot; north of Hamilton on 26 March 2011. The HVAC network was under scheduled maintenance with 2 of 6 220kV lines out and 3 of 5 110kV lines out, thereby restricting supply from the South Island. Extreme bids by Genesis Energy sent Auckland spot prices to $/MWh (€/MWh), these prices later returned $197/MWh (€125/MWh) – a factor of 117×.
The Electricity Authority declared a UTS (undesirable trading situation) and subsequently dropped the final price to $/MWh (€/MWh). The Electricity Authority decision was challenged and the High Court of New Zealand found in favor of the regulator. In its submission, the Electricity Authority stated that &quot;the high interim prices on 26 March 2011, if they are allowed to become final prices threaten to damage the integrity and reputation of the wholesale market for electricity&quot;.

== History of reform ==
Regulation of the electricity market started in a light-handed fashion but there has been an increasing trend towards more heavy-handed regulation. Light-handed regulation is based on the threat of regulation providing an incentive on companies with market power to exercise self-regulation. The normal regulatory legislation such as the Companies Act, Electricity Act, Resource Management Act 1991, Commerce Act 1986, and Fair Trading Act 1986 provide the framework for regulating normal commercial and environmental transactions.

The government has increased the extent of intervention through the Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998, which forced power companies to divest either their energy or their lines business. The Electricity Amendment Act 2001 led to another round of industry reform concentrating on achieving better governance of the electricity market and tighter control of monopoly functions. The &quot;threat of regulation&quot; was extended to the production of a set of regulations that would be brought into effect if the industry&#x27;s self-regulation did not meet the government&#x27;s criteria.

On 16 May 2003 the result of a referendum by industry participants and customer representatives on a proposed set of self-regulating rules was announced:

* consumers voted 4.4% for the proposal
* traders voted 66.2% for the proposal (traders comprise generating companies and retailers)
* transporters voted 47.4% for the proposal (transporters comprise distributors and Transpower)

As there was not a substantial majority of all classes in favour of the proposal it was not implemented.

The result put paid to the prospect of a multilateral agreement on the governance and operational arrangements for the electricity market. The New Zealand government invoked the regulations already prepared to meet this contingency. The &quot;threat of regulation&quot; had been insufficient to stave off regulation.

On 2 July 2003 a draft set of Electricity Governance Regulations and Rules was issued on behalf of the Minister of Energy by the Electricity Commission Establishment Unit (ECEU). This set was for consultation purposes and after submissions were received and reviewed, a set of regulations and rules was recommended to the Governor-General.

In September 2003 a revised set of draft rules and regulations was issued by the ECEU for submissions by the end of October. The set did not include proposed transmission regulations, which were still being drafted. Also in September the Minister of Energy announced the chair and members of the Electricity Commission. Roy Hemmingway, whose most recent position was chairperson of the Oregon Public Utility Commission in the US, took on the role as chairperson of the commission.

The final set of Electricity Governance Regulations and Rules (excluding rules for transmission) became effective on 1 March 2004. The final chapter of the Electricity Governance Rules, on transmission, was gazetted on 28 April to become effective on 28 May 2004.

A Ministerial Review of Electricity Market Performance was initiated on 1 April 2009 and led by an independent Electricity Technical Advisory Group, appointed by the Minister for Energy and Resources, with assistance from officials from the Ministry of Economic Development. There were 29 recommendations arising from the review.

One of the key recommendations approved by Cabinet was the transfer of ownership and operation of some power stations between Genesis Energy and Meridian Energy in order to increase retailer competition in both islands and to give Genesis a South Island generating base. It was decided that Genesis would receive the Tekapo A and Tekapo B hydroelectric power stations from Meridian, and Meridian would receive the Whirinaki Power Station from the government (although Meridian eventually declined to accept). The transfer of Tekapo A and B was completed on 1 June 2011.

On 1 November 2010, the Electricity Authority commenced operations, taking over from the Electricity Commission.

In April 2013, the Labour Party and the Green Party said if they were to win the 2014 election, they would introduce a single buyer for electricity, in order to cut retail costs. The government responded by calling it &quot;economic vandalism&quot;, comparing it to the Soviet Union, but Greens co-leader Russel Norman said it would boost the economy and create jobs. By the following day, shares in privately owned power company Contact Energy had fallen by more than 10 percent. The general election held on 20 September 2014 was won by the National Party. Share prices of listed electricity companies rose significantly when the share market opened on the Monday following the election.

===Milestones in the reform process===

== Current structure ==
The New Zealand electricity market is split into the following areas: administration and market clearing, regulation, generation, transmission, distribution and retailing.

The current legislation (Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998) prevents the ownership of cross-sector investment (that is energy and lines functions). This means a generation company cannot own or have an interest in a distribution company and a distribution company cannot retail electricity or deal in electricity hedges. There are two exceptions to the regulations: generation companies can own the lines required to transport electricity from their power stations to the grid or local distribution network; and distribution companies can own a small amount of conventional generation capacity within their network but are not limited in the level of renewable generation capacity. There is no barrier to vertical integration from generation to retail. The overall arrangement of the industry creates some very interesting market behaviour amongst the players.

Generation is dominated by five companies: Contact Energy, Genesis Energy, Mercury Energy, Meridian Energy, and Trustpower.

=== Retail companies ===
The retailers are: Contact Energy, Ecotricity, Electra Energy, Electric Kiwi, Energy Direct, Energy Online, Flick Electric, Genesis Energy, Giving Energy, GLOBUG, King Country Energy, , Mercury Energy, Meridian Energy, Nova Energy, Opunake Hydro, Paua to the People, Payless Energy, Powershop, Pulse Energy, Tiny Mighty Power and Trustpower.

Many of the retailers are owned by generating companies. For example, Mercury Energy owns GLOBUG and Tiny Mighty Power. Some retailers are restricted to certain geographical locations, such as King Country Energy which supplies to the King Country region of the Waikato.

===Generation companies===
The electricity sector in New Zealand is dominated by five generators, which are Contact Energy, Genesis Energy, Mercury Energy, Meridian Energy, and Trustpower. These are all active in generation, the wholesale market and retail sales of electricity. Between these five companies they produce or control more than 95% of NZ&#x27;s total electricity generation.

All of these five companies are listed and traded on the NZX stock exchange. The New Zealand government has 51% ownership of Genesis, Mercury, and Meridian. Contact is also traded on the ASX Australian exchange.

There are a number of smaller companies in the electricity generation industry including WEL Networks, NZ Windfarms, NZ Energy, MainPower, Pioneer and Top Energy.

The retail space is dominated by the five generating companies. The generation and retail companies use this vertical integration as a natural hedge to manage risks associated with volatility of the spot market. For example, during a dry year, the high prices in the wholesale market price benefit the generation arm but hurts the retailers who buy at wholesale prices and sell electricity to consumers at fixed prices; when prices are low, the loss of profits in the generation side is offset by the profits in the retail business.

These five companies have now extended their risk management strategy further by aligning their retail and generation businesses to the same geographic locations. For example, the majority of Meridian Energy&#x27;s generation assets are in the South Island, and that&#x27;s where their retail strongholds are. Mercury Energy&#x27;s generation assets are exclusively in the North Island, and its customer base is also primarily in the North Island.

<doc id="174995" wikidata="Q13788" url="?curid=174995" title="Japanese calendar">
<text>Japanese calendar types have included a range of official and unofficial systems. At present, Japan uses the Gregorian calendar together with year designations stating the year of the reign of the current Emperor. The written form starts with the year, then the month and finally the day, coinciding with the ISO 8601 standard.

For example, February 16, 2003, can be written as either or (the latter following the regnal year system). reads and means &quot;year&quot;, reads and means &quot;month&quot;, and finally (usually) reads (its pronunciation depends on the number that precedes it, see below) and means &quot;day&quot;.

Prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1873, the reference calendar was based on the lunisolar Chinese calendar.

==History==

Over the centuries, Japan has used up to four systems for designating years: the Chinese sexagenary cycle, the system, the Japanese imperial year ( or ) and the system. In the 21st century, however, the era system (&quot;gengō&quot;) and Western system (&quot;seireki&quot;) are the only ones still widely used.

===Chinese Calendar===

The lunisolar Chinese calendar was introduced to Japan via Korea in the middle of the sixth century. After that, Japan calculated its calendar using various Chinese calendar procedures, and from 1685, using Japanese variations of the Chinese procedures. Its sexagenary cycle was often used together with era names, as in the 1729 Ise calendar shown above, which is for &quot;the 14th year of Kyōhō, tsuchi-no-to no tori&quot;, i.e., .

In modern times, the old Chinese calendar is virtually ignored; celebrations of the Lunar New Year are thus limited to Chinese and other Asian immigrant communities. However, its influence can still be felt in the idea of &quot;lucky and unlucky days&quot; (described below), the traditional meanings behind the name of each month, and other features of modern Japanese calendars.

===Era Names (&quot;gengō&quot;)===

The system was also introduced from China, and has been in continuous use since AD 701. The reigning Emperor chooses the name associated with their regnal eras; before 1868, multiple names were chosen throughout the same emperor&#x27;s rule, such as to commemorate a major event. For instance, the Emperor Kōmei&#x27;s reign (1846–1867) was split into seven eras, one of which lasted only one year. Starting with Kōmei&#x27;s son the Emperor Meiji in 1868, there has only been one &quot;gengō&quot; per emperor representing their entire reign.

The &quot;nengō&quot; system remains in wide use, especially on official documents and government forms. It is also in general use in private and personal business.

The present era, Reiwa, formally began on 1 May 2019. The name of the new era was announced by the Japanese government on 1 April 2019, a month prior to Naruhito&#x27;s accession to the throne. The previous era, Heisei, came to an end on 30 April 2019, after Japan&#x27;s former emperor, Akihito, abdicated the throne. Reiwa is the first era name whose characters come from a Japanese root source; prior eras&#x27; names were taken from Chinese classic literature.

===Japanese Imperial Years (&quot;kōki&quot; or &quot;kigen&quot;)===

The Japanese imperial year ( or ) is based on the date of the legendary founding of Japan by Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC. For instance, 660 BC is counted as &quot;Kōki&quot; 1.

It was first used in the official calendar in 1873. &quot;Kōki&quot; 2600 (1940) was a special year. The 1940 Summer Olympics and Tokyo Expo were planned as anniversary events, but were canceled due to the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese naval Zero Fighter was named after this year. After the Second World War, the United States occupied Japan, and stopped the use of &quot;kōki&quot; by officials.

Today, &quot;kōki&quot; is rarely used, except in some judicial contexts. Usage of &quot;kōki&quot; dating can be a nationalist signal, pointing out that the history of Japan&#x27;s imperial family is longer than that of Christianity, the basis of the Anno Domini (AD) system.

The 1898 law determining the placement of leap years is officially based on the &quot;kōki&quot; years, using a formula that is effectively equivalent to that of the Gregorian calendar: if the &quot;kōki&quot; year number is evenly divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless the number minus 660 is evenly divisible by 100 and not by 400. Thus, for example, the year &quot;Kōki&quot; 2560 (AD 1900) is divisible by 4; but 2560 − 660 = 1900, which is evenly divisible by 100 and not by 400, so &quot;kōki&quot; 2560 (1900) was not a leap year, just as in most of the rest of the world.

===Gregorian Calendar (&quot;seireki&quot;)===

The system, based on the solar Gregorian calendar, was first introduced in 1873 as part of the Japan&#x27;s Meiji period modernization.

Nowadays, Japanese people know it as well as the regnal eras.

==Divisions of time==

===Seasons===

There are four seasons corresponding to the West&#x27;s:

However, there is also a traditional system of , consisting of each divided into three sets of five days, and with specially-named days or indicating the start and end of each. This system was adapted from the Chinese in 1685 by court astronomer Shibukawa Shunkai, rewriting the names to better match the local climate and nature in his native Japan. Each &quot;kō&quot; has traditional customs, festivals, foods, flowers and birds associated with it:

====The 24 sekki====

====&quot;Zassetsu&quot;====
 is a collective term for special seasonal days within the 24 &quot;sekki&quot;.

&quot;Shanichi&quot; dates can vary by as much as 5 days.
&quot;Chūgen&quot; has a fixed day. All other days can vary by one day.

Many &quot;zassetsu&quot; days occur in multiple seasons:
* refers to the 18 days before each season, especially the one before fall which is known as the hottest period of a year.
* is the seven middle days of spring and autumn, with &quot;Shunbun&quot; at the middle of the seven days for spring, &quot;Shūbun&quot; for fall.
* is the day closest to &quot;Shunbun&quot; (middle of spring) or &quot;Shūbun&quot; (middle of fall), which can be as much as 5 days before to 4 days after &quot;Shunbun&quot;/&quot;Shūbun&quot;.

The term originally referred to the eves of , , , and ; however, it now only refers to the day before .

===Months===

As mentioned above, the Japanese calendar used to be based on an adaptation of the Chinese lunar calendar, which begins 3 to 7 weeks later than the Gregorian. In other words, the Gregorian &quot;first month&quot; and the Chinese &quot;first month&quot; do not align, which is important in historical contexts.

The &quot;traditional names&quot; for each month, shown below, are still used by some in fields such as poetry; of the twelve, &quot;Shiwasu&quot; is still widely used today. The opening paragraph of a letter or the greeting in a speech might borrow one of these names to convey a sense of the season. Some, such as &quot;Yayoi&quot; and &quot;Satsuki&quot;, do double duty as given names (for women). These month names also appear from time to time on &quot;jidaigeki&quot;, contemporary television shows and movies set in the Edo period or earlier.

The Japanese names for the modern Gregorian months literally translate to &quot;first month&quot;, &quot;second month&quot;, and so on. The corresponding number is combined with the suffix . The table below uses traditional numerals, but the use of Western numerals (, , , etc.) is common.

===Division of the Month===

====Week====

Japan uses a seven-day week, aligned with the Western calendar. The seven-day week, with names for the days corresponding to the Latin system, was brought to Japan around AD 800 with the Buddhist calendar. The system was used for astrological purposes and little else until 1876.

Much like in multiple European languages, in which the names for weekdays are, partially or fully, based on what the Ancient Romans considered the seven visible planets, meaning the five visible planets and the sun and the moon, in The Far East the five visible planets are named after the five Chinese elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth.) On the origin of the names of the days of the week, also see East Asian Seven Luminaries.

Sunday and Saturday are regarded as &quot;Western style take-a-rest days&quot;. Since the late 19th century, Sunday has been regarded as a &quot;full-time holiday&quot;, and Saturday a . These days have no religious meaning (except those who believe in Christianity or Judaism). Many Japanese retailers do not close on Saturdays or Sundays, because many office workers and their families are expected to visit the shops during the weekend. Sunday is traditionally the first day of the week.

====10-Days (&quot;jun&quot;)====

Japanese people also use 10-day periods called . Each month is divided into two 10-day periods and a third with the remaining 8 to 11 days:
* The first (from the 1st to the 10th) is 
* The second (from the 11th to the 20th), 
* The last (from the 21st to the end of the month), .

These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, &quot;the temperatures are typical of the &quot;jōjun&quot; of April&quot;; &quot;a vote on a bill is expected during the &quot;gejun&quot; of this month.&quot; The magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; was originally published once every &quot;jun&quot; (i.e. three times a month).

===Days===

The table below shows dates written with traditional numerals, but use of Arabic numerals (, , , etc.) is extremely common in everyday communication, almost the norm.

Each day of the month has a semi-systematic name. The days generally use &quot;kun&quot; (native Japanese) numeral readings up to ten, and thereafter &quot;on&quot; (Chinese-derived) readings, but there are some irregularities.

&quot;Tsuitachi&quot; is a worn-down form of , literally &quot;month start.&quot; The last day of the month was called &quot;tsugomori&quot;, which means &quot;Moon hidden.&quot; This classical word comes from the tradition of the lunisolar calendar.

The 30th was also traditionally called &quot;misoka&quot;, just as the 20th is called &quot;hatsuka&quot;. Nowadays, the terms for the numbers 28–31 plus &quot;nichi&quot; are much more common. However, &quot;misoka&quot; is much used in contracts, etc., specifying that a payment should be made on or by the last day of the month, whatever the number is. New Year&#x27;s Eve is known as , and that term is still in use.

As mentioned below, there is traditional belief that some days are lucky (&quot;kichijitsu&quot;) or unlucky. For example, there are some who will avoid beginning something on an unlucky day.

==Holidays and other notable days==

===April 1===
The first day of April has broad significance in Japan. It marks the beginning of the government&#x27;s fiscal year. Many corporations follow suit. In addition, corporations often form or merge on that date. In recent years, municipalities have preferred it for mergers. On this date, many new employees begin their jobs, and it is the start of many real-estate leases. The school year begins on April 1.

===&quot;Rokuyō&quot;===
The are a series of six days calculated from the date of Chinese calendar that supposedly predict whether there will be good or bad fortune during that day. The &quot;rokuyō&quot; are commonly found on Japanese calendars and are often used to plan weddings and funerals, though most people ignore them in ordinary life. The &quot;rokuyō&quot; are also known as the . In order, they are:

The &quot;rokuyō&quot; days are easily calculated from the Japanese lunisolar calendar. The first day of the first month is always &quot;senshō&quot;, with the days following in the order given above until the end of the month. Thus, the 2nd day is &quot;tomobiki&quot;, the 3rd is &quot;senbu&quot;, and so on. The 1st day of the 2nd month restarts the sequence at &quot;tomobiki&quot;. The 3rd month restarts at &quot;senbu&quot;, and so on for each month. The latter six months repeat the patterns of the first six, so the 1st of the 7th is &quot;senshō&quot;, the 1st of the 12th is &quot;shakkō&quot; and the moon-viewing day on the 15th of the 8th is always &quot;butsumetsu&quot;. 

This system did not become popular in Japan until the end of the Edo period.

===National Holidays===
After World War II, the names of Japanese national holidays were completely changed because of the secular state principle (Article 20, The Constitution of Japan). Although many of them actually originated from Shinto, Buddhism and important events relating to the Japanese imperial family, it is not easy to understand the original meanings from the superficial and vague official names.

Notes: Single days between two national holidays are taken as a bank holiday. This applies to May 4, which is a holiday each year. When a national holiday falls on a Sunday the next day that is not a holiday (usually a Monday) is taken as a holiday.

==== Timeline of Creation of and Changes to National Holidays ====

* 1948: The following national holidays were introduced in the : New Year&#x27;s Day, Coming-of-Age Day, Constitution Memorial Day, Children&#x27;s Day, Autumnal Equinox Day, Culture Day, and Labor Thanksgiving Day.
* 1966: A supplementary provision to create Health and Sports Day was introduced in memory of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Vernal Equinox Day, National Foundation Day and Respect for the Aged Day were also introduced.
* 1985: Reform to the national holiday law made days like May 4, sandwiched between two other national holidays, a . 
* 1989: After the Shōwa Emperor died on January 7, his birthday, April 29, was renamed &quot;Greenery Day&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (observed as a national holiday since 1868) moved to December 23 for the succeeding Akihito.
* 1995: Reform to the national holiday law added Marine Day, to be celebrated July 20.
* 2000, 2003: moved several holidays to Monday. Starting with 2000: Coming-of-Age Day (formerly January 15, now the second Monday in January) and Health and Sports Day (formerly October 10, now the second Monday in October). Starting with 2003: Marine Day (formerly July 20, now the third Monday in July) and Respect for the Aged Day (formerly September 15, now the third Monday in September).
* 2005, 2007: April 29 was renamed Shōwa Day, and May 4, previously a , became the new Greenery Day.
* 2014: Mountain Day was established as a new holiday, to be observed starting 2016
* 2019: Akihito&#x27;s birthday is December 23; however, he abdicated April 30, 2019, in favor of his son Naruhito, which moved the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Birthday&quot; holiday to February 23. Because the transition happened before Akihito&#x27;s birthday but after Naruhito&#x27;s, the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Birthday&quot; holiday was not celebrated that year.
* 2020: The speech given by Naruhito during the New Year was the first given since 2017, when Akihito halted the practice to reduce his workload.
* 2021, 2022: Because of the COVID-19 crisis, Naruhito&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s greetings were delivered via a televised speech instead of in-person.
* 2023: The imperial family&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s greetings were held publicly for the first time in three years. The Emperor&#x27;s Birthday on February 23 will also be the first time public celebrations will be held for the occasion since Naruhito&#x27;s ascension in 2019. The latter events in 2020, 2021 and 2022 had all been cancelled due to concerns over COVID-19.

===Seasonal Festivals===
The following are known as the , also known as . The &quot;sekku&quot; were made official holidays during Edo period on Chinese lunisolar calendar. The dates of these festivals are confused nowadays; some on the Gregorian calendar, others on &quot;&quot;Tsuki-okure&quot;.

# 7th day of the 1st month: , held on 7 January 
# 3rd day of the 3rd month: , held on 3 March or 3 April depending on the area
# 5th day of the 5th month: : mostly held on 5 May
#* Boys&#x27; Day. Overlaps with the national holiday Children&#x27;s Day.
# 7th day of the 7th month: , held on 7 July in many areas, but in northern Japan held on 7 August (e.g. in Sendai)
# 9th day of the 9th month: , almost out of vogue today

Not &quot;sekku&quot;:
* January 1: Japanese New Year
* August 15: Obon – the date is &quot;Tsuki-okure&quot;&quot;. In central Tokyo, Obon is held on July 15 (the local culture of Tokyo tends to dislike &quot;Tsuki-okure&quot; custom)
* December 31: Ōmisoka

== Customary issues in modern Japan ==

=== Gregorian months and the &quot;One-Month Delay&quot;===
In contrast to other East Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, Korea and Mongolia, Japan has almost completely forgotten the Chinese calendar. Since 1876, January has been officially regarded as the &quot;first month&quot; even when setting the date of Japanese traditional folklore events (other months are the same: February as the second month, March as the third, and so on). But this system often brings a strong seasonal sense of gap since the event is 3 to 7 weeks earlier than in the traditional calendar. Modern Japanese culture has invented a kind of &quot;compromised&quot; way of setting dates for festivals called &quot;Tsuki-okure&quot; (&quot;One-Month Delay&quot;) or &quot;Chūreki&quot; (&quot;The Eclectic Calendar&quot;).
The festival is celebrated just one solar calendar month later than the date on the Gregorian calendar. For example, the Buddhist festival of Obon was the 15th day of the 7th month. In many places the religious services are held on 15 July. However, in some areas, the rites are normally held on 15 August, which is more seasonally close to the old calendar. (The general term &quot;Obon holiday&quot; always refers to the middle of August.) Although this is just de facto and customary, it is broadly used when setting the dates of many folklore events and religious festivals. But Japanese New Year is the great exception. The date of Japanese New Year is always 1 January.

<text>A light-on-dark color scheme, better known as dark mode, dark theme or night mode, is a color scheme that uses light-colored text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background. It is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design. Many modern websites and operating systems offer the user an optional light-on-dark display mode.

Some users find dark mode displays more visually appealing, and claim that it can reduce eye strain. Displaying white at full brightness uses roughly six times as much power as pure black on a 2016 Google Pixel, which has an OLED display. However, conventional LED displays cannot benefit from reduced power consumption. Most modern operating systems support an optional light-on-dark color scheme.

== History ==

Predecessors of modern computer screens, such as cathode-ray oscillographs, oscilloscopes, etc., tended to plot graphs and introduce other content as glowing traces on a black background.

With the introduction of computer screens, originally user interfaces were formed on cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) like those used for oscillographs or oscilloscopes. The phosphor was normally a very dark color, and lit up brightly when the electron beam hit it, appearing to be white, green, blue, or amber on a black background, depending on phosphors applied on a monochrome screen. RGB screens continued to operate similarly, using all the beams set to &quot;on&quot; to form white.

With the advent of teletext, research was done into which primary and secondary light colors and combinations worked best for this new medium. Cyan or yellow on black was typically found to be optimal from a palette of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

The opposite color set, a dark-on-light color scheme (light mode or light theme), was originally introduced in WYSIWYG word processors to simulate ink on paper, and became the norm.

Microsoft introduced a dark theme in the Anniversary Update of Windows 10 in 2016. In 2018, Apple followed in macOS Mojave. In September 2019, iOS 13 and Android 10 both introduced dark modes. Some operating systems provide tools to change the dark mode state automatically at sundown or sunrise.

Firefox and Chromium have optional dark theme for all internal screens. It will also be possible for third-party developers to implement their own dark themes. There are also a variety of browser add-ons that can re-theme web sites with dark color schemes, also aligning with system theme.

In 2019, a &quot;prefers-color-scheme&quot; option was created for front-end web developers, being a CSS property that signals a user&#x27;s choice for their system to use a light or dark color theme.

In July 2024, Wikipedia&#x27;s mobile website received a dark mode. The desktop website later received a dark mode as well.

== Energy usage ==
Light on dark color schemes require less energy to display on OLED displays. This positively impacts battery life and reduces energy consumption.

While an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, it can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site. This can lead to reduced battery life and higher energy usage unless a light-on-dark color scheme is used. The long-term reduced power usage may also prolong battery life or the useful life of the display and battery. 

The energy savings that can be achieved using a light-on-dark color scheme are because of how OLED screens work: in an OLED screen, each subpixel generates its own light and it only consumes power when generating light. This is in contrast to how an LCD works: in an LCD, subpixels either block or allow light from an always-on (lit) LED backlight to pass through.

&quot;AMOLED Black&quot; color schemes (that use pure black instead of dark gray) do not necessarily save more energy than other light-on-dark color schemes that use dark gray instead of black, as the power consumption on an AMOLED screen decreases proportionately to the average brightness of the displayed pixels. Although it is true that AMOLED black does save more energy than dark gray, the additional energy savings are often negligible; AMOLED black will only give an additional energy saving of less than 1%, for instance, over the dark gray that&#x27;s used in the dark theme for Google&#x27;s official Android apps. In November 2018, Google confirmed that dark mode on Android saved battery life.

== Issues with the web ==
Some argue that a color scheme with light text on a dark background is easier to read on the screen, because the lower overall brightness causes less eyestrain. Others argue to the contrary. Some pages on the web are designed for white backgrounds; Image assets (GIF, PNG, SVG, WOFF, etc) can be used improperly causing visual artifacts if dark mode is forced (instead of designed for) with a plugin like Dark Reader.

There is a codice_1 media feature on CSS, to detect if the user has requested light or dark color scheme and serve the requested color scheme. It can be indicated from the user&#x27;s operating system preference or a user agent.

CSS example:

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
 body {
 color: #ccc;
 background: #222;
}
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: light-dark(#fff, #333); color: light-dark(#333, #fff);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

JavaScript example:

if (window.matchMedia(&#x27;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#x27;).matches) {
 dark();

<text>The Specials, also known as The Special AKA, were an English 2 tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of Terry Hall and Neville Staple on vocals, Jerry Dammers on keyboards, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horns. The band wore mod-style &quot;1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits and loafers)&quot;. Their music combines the danceable rhythms of ska and rocksteady with the energy and attitude of punk. Lyrically, their work (often written by primary songwriter Dammers) presented overt political and social commentary.

In 1980, their &quot;The Special AKA Live!&quot; EP, featuring lead track &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot;, reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1981, the recession-themed single &quot;Ghost Town&quot; also hit No. 1 in the UK.

After seven consecutive UK top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form Fun Boy Three. Continuing as &quot;The Special AKA&quot; (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material until 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;. After this, founder Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism.

The group re-formed in 1993, and continued to perform and record with varying line-ups – none of them involving Dammers – until the death of Terry Hall in December 2022.

==Career==
===Founding and early years (1977–1978)===
The group was formed in 1977 by songwriter/keyboardist Dammers, vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist Lynval Golding, drummer Silverton Hutchinson and bassist Horace Panter (Sir Horace Gentleman). Strickland was replaced by Terry Hall shortly after the band&#x27;s formation. The band was first called the Automatics, then the Coventry Automatics. Guitarist Roddy Byers (usually known as Roddy Radiation) agreed to join the band in March 1978 ahead of a recording session of demos. 

The new line-up changed their name to the Special A.K.A. The Automatics after another band called the Automatics signed a record deal with Island Records. The new name was a bit of a mouthful and was shortened to the Special AKA. The name Special AKA soon evolved into the Specials – the moniker that would be used for most of the band&#x27;s career. 

Joe Strummer of the Clash had attended one of their concerts, and invited the Special AKA to open for his band in their &quot;On Parole&quot; UK tour. This performance gave the Special AKA a new level of national exposure, and they briefly shared the Clash&#x27;s management. During the tour Neville Staple, who was initially one of the roadies, became a full member of The Specials when his version of &quot;Monkey Man&quot; was incorporated into the group&#x27;s set. 

The Specials began at the same time as Rock Against Racism, which was first organised in 1978. According to Dammers, anti-racism was intrinsic to the formation of the Specials, in that the band was formed with the goal of integrating black and white people. Many years later Dammers stated that &quot;Music gets political when there are new ideas in music... punk was innovative, so was ska, and that was why bands such as the Specials and the Clash could be political&quot;.

===Ascendancy of the Specials (1979–1981)===
In 1979, shortly after drummer Hutchinson left the band to be replaced by John Bradbury, Dammers formed the 2 Tone Records label and released the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Gangsters&quot;, a reworking of Prince Buster&#x27;s &quot;Al Capone&quot;. &quot;The Selecter&quot; by The Selecter appeared on the B-side. The fledgling 2 Tone records released Gangsters / The Selecter in a completely independent do-it-yourself operation. After initial good sales, Rough Trade then agreed to repress and distribute the single through its independent distribution network. In May 1979, John Peel played the record on his influential late night BBC Radio One show. The record became a Top 10 hit that summer. 

Following the release and early success of &quot;Gangsters&quot;, major record labels lined up with offers to sign the Specials. The aim of the Specials was not only to secure a record deal for the group but to get an agreement that would establish 2 Tone as an independent sub-label. The plan was for 2 Tone to put out singles by non-signed bands who would not be held to any contract. Chrysalis agreed to the terms that would establish 2 Tone as a viable independent label and the Specials would get the backing of a major record company. 

The band had begun wearing mod/rude boy/skinhead-style two-tone tonic suits, along with other elements of late 1960s teen fashions. Changing their name to the Specials, they recorded their eponymous debut album in 1979, produced by Elvis Costello. Horn players Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez were featured on the album, but would not be official members of the Specials until their second album.

&quot;The Specials&quot; led off with Dandy Livingstone&#x27;s &quot;Rudy, A Message to You&quot; (slightly altering the title to &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot;) and also had covers of Prince Buster and Toots &amp; the Maytals songs from the late 1960s. In 1980, the EP &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot; (predominantly credited to the Special A.K.A.) was a No. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart, despite controversy over the song&#x27;s lyrics, which reference teen pregnancy and promote contraception.

Reverting once again to the name of the Specials, the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;More Specials&quot;, was not as commercially successful and was recorded at a time when, according to Hall, conflicts had developed in the band. Female backing vocalists on the Specials&#x27; first two studio albums included Chrissie Hynde, Rhoda Dakar (then of the Bodysnatchers and later of the Special AKA), and Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go&#x27;s. In the first few months of 1981, the band took a break from recording and touring, and then released &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, a non-album single, which hit No. 1 in 1981. At their &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; recording of the song, however, Staple, Hall and Golding announced they were leaving the band. Golding later said: &quot;We didn&#x27;t talk to the rest of the guys. We couldn&#x27;t even stay in the same dressing room. We couldn&#x27;t even look at each other. We stopped communicating. You only realise what a genius Jerry was years later. At the time, we were on a different planet.&quot; Shortly afterwards, the three left the band to form Fun Boy Three.

===Band split, rebirth as the Special AKA (1982–1984)===
For the next few years, the group was in a seemingly constant state of flux. Adding Dakar to the permanent line-up, the group recorded &quot;The Boiler&quot; with Dakar on vocals, Dammers on keyboards, Bradbury on drums, John Shipley (from the Swinging Cats) on guitar, Cuthell on brass and Nicky Summers on bass. The single was credited to &quot;Rhoda with the Special AKA&quot;. The track describes an incident of date rape, and its frank and harrowing depiction of the matter meant that airplay was severely limited. Nevertheless, it managed to reach No. 35 on the UK charts, and American writer Dave Marsh later identified &quot;The Boiler&quot; as one of the 1,001 best &quot;rock and soul&quot; singles of all time in his book &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul&quot;.

After going on tour with Rodriguez, the band (without Dakar, and as &quot;Rico and the Special AKA&quot;) also recorded the non-charting (and non-album) single &quot;Jungle Music&quot;. The line-up for the single was Rodriguez (vocal, trombone), Cuthell (cornets), Dammers (keyboards), Bradbury (drums), Shipley (guitar), returning bassist Panter, and new additions Satch Dickson and Groco (percussion) and Anthony Wymshurst (guitar).

Rodriguez and the three newcomers were all dropped for the next single, &quot;War Crimes&quot;, which brought back Dakar and added new co-vocalists Egidio Newton and Stan Campbell, as well as violinist Nick Parker. Follow-up single &quot;Racist Friend&quot; was a minor hit (UK No. 60), with the band establishing themselves as a septet: Dakar, Newton, Campbell, Bradbury, Cuthell, Dammers and Shipley.

The new line-up (still known as the Special AKA) finally issued a new full-length album &quot;In the Studio&quot; in 1984. Officially, the band was now a sextet: Dakar, Campbell, Bradbury, Dammers, Shipley and new bassist Gary McManus. Cuthell, Newton, Panter and Radiation all appeared on the album as guests; as did saxophonist Nigel Reeve, and Claudia Fontaine and Caron Wheeler of the vocal trio Afrodiziak. Both critically and commercially, &quot;In The Studio&quot; was less successful than previous efforts, although the 1984 single &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot; was a No. 9 UK hit. The latter contributed to making Mandela&#x27;s imprisonment a cause célèbre in the UK, and became popular with anti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Dammers then dissolved the band and pursued political activism.

==Later developments==

Following the break-up of the original line-up, various members of the band performed in other bands and reformed several times to tour and record in Specials-related projects. However, there was never a complete reunion of the original line-up.

After their departure from the Specials, Golding, Hall and Staple founded the pop band Fun Boy Three and enjoyed commercial success from 1981 to 1983 with hits such as &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot;, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; and &quot;The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)&quot;. The group ended with Hall&#x27;s sudden departure, leading to a 15-year rift with Staple.

After Fun Boy Three, Staple and Golding joined Pauline Black of the Selecter in the short-lived band Sunday Best, releasing the single &quot;Pirates on the Airwaves&quot;.

In 1990, Bradbury, Golding, Panter and Staple teamed up with members of the Beat to form Special Beat, performing the music of the two bands and other ska and Two Tone classics. The group, undergoing many line-up changes, toured and released several live recordings through the 1990s.

A 1994 single credited to &quot;X Specials&quot; featured Staple, Golding, Radiation, and Panter. A cover of the Slade song &quot;Coz I Luv You&quot;, the project was produced by Slade&#x27;s Jim Lea.

Moving into production and management, Staple &quot;discovered&quot; and produced bhangra pop fusion artist Johnny Zee. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Staple would stay active producing and guesting with a variety of artists, including International Beat, Special Beat, Unwritten Law, Desorden Público, the Planet Smashers and others, as well as leading his own bands and starting the Rude Wear clothing line. He sang with the 1990s Specials line-up, and again from 2009 to 2012.

Panter went on to join with members of the Beat and Dexys Midnight Runners to form General Public, and then Special Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials before training as a primary school teacher at the University of Central England in Birmingham. He continued to play with latter-day Special Neol Davies in the blues outfit Box of Blues. However, he rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion and continued as a member until the group came to an end in December 2022.

Golding teamed up with Dammers for a brief spell of club DJing, and then worked with Coventry band After Tonight. After Special Beat, he went on to lead the Seattle-based ska groups Stiff Upper Lip, and more recently, Pama International, as well as many collaborations with other ska bands. He has also toured with the Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up, but left in 2000. He rejoined in 2009, and remained with the group until its end in 2022.

Radiation fronted and worked with numerous artists including the Tearjerkers (a band that he had begun in the last months of the Specials), the Bonediggers, the Raiders and Three Men &amp; Black (including Jean-Jacques Burnel of the Stranglers), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Pauline Black, Bruce Foxton (the Jam), Dave Wakeling (the Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK). He also fronts the Skabilly Rebels, a band that mixes rockabilly with ska. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up and again in 2009, continuing to 2014.

Bradbury continued through the Special AKA era, then formed the band JB&#x27;s Allstars, before moving into production. He joined Special Beat for several years, then a reformed Selecter, before retiring from music to work as an IT specialist. He rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion, and continued to perform with them until his death in 2015.

From 1984 until 1987, Hall fronted the Colourfield, with some commercial success. After they disbanded, he pursued a solo career, working mostly in the new wave genre. He co-wrote a number of early Lightning Seeds releases. He also performed some vocals for a Dub Pistols album. He and Eurythmics member David A. Stewart formed the duo Vegas in the early 1990s, releasing an eponymous album in 1992. Hall joined the Specials for their 2009 reunion, and continued to perform with them until his death in 2022.

In 2006, Dammers formed large, jazz-style ensemble the Spatial AKA Orchestra.

==Reunions==
===The Specials Mk.2 (1993–1998)===
The first reunion under the Specials name occurred in 1993. Producer Roger Lomas was asked by Trojan Records to get some musicians together to back ska legend Desmond Dekker on a new album. He approached all members of the Specials and the four that were willing to participate were Roddy Radiation, Neville Staple, Lynval Golding and Horace Panter, they were also joined by Aitch Bembridge, who had been the drummer in the Selecter. In the 1970s, Bembridge had played with soul singer Ray King, who mentored and worked with Dammers, Staple, Golding and Hutchinson in their days before the Specials. A group of studio musicians filled out the band, including keyboardist Mark Adams. The album, released by Trojan Records as &quot;King of Kings&quot;, was credited to Desmond Dekker and the Specials.

The release of the album with Desmond Dekker created some buzz for the band, and led to an offer from a Japanese promoter to book a tour. Rejoined by Golding, along with Bembridge &amp; Adams from the &quot;King of Kings&quot; sessions, the band added horn players Adam Birch and Jonathan Read and began rehearsing and playing live. Initially using the names the Coventry Specials, The X Specials, and Specials2, they shortly reverted to the Specials after accepting that it was the name promoters were using anyway, although the line-up was referred to as Specials MkII by those involved. This line-up went on to tour internationally and released two studio albums: &quot;Today&#x27;s Specials&quot;, a collection of mostly reggae and ska covers in 1996, and &quot;Guilty &#x27;til Proved Innocent!&quot; in 1998, a collection of original compositions. The band toured heavily in support of both releases – including headlining the Vans Warped Tour – and received positive reviews of their live shows.

Despite the live success, the band fizzled out after a 1998 Japan tour (which Panter missed due to illness), although limited touring with a different line-up continued into 2000. The release of the earlier Trojan sessions, &quot;Skinhead Girl&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Conquering Ruler&quot; in 2001, would be the last heard from the band for some time.

After completing a similar project with the Selecter in 1999, Roger Lomas brought the group back into the studio to record a number of classic songs from the Trojan Records back catalogue. Two weeks before this project, Golding left the group to concentrate on domestic life in Seattle. Turning to another Selecter veteran for help, the band replaced him on guitar with Neol Davies. Davies, Staple, Radiation and Panter, joined by a group of session musicians, recorded a wealth of tracks that eventually saw release by Trojan sub-label Receiver Records as &quot;Skinhead Girl&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Conquering Ruler&quot; in 2001.

===The Specials reunion (2008–2022)===
====Terry Hall &amp; Friends====
In 2007, Hall teamed up with Golding for the first time in 24 years, to play Specials songs at two music festivals. At Glastonbury Festival, they appeared on the Pyramid Stage with Lily Allen to perform &quot;Gangsters&quot;. In May 2009, Golding claimed that Allen&#x27;s reuniting him with Hall played a &quot;massive part&quot; in the group&#x27;s later reformation. Later the same day, they played on the Park Stage, with Damon Albarn of Blur on piano and beatboxer Shlomo providing rhythm, to perform &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot;. At GuilFest, Golding joined the Dub Pistols to again perform &quot;Gangsters&quot;. In 2007, Golding regularly performed concerts and recorded with Pama International, a collective of musicians who were members of Special Beat.
On 30 March 2008, Hall stated that the Specials would be reforming for tour dates in autumn 2008, and possibly for some recording. This was officially confirmed on 7 April 2008. On 6 September 2008, six members of the band performed on the main stage at the Bestival, billed as the &quot;Surprise Act&quot;. By December 2008, the band had announced 2009 tour dates to celebrate their 30th anniversary, although founder member Dammers was not joining the band on the tour.

Hall was quoted as saying, &quot;The door remains open to him&quot;. However, Dammers described the new reunion as a &quot;takeover&quot; and claimed he had been forced out of the band. Around that same time, longtime Specials fan Amy Winehouse joined Dammers onstage at Hyde Park, singing the song he wrote for the Specials, &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;, for Mandela&#x27;s 90th birthday concert, dubbed 46664 after Mandela&#x27;s prison number, and also the name of his AIDS charity, which received money raised by the birthday bash.

====30th Anniversary Tour and beyond====
On 10 April 2009, the Specials guested on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. The following month, Bradbury and Golding expressed their intentions to release further original Specials material at a later date. On 8 June 2009, it was announced that the Specials would embark on a second leg of their 30th anniversary tour, taking in the locations and venues that they missed earlier in the year. In July and August 2009, the Specials toured Australia and Japan. In October, the band picked up the Inspiration Award at the Q Awards. In 2010, they performed at the Dutch festival Lowlands.

In an interview at the Green Room in Manchester in November 2010, Hall confirmed that there would be further Specials dates in the autumn of 2011, and confessed to having enjoyed playing live again: &quot;It&#x27;s a celebration of something that happened in your life that was important, and we&#x27;re going to do that again next year, but then maybe that&#x27;ll be it&quot;. In late 2010, the band re-released &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot; as a Haiti Special Fund available to download from iTunes in both the UK and the US, with proceeds going to aid the UNICEF effort to help children in earthquake-stricken Haiti.

In February 2012, it was announced that the Specials would perform at Hyde Park with Blur and New Order to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Panter said that the band were excited to be involved in such a momentous event: &quot;We have been keeping it under our pork pie hats for a month or so now. I think it is going to be the only chance people get to see the Specials performing in the UK this year.&quot; The Specials&#x27; performance was said to have remained synonymous with Britain&#x27;s political and social upheaval of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In August 2012, the Specials released a new live album, &quot;More... Or Less. – The Specials Live&quot;, featuring &quot;the best of the best&quot; performances from their 2011 European tour, selected by the band themselves on a double-disc CD and double-vinyl LP.

====Departures of Neville Staple and Roddy Radiation====
In January 2013, the Specials announced the departure of Staple with the following message on their website: &quot;We are very sad Neville cannot join us on the Specials&#x27; UK tour in May 2013 or indeed on the future projects we have planned. He has made a huge contribution to the fantastic time and reception we have received since we started and reformed in 2009. However, he missed a number of key shows last year due to ill health, and his health is obviously much more important. We wish him the very best for the future&quot;.

The Specials completed a North American tour in 2013, performing to sold-out crowds in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver.

In February 2014, it was revealed that Roddy Radiation had left the reformed group. In spite of his departure, the Specials played an extensive tour in the autumn of 2014 with Steve Cradock (Ocean Colour Scene, Paul Weller) as lead guitarist.

====Death of John Bradbury====
Drummer John Bradbury died on 28 December 2015 at the age of 62. On 22 March 2016, the Specials announced that the Libertines drummer Gary Powell would be performing on their upcoming tours. Powell was replaced by PJ Harvey/Jazz Jamaica drummer Kenrick Rowe on the Encore album and subsequent tour.

====&quot;Encore&quot; and &quot;Protest Songs 1924–2012&quot;====

In 2017, the band invited 20-year-old Birmingham native Saffiyah Khan to a show after a photo of her confronting an &quot;English Defence League goon&quot; in a Specials t-shirt at a counter-demonstration went viral. Less than two years later, Khan had performed on stage for the first time, recorded a song and toured North America with the band.

On 29 October 2018, the Specials announced a UK tour in 2019 to coincide with the release of a new album, &quot;Encore&quot;.

On 1 February 2019, the band announced a spring North American tour to promote the 1 February 2019 release of &quot;Encore&quot; (out via Island Records). The following week, &quot;Encore&quot; debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, giving the band their first chart-topping album since 1980. During 2019, The Specials invited 17-year-old artist and photographer Sterling Chandler to join the tour.

In March 2021, the band announced a UK tour. On 7 July 2021, Horace Panter announced a new 12-track Specials album that was released on 23 August 2021, titled &quot;Protest Songs 1924–2012&quot;. Vocalist Hannah Hu joined the band for their 2021 tour and also sang on the new album.

====Death of Terry Hall====
On 19 December 2022, the Specials announced on social media that Hall had died at age 63 after a brief illness which was later revealed to be pancreatic cancer. They had planned to record a new album in the United States before Hall&#x27;s health deteriorated.

In a 2023 interview, bass player Horace Panter confirmed that the Specials had ceased to be following Hall&#x27;s death. He stated, &quot;It would be ludicrous to tour without Terry, so yes, that&#x27;s definitely the end of the Specials&quot;.

In December 2024, Sky Arts aired “Live from Coventry Cathedral” the last-filmed concert by The Specials, before the sudden passing of lead-singer Terry Hall in 2022. The show was directed by Terry’s wife Lindy Heymann.

<doc id="175019" wikidata="Q3314318" url="?curid=175019" title="Miller v. California">
<text>Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court clarifying the legal definition of obscenity as material that lacks &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot;. The ruling was the origin of the three-part judicial test for determining obscene media content that can be banned by government authorities, which is now known as the Miller test.

==Background==
In 1971, Marvin Miller, owner of a California mail-order business specializing in pornographic films and books, mass-mailed a brochure advertising products that graphically depicted sexual activity between men and women. Five of the brochures were mailed to a restaurant in Newport Beach, California. The owner and his mother opened the envelope and, upon seeing the brochures, called the police.

Miller was arrested and charged with violating California Penal Code 311.2(a) which says in part: &quot;Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, [...] any obscene matter is for a first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot; California lawmakers wrote the statute based on two previous Supreme Court obscenity rulings: &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;.

Miller was tried by jury at the Superior Court of Orange County. The judge instructed the jury to evaluate the evidence by the community standards of California as defined by the statute. The jury returned a guilty verdict.

Miller appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, arguing that the jury instructions did not use the standard set in &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; which said that in order to be judged obscene, materials must be &quot;utterly without redeeming social value.&quot; The appellate division rejected this argument and upheld the jury verdict. Miller then filed an appeal with the California Court of Appeal for the Third District, which declined to review the lower court rulings. 

Adopting a freedom of speech argument, Miller applied to the U.S. Supreme Court for &quot;certiorari&quot;, which was granted. The first oral arguments were heard in January 1972.

==Supreme Court precedents on obscenity==
The U.S. Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; to Miller because the California statute at issue was based on two previous obscenity precedents that the Court wanted to revisit. Chief Justice Warren Burger believed that the Court&#x27;s obscenity jurisprudence was misguided and that governments should be given more leeway to ban obscene materials. Burger pushed for a looser definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; which would allow local prosecutions. Meanwhile, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., pushed for First Amendment protection for all &quot;obscenity&quot; unless distributed to minors or exposed offensively to unconsenting adults. These disagreements among the Justices resulted in three different hearings, pushing Miller&#x27;s case into 1973.

Since the &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; ruling in 1957, the Supreme Court had struggled to define what embodied constitutionally unprotected obscene material. Under the Comstock laws controlling mail distribution that prevailed before &quot;Roth&quot;, any material that tended to &quot;deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences&quot; was deemed &quot;obscene&quot; and could be banned on that basis. &quot;Roth&quot; defined obscenity more strictly, as material whose &quot;dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the interest&quot; to the &quot;average person, applying contemporary community standards&quot;. Only material meeting this test could now be banned as &quot;obscene&quot;.

In &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; in 1964, concerning a state ban of an adult-oriented film, Justice Potter Stewart opined that the Court &quot;was faced with the task of trying to define what may be indefinable&quot;, and that criminal laws were constitutionally limited to hardcore pornography, which he did not try to define: &quot;perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it&quot;. In &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; in 1966, the Supreme Court refined the &quot;Roth&quot; test to material that is &quot;patently offensive&quot; and &quot;utterly without redeeming social value&quot;. These precedents resulted in an unclear definition of obscene material that could be banned by government authorities.

==Opinion of the Court==
Miller had based his appeal in California on the &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; precedent, particularly its test for material without any redeeming social value. Miller believed that such material had value for consenting adults who purchased it voluntarily. Per this argument positioning such material as items of expression, the question before the Court was whether the sale and distribution of that material was protected under the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of speech. The court determined that the material at issue in Miller&#x27;s case was pornography that could have been banned under the &quot;Roth&quot; precedent. 

However, the Court acknowledged &quot;the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression&quot;, and said that &quot;State statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited.&quot; The Court, in an attempt to set such limits, devised a set of three criteria which must be met for a media item to be legitimately subjected to state regulatory bans:
# whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the interest;
# whether the work depicts or describes, in an offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions, as specifically defined by applicable state law; and
# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

This test clarified the definition of obscenity originally set out in the &quot;Memoirs&quot; precedent. This three-part analysis became known as the Miller test. 

The result of the ruling was that the Supreme Court overturned Miller&#x27;s criminal conviction and remanded the case back to the California Superior Court for reconsideration of whether Miller had committed a misdemeanor. On overturning Miller&#x27;s conviction, the Court stated: &quot;Under the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive &#x27;hard core&#x27; sexual conduct specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.&quot;

==Impact and subsequent events==
The &quot;Miller&quot; ruling, and particularly the resulting Miller test, was the Supreme Court&#x27;s first comprehensive explication of obscene material that does not qualify for First Amendment protection and thus can be banned by governmental authorities with criminal charges for those who distribute it. Furthermore, due to the three-part test&#x27;s stringent requirements, very few types of content can now be completely banned, and material that is appropriate for consenting adults can only be partially restricted per delivery method. 

The ruling had no direct impact on government attempts to restrict live adult entertainment, which is largely addressed in another Supreme Court precedent from roughly the same period: &quot;Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton.&quot;

Categories of media material that completely fail the Miller test, and thus can be completely banned by government authorities, have been narrowed down in later Supreme Court rulings. Child pornography was deemed to be unprotected by the First Amendment in &quot;New York v. Ferber&quot; in 1982, because it has no redeeming social value per the Miller test. In &quot;Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition&quot; in 2002, however, the Court held that sexually explicit material that only &quot;appears&quot; to depict minors, but actually does not, might also be considered obscenity with no redeeming social value.

The &quot;community standards&quot; portion of the Miller test is of particular relevance with the rise of the Internet, as materials believed by some to be &quot;obscene&quot; can be accessed from anywhere in the nation, including places where there is a greater concern than other areas of the nation. Enforcing and applying obscenity laws to the Internet have proven difficult. Due to the difficulty in determining which &quot;community&quot; is most relevant, both the Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) have had sections struck down as unconstitutional in cases such as &quot;Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition&quot; and &quot;Ashcroft v. ACLU&quot;.

<doc id="175020" wikidata="Q267836" url="?curid=175020" title="Nancy Carroll">
<text>Nancy Carroll (born Ann Veronica Lahiff; November 19, 1903 – August 6, 1965) was an American actress. She started her career in Broadway musicals and then became an actress in sound films and was in many films from 1927 to 1938. She was then in television roles from 1950 to 1963. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960.

==Early years==
Of Irish parentage, the daughter of Thomas and Ann Lahiff, Carroll was born in New York City. Her education came at Holy Trinity School in New York, but she left there at age 16 to work as a stenographer in an office of a lace manufacturer. (Another source says that she left the eighth grade at age 14 &quot;to go on the stage&quot;.) She was the seventh of 12 children. Although her parents had named her Ann, she said, &quot;... finally I &quot;demanded&quot; that I be called Nancy, and they agreed it suited me.&quot;

Carroll and her sister &quot;worked up a little specialty number&quot; and auditioned for the Shuberts, which resulted in their performing in a show.

== Career ==
Carroll&#x27;s career began in 1923 when she performed in the chorus of &quot;The Passing Show&quot; in New York. She began her acting career in Broadway musicals. Although she initially wanted to be a character actress, she said, &quot;But the moment I took off my hat, and that&#x27;s the first thing a manager asks you to do when you go to apply for a job — every manager without exception would say: &#x27;You must go into musical comedy. You&#x27;re just the type. No chance for you in a dramatic production.&#x27;&quot; She became a successful actress in sound films because her musical background enabled her to play in movie musicals of the 1930s. Her film debut was in &quot;Ladies Must Dress&quot; in 1927. 

Carroll&#x27;s early experience included work in &quot;second-rate road companies&quot; and portrayal of Roxie Hart in the Los Angeles production of &quot;Chicago&quot;. 
In 1928 she made eight films. One of them, &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot;, co-starring Richard Dix, made her a movie star. In 1929 she starred in &quot;The Dance of Life&quot; with Hal Skelly, and &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; along with George Bancroft and Olga Baclanova. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1930 for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. Among her other films are &quot;Laughter&quot; (1930), &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930), &quot;Hot Saturday&quot; (1932) with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, &quot;The Kiss Before the Mirror&quot; (1933) directed by James Whale, and &quot;Broken Lullaby&quot; aka &quot;The Man I Killed&quot; (1932) directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

Under contract to Paramount Pictures, Carroll often balked at the roles the studio offered her, and she earned a reputation as a recalcitrant and uncooperative actress. In spite of her ability to successfully tackle light comedies, tearful melodramas, and even musicals, and as well as garnering considerable praise by the critics and public – she received the most fan mail of any star in the early 1930s – she was released from her contract by the studio. In the mid-1930s under a four-film contract with Columbia Pictures, she made four rather insignificant films and was no longer an A-list actress. 

Carroll retired from films in 1938, returned to the stage, and starred as the mother in the early television series &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot; in 1950. In the following year, she guest-starred in the television version of &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, starring her daughter, Patricia Kirkland.

== Personal life and death ==
Carroll&#x27;s first husband was author Jack Kirkland. They were married seven years and divorced in 1931. Also in 1931 she married educator Francis Bolton Mallory. They were together for three years and separated for three years before they were divorced. She was married to C. H. J. Groen, a manufacturer of fiberglass. On August 6, 1965, she was found dead after failing to arrive at the theater for a performance. The cause of her death was an aneurysm. She was 61 years old.

==Hollywood Walk of Fame==
For her contributions to the film industry, Carroll has a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1725 Vine Street. The star was dedicated February 8, 1960.

<text>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), is a case of the United States Supreme Court that unanimously struck down St. Paul&#x27;s Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance and reversed the conviction of a teenager, referred to in court documents only as R.A.V., for burning a cross on the lawn of an African-American family since the ordinance was held to violate the First Amendment&#x27;s protection of freedom of speech. The Court reasoned that an ordinance like this constitutes &quot;viewpoint discrimination&quot; which may have the effect of driving certain ideas from the marketplace of ideas. 

==Facts and procedural background==

In the early morning hours of June 21, 1990, the petitioner and several other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely made cross by taping together broken chair legs. The cross was erected and burned in the front yard of an African American family that lived across the street from the house where the petitioner was staying. Petitioner, who was a juvenile at the time, was charged with two counts, one of which a violation of the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance. The Ordinance provided the following:
Petitioner moved to dismiss the count under the Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance on the ground that it was substantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment. The trial court granted the motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, rejecting petitioner&#x27;s overbreadth claim because, as the Minnesota Court had construed the Ordinance in prior cases, the phrase &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot; limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounted to fighting words under the &quot;Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire&quot; decision. The Minnesota Court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based, because &quot;the ordinance is a narrowly tailored means towards accomplishing the compelling governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order.&quot; Petitioner appealed, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.

==Decision==

Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the court, in which Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice David Souter, and Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Justice Byron White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justice Harry Blackmun and Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor joined in full, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in part. Justice Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which was joined in part by Justice White and Justice Blackmun.

===The majority decision===
The Court began with a recitation of the relevant factual and procedural background, noting several times that the conduct at issue could have been prosecuted under different Minnesota statutes. In construing the ordinance, the Court recognized that it was bound by the construction given by the Minnesota Supreme Court. Therefore, the Court accepted the Minnesota court&#x27;s conclusion that the ordinance reached only those expressions that constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; within the meaning of &quot;Chaplinsky&quot;.

Petitioner argued that the &quot;Chaplinsky&quot; formulation should be narrowed, such that the ordinance would be invalidated as &quot;substantially overbroad,&quot; but the Court declined to consider this argument, concluding that even if all of the expression reached by the ordinance was proscribable as &quot;fighting words,&quot; the ordinance was facially unconstitutional in that it prohibited otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addressed.

The Court began its substantive analysis with a review of the principles of free speech clause jurisprudence, beginning with the general rule that the First Amendment prevents the government from proscribing speech, or even expressive conduct, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed. The Court noted that while content-based regulations are presumptively invalid, society has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are &quot;of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.&quot;

The Court then clarified language from previous free speech clause cases, including &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;, &quot;Beauharnais v. Illinois&quot;, and &quot;Chaplinsky&quot; that suggested that certain categories of expression are &quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot; and &quot;must be taken in context.&quot; The Court&#x27;s clarification stated that this meant that certain areas of speech &quot;can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated &quot;because of their constitutionally proscribable content&quot; (obscenity, defamation, etc.)—not that they are categories of speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for content discrimination.&quot; Thus, as one of the first of a number of illustrations that Justice Scalia would use throughout the opinion, the government may &quot;proscribe libel, but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing &quot;only&quot; libel critical of the government.&quot;

The Court recognized that while a particular utterance of speech can be proscribed on the basis of one feature, the Constitution may prohibit proscribing it on the basis of another feature. Thus, while burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against outdoor fires could be punishable, burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not. In addition, other reasonable &quot;time, place, or manner&quot; restrictions were upheld, but only if they were &quot;justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.&quot;

The Court recognized two final principles of free speech jurisprudence. One of these described that when &quot;the entire basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.&quot; As examples, Justice Scalia wrote,

The other principle of free speech jurisprudence was recognized when the Court wrote that a valid basis for according different treatment to a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the subclass &quot;happens to be associated with particular &#x27;secondary effects&#x27; of the speech, so that &#x27;the regulation is &quot;justified&quot; without reference to the content of the ... speech&#x27;&quot; As an example, the Court wrote that a State could permit all obscene live performances except those involving minors.

Applying these principles to the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, the Court concluded that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. Justice Scalia explained the rationale, writing,

The Court went on to explain that, in addition to being an impermissible restriction based on content, the Ordinance was also viewpoint- based discrimination, writing,

Displays containing some words, such as racial slurs, would be prohibited to proponents of all views, whereas fighting words that &quot;do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender—aspersions upon a person&#x27;s mother, for example—would seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be used by those speakers&#x27; opponents.&quot; The Court concluded that &quot;St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquess of Queensberry rules.&quot;

The Court concluded, &quot;Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone&#x27;s front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire.&quot;

==Limitation==

In &quot;Virginia v. Black&quot; (2003), the United States Supreme Court deemed constitutional part of a Virginia statute outlawing the public burning of a cross if done with an intent to intimidate, noting that such expression &quot;has a long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence.&quot;

<text>Sarah and Son is a 1930 pre-Code American drama film directed by Dorothy Arzner. The screenplay by Zoë Akins was adapted from Timothy Shea&#x27;s novel of the same name. It stars Ruth Chatterton, Fredric March, Gilbert Emery, and Doris Lloyd. It was filmed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and released by Paramount Pictures.

==Plot==
Sarah Storm, an Austrian immigrant, has taken up with Jim Grey, with the goal of both of them becoming vaudeville entertainers. Months after their stage debut, they now have a baby boy and no steady income, and Jim expresses little interest in finding work or supporting the family. After a fight with Sarah, Jim tries to get a loan from John Ashmore, a wealthy businessman, who denies his request, but mentions his envy at Jim&#x27;s fatherhood, since his wife cannot bear children. On a whim, Jim enlists with the Marines for four years, and goes drinking. After returning home and quarreling again with Sarah, he disappears with their young son Bobby, intending to sell him to the Ashmores. The heartbroken Sarah is given a job singing with an itinerant musician, Cyril Belloc.

Two years later, Cyril and Sarah perform for WWI veterans in a hospital. As she goes among the beds of the wounded soldiers, she finds Jim there, near death. He begs forgiveness for his actions, and tells her about giving her son to the Ashmores. When she pleads with John Ashmore to let her see if their son is hers, Ashmore refuses, threatening to have her committed; their attorney, Howard Vanning, who is also Ashmore&#x27;s brother-in-law, takes pity on her and says he will try to help, but also believes her delusional. Sarah leaves America for Germany to pursue her singing career.
Years later, Sarah has become an internationally famous opera singer, and returns to New York to perform. She reconnects with Vanning, declares she is no longer afraid of any threats the Ashmores can levy against her, and again demands to meet the boy, saying a birthmark will prove her is her son. Meanwhile, Bobby is now 13, and unhappy with the too-protective Ashmores, confiding to his uncle Howard that he fears being incapable of being a self-sufficient man. Still refusing to agree to a meeting, Mrs. Ashmore presents in his stead the deaf mute son of one of their servants, hoping this will convince Sarah he is not her son. Bobby, unbeknownst to his adoptive parents, runs away to the summer house of his uncle Howard. Howard, who is now fully in love with Sarah, brings her to the house unaware of Bobby&#x27;s presence, and finally engineers an encounter between them.

==Cast==
* Ruth Chatterton as Sarah Storm
* Fredric March as Howard Vanning
* Fuller Mellish Jr. as Jim Grey (Mellish died on February 8, 1930, shortly before the movie&#x27;s release)
* Gilbert Emery as John Ashmore
* Doris Lloyd as Mrs. Ashmore (Vanning&#x27;s sister)
* William Stack as Cyril Belloc
* Philippe De Lacy as Bobby

==Reception==
The &quot;New York Times&quot; praised the performances and most of the screenplay, faulting only some aspects of plot development. It offered as praise: &quot;&quot;Sarah and Son&quot; is one of the few audible pictures which are really good enough to warrant criticism of the development of the story, and no matter what are its minor shortcomings, it is an emphatically ingratiating entertainment.&quot;

==Awards==
* Ruth Chatterton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Sarah and Son&quot;. Her character&#x27;s evolution from an immigrant with a strong Austrian accent to a successful celebrity with just a trace of an accent appeared alongside Greta Garbo&#x27;s heavily accented performance in her first talkie.

<text>Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, commonly known as Hall &amp; Oates, were an American rock duo formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1970. Daryl Hall was generally the lead vocalist, while John Oates primarily supplied electric guitar and backing vocals. The two wrote most of the songs they performed, either separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s with a fusion of rock music, soul music, and rhythm and blues.

Though they are commonly referred to by only their surnames, the duo&#x27;s official and preferred title includes the members&#x27; first names. They have been credited on albums as Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates (or Daryl Hall John Oates) on all of their US releases. The duo reached the US Top 40 with 29 of their 33 singles charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 between 1974 and 1991. Six of these peaked at number one: &quot;Rich Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;Kiss on My List&quot; (1980), the two 1981 releases &quot;Private Eyes&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; (also a Hot Soul No. 1), &quot;Maneater&quot; (1982) and &quot;Out of Touch&quot; (1984). Their overall 16 US Top Tens also include &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Sara Smile&quot;, &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Family Man&quot;, &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, and &quot;Method of Modern Love&quot;. Seven of their albums have been RIAA-certified platinum and six of them gold. In the United Kingdom, they have achieved success with two Top Ten albums and six Top 40 singles, two of which – &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; and &quot;Maneater&quot; – reached the Top Ten. The duo have spent 120 weeks in the UK Top 75 albums chart and 84 weeks in the UK Top 75 singles chart.

While the duo had employed a wide variety of session musicians on their recordings, several in particular appear on many of their works and have toured with them, including guitarist G. E. Smith, bassist Tom &quot;T-Bone&quot; Wolk, drummer Mickey Curry and multi-instrumentalist Charles DeChant. In addition, they collaborated with sisters Sara Allen and Janna Allen on songwriting and composing.

In 2003, Hall &amp; Oates were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In August 2018, in a 60th-anniversary celebration of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the duo ranked 18 in a list of the top Hot 100 artists of all time and six in a list of the Hot 100&#x27;s top duos/groups. They remain the most successful duo of all time, ahead of the Carpenters, the Everly Brothers, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. In September 2010, VH1 ranked the duo 99th among the 100 greatest artists of all time. In April 2014, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and on September 2, 2016, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In April 2024, Oates indicated that the duo would no longer perform together amidst a legal battle between each other.

== History ==
=== 1967–1972: Formation and early years ===
Daryl Franklin Hohl (born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, on October 11, 1946) and John William Oates (born in New York City on April 7, 1948) first met at the Adelphi Ballroom in Philadelphia in 1967. Each was heading his own musical group, Hall with The Temptones and Oates with The Masters. They were attending a band competition, when they discovered that they were interested in the same music and both were attending Temple University. They started spending time together and eventually shared a number of apartments in the city. One of the apartments they shared had &quot;Hall &amp; Oates&quot; on the mailbox, which became the duo&#x27;s common nickname. It took them another two years to form a musical duo, and three years after that, they signed to Atlantic Records and released their debut album. The two did not start working together seriously until 1970 after Oates returned from an extended stay in Europe.

=== 1972–1974: First albums ===
Early in their recording careers, Hall and Oates had trouble clearly defining their sound, alternating among folk, soul, rock and pop. None of their early albums—&quot;Whole Oats&quot;, &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette&quot;, and &quot;War Babies&quot;—were very successful. Despite being produced by such big-name producers as Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren, they had no hit singles. But after &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot; off &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette&quot; was covered by Lou Rawls and Tavares, the latter version reached Number One on the R&amp;B chart in 1974&quot;.&quot; Written for Hall&#x27;s first wife, Bryna Lublin (Hall), the song was inspired by Oates&#x27;s being stood up on a date on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Another &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette&quot; single, &quot;Las Vegas Turnaround&quot;, was written about (and mentioned by first name) Hall&#x27;s girlfriend, flight attendant and future song-writing collaborator Sara Allen.

=== 1975–1977: First hits ===

After the release of &quot;War Babies&quot; in 1974, Hall and Oates left Atlantic Records to join RCA Records. Their first album for RCA, &quot;Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates&quot; (often referred to by their fans as &quot;the silver album&quot; because of the silver foil material on the original album cover), was issued in 1975 and was their first notable success. The album contained the ballad &quot;Sara Smile&quot;, a song Hall wrote for Sara Allen. The album cover depicted Hall and Oates, overly made up with cosmetic blush to the point where they looked feminine, especially the long-haired and clean-shaven Hall. Hall later said in an interview for VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; that he looked like &quot;the girl I always wanted to go out with&quot; on the album cover. This cover was designed by Pierre LaRoche, who created the cover for Ziggy Stardust for David Bowie.

&quot;Sara Smile&quot; became Hall and Oates&#x27; first Top 10 hit, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1976. Atlantic subsequently re-released &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, which reached No. 7 in October 1976, and &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette&quot;, which reached #33 on the album charts on November 20, 1976, and staying on for 38 weeks.

Hall and Oates followed those hits with the more pop-oriented album &quot;Bigger Than Both of Us&quot; later that year. Although the album&#x27;s first single—the Philadelphia soul-oriented ballad &quot;Do What You Want, Be What You Are&quot;—barely made the Top 40, their second single, &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, was a smash. The song was Hall and Oates&#x27;s first No. 1 hit, reaching the top spot for the week ending March 26, 1977.

=== 1977–1978: Leaner years and &quot;Sacred Songs&quot; ===
After this small run of hits, Hall and Oates still encountered difficulty getting radio play. Despite touring constantly and recording albums with efficiency, the duo could not find any pop success for a number of reasons, mainly because of the popularity of the disco genre. By the time they released the rock-oriented albums &quot;Beauty on a Back Street&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Along the Red Ledge&quot; in 1978, disco music was trendy and taking most of the spots in popular music.

They did release a few hit singles during this period: the follow-up to &quot;Rich Girl,&quot; &quot;Back Together Again,&quot; hit the Top 40, and &quot;It&#x27;s A Laugh&quot; (from &quot;Along The Red Ledge&quot;) hit the top 20 in 1978. In 1977, RCA attempted to push Hall to the fore with his first solo effort &quot;Sacred Songs&quot;. However, after being presented with the highly experimental recording, produced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson, RCA became unwilling to release what was, in their view, a non-commercial album. &quot;Sacred Songs&quot; was eventually released in 1980.

=== 1979–1981: &quot;X-Static&quot; and &quot;Voices&quot; ===
In late 1979, Hall and Oates released &quot;X-Static&quot; – produced by David Foster, which combined rock with disco. The album did not fare well, although &quot;Wait for Me&quot; did hit the top 20. The 1980s brought changes for Hall and Oates. The pair felt that the biggest hindrance to their success was that their music was being filtered through outside producers, and that studio musicians were not familiar with their own tastes and thoughts. In 1979, they hired G. E. Smith (who had worked with Dan Hartman and David Bowie) as lead guitarist, Mickey Curry as drummer, and Tom &quot;T-Bone&quot; Wolk joined as bassist in 1981. They also enlisted Hall&#x27;s girlfriend Sara Allen (and her younger sister Janna) to help write songs, and began working with Neil Kernon, an engineer on &quot;Voices&quot; who worked as co-producer on their succeeding two albums.

The band also wished to capture the sound of New York City which, by then, had become their home. As a result, instead of recording in Los Angeles, as they had done previously, they decided to record at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, just five minutes away from their apartments, and began producing their own recordings with their touring band backing them in the studio.

The resulting album, &quot;Voices&quot;, was written, produced and arranged by Hall and Oates in one month, according to their authorized biography &quot;Dangerous Dances&quot; (by Nick Tosches). The first two singles from the album charted fairly well, with &quot;How Does It Feel to Be Back&quot; charting at Number 30. The well-received cover of The Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, just missed the Top 10, peaking at Number 12, but spent 14 weeks in the Top 40. After the release of that song, Oates&#x27;s contribution as the lead vocalist diminished on future releases. The third single &quot;Kiss on My List&quot; hit Number 1 in April 1981 and remained there for three weeks. The follow-up single &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot; reached Number 5 in July of that year.

The other well-known song from &quot;Voices&quot; is the emotive ballad &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot;, with powerful lead vocals by Hall, who wrote it. British singer Paul Young had a &quot;Billboard&quot; Number 1 hit with a cover of the song in 1985. Though the Hall and Oates original (recorded in a Memphis-soul style) was never released as a single, it remains a fan favorite on the duo&#x27;s greatest hits albums, and was featured on their Apollo Theater album in 1985, and is frequently featured in their live set to this day.

=== 1981–1982: &quot;Private Eyes&quot; ===
By the time &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot; was falling off the charts, Hall and Oates had already released their follow-up album &quot;Private Eyes&quot;. Having worked in the studio while &quot;Voices&quot; was at its peak in popularity, the two had already recorded most of their material and perfected a fusion of their doo-wop and soul roots with New Wave energy and hard rock grit. The result was a pop classic that is often considered one of the greatest albums of the 1980s, and was the first Hall and Oates album to reach the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, while four singles from &quot;Private Eyes&quot; all reached the Top 40.

The title track and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; were both Number 1 hits, separated only by the ten-week stay at Number 1 by &quot;Physical&quot; by Olivia Newton-John. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; was one of the few songs ever recorded by a white act to reach Number One on both the R&amp;B and the pop charts. &quot;Did It in a Minute&quot; reached Number 9 in the spring of 1982, and &quot;Your Imagination&quot; peaked at No. 33.

=== 1982–1983: &quot;H2O&quot; and band changes ===
Their next album, &quot;H2O&quot;, a very polished, synth-heavy effort, became the duo&#x27;s most successful album, with US sales eventually approaching four million copies. &quot;H2O&quot; reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (where it held for 15 weeks) and spawned three Top 10 singles. &quot;Maneater&quot;, the biggest hit of their career, reached No. 1 on December 18, 1982, and stayed there for four weeks.

The soulful ballad &quot;One on One&quot; and a cover of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Family Man&quot; reached No. 7 and No. 6 in March and June 1983, respectively.
According to Oates, they recorded approximately twenty songs for the album, of which nine did not make the final cut. He went on to say they usually had five or six tracks left over per album.

For the &quot;H2O&quot; album, Hall and Oates made some permanent changes to their current band. Drummer Mickey Curry, who had appeared on some &quot;Private Eyes&quot; tracks, including the title song, replaced Jerry Marotta full-time. Bassist Tom Wolk, who had mimed John Siegler&#x27;s bass line in the &quot;Private Eyes&quot; video, replaced Siegler full-time. These two joined the band&#x27;s holdovers—lead guitar player G.E. Smith, and saxophonist Charles DeChant. Wolk continued to perform with the duo until his death in early 2010, while Curry returned for the &quot;Do It for Love&quot; and &quot;Laughing Down Crying&quot; sessions.

=== 1983–1984: &quot;Rock &#x27;n Soul Part 1&quot; ===
By the fall of 1983, Hall and Oates were one of the biggest pop music acts in the United States. They had five Number 1 singles to their credit, two consecutive Top 10 albums and were one of the biggest names on MTV. Two covers of the 1957 Bobby Helms classic &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; were recorded—one with Hall on lead vocals, and the other with Oates on lead vocals—and released in time for Christmas 1983, complete with a humorous video of the band, that received extensive airplay on MTV. In 1983, they released their first greatest hits album entitled &quot;Rock &#x27;n Soul Part 1&quot;. The album peaked at Number 7, and the two new songs that were written and recorded for that LP also became Top 10 hits as well.

The first single released from this album, &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, battled six weeks for the Number 1 spot with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Say Say Say&quot; at the peak of &quot;Thriller&quot; mania. &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; remained at No. 2 for four weeks from December 10 through 31, 1983.

Hall and Oates&#x27;s follow-up single &quot;Adult Education&quot; received heavy airplay at both pop and black (urban contemporary) radio, and reached Number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1984. It was accompanied by a dark, New York City-oriented music video set in a cave. Oates later told VH1 that the clip resembled the &quot;Survivor&quot; TV show on acid.

=== 1984–1985: &quot;Big Bam Boom&quot; ===

Hall and Oates returned to the studio in 1984 after a rest period to begin work on the &quot;Big Bam Boom&quot; album. This album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it than &quot;H2O&quot;, combining their song structure and vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing. The album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time (most notably the Synclavier II, one of the first computerized synthesizer workstations, as well as the Fairlight CMI). Noted remix and hip-hop icon Arthur Baker worked very closely with the duo as a consultant, and produced dance remixes of four of the album&#x27;s singles.

Released in late 1984, the first single from the LP, &quot;Out of Touch&quot;, became the group&#x27;s sixth number 1 hit on December 8, 1984. &quot;Method of Modern Love&quot;, which debuted on the pop charts while &quot;Out of Touch&quot; was at number 1, reached number 5 in February 1985. &quot;Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid&quot; reached number 18, and &quot;Possession Obsession&quot; (a song in which Oates sings lead) reached number 30 in 1985 as well. The group&#x27;s &quot;Live Thru &#x27;85&quot; tour to promote the album began in November 1984, sponsored by Pontiac&#x27;s latest sports car, the Fiero. In addition, Pontiac allowed Oates, a skilled amateur racer, to drive in Pontiac&#x27;s factory IMSA GTU race car in Camel GT pro races. In April 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America named Hall &amp; Oates the most successful duo in rock history.

=== 1985–1988: &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; and other projects ===
Hall and Oates almost always toured extensively for each album release. But in 1985, the duo took a break after the release of their &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; album with David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks—voices of The Temptations and two of their heroes. This was RCA&#x27;s second attempt at a live Hall and Oates album, following the 1978 release &quot;Livetime&quot;. &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; was released primarily to fulfill the duo&#x27;s contract with RCA, and contained a Top 20 Grammy-nominated hit with a medley of &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot;; Ruffin and Kendrick had originally recorded both songs with the Temptations in 1964.

Hall and Oates had collaborated on the USA for Africa &quot;We Are the World&quot; project, with the former as one of the soloists and the latter as a chorus member, and performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, with Ruffin and Kendrick. The Hall and Oates band also backed up Mick Jagger&#x27;s performance at this show.

Hall, Oates, Ruffin and Kendrick performed again at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York later that year, complete with an Apollo Theater-style marquee descending on the stage during their performance.

In May 1985, Hall and Oates performed at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium. Just prior to Live Aid, on July 4, they participated in Liberty Concert, an outdoor benefit concert at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, which was filmed for HBO. It became a major music event, drawing an estimated crowd of over 60,000 people.

In 1986, Hall scored a Top 5 US hit with &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, from his solo album &quot;Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine&quot;. That album also included the Top 40 hit &quot;Foolish Pride&quot; and the Top 100 hit &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, later performed by the duo live on their &quot;Behind the Music&quot; set. Although Oates did not have a solo hit as a singer, he did contribute a solo track to the film &quot;About Last Night&quot; and co-wrote (with Iva Davies) and performed backing vocals on the 1987 Icehouse top 10 US hit &quot;Electric Blue&quot;. Oates also worked as producer, co-songwriter and co-lead vocalist of the single &quot;Love Is Fire&quot; by The Parachute Club, which was a top 40 hit in Canada in 1987.

=== 1988–1990: Arista years ===
Hall and Oates signed with Arista Records, their third record company, in 1987, shortly before the string of Top 10 hits ended, in Tommy Mottola&#x27;s effort to keep them under contract when their RCA obligation ran out. Their first album for the label, &quot;Ooh Yeah!&quot;, included the hits &quot;Everything Your Heart Desires&quot; (Number 3 in May 1988—their last to make the Top 10), &quot;Missed Opportunity&quot;, and &quot;Downtown Life&quot;. Beginning with &quot;Ooh Yeah!&quot;, album and single releases were credited as Daryl Hall John Oates, with the &#x27;&amp;&#x27; or &#x27;and&#x27; missing between the duo&#x27;s names. It was the last Hall and Oates album, other than greatest hits packages, to enjoy platinum success. They recorded one more album for Arista called &quot;Change of Season&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;So Close&quot; (co-produced by Jon Bon Jovi) reached Number 11 and was Hall &amp; Oates&#x27;s last major hit. 

Another song from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold Back Your Love&quot;, was named by SOCAN as the second-most performed song in Canada for 1992; it became a hit for Australian Sherbet front man, Daryl Braithwaite, in his solo years, and has become a Hall and Oates staple in concert. &quot;Change of Season&quot; was a more mainstream rock album than their previous work. Despite the fact that &quot;Ooh Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Change of Season&quot; reached platinum and gold status respectively, they were perceived as disappointments. In 1989, they covered and performed their own version of the O&#x27;Jays song &quot;Love Train&quot; for the film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;.

=== 1991–2006: &quot;Do It for Love&quot; and Christmas album ===
The duo&#x27;s occasional song-writing collaborator Janna Allen died of leukemia in 1993. Hall and Oates released the &quot;Marigold Sky&quot; album in 1997 (their first all-new studio album in seven years), which included an Adult Contemporary hit &quot;Promise Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;. They also released a &quot;VH1 Behind the Music&quot; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package shortly after appearing on the show in 2002. Hall and Oates released the &quot;Do It for Love&quot; album in 2003, whose title track was a number one Adult Contemporary hit. They also released the &quot;Hall &amp; Oates Live&quot; DVD from an A&amp;E &quot;Live by Request&quot; special. This album was the first release (and first success) for their newest joint venture U-Watch Records. Hall has also released the solo albums &quot;Soul Alone&quot; (1993) and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dreaming&quot; (originally released in Japan in 1996), and a live two-disc solo album titled &quot;Live in Philadelphia&quot; (2004).

Hall and Oates covered Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; on the 1991 John/Taupin tribute album &quot;Two Rooms&quot;, saying in the booklet: &quot;We chose &#x27;Philadelphia Freedom&#x27; because the music is so close to our hearts, and the lyrics represent the way we feel about Philadelphia.&quot; Oates released his own solo album in 2002 entitled &quot;Phunk Shui&quot; and a companion live concert DVD. Hall and Oates also released their first CD of (mostly) covers, &quot;Our Kind of Soul&quot;, in 2004. It includes some of their favorite R&amp;B songs, such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; (their first Hot 100 entry in over a decade), &quot;Love T.K.O.&quot;, and Dan Hartman&#x27;s &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;, among others. Hall and Oates remained on the touring circuit, traveling nearly as much as they did in years past. In addition, a DVD of live performances of the songs from &quot;Our Kind of Soul&quot; was released in November 2005.

Hall and Oates released a Christmas album, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot;, on October 3, 2006, which contained two Christmas originals and covers, including a version of &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot;, which became their second number one Adult Contemporary hit.

=== 2007–2013: Solo projects and hiatus ===
In September 2007, representatives of Montreal-based band Chromeo stated in a press release, &quot;Indeed, Chromeo&#x27;s idols Hall and Oates have asked them to collaborate with them on their upcoming record! Needless to say, the gentlemen are giddy like schoolchildren to be given this opportunity&quot;, as reported by Pitchfork Media. This collaboration with Chromeo was expected to be released in late 2008/early 2009, and was released as &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot;. On May 20, 2008, Hall and Oates were honored as BMI Icons at the 56th annual BMI Pop Awards. As of 2008, their song-writing has collected 24 BMI Pop Awards and 14 BMI Million-Air awards.

There were two notable nationally televised appearances for the duo in late 2008. On October 27, Oates sang the national anthem before Game 5 of the 2008 World Series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia (Hall had taken sick, and the game was called on account of rain after the top of the 6th inning, but resumed on October 29, and the Phillies won, claiming their first World Series Championship in 28 years). (Though born in New York, Oates was raised in a suburb of Philadelphia and attended Temple University.) Then, on December 11, both Hall and Oates appeared on the year&#x27;s last episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart. They sang a satirical tribute to Alan Colmes, as he was leaving the show &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; on Fox News a month later. On March 24, 2009, Hall and Oates performed together on the American television show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. During 2009, the duo recorded a cameo for the movie &quot;You Again&quot;, performing &quot;Kiss On My List&quot; for the final scene and closing credits.

On May 22 and 23, 2008, they performed at the Troubadour, 35 years after first performing there as an opening act. They played many popular selections, including &quot;Cab Driver&quot; from Hall&#x27;s solo album as well as several songs from the &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette&quot; album, including &quot;Had I Known You Better Then&quot; which had never been performed live before. The performance was recorded as a concert film and later released in the US as a double CD set with DVD/Blu-ray Combo on November 25, 2008. In 2009 the live performances of &quot;Sara Smile&quot; from this album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, an incredible 33 years after the original song was released. Concerning the nomination, Hall considered it truly a surprise. This made it the third time that the band was nominated for a Grammy Award; the other two times were in 1981 for &quot;Private Eyes&quot; and 1983 for &quot;Maneater&quot;.

On October 13, 2009, a 4-CD box set was released, titled &quot;Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall and John Oates&quot;. This set represents the most comprehensive hits collection by the duo as it includes songs from various labels. Also included are three songs recorded by Hall and Oates with their earlier bands prior to their forming Hall and Oates as a duo. The boxed set sold 5,000 copies the first hour and, in total, it has sold 15,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, peaking at No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on October 23, 2009. In one of the last concerts at the Wachovia Spectrum, Hall and Oates and Philadelphia-area musicians The Hooters and Todd Rundgren headlined a concert titled &quot;Last Call&quot;. In 2010, Hall and Oates embarked on their &quot;Do What You Want, Be What You Are&quot; tour in the United States. They appeared on the &quot;American Idol&quot; season finale on May 26, 2010, performing &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot;. Also in 2010, Hall and Oates announced they would join a growing artists&#x27; boycott of the state of Arizona over the state&#x27;s recently passed anti-illegal immigrant laws.

On May 8, 2012, the two performed on the NBC reality singing competition &quot;The Voice&quot;.

=== 2013–2023: Hall of Fame induction and aborted 19th album===
On October 16, 2013, Hall and Oates were announced as 2014 nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were announced as inductees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2014 on December 16, 2013.

Hall started his monthly web series &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot; in 2007 after having the idea of &quot;playing with my friends and putting it up on the Internet&quot;. The series features him jamming with various guest musicians in his house in the woods. Guest artists on the show have run the gamut of musical styles and influences, including artists such as Smokey Robinson, Robby Krieger from The Doors, Rumer, Nick Lowe, CeeLo Green, KT Tunstall, Todd Rundgren, Darius Rucker, and Chromeo. In 2010, &quot;Live From Daryl&#x27;s House&quot; won a Webby Award in the Variety category.

In May 2014, Hall&#x27;s home renovation program, &quot;Daryl&#x27;s Restoration Over-Hall&quot;, premiered on the DIY Network. On July 15, 2014, Hall and Oates performed in Ireland as a duo for the very first time (they each performed independently as solo acts before) at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin. The event was recorded, packaged as a two CD/DVD set and released as &quot;Live in Dublin&quot; in Germany March 27, 2015, and in the US on March 30, 2015. Hall and Oates indicated that the recorded concert was also being released in movie theaters nationwide for one day only.

The duo made a cameo in the 2015 Happy Madison film &quot;Pixels&quot;. On September 2, 2016, Hall and Oates received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their work in the music industry, located at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard.

In March 2017, it was announced that they would be touring the US from May to July 2017. The 29-date arena tour was with co-headliner Tears for Fears. This included the HoagieNation festival in Philadelphia, created by Hall &amp; Oates. A &quot;celebration of everything Philly&quot;, the event was held again in 2018 and 2021. Hall &amp; Oates also headlined the BluesFest 2017 at the London O2 arena on October 28, 2017, supported by Chris Isaak. They played a Dublin concert the following night.

Between May and June 2019 they made their first tour of Latin America, visiting Argentina, Chile and Brazil. Later they performed for the first time in Spain.

In January 2020, Hall said that he was working on songs for the duo&#x27;s next album. However, in a 2021 interview, Hall said that while progress initially was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, work eventually stalled as he did not want to release anything that would become &quot;irrelevant&quot;. By the time of the interview, he was uncertain about the prospect of a new album, stating that &quot;things have changed&quot;. When asked by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about the possibility of a new album in a March 2022 interview, Hall was still uncertain, simply stating &quot;time will tell&quot;.

On April 17, 2023, longtime keyboardist Eliot Lewis took to social media to announce that he would be departing the Hall &amp; Oates band, Daryl Hall solo band, and the &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot; band to &quot;focus on [his] own music.&quot;

Hall &amp; Oates were inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame Class of 2023.

===2023–2024: Lawsuit and split===
In November 2023, Hall filed a contract lawsuit under seal to prevent Oates from selling the pair&#x27;s publishing rights, held by the pair&#x27;s Whole Oats Enterprises, to Primary Wave Music without consulting Hall. Hall received a restraining order from the court to prevent such sale until the pair had attempted to arbitrate the matter between themselves.

In April 2024, Oates said in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he had &quot;moved on&quot; from Hall and Oates and that the duo would never perform together again, with Hall confirming the same a month later in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;.

== Songwriting ==
In an interview in a 1983 issue of &quot;Juke Magazine&quot;, Oates was asked about whether conflicts arose. He replied that &quot;we have our creative differences but we reconcile them.&quot; He said that if they both came up with a different way of doing something, they&#x27;d try it both ways and whatever sounded the better of the two they would use.

In a September 2022 interview for &quot;Club Random with Bill Maher&quot;, Hall referred to Oates solely as his business partner, not his creative partner, and then listed some Hall &amp; Oates songs he actually recorded solo.

== Name ==
The duo preferred to be referenced using both their first and last names. In an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Oates said, &quot;There isn&#x27;t one album that says &quot;Hall and Oates&quot;. It&#x27;s always &quot;Daryl Hall and John Oates&quot;, from the very beginning. People never note that. The idea of &#x27;Hall and Oates&#x27;, this two-headed monster, this thing, is not anything we&#x27;ve ever wanted or liked.&quot; In a 2015 interview, Oates said that &quot;it&#x27;s a horrible name&quot; and that &quot;it was a totally conscious decision&quot; not to be known as &quot;Hall &amp; Oates&quot;. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to be the Everly Brothers, or Loggins &amp; Messina, or whatever.&quot; 

In a 2017 interview with &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, Hall explained that &quot;the reason we&#x27;ve always insisted on our full names is because we consider ourselves to be two individual artists. We&#x27;re not really a classic duo in that respect.&quot; Despite their stated dislike for the name Hall &amp; Oates, the group sued a Brooklyn-based granola company in 2015 for naming one of their products &quot;Haulin&#x27; Oats&quot;, claiming it was a &quot;well-known mark&quot; of the group.

<text>Venkateswara (, , ), also known as Venkatachalapati, Venkata, Balaji and Srinivasa, is a Hindu deity, described as a form or avatar of the god Vishnu. He is the presiding deity of Venkateswara Temple, Tirupati. His consorts, Padmavathi and Bhudevi, are avatars of the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu.

==Etymology and other names==
Venkateswara literally means &quot;Lord of Venkata&quot;. The word is a combination of the words &quot;Venkata&quot; (the name of a hill in Andhra Pradesh) and &quot;iśvara&quot; (&quot;Lord&quot;). According to the &quot;Brahmanda&quot; and &quot;Bhavishyottara&quot; Puranas, the word &quot;Venkata&quot; means &quot;destroyer of sins&quot;, deriving from the Sanskrit words &quot;vem&quot; (sins) and &quot;kata&quot; (power of immunity).

Venkateswara is known by many names such as Srinivasa (&quot;in whom Lakshmi dwells&quot;), Narayana (&quot;The Primordial One&quot;), Perumal (&quot;the great lord&quot;), Malayappa (&quot;the lord of the Hill&quot;) and Govinda (Protector of Cows). In Tamil, he is commonly called &quot;Elumalayan&quot;, meaning Lord of Seven Hills. In Telugu, he is commonly known as &quot;ఏడు కొండలవాడా,” (Ēḍu Koṇḍala Vāḍā), also meaning the Lord of the Seven Hills. In Telugu, the hill name was &#x27;Venkatam, Vēṅkaṭam&#x27;, which is another form of &#x27;Vaikuntam&#x27;, and it follows that Lord Venkateswara means Lord Vaikunteswara or God of Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha refers to the residence of Lord Vishnu. 

The Venkateswara mantra is &quot;&lt;mark&gt;Om Namo Venkateshaya&lt;/mark&gt;&quot;

==Legends==
===Birth===
Every year, hundreds of thousands of devotees donate a large amount of wealth at the Venkateswara Temple at Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. A legend provides the reason for the tradition of providing donations.

Narada once observed a few rishis performing a holy yagna. Unable to decide who the yagna should benefit, he recruited sage Bhrigu to decide after he had met with each of the Trimurti in their abodes. Bhrigu visited Brahma in Brahmaloka and Shiva in Kailasha and went unnoticed by both of these deities. He finally reached Vaikuntha and met Vishnu, who was absorbed in meditation with his feet being attended to by his consort, the goddess Lakshmi. A furious Bhrigu kicked Vishnu&#x27;s chest (the abode of Lakshmi) and angered Lakshmi. But a calm Vishnu asked for forgiveness of Bhrigu, and served the sage by massaging his legs. During this act, he squashed the extra eye that was present on the sole of Bhrigu&#x27;s foot, which destroyed the sage&#x27;s egotism. Lakshmi then departed from Vaikuntha, arrived at the region of Varaha Kshetra and performed an intense penance for twelve years, after which she was born as Padmavathi to Akasha Raja. 

After Lakshmi left, Vishnu went to Venkata Hill, sat in an anthill under a tamarind tree beside a pushkarini (lake), and started chanting the name of his wife, Mahalakshmi. He then reincarnated as Srinivasa (or presented himself after penance in the ant-hill) as the son of the elderly woman Vakula Devi, who was the rebirth of Yashoda the deity Krishna&#x27;s foster-mother. Unhappy that she had been unable to attend Krishna&#x27;s wedding to Rukmini, the deity promised that he would be reborn to her as a son, as Srinivasa.

===Marriage to Padmavathi===

Vakula Devi travelled from her hermitage to approach Akasha Raja with her proposal of marriage between Srinivasa and Padmavathi. In the meantime, the restless deity came to the city in the disguise of a fortune-teller. Princess Padmavathi also fell in love with Srinivasa and fell ill after returning to the palace. Unable to diagnose the cause of her sickness, the maids invited the fortune-teller into the palace to foretell the future of the princess. When the fortune-teller revealed that Padmavathi was born to marry Vishnu in his current avatar as Srinivasa, she recovered. As the king heard this news, Vakula announced herself to the king and asked for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage to her son, Srinivasa. The overjoyed king agreed and his advisor Brihaspati wrote the invitation for the wedding between the two deities. 

Srinivasa asked the gods for consent to his marriage with Padmavathi. The deity also obtained a large loan from Kubera, the god of wealth, towards the expenses for the wedding as well as provide proof of his wealth. According to legends, Venkateswara married Padmavathi at Kalyana Venkateswara Temple, Narayanavanam, after which they moved to Tirumala.

===Srinivasa turns into Venkateswara===
About six months after the celestial wedding, Brahma and Shiva explained to Lakshmi her consort Vishnu&#x27;s desire to be on the seven hills for the emancipation of mankind from the perpetual troubles of Kali Yuga. Lakshmi as well as her form as Padmavathi also turn into stone idols as an expression of their wish to always be with their deity. Lakshmi stays with him on the left side of his chest while Padmavathi rests on the right side of his chest.

==Iconography and symbolism==
The idol of Venkateswara has the attributes of both Vishnu and Shiva- the preserving and destroying aspects of the Hindu Trinity. The deity wears ornaments associated with Vishnu, but also ornaments such as the Naga, associated with Shiva. As such, followers believe that Venkateswara represents the vishwarup, or universal form, encompassing all of God&#x27;s forms as described in Chapter 11 of the Bhagavad Gita.

Venkateswara is known to stand for goodness. His &quot;disc&quot; is believed to annihilate evil, while the &quot;conch&quot; is presumed to produce the cosmic sound that puts an end to the world&#x27;s ignorance. Venkateswara is also known as &quot;Sat-Chit-Ananda&quot;.

== Literature ==
Venkateswara finds his mention in the Puranas, mainly in Padma Purana and Skanda Purana (as a form of Vishnu). Other Puranas also mentioned him as an avatar of Vishnu. Additionally, &quot;Sri Venkatachala Mahatmyam&quot; a text glorifies the deity and has hymns related to his worship.

&quot;Skanda Purana&quot; extols the significance of worshipping this deity:
==Worship and festivals==
Venkateshwara, an aspect of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the Tirupati temple. It is believed that the deity is &quot;Swayambhu&quot; (self manifested). Ten &quot;Puranas&quot; state that Tirupati is a form of Lord Vishnu. Even deity appears similar to 108 Divya Desams - Vaishnava temple Vishnu deities. The deity is believed to be as old as the &quot;Shila thoranam&quot; in Tirumala. Tirumala has tremendous fame from the ancient period. The deity is referred to as &#x27;Balaji&#x27; by North Indians. The scriptures state that Venkateshwara is the saviour of all suffering people in the Kali Yuga.

In the 12th century, Ramanuja visited Tirupati to settle a dispute that had arisen between the Shaivites and Vaishnavites regarding the nature of the deity set up in the Tirumala temple. Until that, Deity was worshipped as Shiva for six months and Vishnu as another six months in a year. Ramanuja streamlined the rituals at Tirumala temple according to Vaikanasa Agama tradition, and introduced the recitation of the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. He also set up the Tirupati Jeeyar Matha in 1119 AD, in consultation with Tirumalai Ananthalwan to institutionalise service to the deity and supervise the temple rituals. The Jeeyars, to this day, ensures that the rituals ordained by Ramanuja are observed. 

===The five deities===
According to the Vaikhanasa Agamas, Venkateswara is represented by five deities (berams) including the Moolavirat, which are together referred to as the Pancha beramulu in Telugu (pancha means five; beram means deity). The five deities are Dhruva Beram (Moolavar), Kautuka Beram, Snapana Beram, Utsava Beram, and Bali Beram. All the pancha berams are placed in the Garbha griha under Ananda Nilayam.

#Moolavirat (Chief deity) or Dhruva Beram: In the centre of the Garbha griha, under the Ananda Nilayam Vimana, the Moolavirat of Venkateswara is seen in a standing posture on a lotus base, with four arms, two holding shanka and chakra, one in the Varada posture, and the other in the Kati posture. This deity is considered the main source of energy for the temple, and is adorned with the Vaishnavite nama and jewels, including vajra kiritam (diamond crown), Makarakundalas, Nagabharana, Makara Kanti, Saligrama haram, Lakshmi haram. Venkateswara&#x27;s consort, Lakshmi, stays on the chest of the Moolavirat as Vyuha Lakshmi.
#Bhoga Srinivasa or Kautuka Beram: This is a small one-foot (0.3 m) silver deity that was given to the temple in 614 AD by the Pallava queen, Samavai, for conducting festivals. Bhoga Srinivasa is always placed near the left foot of Moolavirat, and is believed to always be connected to the main deity by the holy &quot;Sambandha Kroocha&quot;. This deity receives many daily sevas (pleasures) on behalf of Moolavar, and is hence known as Bhoga Srinivasa (Bhoga: pleasure). This deity receives Ekanthaseva daily (the last ritual of the day), and Sahasra Kalasabhisheka (a special abhishekam (ablution) with sacred waters in 1008 kalashas (pots)) on Wednesdays.
#Ugra Srinivasa or Snapana Beram: This deity represents the fearsome (Ugra: terrible) aspect of Venkateswara. This deity was the main processional deity until 1330 CE, when it was replaced by the Malayappa Swami deity. Ugra Srinivasa remains inside the sanctum sanctorum, and is carried out on a procession only one day in a year, on &quot;Kaishika Dwadasi,&quot; before the sunrise. This deity receives daily &quot;abhishekam&quot; on behalf of Moolavirat, offering it the name Snapana Beram (Snapana: cleansing)
#Malayappa Swami or Utsava Beram: Malayappa is the processional deity (Utsava beram) of the temple, and is always flanked by the idols of his consorts, Sridevi and Bhudevi. This deity receives veneration on all festivals, like Brahmotsavams, Kalyanotsavam, Dolotsavam, Vasanthotsavam, Sahasra deepalankarana seva, Padmavati parinyotsavams, pushpapallaki, Anivara asthanam, Ugadi asthanam, etc.
#Koluvu Srinivasa or Bali Beram: Koluvu Srinivasa represents the Bali Beram. Koluvu Srinivasa is regarded as the guardian deity of the temple, that presides over its financial and economic affairs. Daily Koluvu seva (Koluvu: engaged in) is held in the morning, during which the previous day&#x27;s offerings, income, expenditures. are notified to this deity, with a presentation of accounts. Panchanga sravanam is also held at the same time, during which that particular day&#x27;s tithi, sunrise and sunset time, and nakshatra. are notified to Venkateshwara.

===Festivals===
In the Venkateswara Temple over 433 festivals are being observed in 365 days of a year suiting the title &quot;Nitya Kalyanam Paccha Toranam&quot; where every day is a festival.

====Sri Venkateswara Brahmotsavams====
Sri Venkateswara Brahmotsavams, a nine-day event, which is celebrated every year during month of October, is the major event of Venkateswara Temple. During brahmotsavams the processional deity Malayappa along with his consorts SriDevi and BhuDevi, is taken in a procession in four mada streets around the temple on different vahanams.

Ratha Saptami, is another festival, celebrated during February, when Venkateswara&#x27;s processional deity (Malayappa) is taken in a procession around the temple on seven different vahanams starting from early morning to late night.

==Hymns==
The Venkateswara Suprabhatam is the first and pre-dawn prayer performed to Venkateswara at Sayana Mandapam, within the inner sanctum of the Tirumala Temple. &#x27;Suprabhatam&#x27; is a Sanskrit term, which literally means &#x27;morning salutations&#x27;, and is meant to wake up the deity from his celestial sleep. The Venkateswara Suprabhatam hymns were composed by Prathivadhi Bhayankaram Annangaracharya during the 13th century, and consist of 70 slokas in four parts, including Suprabhatam (29), Stotram (11), Prapatti (14), and Mangalasasanam (16).

The Dayashataka, a Sanskrit work containing ten decads, was composed by the philosopher Vedanta Desika in praise of the deity.

Tallapaka Annamacharya (Annamayya), the poet saint of the 14th century, one of the greatest Telugu poets and a great devotee of Venkateswara, had sung 32,000 songs in praise of Venkateswara. All his songs, which are in Telugu and Sanskrit, are referred to as Sankirtanas and are classified as Sringara Sankirtanalu and Adhyatma Sankirtanalu.
