<text>Joseph Hooker (November 13, 1814 – October 31, 1879) was an American Civil War general for the Union, chiefly remembered for his decisive defeat by Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863.

Hooker had served in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican–American War, receiving three brevet promotions, before resigning from the Army. At the start of the Civil War, he joined the Union side as a brigadier general, distinguishing himself at Williamsburg, Antietam and Fredericksburg, after which he was given command of the Army of the Potomac.

His ambitious plan for Chancellorsville was thwarted by Lee&#x27;s bold move in dividing his army and routing a Union corps, as well as by mistakes on the part of Hooker&#x27;s subordinate generals and his own loss of nerve. The defeat handed Lee the initiative, which allowed him to travel north to Gettysburg.

Hooker was kept in command, but when General Halleck and Lincoln declined his request for reinforcements, he resigned. George G. Meade was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac three days before Gettysburg.

Hooker returned to combat in November 1863, helping to relieve the besieged Union Army at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and continuing in the Western Theater under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, but departed in protest before the end of the Atlanta Campaign when he was passed over for promotion.

Hooker became known as &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; following a journalist&#x27;s clerical error, and the nickname stuck. His personal reputation was as a hard-drinking ladies&#x27; man, and his headquarters was known for parties and gambling.

==Early years==
Hooker was born in Hadley, Massachusetts, the grandson of a captain in the American Revolutionary War. He was of entirely English ancestry, all of whom had been in New England since the early 1600s. His initial schooling was at the local Hopkins Academy. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1837, ranked 29th out of a class of 50, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery. His initial assignment was in Florida fighting in the second of the Seminole Wars. He served in the Mexican–American War in staff positions in the campaigns of both Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. He received brevet promotions for his staff leadership and gallantry in three battles: Monterrey (to captain), National Bridge (major), and Chapultepec (lieutenant colonel). His future Army reputation as a ladies&#x27; man began in Mexico, where local women referred to him as the &quot;Handsome Captain&quot;.

After the Mexican–American War (which ended in 1848), he served as an assistant adjutant general of the Pacific Division, but resigned his commission in 1853; his military reputation had been damaged when he testified against his former commander, General Scott, in the court-martial for insubordination of Gideon Johnson Pillow. The Handsome Captain struggled with the tedium of peacetime life and reportedly passed the time with liquor, ladies, and gambling. He settled in Sonoma County, California, as a farmer and land developer, and ran unsuccessfully for election to represent the region in the California legislature. He was obviously unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because, in 1858, he wrote to Secretary of War John B. Floyd to request that his name &quot;be presented to president Buchanan as a candidate for a lieutenant colonelcy&quot;, but nothing came of his request. From 1859 to 1861, he held a commission as a colonel in the California militia.

==Civil War==
At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Hooker requested a commission, but his first application was rejected, possibly because of the lingering resentment harbored by Winfield Scott, general-in-chief of the Army. He had to borrow money to make the trip east from California. After he witnessed the Union Army defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, he wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln that complained of military mismanagement, promoted his own qualifications, and again requested a commission. He was appointed, in August 1861, as brigadier general of volunteers to rank from May 17. He commanded a brigade and then division around Washington, D.C., as part of the effort to organize and train the new Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.

===1862===

In the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, Hooker commanded the 2nd Division of the III Corps and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields. He led his division with distinction at Williamsburg and at Seven Pines. Hooker&#x27;s division did not play a major role in the Seven Days Battles, although he and fellow division commander Phil Kearny tried unsuccessfully to urge McClellan to counterattack the Confederates. He chafed at the cautious generalship of McClellan and openly criticized his failure to capture Richmond. Of his commander, Hooker said, &quot;He is not only not a soldier, but he does not know what soldiership is.&quot; The Peninsula cemented two further reputations of Hooker&#x27;s: his devotion to the welfare and morale of his men, and his hard-drinking social life, even on the battlefield.

On July 26, Hooker was promoted to major general, ranked from May 5. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, the III Corps was sent to reinforce John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia. Following Second Bull Run, Hooker replaced Irvin McDowell as commander of the Army of Virginia&#x27;s III Corps, which soon redesignated the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. During the Maryland Campaign, Hooker led the I Corps at South Mountain and at Antietam, his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in American history, driving south into the corps of Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson, where they fought each other to a standstill. Hooker, aggressive and inspiring to his men, left the battle early in the morning with a foot wound. He asserted that the battle would have been a decisive Union victory if he had managed to stay on the field, but General McClellan&#x27;s caution once again failed the Northern troops and Lee&#x27;s much smaller army eluded destruction. With his patience at an end, President Lincoln replaced McClellan with Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Although Hooker had criticized McClellan persistently, the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early October, shortly before his termination, had recommended that Hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army. The War Department promptly acted on this recommendation, and Hooker received his brigadier&#x27;s commission to rank from September 20. This promotion ensured that he would remain a general after the war was over, retire a general, and be entitled to a general&#x27;s pay and pension.

The December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg was another Union debacle. Upon recovering from his foot wound, Hooker was briefly made commander of V Corps but was then promoted to &quot;Grand Division&quot; command, with a command that consisted of both III and V Corps. Hooker derided Burnside&#x27;s plan to assault the fortified heights behind the city, deeming them &quot;preposterous&quot;. His Grand Division (particularly V Corps) suffered serious losses in fourteen futile assaults ordered by Burnside over Hooker&#x27;s protests. Burnside followed up this battle with the humiliating Mud March in January and Hooker&#x27;s criticism of his commander bordered on formal insubordination. He described Burnside as a &quot;wretch ... of blundering sacrifice.&quot; Burnside planned a wholesale purge of his subordinates, including Hooker, and drafted an order for the president&#x27;s approval. He stated that Hooker was &quot;unfit to hold an important commission during a crisis like the present.&quot; But Lincoln&#x27;s patience had again run out and he removed Burnside instead.

===Army of the Potomac===

Lincoln appointed Hooker to command of the Army of the Potomac on January 26, 1863. Some members of the army saw this move as inevitable, given Hooker&#x27;s reputation for aggressive fighting, something sorely lacking in his predecessors. During the &quot;Mud March&quot; Hooker was quoted by a &quot;New York Times&quot; army correspondent as saying that &quot;Nothing would go right until we had a dictator, and the sooner the better.&quot; Lincoln wrote a letter to the newly appointed general, part of which stated,

During the spring of 1863, Hooker established a reputation as an outstanding administrator and restored the morale of his soldiers, which had plummeted to a new low under Burnside. Among his changes were fixes to the daily diet of the troops (by issuing flour or soft bread 4 times a week, fresh onions or potatoes twice a week and desiccated vegetables once a week) , camp sanitary changes (such as regular airing of bedding, men having to bathe twice a week), improvements and accountability of the quartermaster system, addition of and monitoring of company cooks, several hospital reforms, and an improved furlough system (two man per company by lot, 10 days for mid-Atlantic states, 15 days to northern and western states). He created the Bureau of Military Information, which was the first all-source intelligence organization employed by the U.S. military. He also implemented corps badges as a means of identifying units during battle or when marching and to instill unit pride in the men. Other orders addressed the need to stem rising desertion (one from Lincoln combined with incoming mail review, the ability to shoot deserters, and better camp picket lines), more and better drills, stronger officer training, and for the first time, combining the federal cavalry into a single corps. The corps badge idea was suggested by Hooker&#x27;s chief of staff, Daniel Butterfield. Hooker said of his revived army:

Also during this winter, Hooker made several high-level command changes, including with his corps commanders. Both &quot;Left Grand Division&quot; commander Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, who vowed that he would not serve under Hooker, and II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner was relieved of command, on Burnside&#x27;s recommendation, in the same order appointing Hooker to command. The IX Corps was a potential source of embarrassment or friction within the army because it was Burnside&#x27;s old corps, so it was detached as a separate organization and sent to the Virginia Peninsula under the command of Brig. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, former commander of VI Corps. (Both Franklin and Smith were considered suspect by Hooker because of their previous political maneuvering against Burnside and on behalf of McClellan.)

For the important position of chief of staff, Hooker asked the War Department to send him Brig. Gen. Charles Stone, however, this was denied. Stone had been relieved, arrested, and imprisoned for his role in the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff in the fall of 1861, despite the lack of any trial. Stone did not receive a command upon his release, mostly due to political pressures, which left him militarily exiled and disgraced. Army of the Potomac historian and author Bruce Catton termed this request by Hooker &quot;a strange and seemingly uncharacteristic thing&quot; and &quot;one of the most interesting things he ever did.&quot; Hooker never explained why he asked for Stone, but Catton believed:

Despite this, Fighting Joe would set a very bad example for the conduct of generals and their staff and subordinates. His headquarters in Falmouth, Virginia, was described by cavalry officer Charles F. Adams, Jr., as being a combination of a &quot;bar-room and a brothel&quot;. He built a network of loyal political cronies that included Maj. Gen. Dan Butterfield for chief of staff, and the notorious political general, Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles, for command of the III Corps.

====Chancellorsville====
Hooker&#x27;s plan for the spring and summer campaign was both elegant and promising. He first planned to send his cavalry corps deep into the enemy&#x27;s rear, disrupting supply lines and distracting him from the main attack. He would pin down Robert E. Lee&#x27;s much smaller army at Fredericksburg while taking the large bulk of the Army of the Potomac on a flanking march to strike Lee in his rear. Defeating Lee, he could move on to seize Richmond. Unfortunately for Hooker and the Union, the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself. The cavalry raid was conducted cautiously by its commander, Brig. Gen. George Stoneman, and met none of its objectives. The flanking march went well enough, achieving strategic surprise, but when he attempted to advance with three columns, Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s surprise attack on May 1 pushed Hooker back and caused him to withdraw his troops. From there, Hooker pulled his army back to Chancellorsville and waited for Lee to attack. Lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of Hooker&#x27;s army. Then, he split again, sending Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s corps on its own flanking march, striking Hooker&#x27;s exposed right flank and routing the Union XI Corps. The Army of the Potomac dropped into a purely defensive mode and eventually was forced to retreat.

The Battle of Chancellorsville has been called &quot;Lee&#x27;s perfect battle&quot; because of his ability to vanquish a much larger foe through audacious tactics. Part of Hooker&#x27;s failure can be attributed to an encounter with a cannonball; while he was standing on the porch of his headquarters, the missile struck a wooden column against which he was leaning, initially knocking him senseless, and then putting him out of action for the rest of the day with a concussion. Despite his incapacitation, he refused entreaties to turn over temporary command of the army to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch. Several of his subordinate generals, including Couch and Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, openly questioned Hooker&#x27;s command decisions. Couch was so disgusted that he refused to ever serve under Hooker again. Political winds blew strongly in the following weeks as generals maneuvered to overthrow Hooker or to position themselves if Lincoln decided on his own to do so.

Robert E. Lee once again began an invasion of the North, in June 1863, and Lincoln urged Hooker to pursue and defeat him. Hooker&#x27;s initial plan was to seize Richmond instead, but Lincoln immediately vetoed that idea, so the Army of the Potomac began to march north, attempting to locate Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia as it slipped down the Shenandoah Valley into Pennsylvania. Hooker&#x27;s mission was first to protect Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and second to intercept and defeat Lee. Unfortunately, Lincoln was losing any remaining confidence he had in Hooker. Hooker&#x27;s senior officers expressed to Lincoln their lack of confidence in Hooker, as did Henry W. Halleck, Lincoln&#x27;s General-in-chief. When Hooker got into a dispute with Army headquarters over the status of defensive forces in Harpers Ferry, he impulsively offered his resignation in protest, which was quickly accepted by Lincoln and Halleck. On June 28, 1863, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. George Meade. Hooker received the Thanks of Congress for his role at the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, but the glory would go to Meade. Hooker&#x27;s tenure as head of the Army of the Potomac had lasted 5 months.

===Western Theater===
Hooker&#x27;s military career was not ended by his poor performance in the summer of 1863. He went on to regain a reputation as a solid corps commander when he was transferred with the XI and XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac westward to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland around Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hooker was in command at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, playing an important role in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Chattanooga. He was brevetted to major general in the regular army for his success at Chattanooga, but he was disappointed to find that Grant&#x27;s official report of the battle credited William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s contribution over Hooker&#x27;s.

Hooker led his corps (now designated the XX Corps) competently in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign under Sherman but when Army of the Tennessee commander James B. McPherson was killed in July during the battles around Atlanta, Sherman appointed XI Corps commander Oliver O. Howard to command the army instead. Hooker was offended at this gesture as he outranked Howard and had blamed him for the defeat at Chancellorsville. He also had very poor relations with XII Corps commander Henry W. Slocum ever since that battle and Slocum was relieved at being reassigned and sent to command the Vicksburg garrison. Sherman did not have a very positive opinion of Hooker and readily accepted his resignation. Upon hearing of Hooker&#x27;s protests at being turned down for army command despite his seniority, Grant remarked &quot;A major general is only entitled to command of a division.&quot; Hooker&#x27;s biographer reports that there were numerous stories indicating that Abraham Lincoln attempted to intercede with Sherman, urging that Hooker be appointed to command the Army of the Tennessee, but Sherman threatened to resign if the president insisted. However, due to &quot;obvious gaps&quot; in the Official Records, the story cannot be verified.

After leaving Georgia, Hooker commanded the Northern Department (comprising the states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois), headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, from October 1, 1864, until the end of the war. While in Cincinnati he married Olivia Groesbeck, sister of Congressman William S. Groesbeck.

==Final years==

After the war, Hooker led Lincoln&#x27;s funeral procession in Springfield on May 4, 1865. He served in command of the Department of the East and Department of the Lakes following the war. His postbellum life was marred by poor health and he was partially paralyzed by a stroke. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on September 1, 1866, and retired from the U.S. Army on October 15, 1868, with the regular army rank of major general. He died on October 31, 1879, while on a visit to Garden City, New York, and is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio, his wife&#x27;s hometown.

==Legacy==
Hooker was popularly known as &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker, a nickname he regretted deeply; he said, &quot;People will think I am a highwayman or a bandit.&quot; When a newspaper dispatch arrived in New York during the Peninsula Campaign, a typographical error changed the entry &quot;Fighting – Joe Hooker Attacks Rebels&quot; to remove the dash and the name stuck. Robert E. Lee occasionally referred to him as &quot;Mr. F. J. Hooker&quot; in a mildly sarcastic jab at his opponent.

Hooker&#x27;s reputation as a hard-drinking ladies&#x27; man was established through rumors in the pre-Civil War Army and has been cited by a number of popular histories. Biographer Walter H. Hebert describes the general&#x27;s personal habits as the &quot;subject of much debate&quot; although there was little debate in the popular opinion of the time. His men parodied Hooker in the popular war song &quot;Marching Along&quot;. The lines

were replaced by

Historian Stephen W. Sears, however, states that there is no basis for the claims that Hooker was a heavy drinker or that he was ever intoxicated on the battlefield.
There is a popular legend that &quot;hooker&quot; as a slang term for a prostitute is derived from his last name because of parties and a lack of military discipline at his headquarters near the Murder Bay district of Washington, DC. Some versions of the legend claim that the band of prostitutes that followed his division was derisively referred to as &quot;General Hooker&#x27;s Army&quot; or &quot;Hooker&#x27;s Brigade&quot;. However, the term &quot;hooker&quot; was used in print as early as 1845, years before Hooker was a public figure, and is likely derived from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the Corlear&#x27;s Hook area of Manhattan in the early to middle 19th century, who came to be referred to as &quot;hookers&quot;. The prevalence of the Hooker legend may have been at least partly responsible for the popularity of the term. There is some evidence that an area in Washington, DC, known for prostitution during the Civil War, was referred to as &quot;Hooker&#x27;s Division&quot;. The name was shortened to &quot;The Division&quot; when he spent time there after First Bull Run guarding D.C. against incursion.

There is an equestrian statue of General Hooker outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston, and Hooker County in Nebraska is named for him.

In Sonoma, where he settled before the Civil War, his historic house near Sonoma Plaza currently houses a winery office and tasting room, and a thoroughfare in nearby Agua Caliente is named Hooker Avenue in his honor.

<doc id="171484" wikidata="Q5100932" url="?curid=171484" title="Chinese social relations">
<text>Chinese social relations are typified by a reciprocal social network. Often social obligations within the network are characterized in familial terms. The individual link within the social network is known by &quot;guanxi&quot; (关系/關係) and the feeling within the link is known by the term &quot;ganqing&quot; (感情). An important concept within Chinese social relations is the concept of face, as in many other Asian cultures. A Buddhist-related concept is &quot;yuanfen&quot; (缘分/緣分).

As articulated in the sociological works of leading Chinese academic Fei Xiaotong, the Chinese—in contrast to other societies—tend to see social relations in terms of networks rather than boxes. Hence, people are perceived as being &quot;near&quot; or &quot;far&quot; rather than &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot;.

<doc id="171486" wikidata="Q436790" url="?curid=171486" title="Horace Greeley">
<text>Horace Greeley (February 3, 1811 – November 29, 1872) was an American newspaper editor and publisher who was the founder and editor of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. Long active in politics, he served briefly as a congressman from New York and was the unsuccessful candidate of the new Liberal Republican Party in the 1872 presidential election against incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant, who won by a landslide.

Greeley was born to a poor family in Amherst, New Hampshire. He was apprenticed to a printer in Vermont and went to New York City in 1831 to seek his fortune. He wrote for or edited several publications, involved himself in Whig Party politics, and took a significant part in William Henry Harrison&#x27;s successful 1840 presidential campaign.

The following year, Greeley founded the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which became the highest-circulating newspaper in the country through weekly editions sent by mail. Among many other issues, he urged the settlement of the American Old West, which he saw as a land of opportunity for the young and the unemployed. He popularized the slogan &quot;Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.&quot; He endlessly promoted radical reforms such as socialism, vegetarianism, agrarianism, feminism, and temperance and hired the best talent that he could find.

Greeley&#x27;s alliance with William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed led to his serving three months in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he angered many by investigating Congress in his newspaper. In 1854, he helped found the Republican Party. Republican newspapers across the nation regularly reprinted his editorials. During the Civil War, he mostly supported President Abraham Lincoln but urged him to commit to the end of slavery before Lincoln was willing to do so. After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, he supported the Radical Republicans in opposition to President Andrew Johnson. He broke with the Radicals and with Republican President Ulysses Grant because of the party&#x27;s corruption and Greeley&#x27;s view that Reconstruction-era policies were no longer needed.

Greeley was the new Liberal Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1872. He lost in a landslide despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party. He was devastated by the death of his wife five days before the election and died one month later, prior to the meeting of the Electoral College.

==Early life==

Greeley was born on February 3, 1811, on a small farm about five miles from Amherst, New Hampshire. He could not breathe for the first twenty minutes of his life. It is suggested that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger&#x27;s syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. His father&#x27;s family was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, while his mother&#x27;s family descended from Scots-Irish immigrants from the village of Garvagh in County Londonderry who had settled Londonderry, New Hampshire. Some of Greeley&#x27;s maternal ancestors were present at the siege of Derry during the Williamite War in Ireland in 1689.

Greeley was the son of poor farmers Zaccheus and Mary (Woodburn) Greeley. Zaccheus was not successful, and moved his family several times, as far west as Pennsylvania. Horace attended the local schools and was a brilliant student.

Seeing the boy&#x27;s intelligence, some neighbors offered to pay Horace&#x27;s way at Phillips Exeter Academy, but the Greeleys did not want to accept charity. In 1820, Zaccheus&#x27;s financial reverses caused him to flee New Hampshire with his family lest he be imprisoned for debt, and settle in Vermont. Even as his father struggled to make a living as a hired hand, Horace Greeley read everything he could—the Greeleys had a neighbor who let Horace use his library. In 1822, Horace ran away from home to become a printer&#x27;s apprentice, but was told he was too young.

In 1826, at age 15, Greeley was made a printer&#x27;s apprentice to Amos Bliss, editor of the &quot;Northern Spectator&quot;, a newspaper in East Poultney, Vermont. There, he learned the mechanics of a printer&#x27;s job, and acquired a reputation as the town encyclopedia, reading his way through the local library. When the paper closed in 1830, the young man went west to join his family, living near Erie, Pennsylvania. He remained there only briefly, going from town to town seeking newspaper employment, and was hired by the &quot;Erie Gazette&quot;. Although ambitious for greater things, he remained until 1831 to help support his father. While there, he became a Universalist, breaking from his Congregationalist upbringing.

==First efforts at publishing==

In late 1831, Greeley went to New York City to seek his fortune. There were many young printers in New York who had likewise come to the metropolis, and he could only find short-term work. In 1832, Greeley worked as an employee of the publication &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;. He built his resources and set up a print shop in that year. In 1833, he tried his hand with Horatio D. Sheppard at editing a daily newspaper, the &quot;New York Morning Post&quot;, which was not a success. Despite this failure and its attendant financial loss, Greeley published the thrice-weekly &quot;Constitutionalist&quot;, which mostly printed lottery results.

On March 22, 1834, he published the first issue of &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; in partnership with Jonas Winchester. It was less expensive than other literary magazines of the time and published both contemporary ditties and political commentary. Circulation reached 9,000, then a sizable number, yet it was ill-managed and eventually fell victim to the economic Panic of 1837. He also published the campaign newssheet of the new Whig Party in New York for the 1834 campaign, and came to believe in its positions, including free markets with government assistance in developing the nation.

Soon after his move to New York City, Greeley met Mary Young Cheney. Both were living at a boarding house run on the diet principles of Sylvester Graham, eschewing meat, alcohol, coffee, tea, and spices, as well as abstaining from the use of tobacco. Greeley was subscribing to Graham&#x27;s principles at the time, and to the end of his life rarely ate meat. Mary Cheney, a schoolteacher, moved to North Carolina to take a teaching job in 1835. They were married in Warrenton, North Carolina, on July 5, 1836, and an announcement duly appeared in &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; eleven days later. Greeley had stopped over in Washington, D.C., on his way south to observe Congress. He took no honeymoon with his new wife, returning to work while his wife took up a teaching job in New York City.

One of the positions taken by &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; was that the unemployed of the cities should seek lives in the developing American West (in the 1830s, the West encompassed today&#x27;s Midwestern states). The harsh winter of 1836–1837 and the financial crisis that developed soon after made many New Yorkers homeless and destitute. In his journal, Greeley urged new immigrants to buy guide books on the West, and Congress to make public lands available for purchase at cheap rates to settlers. He told his readers, &quot;Fly, scatter through the country, go to the Great West, anything rather than remain here ... the West is the true destination.&quot; In 1838, he advised &quot;any young man&quot; about to start in the world, &quot;Go to the West: there your capabilities are sure to be appreciated and your energy and industry rewarded.&quot;

In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed spoke for a liberal faction of the Whigs in his newspaper, the Albany &quot;Evening Journal&quot;. He hired Greeley as editor of the state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the &quot;Jeffersonian&quot;, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit.

Greeley was deeply involved in the campaign of the Whig candidate for president in 1840, William Henry Harrison. He published the major Whig periodical, the &quot;Log Cabin&quot;, and also wrote many of the pro-Harrison songs that marked the campaign. These songs were sung at mass meetings, many organized and led by Greeley. According to biographer Robert C. Williams, &quot;Greeley&#x27;s lyrics swept the country and roused Whig voters to action.&quot; Funds raised by Weed helped distribute the &quot;Log Cabin&quot; widely. Harrison and his running mate John Tyler were easily elected.

==Editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;==
===Early years (1841–1848)===

By the end of the 1840 campaign, the &quot;Log Cabin&quot;&#x27;s circulation had risen to 80,000 and Greeley decided to establish a daily newspaper, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. At the time, New York had many newspapers, dominated by James Gordon Bennett&#x27;s &quot;New York Herald&quot;, which, with a circulation of about 55,000, had more readers than its combined competition. As technology advanced, it became cheaper and easier to publish a newspaper, and the daily press came to dominate the weekly, which had once been the more common format for news periodicals. Greeley borrowed money from friends to get started, and published the first issue of the &quot;Tribune&quot; on April 10, 1841—the day of a memorial parade in New York for President Harrison, who had died after a month in office and been replaced by Vice President Tyler.

In the first issue, Greeley promised that his newspaper would be a &quot;new morning Journal of Politics, Literature, and General Intelligence&quot;. New Yorkers were not initially receptive; the first week&#x27;s receipts were $92 and expenses $525. The paper was sold for a cent a copy by newsboys who purchased bundles of papers at a discount. The price of advertising was initially four cents a line but was quickly raised to six cents. Through the 1840s, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was four pages, that is, a single sheet folded. It initially had 600 subscribers and 5,000 copies were sold of the first issue.

In the early days, Greeley&#x27;s chief assistant was Henry J. Raymond, who a decade later founded &quot;The New York Times&quot;. To place the &quot;Tribune&quot; on a sound financial footing, Greeley sold a half-interest in it to attorney Thomas McElrath (1807–1888), who became publisher of the &quot;Tribune&quot; (Greeley was editor) and ran the business side. Politically, the &quot;Tribune&quot; backed Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, who had unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination that fell to Harrison, and supported Clay&#x27;s American System for development of the country. Greeley was one of the first newspaper editors to have a full-time correspondent in Washington, an innovation quickly followed by his rivals. Part of Greeley&#x27;s strategy was to make the &quot;Tribune&quot; a newspaper of national scope, not merely local. One factor in establishing the paper nationally was the &quot;Weekly Tribune&quot;, created in September 1841 when the &quot;Log Cabin&quot; and &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; were merged. With an initial subscription price of $2 a year, this was sent to many across the United States by mail and was especially popular in the Midwest. In December 1841, Greeley was offered the editorship of the national Whig newspaper, the &quot;Madisonian&quot;. He demanded full control, and declined when not given it.

Greeley, in his paper, initially supported the Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, he supported the Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay&#x27;s behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of &quot;The New-Yorker&quot; in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.

Greeley hired Margaret Fuller in 1844 as first literary editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, for which she wrote over 200 articles. She lived with the Greeley family for several years, and when she moved to Italy, he made her a foreign correspondent. He promoted the work of Henry David Thoreau, serving as literary agent and seeing to it that Thoreau&#x27;s work was published. Ralph Waldo Emerson also benefited from Greeley&#x27;s promotion. Historian Allan Nevins explained:

Greeley, who had met his wife at a Graham boarding house, became enthusiastic about other social movements that did not last and promoted them in his paper. He subscribed to the views of Charles Fourier, a French social thinker, then recently deceased, who proposed the establishment of settlements called &quot;phalanxes&quot; with a given number of people from various walks of life, who would function as a corporation and among whose members profits would be shared. Greeley, in addition to promoting Fourierism in the &quot;Tribune&quot;, was associated with two such settlements, both of which eventually failed, though the town that eventually developed on the site of the one in Pennsylvania was after his death renamed Greeley.

===Congressman (1848–1849)===
In November 1848, Congressman David S. Jackson, a Democrat, of New York&#x27;s 6th district was unseated for election fraud. Jackson&#x27;s term was to expire in March 1849 but, during the 19th century, Congress convened annually in December, making it important to fill the seat. Under the laws then in force, the Whig committee from the Sixth District chose Greeley to run in the special election for the remainder of the term, though they did not select him as their candidate for the seat in the following Congress. The Sixth District, or Sixth Ward as it was commonly called, was mostly Irish-American, and Greeley proclaimed his support for Irish efforts towards independence from the United Kingdom. He easily won the November election and took his seat when Congress convened in December 1848. Greeley&#x27;s selection was procured by the influence of his ally, Thurlow Weed.

As a congressman for three months, Greeley introduced legislation for a homestead act that would allow settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This was enough to make him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported a bill that would have corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had &quot;divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied without a hand in doing it.&quot;

Other legislation introduced by Greeley, all of which failed, included attempts to end flogging in the Navy and to ban alcohol from its ships. He tried to change the name of the United States to &quot;Columbia&quot;, abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and increase tariffs. One lasting effect of the term of Congressman Greeley was his friendship with a fellow Whig, serving his only term in the House, Illinois&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln. Greeley&#x27;s term ended after March 3, 1849, and he returned to New York and the &quot;Tribune&quot;, having, according to Williams, &quot;failed to achieve much except notoriety&quot;.

===Influence (1849–1860)===
By the end of the 1840s, Greeley&#x27;s &quot;Tribune&quot; was not only solidly established in New York as a daily paper, it was highly influential nationally through its weekly edition, which circulated in rural areas and small towns. Journalist Bayard Taylor deemed its influence in the Midwest second only to that of the Bible. According to Williams, the &quot;Tribune&quot; could mold public opinion through Greeley&#x27;s editorials more effectively than could the president. Greeley sharpened those skills over time, laying down what future Secretary of State John Hay, who worked for the &quot;Tribune&quot; in the 1870s, deemed the &quot;Gospel according to St. Horace&quot;.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; remained a Whig paper, but Greeley took an independent course. In 1848, he had been slow to endorse the Whig presidential nominee, General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan and hero of the Mexican–American War. Greeley opposed both the war and the expansion of slavery into the new territories seized from Mexico and feared Taylor would support expansion as president. Greeley considered endorsing former President Martin Van Buren, candidate of the Free Soil Party, but finally endorsed Taylor, who was elected; the editor was rewarded for his loyalty with the congressional term. Greeley vacillated on support for the Compromise of 1850, which gave victories to both sides of the slavery issue, before finally opposing it. In the 1852 presidential campaign, he supported the Whig candidate, General Winfield Scott, but savaged the Whig platform for its support of the Compromise. &quot;We defy it, execrate it, spit upon it.&quot; Such party divisions contributed to Scott&#x27;s defeat by former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce.

In 1853, with the party increasingly divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper&#x27;s identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not sorry to see him go: the &quot;Republic&quot;, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: &quot;If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions.&quot; When, in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas–Nebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to decide whether it would be slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the &quot;Tribune&quot; as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the &quot;Tribune&quot; reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the Civil War.

The Kansas–Nebraska Act helped destroy the Whig Party, but a new party with opposition to the spread of slavery at its heart had been under discussion for some years. Beginning in 1853, Greeley participated in the discussions that led to the founding of the Republican Party and may have coined its name. Greeley attended the first New York state Republican Convention in 1854 and was disappointed not to be nominated either for governor or lieutenant governor. The switch in parties coincided with the end of two of his longtime political alliances: in December 1854, Greeley wrote that the political partnership between Weed, William Seward (who was by then senator after serving as governor) and himself was ended &quot;by the withdrawal of the junior partner&quot;. Greeley was angered over patronage disputes and felt that Seward was courting the rival &quot;The New York Times&quot; for support.

In 1853, Greeley purchased a farm in rural Chappaqua, New York, where he experimented with farming techniques. In 1856, he designed and built Rehoboth, one of the first concrete structures in the United States. In 1856, Greeley published a campaign biography by an anonymous author for the first Republican presidential candidate, John C. Frémont.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; continued to print a wide variety of material. In 1851, its managing editor, Charles A. Dana, recruited Karl Marx as a foreign correspondent in London. Marx collaborated with Friedrich Engels on his work for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which continued for over a decade, covering 500 articles. Greeley felt compelled to print, &quot;Mr. Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far from agreeing, but those who do not read his letters are neglecting one of the most instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European politics.&quot;

Greeley sponsored a host of reforms, including pacifism and feminism and especially the ideal of the hard-working free laborer. Greeley demanded reforms to make all citizens free and equal. He envisioned virtuous citizens who would eradicate corruption. He talked endlessly about progress, improvement, and freedom, while calling for harmony between labor and capital. Greeley&#x27;s editorials promoted social democratic reforms and were widely reprinted. They influenced the free-labor ideology of the Whigs and the radical wing of the Republican Party, especially in promoting the free-labor ideology. Before 1848 he sponsored an American version of Fourierist socialist reform. but backed away after the failed revolutions of 1848 in Europe. To promote multiple reforms Greeley hired a roster of writers who later became famous in their own right, including Margaret Fuller, Charles A. Dana, George William Curtis, William Henry Fry, Bayard Taylor, Julius Chambers, and Henry Jarvis Raymond, who later co-founded &quot;The New York Times&quot;. For many years George Ripley was the staff literary critic. Jane Swisshelm was one of the first women hired by a major newspaper.

In 1859, Greeley traveled across the continent to see the West for himself, to write about it for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and to publicize the need for a transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. In May 1859, he went to Chicago, and then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Nevertheless, after speaking before the first ever Kansas Republican Party Convention at Osawatomie, Kansas, Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader Brigham Young—the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans and was sympathetic but, like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he toured widely and gave many addresses.

===1860 presidential election===

Although he remained on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting him in his bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during the run-up to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to give an address at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.

Greeley attended the convention as a substitute for Oregon delegate Leander Holmes, who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley&#x27;s estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward&#x27;s defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, &quot;it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley&#x27;s resentment smolder for years as Seward did&quot;.

Seward&#x27;s forces made Greeley a target of their anger at the senator&#x27;s defeat. One subscriber cancelled, regretting the three-cent stamp he had to use on the letter; Greeley supplied a replacement. When he was attacked in print, Greeley responded in kind. He launched a campaign against corruption in the New York Legislature, hoping voters would defeat incumbents and the new legislators would elect him to the Senate when Seward&#x27;s term expired in 1861. (Before 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures.) But his main activity during the campaign of 1860 was boosting Lincoln and denigrating the other presidential candidates. He made it clear that a Republican administration would not interfere with slavery where it already was and denied that Lincoln was in favor of voting rights for African Americans. He kept up the pressure until Lincoln was elected in November.

Lincoln soon let it be known that Seward would be Secretary of State, which meant that he would not be a candidate for re-election to the Senate. Weed wanted William M. Evarts elected in his place, while the anti-Seward forces in New York gathered around Greeley. The crucial battleground was the Republican caucus, as the party held the majority in the legislature. Greeley&#x27;s forces did not have enough votes to send him to the Senate, but they had enough strength to block Evarts&#x27;s candidacy. Weed threw his support to Ira Harris, who had already received several votes, and who was chosen by the caucus and elected by the legislature in February 1861. Weed was content to have blocked the editor, and stated that he had &quot;paid the &quot;first&quot; installment on a large debt to Mr. Greeley&quot;.

===Civil War===
====War breaks out====
After Lincoln&#x27;s election, there was talk of secession in the South. The &quot;Tribune&quot; was initially in favor of peaceful separation, with the South becoming a separate nation. According to an editorial on November 9:

Similar editorials appeared through January 1861, after which &quot;Tribune&quot; editorials took a hard line on the South, opposing concessions. Williams concludes that &quot;for a brief moment, Horace Greeley had believed that peaceful secession might be a form of freedom preferable to civil war&quot;. This brief flirtation with disunion would have consequences for Greeley—it was used against him when he ran for president in 1872.

In the days leading up to Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration, the &quot;Tribune&quot; headed its editorial columns each day, in large capital letters: &quot;No compromise!/No concession to traitors!/The Constitution as it is!&quot; Greeley attended the inauguration, sitting close to Senator Douglas, as the &quot;Tribune&quot; hailed the beginning of Lincoln&#x27;s presidency. When southern forces attacked Fort Sumter, the &quot;Tribune&quot; regretted the loss of the fort, but applauded the fact that war to subdue the rebels, who formed the Confederate States of America, would now take place. The paper criticized Lincoln for not being quick to use force.

Through the spring and early summer of 1861, Greeley and the &quot;Tribune&quot; beat the drum for a Union attack. &quot;On to Richmond&quot;, a phrase coined by a &quot;Tribune&quot; stringer, became the watchword of the newspaper as Greeley urged the occupation of the rebel capital of Richmond before the Confederate Congress could meet on July 20. In part because of the public pressure, in mid July Lincoln sent the half-trained Union Army into the field at the First Battle of Bull Run, where it was soundly beaten. The defeat threw Greeley into despair, and he may have suffered a nervous breakdown.

====&quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot;====
Restored to health by two weeks at the farm he had purchased in Chappaqua, Greeley returned to the &quot;Tribune&quot; and a policy of general backing of the Lincoln administration, even having kind words to say about Secretary Seward, his old foe. He was supportive even during the military defeats of the first year of the war. Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Lincoln eagerly accepted, &quot;having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men.&quot;

By early 1862, however, Greeley was again sometimes critical of the administration, frustrated by the failure to win decisive military victories, and perturbed at the president&#x27;s slowness to commit to the emancipation of the slaves once the Confederacy was defeated, something the &quot;Tribune&quot; was urging in its editorials. This was a change in Greeley&#x27;s thinking which began after First Manassas, a shift from preservation of the Union being the primary war purpose to wanting the war to end slavery. By March, the only action against slavery that Lincoln had backed was a proposal for compensated emancipation in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union, though he signed legislation abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. Lincoln supposedly asked a &quot;Tribune&quot; correspondent, &quot;What in the world is the matter with Uncle Horace? Why can&#x27;t he restrain himself and wait a little while?&quot;

Greeley&#x27;s prodding of Lincoln culminated in a letter to him on August 19, 1862, reprinted on the following day in the &quot;Tribune&quot; as &quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot;. By this time, Lincoln had informed his Cabinet of his draft of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, and Greeley was told of it the same day the prayer was printed. In his letter, Greeley demanded action on emancipation and strict enforcement of the Confiscation Acts. Lincoln must &quot;fight slavery with liberty&quot;, and not fight &quot;wolves with the devices of a sheep.&quot;

Lincoln&#x27;s reply would become famous, much more so than the prayer that provoked it. &quot;My paramount object in this struggle &quot;is&quot; to save the Union, and is &quot;not&quot; either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing &quot;any&quot; slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing &quot;all&quot; the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do &quot;not&quot; believe it would help to save the Union.&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s statement angered abolitionists; William Seward&#x27;s wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem &quot;that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom.&quot; Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, &quot;but I&#x27;ll forgive him everything if he&#x27;ll issue the proclamation&quot;. When Lincoln did issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a &quot;great boon of Freedom&quot;. According to Williams, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s war for Union was now also Greeley&#x27;s war for emancipation.&quot;

====Draft riots and peace efforts====

After the Union victory at Gettysburg in early July 1863, the &quot;Tribune&quot; wrote that the rebellion would be quickly &quot;stamped out&quot;. A week after the battle, the New York City draft riots erupted. Greeley and the &quot;Tribune&quot; were generally supportive of conscription, though feeling that the rich should not be allowed to evade it by hiring substitutes. Support for the draft made them targets of the mob, and the &quot;Tribune&quot; Building was surrounded, and at least once invaded. Greeley secured arms from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and 150 soldiers kept the building secure. Mary Greeley and her children were at the farm in Chappaqua; a mob threatened them but dispersed without doing harm.

In August 1863, Greeley was requested by a firm of Hartford publishers to write a history of the war. Greeley agreed, and over the next eight months he penned a 600-page volume, which would be the first of two, entitled &quot;The American Conflict&quot;. The books were very successful, selling a total of 225,000 copies by 1870, a large sale for the time.

Throughout the war, Greeley played with ideas as to how to settle it. In 1862, Greeley had approached the French minister to Washington, Henri Mercier, to discuss a mediated settlement. However, Seward rejected such talks, and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at Antietam in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. In fact, the men were in Niagara Falls, Canada, in order to aid Peace Democrats and otherwise undermine the Union war effort, but they played along when Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln&#x27;s request. The president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had no credentials and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley&#x27;s credulous conduct, but he privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore.

Greeley did not initially support Lincoln for nomination in 1864, casting about for other candidates. In February, he wrote in the &quot;Tribune&quot; that Lincoln could not be elected to a second term. Nevertheless, no candidate made a serious challenge to Lincoln, and Lincoln was nominated in June, which the &quot;Tribune&quot; applauded slightly. In August, fearing a Democratic victory and acceptance of the Confederacy, Greeley engaged in a plot to get a new convention to nominate another candidate, with Lincoln withdrawing. The plot came to nothing. Once Atlanta was taken by Union forces on September 3, Greeley became a fervent supporter of Lincoln. Greeley was gratified by both Lincoln&#x27;s re-election and continued Union victories.

===Reconstruction===
As the war drew to a close in April 1865, Greeley and the &quot;Tribune&quot; urged magnanimity towards the defeated Confederates, arguing that making martyrs of Confederate leaders would only inspire future rebels. This talk of moderation ceased when Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Many concluded that Lincoln had fallen as the result of a final rebel plot, and the new president, Andrew Johnson, offered $100,000 for the capture of fugitive Confederate president Jefferson Davis. After the rebel leader was caught, Greeley initially advocated that &quot;punishment be meted out in accord with a just verdict&quot;.

Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who was being held at Fortress Monroe, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis&#x27;s wife Varina urged Greeley to use his influence to gain her husband&#x27;s release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000 (~$ in ). Greeley was among those who signed the bail bond, and the two men met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the &quot;Tribune&quot; (especially the &quot;Weekly Tribune&quot;) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election.

Initially supportive of Andrew Johnson&#x27;s lenient Reconstruction policies, Greeley soon became disillusioned, as the president&#x27;s plan allowed the quick formation of state governments without securing suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened in December 1865, and gradually took control of Reconstruction, he was generally supportive, as Radical Republicans pushed hard for universal male suffrage and civil rights for freedmen. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866 but lost badly. He ran for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867 but lost to Roscoe Conkling.

As the president and Congress battled, Greeley remained firmly opposed to the president, and when Johnson was impeached in March 1868, Greeley and the &quot;Tribune&quot; strongly supported his removal, attacking Johnson as &quot;an aching tooth in the national jaw, a screeching infant in a crowded lecture room,&quot; and declaring, &quot;There can be no peace or comfort till he is out.&quot; Nevertheless, the president was acquitted by the Senate, much to Greeley&#x27;s disappointment. Also in 1868, Greeley sought the Republican nomination for governor but was frustrated by the Conkling forces. Greeley supported the successful Republican presidential nominee, General Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 election.

===Grant years===

In 1868, Whitelaw Reid joined the &quot;Tribune&quot; &#x27;s staff as managing editor. In Reid, Greeley found a reliable second-in-command. Also on the Tribune&#x27;s staff in the late 1860s was Mark Twain. Henry George sometimes contributed pieces, as did Bret Harte. In 1870, John Hay joined the staff as an editorial writer. Greeley soon pronounced Hay the most brilliant at that craft ever to write for the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

Greeley maintained his interest in associationism. Beginning in 1869, he was heavily involved in an attempt to found the Union Colony of Colorado, a utopia on the prairie, in a scheme led by Nathan Meeker. The new town of Greeley, Colorado Territory was named after him. He served as treasurer and lent Meeker money to keep the colony afloat. In 1871, Greeley published a book &quot;What I Know About Farming&quot;, based on his childhood experience and that from his country home in Chappaqua.

Greeley continued to seek political office, running for state comptroller in 1869 and the House of Representatives in 1870, losing both times. In 1870, President Grant offered Greeley the post of minister to Santo Domingo (today, the Dominican Republic), which he declined.

==Presidential candidate==

As had been the case for much of the 19th century, political parties continued to be formed and to vanish after the Civil War. In September 1871, Missouri Senator Carl Schurz formed the Liberal Republican Party, founded on opposition to President Grant, opposition to corruption, and support of civil service reform, lower taxes, and land reform. He gathered around him an eclectic group of supporters whose only real link was their opposition to Grant, whose administration had proved increasingly corrupt. The party needed a candidate, with a presidential election upcoming. Greeley was one of the best-known Americans, as well as being a perennial candidate for office. He was more minded to consider a run for the Republican nomination, fearing the effect on the &quot;Tribune&quot; should he bolt the party. Nevertheless, he wanted to be president, as a Republican if possible, and if not, as a Liberal Republican.

The Liberal Republican national convention met in Cincinnati in May 1872. Greeley was spoken of as a possible candidate, as was Missouri Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown. Schurz was ineligible, being foreign-born. On the first ballot, former minister to Britain Charles Francis Adams led, but Greeley took a narrow lead on a revised second ballot. Adams then retook the lead, but on the sixth ballot, after a &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstration staged by Reid, Greeley gained the nomination, with Brown as the vice presidential candidate.

The Democrats, when they met in Baltimore in July, faced a stark choice: nominate Greeley, long a thorn in their side, or split the anti-Grant vote and go on to certain defeat. They chose the former, and even adopted the Liberal Republican platform, which called for equal rights for African Americans.

Greeley resigned as editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot; for the campaign, and, unusually for the time, embarked on a speaking tour to bring his message to the people. As it was customary for candidates for major office not to actively campaign, he was attacked as a seeker after office. Nevertheless, in late July, Greeley (and others, such as former Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes) thought he would very likely be elected. Greeley campaigned on a platform of intersectional reconciliation, arguing that the war was over and the issue of slavery was resolved. He asserted that it was time to restore normalcy and end the continuing military occupation of the South.
The Republican counterattack was well financed, accusing Greeley of support for everything from treason to the Ku Klux Klan. The anti-Greeley campaign was famously and effectively summed up in the cartoons of Thomas Nast, whom Grant later credited with a major role in his re-election. Nast&#x27;s cartoons showed Greeley giving bail money for Jefferson Davis, throwing mud on Grant, and shaking hands with John Wilkes Booth across Lincoln&#x27;s grave. The Crédit Mobilier scandal—corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad—broke in September, but Greeley was unable to take advantage of the Grant administration&#x27;s ties to the scandal as he had stock in the railroad himself, and some alleged it had been given to him in exchange for favorable coverage. Grant wrote of Greeley, &quot;He is a genius without common sense&#x27;&quot;.

Greeley&#x27;s wife Mary had returned ill from a trip to Europe in late June. Her condition worsened in October, and he effectively broke off campaigning after October 12 to be with her. She died on October 30, plunging him into despair a week before the election. Poor results for the Democrats in those states that had elections for other offices in September and October presaged defeat for Greeley, and so it proved. He received 2,834,125 votes to 3,597,132 for Grant, who secured 286 electors to 66 for Greeley. The editor-turned-candidate won only six states (out of 37): Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas.

===Final month and death===
Greeley resumed editorship of the &quot;Tribune&quot; but quickly learned that a movement to unseat him was underway. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the &quot;Tribune&quot; on November 13 (a week after the election), he remained under medical care. At the recommendation of a family physician, Greeley was sent to Choate House, the asylum of Dr. George Choate at Pleasantville, New York. There, he continued to worsen, and he died on November 29, with his two surviving daughters and Reid at his side.

His death came before the Electoral College balloted. His 66 electoral votes were divided among four others, principally Indiana governor-elect Thomas A. Hendricks and Greeley&#x27;s vice presidential running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown.

Although Greeley had requested a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair at the Church of the Divine Paternity, later the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York, where Greeley was a member. He is buried in Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery. Among the mourners were old friends, &quot;Tribune&quot; employees including Reid and Hay, his journalistic rivals, and a broad array of politicians, led by President Grant.

==Appraisal==

Despite the venom that had been spewed over him in the presidential campaign, Greeley&#x27;s death was widely mourned. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which had printed Nast&#x27;s cartoons, wrote, &quot;Since the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, the death of no American has been so sincerely deplored as that of Horace Greeley; and its tragical circumstances have given a peculiarly affectionate pathos to all that has been said of him.&quot; Henry Ward Beecher wrote in the &quot;Christian Union&quot;, &quot;when Horace Greeley died, unjust and hard judgment of him died also&quot;. Harriet Beecher Stowe noted Greeley&#x27;s eccentric dress, &quot;That poor white hat! If, alas, it covered many weaknesses, it covered also much strength, much real kindness and benevolence, and much that the world will be better for&quot;.

Greeley supported liberal policies towards the fast-growing western regions; he memorably advised the ambitious to &quot;Go West, young man.&quot; He hired Karl Marx because of his interest in covering working-class society and politics, attacked monopolies of all sorts, and rejected land grants to railroads. Industry would make everyone rich, he insisted, as he promoted high tariffs. He supported vegetarianism and opposed the consumption of alcohol.

Historian Iver Bernstein says:

Greeley&#x27;s view of freedom was based in the desire that all should have the opportunity to better themselves. According to his biographer, Erik S. Lunde, &quot;a dedicated social reformer deeply sympathetic to the treatment of poor white males, slaves, free blacks, and white women, he still espoused the virtues of self-help and free enterprise&quot;. Van Deusen stated: &quot;His genuine human sympathies, his moral fervor, even the exhibitionism that was a part of his makeup, made it inevitable that he should crusade for a better world. He did so with apostolic zeal.&quot;

Nevertheless, Greeley&#x27;s effectiveness as a reformer was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he &quot;must have looked like an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat that made him look like a farmer who came into town for supplies&quot;. Van Deusen wrote, &quot;Greeley&#x27;s effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap.&quot;

The &quot;Tribune&quot; remained under that name until 1924, when it merged with the New York &quot;Herald&quot; to become the New York &quot;Herald-Tribune&quot;, which was published until 1966. The name survived until 2013, when the &quot;International Herald-Tribune&quot; became the &quot;International New York Times&quot;.

The town of Greeley, Colorado is named after Horace Greeley.

There is a statue of Greeley in City Hall Park in New York, donated by the Tribune Association. Cast in 1890, it was not dedicated until 1916. A second statue of Greeley is located in Greeley Square in Midtown Manhattan. Greeley Square, at Broadway and 33rd Street, was named by the New York City Common Council in a vote after Greeley&#x27;s death. Van Deusen concluded his biography of Greeley:

<text>Ganqing () literally means &quot;feel&quot; (&quot;Gǎn&quot;, 感) &quot;affection&quot; (&quot;Qíng&quot;, 情) and together the term is often translated as &quot;feelings&quot; or &quot;emotional attachment&quot;. &quot;Ganqing&quot; refers to a friendship-like feeling that develops between two people, groups, or business partners as their relationship deepens. &quot;Ganqing&quot; is an important concept in social relations in Chinese culture that has roots in Confucianism, and is a sub-dimension to the concept of &quot;guanxi&quot; (a person&#x27;s relationship network). Developing good &quot;ganqing&quot; is a critical aspect of building &quot;guanxi&quot; relationships. Good &quot;ganqing&quot; means that two people have developed a rapport, while deep &quot;ganqing&quot; means there is a considerable emotional bond within the relationship. &quot;Ganqing&quot; can also refer as &quot;love affair&quot; in Chinese.

The term &quot;ganqing&quot; is often used in comments by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, for example statements that an action &quot;hurts the feelings of the Chinese people&quot; which some people interpret to mean harm the relationship with the Chinese government.

<text>Cathy de Monchaux (born 1960) is a British sculptor.

==Early life and education==
Born in London, daughter of the sculptor Paul de Monchaux, de Monchaux earned her BA at the Camberwell School of Art (1980–1983) and an MA at Goldsmiths College, University of London (1985–1987).

==Style and career==
Her sculptures use materials such as glass, paper, metal, fur and leather. Her works juxtapose seductive, soft elements, sometimes associated with strongly sexual overtones, with harder materials, often spikey or in some way appearing to constrain the softer parts, resulting in work which is both sensual and threatening. Her 1997 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in particular made reference to organic forms (crustacea, fossils), animals, erotic and fetishistic imagery, turn of the century decorative traditions, architectural detailing and saintly relics.

She won a Steinberger Group Award in 1988 and the London Arts Individual Artist&#x27;s Award in 1989.

De Monchaux&#x27;s work from the early 1990s was often characterised by the combination of red velvet and steel in simple and strong constructions, but later works have tended to move towards lighter colours and a more ornamental approach.

De Monchaux was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1998. She currently lives in London and is a part-time teacher at the Slade School of Art. However, she has exhibited in the United States almost as much as, if not more than, she has in England.

In her recent work, such as &quot;The Raft&quot; (2016) and &quot;State Secrets&quot; (2014)&quot;,&quot; de Monchaux has concentrated more on subjects such as battles, unicorns and imagery confusing fauna, mineral and flora.

In &quot;Sweetly the Air Flew Overhead, Battle with Unicorns&quot; (2007-8), the work shows small soft sculptures of riders on unicorns entangled in string, cloth and tree figures. It is reminiscent of Uccello&#x27;s &quot;Battle of San Romano&quot; series where distinct horses, lances and knights celebrate human control and clarity, not least in the painter&#x27;s obsessive use of perspective. By contrast, de Monchaux depicts a battle with spike-helmet knights riding unicorns that struggle in a chaos of things: to be in a battle is to be inside a mess.

De Monchaux herself has mentioned recognising an unconscious allusion here to the Iraq War.

<doc id="171498" wikidata="Q435517" url="?curid=171498" title="Winfield Scott Hancock">
<text>Winfield Scott Hancock (February 14, 1824 – February 9, 1886) was a United States Army officer and the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 1880. He served with distinction in the Army for four decades, including service in the Mexican–American War and as a Union general in the American Civil War. Known to his Army as &quot;Hancock the Superb,&quot; he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of the South and the U.S.&#x27;s western expansion and war with the Native Americans at the Western frontier. This concluded with the Medicine Lodge Treaty. From 1881 to 1885 he was president of the Aztec Club of 1847 for veteran officers of the Mexican-American War.

Hancock&#x27;s reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his status as a Unionist and supporter of states&#x27; rights, made him a potential presidential candidate. When the Democrats nominated him for president in 1880, he ran a strong campaign, but was narrowly defeated by Republican James A. Garfield. Hancock&#x27;s last public service involved the oversight of President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s funeral procession in 1885.

==Early life and family==

Winfield Scott Hancock and his identical twin brother Hilary Baker Hancock were born on February 14, 1824, in Montgomery Square, Pennsylvania, a hamlet just northwest of Philadelphia in present-day Montgomery Township. The twins were the sons of Benjamin Franklin Hancock and Elizabeth Hoxworth Hancock. Winfield was named after Winfield Scott, a prominent general in the War of 1812.

The Hancock and Hoxworth families had lived in Montgomery County for several generations, and were of English, Scottish, and Welsh descent. Benjamin Hancock was a schoolteacher when his sons were born. A few years after their birth, he moved the family to Norristown, the county seat, and began to practice law. Benjamin was also a deacon in the Baptist church and participated in municipal government (as an avowed Democrat).

Hancock was at first educated at Norristown Academy, but removed to the public schools when the first one opened in Norristown in the late 1830s. In 1840, Joseph Fornance, the local Congressman, nominated Hancock to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Hancock&#x27;s progress at West Point was average. He graduated 18th in his class of 25 in 1844, and he was assigned to the infantry.

==Early military career==
===Mexican War===
Hancock was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry regiment, and initially was stationed in Indian Territory in the Red River Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock&#x27;s time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself a place at the front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in Kentucky, he proved so adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post. By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in Puebla, Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General Winfield Scott.

Scott&#x27;s army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and attacked Mexico City from the south. During that campaign in 1847, Hancock first encountered battle at Contreras and Churubusco. He was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for gallant and meritorious service in those actions. Hancock was wounded in the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever. Although he was well enough to join his regiment at Molino del Rey, fever kept Hancock from participating in the final breakthrough to Mexico City, something he would regret for the rest of his life. After the final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the treaty of peace was signed in 1848.

===Marriage and peacetime===
Hancock served in a number of assignments as an army quartermaster and adjutant, mostly in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, and St. Louis, Missouri. It was in St. Louis that he met Almira (&quot;Allie&quot;) Russell and they married on January 24, 1850. Allie gave birth to two children, Russell in 1850 and Ada in 1857, but both children died before their parents. Hancock was promoted to captain in 1855 and assigned to Fort Myers, Florida. Hancock&#x27;s young family accompanied him to his new posting, where Allie Hancock was the only woman on the post.

Hancock&#x27;s tour in Florida coincided with the end of the Third Seminole War. His duties were primarily those of a quartermaster, and he did not see action in that campaign. As the situation in Florida began to settle down, Hancock was reassigned to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He served in the West during the partisan warfare of &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, and in the Utah Territory, where the 6th Infantry arrived after the Utah War. Following the resolution of that conflict, Hancock was stationed in southern California in November 1858. He remained there, joined by Allie and the children, until the Civil War broke out in 1861, serving as a captain and assistant quartermaster under future Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. In California, Hancock became friendly with a number of southern officers, most significantly Lewis A. Armistead of Virginia. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Armistead and the other southerners left to join the Confederate States Army, while Hancock remained in the service of the United States. When Armistead left, he turned to Hancock and said, &quot;You&#x27;ll never know what this is costing me, but goodbye, goodbye.&quot;

==Civil War==

===Joining the Army of the Potomac===
Hancock returned east to assume quartermaster duties for the rapidly growing Union Army, but was quickly promoted to brigadier general on September 23, 1861, and given an infantry brigade to command in the division of Brig. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, Army of the Potomac. He earned his &quot;Superb&quot; nickname in the Peninsula Campaign, in 1862, by leading a critical counterattack in the Battle of Williamsburg; army commander Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan telegraphed to Washington that &quot;Hancock was superb today&quot; and the appellation stuck. McClellan did not follow through on Hancock&#x27;s initiative, however, and Confederate forces were allowed to withdraw unmolested.

In the Battle of Antietam, Hancock assumed command of the 1st Division, II Corps, following the mortal wounding of Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson in the horrific fighting at &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;. Hancock and his staff made a dramatic entrance to the battlefield, galloping between his troops and the enemy, parallel to the Sunken Road. His men assumed that Hancock would order counterattacks against the exhausted Confederates, but he carried orders from McClellan to hold his position. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on November 29, 1862. He led his division in the disastrous attack on Marye&#x27;s Heights in the Battle of Fredericksburg the following month and was wounded in the abdomen. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, his division covered Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s withdrawal and Hancock was wounded again. His corps commander, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, transferred out of the Army of the Potomac in protest of actions Hooker took in the battle and Hancock assumed command of II Corps, which he would lead until shortly before the war&#x27;s end.

===Gettysburg===


Hancock&#x27;s most famous service was as a new corps commander at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1 to 3, 1863. After his friend, Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, was killed early on July 1, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, sent Hancock ahead to take command of the units on the field and assess the situation. Hancock thus was in temporary command of the &quot;left wing&quot; of the army, consisting of the I, II, III, and XI Corps. This demonstrated Meade&#x27;s high confidence in him, because Hancock was not the most senior Union officer at Gettysburg at the time. Hancock and the more senior XI Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, argued briefly about this command arrangement, but Hancock prevailed and he organized the Union defenses on Cemetery Hill as more numerous Confederate forces drove the I and XI Corps back through the town. He had the authority from Meade to withdraw, so he was responsible for the decision to stand and fight at Gettysburg. At the conclusion of the day&#x27;s action, Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum arrived on the field and assumed command until Gen. Meade arrived after midnight.

On July 2, Hancock&#x27;s II Corps was positioned on Cemetery Ridge, roughly in the center of the Union line, while Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee launched assaults on both ends of the line. On the Union left, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s assault smashed the III Corps and Hancock sent in his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell, to reinforce the Union in the Wheatfield. As Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill&#x27;s corps continued the attack toward the Union center, Hancock rallied the defenses and rushed units to the critical spots. First, he sent the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division, under Col. George Willard, into the fray to stop the advance of Confederate Brigadier General William Barksdale&#x27;s Brigade. In one famous incident, he sacrificed a regiment, the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, by ordering it to advance and charge a Confederate brigade four times its size, causing the Minnesotans to suffer 87% casualties. While costly, this sacrifice bought time to organize the defensive line and saved the day for the Union Army. Following the action toward his right, he sent the 13th Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the 1st Corps, which had come from Cemetery Hill to help quell the crisis, to recover some artillery pieces the Confederates had captured and were pulling away. The Vermonters were successful. Having stabilized his line, he turned his attention to the sound of fighting on East Cemetery Hill. There, with darkness falling, Confederates from Maj. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s Division had gotten into Union batteries and were fighting the cannoneers hand-to-hand. Hancock sent the First Brigade of his Third Division, under Colonel Samuel S. Carroll, to the fighting. The brigade was crucial in flushing the enemy out of the batteries and dispatching them back down the face of East Cemetery Hill.

On July 3, Hancock defended his position on Cemetery Ridge and thus bore the brunt of Pickett&#x27;s Charge. During the massive Confederate artillery bombardment that preceded the infantry assault, Hancock was prominent on horseback, reviewing and encouraging his troops. When one of his subordinates protested, &quot;General, the corps commander ought not to risk his life that way,&quot; Hancock is said to have replied, &quot;There are times when a corps commander&#x27;s life does not count.&quot; During the infantry assault, his old friend, Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead, now leading a brigade in Maj. Gen. George Pickett&#x27;s division, was wounded and died two days later. Hancock could not meet with his friend because he had just been wounded himself, a severe wound caused by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. Helped from his horse by aides, and with a tourniquet applied to stanch the bleeding, he removed the saddle nail himself and, mistaking its source, remarked wryly, &quot;They must be hard up for ammunition when they throw such shot as that.&quot; News of Armistead&#x27;s mortal wounding was brought to Hancock by a member of his staff, Capt. Henry H. Bingham. Despite his pain, Hancock refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was resolved. He had been an inspiration for his troops throughout the three-day battle. Hancock later received the thanks of the U.S. Congress for &quot;... his gallant, meritorious and conspicuous share in that great and decisive victory.&quot;

One military historian wrote, &quot;No other Union general at Gettysburg dominated men by the sheer force of their presence more completely than Hancock.&quot; As another wrote, &quot;his tactical skill had won him the quick admiration of adversaries who had come to know him as the &#x27;Thunderbolt of the Army of the Potomac&#x27;.&quot;

===Virginia and the end of the war===

Hancock suffered from the effects of his Gettysburg wound for the rest of the war. After recuperating in Norristown, he performed recruiting services over the winter and returned in the spring to field command of the II Corps for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s 1864 Overland Campaign, but he never regained full mobility and his former youthful energy. Nevertheless, he performed well at the Battle of the Wilderness and commanded a critical breakthrough assault of the Mule Shoe at the &quot;Bloody Angle&quot; in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 12, shattering the Confederate defenders in his front, including the Stonewall Brigade. His corps suffered enormous losses during a futile assault Grant ordered at Cold Harbor.

After Grant&#x27;s army slipped past Lee&#x27;s army to cross the James River, Hancock found himself in a position from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith&#x27;s assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith&#x27;s advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.

Hancock&#x27;s only significant military defeat occurred during the siege of Petersburg. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth attacked and overran the faulty Union position at Reams&#x27;s Station, shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at Hatcher&#x27;s Run, the humiliation of Reams&#x27;s Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after a year in which it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial First Veteran Corps. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in command of forces in the now-quiet Shenandoah Valley. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.

==Post-war military service==

===Execution of Lincoln assassination conspirators===

At the close of the war, Hancock was assigned to supervise the execution of the conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had been assassinated on April 14, 1865, and by May 9 of that year, a military commission had been convened to try the accused. The actual assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was already dead, but the trial of his co-conspirators proceeded quickly, resulting in convictions. President Andrew Johnson ordered the executions to be carried out on July 7. Although he was reluctant to execute some of the less-culpable conspirators, especially Mary Surratt, Hancock carried out his orders, later writing that &quot;every soldier was bound to act as I did under similar circumstances.&quot;

===Service on the Plains===
After the executions, Hancock was assigned command of the newly organized Middle Military Department, headquartered in Baltimore. In 1866, on Grant&#x27;s recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military Department of the Missouri, which included the states of Missouri and Kansas and the territories of Colorado and New Mexico. Hancock reported to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and took up his new posting.

Soon after arriving, he was assigned by General Sherman to lead an expedition to negotiate with the Cheyenne and Sioux, with whom relations had worsened since the Sand Creek massacre. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started.

The official report to the President by the Indian Peace Commission found that the actions of George Custer and other subordinates just after Hancock&#x27;s arrival led to an instigation of violent reprisals by the Native Americans:

===Reconstruction===

Hancock&#x27;s time in the West was brief. President Johnson, unhappy with the way Republican generals were governing the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson&#x27;s liking. Although neither man was pleased with the change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.

Hancock&#x27;s new assignment found him in charge of the Fifth Military District, covering Texas and Louisiana. Almost immediately upon arriving, Hancock ingratiated himself with the secessionist white population by issuing his General Order Number 40 of November 29, 1867. In that order, written while traveling to New Orleans, Hancock expressed sentiments in support of President Johnson&#x27;s policies, writing that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials perform their duties, then &quot;the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion.&quot; The order continued:

Hancock&#x27;s order encouraged white Democrats across the South who hoped to return to civilian government more quickly, but discomforted blacks and Republicans in the South who feared a return to the antebellum ways of traditional white dominance.

Hancock&#x27;s General Order Number 40 was quickly condemned by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless of the situation in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians&#x27; requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock&#x27;s popularity within the Democratic party grew to the extent that he was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party&#x27;s principles of states&#x27; rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.

===Return to the Plains===
Following General Grant&#x27;s 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were firmly in charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this time away from the sensitive assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the Black Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie.

It was during this tour that Hancock had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of Yellowstone National Park. In August 1870, he ordered the 2nd Cavalry at Fort Ellis to provide a military escort for General Henry D. Washburn&#x27;s planned exploration of the Yellowstone Region. The expedition, which was a major impetus in creating the park, became known as the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition. Hancock&#x27;s order led to the assignment of Lt. Gustavus Cheyney Doane and a troop of 5 cavalrymen from Fort Ellis to escort the expedition. In 1871, Captain John W. Barlow during his exploration of the Yellowstone region formally named a summit on what would become the southern boundary of the park Mount Hancock to honor the general&#x27;s decision to provide the escort.

===Command in the East and political ambitions===
In 1872, General Meade died, leaving Hancock the army&#x27;s senior major general. This entitled him to a more prominent command, and President Grant, still desirous to keep Hancock from a Southern post, assigned him command of the Division of the Atlantic, headquartered at Fort Columbus on Governors Island, in New York City. The vast department covered the settled northeast area of the country and was militarily uneventful with the exception of the army&#x27;s involvement in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. When railroad workers went on strike to protest wage cuts, the nation&#x27;s transportation system was paralyzed. The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland asked President Hayes to call in federal troops to re-open the railways. Once federal troops entered the cities, most of the strikers melted away, but there were some violent clashes.

All the while Hancock was posted in New York, he did his best to keep his political ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats&#x27; 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.

==Election of 1880==

===Democratic convention===
Hancock&#x27;s name had been proposed several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock&#x27;s chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock&#x27;s neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, more than any other candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.

===Campaign against Garfield===

The Republicans nominated James A. Garfield, a Congressman from Ohio and a skillful politician, as well as a former general from the Civil War. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, but needed to add a few of the Northern states to their total to win the election. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation. The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing &quot;a tariff for revenue only.&quot; Garfield&#x27;s campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that would benefit by a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. In the end, the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Northern states they had targeted, with the exception of New Jersey. Hancock lost the election to Garfield. Garfield polled only 39,213 more votes than Hancock, the popular vote being 4,453,295 for Garfield and 4,414,082 for Hancock. The electoral count, however, had a much larger spread, as Garfield polled 214 electoral votes and Hancock only 155. Garfield would be shot four months into his presidency on July 2, 1881, and would die on September 19, 1881.

==Later life==
Hancock took his electoral defeat in stride and attended Garfield&#x27;s inauguration. Following the election, Hancock carried on as commander of the Division of the Atlantic. He was elected president of the National Rifle Association in 1881, explaining that &quot;The object of the NRA is to increase the military strength of the country by making skill in the use of arms as prevalent as it was in the days of the Revolution.&quot; Hancock was a Charter Director and the first president of the Military Service Institution of the United States from 1878 until his death in 1886. He was commander-in-chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States veterans organization from 1879 until his death in 1886. He was the author of &quot;Reports of Major General W. S. Hancock upon Indian Affairs&quot;, published in 1867. Hancock&#x27;s last major public appearance was to preside over the funeral of President Grant in 1885, although he also made a less publicized trip that year to Gettysburg.

Hancock died in 1886 at Governors Island, still in command of the Military Division of the Atlantic, the victim of an infected carbuncle, complicated by diabetes. He is buried in Montgomery Cemetery in West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania, near Norristown, Pennsylvania. Hancock&#x27;s wife, Almira, published &quot;Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock&quot; in 1887.

In 1893, Republican General Francis A. Walker wrote,Although I did not vote for General Hancock, I am strongly disposed to believe that one of the best things the nation has lost in recent years has been the example and the influence of that chivalric, stately, and splendid gentleman in the White House. Perhaps much which both parties now recognize as having been unfortunate and mischievous during the past thirteen years would have been avoided had General Hancock been elected.

His noted integrity was a counterpoint to the corruption of the era, for as President Rutherford B. Hayes said,If, when we make up our estimate of a public man, conspicuous both as a soldier and in civil life, we are to think first and chiefly of his manhood, his integrity, his purity, his singleness of purpose, and his unselfish devotion to duty, we can truthfully say of Hancock that he was through and through pure gold.
The last public act performed by Hancock was his oversight of the funeral of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885, and his organizing and leading of Grant&#x27;s nine-mile funeral procession in New York City. From Grant&#x27;s home at Mount McGregor, New York, to its resting place in Riverside Park, the casket containing Grant&#x27;s remains was in the charge of General Hancock. As he appeared on the scene at the commencement of Grant&#x27;s funeral procession, Hancock was met with a mild applause, but with a gesture he directed a silence and respect for Grant.

==Legacy==
Winfield Scott Hancock is memorialized in a number of statues:
* An equestrian statue on East Cemetery Hill on the Gettysburg Battlefield.
* A portrait statue by Cyrus Dallin as part of the Pennsylvania Memorial at Gettysburg.
* An alto-relievo representing Hancock&#x27;s wounding during Pickett&#x27;s Charge, on the New York State Monument at Gettysburg.
* An equestrian statue located at Pennsylvania Avenue and 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C.
* An equestrian statue atop the Smith Memorial Arch in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
* A monumental bronze bust in Hancock Square, New York City, by sculptor James Wilson Alexander MacDonald.
* Fort Hancock, Texas
* Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook, New Jersey, was named for General Hancock.
The original Winfield Scott Hancock Elementary School, located at Arch and East Spruce Streets in Norristown, Pennsylvania, was built in 1895 in memory of the General who grew up not far from the site. It was replaced in 1962 by a new building still in use by the Norristown Area School District only a few blocks away at Arch and Summit Streets, which is also named after General Hancock. The original 1895 building still stands and is used by a community non-profit organization.

A Pennsylvania historical marker was dedicated September 11, 1947, along Bethlehem Pike (PA 309), just south of US 202, where Hancock was born.
Hancock&#x27;s portrait adorns U.S. currency on the $2 Silver Certificate series of 1886. Approximately 1,500 to 2,500 of these bills survive today in numismatic collections. Hancock&#x27;s bill is ranked number 73 on a list of &quot;100 Greatest American Currency Notes&quot;.

Hancock was an important character in the Shaara family&#x27;s Civil War historical novels: &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara, and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; and &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; by Jeffrey Shaara. In the films &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993) and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (2003), based on the first two of these novels, Hancock is portrayed by Brian Mallon, and is depicted in both films in a very favorable light. A number of scenes in the novel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; that depict Hancock and his friend Lewis A. Armistead in Southern California before the war were omitted from the film.

<doc id="171507" wikidata="Q956500" url="?curid=171507" title="Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark">
<text>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic band formed in Meols, Merseyside in 1978 by Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals). Regarded as pioneers of electronic music, OMD combined an experimental, minimalist ethos with pop sensibilities, becoming key figures in the emergence of synth-pop; McCluskey and Humphreys also introduced the &quot;synth duo&quot; format to British popular music. In the United States, the band were an early presence in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion.

McCluskey and Humphreys led the Id, a precursor group, from 1977 to 1978 and re-recorded their track &quot;Electricity&quot; as OMD&#x27;s debut single in 1979. Weathering an &quot;uncool&quot; image and a degree of hostility from music critics, the band achieved popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, and gained further recognition via &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; (1981) and its three hit singles. Although later reappraised, &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; (1983) was seen as overly experimental, and eroded European support. OMD embraced a more radio-friendly sound on &quot;Junk Culture&quot; (1984); this change in direction led to greater success in the US, and spawned hits including &quot;If You Leave&quot; (from the 1986 film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;).

In 1989, Humphreys and longtime group members Martin Cooper (keyboards, saxophone) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) departed to form the spin-off band the Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey as the only remaining member of OMD. The group returned with a new line-up and explored the dance-pop genre: &quot;Sugar Tax&quot; (1991) and its initial singles were hits in Europe. OMD then began to flounder amid the guitar-oriented grunge and Britpop movements, eventually disbanding in 1996. McCluskey later founded girl group Atomic Kitten, for whom he served as a principal songwriter and producer, while Humphreys formed the duo Onetwo alongside lead vocalist Claudia Brücken of Propaganda.

In 2006, OMD reformed with McCluskey and Humphreys revisiting the more experimental territory of their early work. The band have achieved 14 top-20 entries on the UK Albums Chart, as well as global sales of 40 million records. Their 20th century output yielded 18 top-40 appearances on the UK Singles Chart, along with four top-40 entries on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Described as one of the most influential synth-pop acts in history, OMD have inspired many artists across diverse genres and disciplines. In 2015, the group established their most enduring line-up, with McCluskey and Humphreys being complemented by Cooper and Stuart Kershaw (drums).

==History==
===1975–1979: Roots and early years===

Founders Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys met at primary school in Meols, England in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved with various local groups. By 1975, McCluskey had formed Equinox as bassist and lead vocalist, alongside schoolmate Malcolm Holmes on drums, while Humphreys was roadie. During that time, McCluskey and Humphreys discovered their electronic style, inspired by German band Kraftwerk. After Equinox, McCluskey joined Pegasus, and, later, the short-lived Hitlerz Underpantz, alongside Humphreys. McCluskey would usually sing and play bass guitar; roadie and electronics enthusiast Humphreys, who shared McCluskey&#x27;s love of electronic music, graduated to keyboards.

In September 1977, McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three vocalists, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboardist) Wirral band the Id, whose line-up included drummer Malcolm Holmes and McCluskey&#x27;s girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the Merseyside area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (&quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot;) was included on a compilation album of local bands called &quot;Street to Street – A Liverpool Album&quot; (1979). Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side project called VCL XI, whose name was adapted from a diagram on the back cover of Kraftwerk&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; (1975), reading &quot;VCL 11&quot;. This project allowed them to pursue their more obscure electronic experiments.

In August 1978, the Id broke up due to musical differences. Also in August, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit Dalek I Love You as lead vocalist, but quit in September. Later in the month, he rejoined Humphreys and their VCL XI project was renamed Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The name was gleaned from a list of song lyrics and ideas that were written on McCluskey&#x27;s bedroom wall; and was chosen so they would not be mistaken for a punk band. Given that OMD intended to play only one gig, the duo considered their moniker to be inconsequential. McCluskey has since expressed regret over choosing &quot;such a very silly name&quot;. The contrasting personalities of Humphreys and McCluskey established the band&#x27;s dynamic, with the former saying that &quot;two Pauls wouldn&#x27;t get anything done and two Andys would kill each other.&quot; They have further described their creative roles as &quot;The Surgeon&quot; (Humphreys) and &quot;The Butcher&quot; (McCluskey). As working class youngsters, OMD had a limited budget, using second-hand &quot;junk-shop&quot; instruments including a left-handed bass guitar (which McCluskey would play upside-down). The pair also created their own devices, with Humphreys &quot;making things out of his aunt&#x27;s radios cannibalised for the circuit boards&quot;. Eventually, they acquired a basic Korg M-500 Micro Preset synthesizer, purchased via McCluskey&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mail-order catalogue for £7.76 a week, paid over 36 weeks.

OMD began to gig regularly as a duo, performing to backing tracks played from a TEAC 4-track tape-recorder christened &quot;Winston&quot; (after the antihero of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;). Their debut performance was in October 1978 at Eric&#x27;s Club in Liverpool. Finding themselves on the cusp of an electronic new wave in British pop music, they released a one-off single, &quot;Electricity&quot;, with independent label Factory Records. The track was supposed to be produced by the Factory Records producer Martin Hannett. However, the A-side was the band&#x27;s original demo produced by their friend, owner of Winston and soon to be manager, Paul Collister, under the pseudonym Chester Valentino (taken from a nightclub called Valentino&#x27;s in the nearby city of Chester). The single&#x27;s sleeve was designed by Peter Saville, whose distinctive graphics contributed to OMD&#x27;s public image into the 1980s. &quot;Electricity&quot; became a seminal release within the burgeoning synth-pop movement, and led to the band receiving a seven-album recording contract with Dindisc, worth over £250,000.

In 1979, OMD were asked to support Gary Numan on his first major British tour. Humphreys noted, &quot;[Numan] gave us our first big break. He saw us opening for Joy Division and he asked us to go on tour with him... we went from the small clubs to playing huge arenas. Gary was very good to us.&quot; Along with Numan, OMD became key figures in the rise of synth-pop. Numan later supported OMD on a 1993 UK arena tour.

===1980–1988: Classic line-up===
Rather than hire studio time to record their eponymous debut album (1980), McCluskey and Humphreys used their advance payment from Dindisc to build their own Liverpool recording studio, called the Gramophone Suite. They predicted that they would be dropped by the label due to disappointing sales, but would at least own a studio. The album showcased the band&#x27;s live set at the time, and included some guest drums from former Id drummer Malcolm Holmes and saxophone from former Dalek I Love You member Martin Cooper. It had a raw, poppy, melodic synth-pop sound. Dindisc arranged for the song &quot;Messages&quot; to be re-recorded (produced by Gong bassist Mike Howlett) and released as a single—it gave the band their first hit. Dave Hughes (another Dalek I Love You alumnus), who joined OMD in 1980, is featured in the &quot;Messages&quot; music video. A tour followed; Winston was augmented with live drums from Malcolm Holmes, and Dave Hughes played synthesizers. Hughes left OMD in late 1980.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Organisation&quot; (a reference to the band which preceded Kraftwerk, founded by Kraftwerk&#x27;s original members Florian Schneider-Esleben and Ralf Hütter), followed later that year, recorded as a three-piece with Humphreys, McCluskey and Holmes. It was again produced by Howlett, and had a darker, moodier feel largely inspired by the passing of Joy Division lead vocalist and former Factory label-mate Ian Curtis. The album included the anti-war hit single &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, named after the plane that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The song was intended to be included on the debut studio album, but was left out at the final selection. The tour for this album had a four-piece band line-up, with Martin Cooper recruited for keyboard duties and enlisted as an official group member. The McCluskey/Humphreys/Cooper/Holmes unit came to be regarded as the band&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; line-up. In early 1981, readers of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; voted OMD the fourth-best band and eighth-best live act of 1980; &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; readers named the group the eighth and 10th best new act of the year, respectively. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, they were voted both the fifth-best band of 1980 and the eighth-hottest new act for 1981.

Howlett then presided over the recording of a further hit single, &quot;Souvenir&quot;, co-written by Cooper and Humphreys. It ushered in a lush choral electronic sound. The song also became OMD&#x27;s biggest UK hit to date. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot;, was released in the UK and Europe in November 1981, becoming their most commercially successful studio album. The group went into the studio with Richard Manwaring producing. Cooper then temporarily dropped out and was replaced by Mike Douglas, but this change was reversed by the time the album was released and a tour followed. The album&#x27;s sound saw OMD&#x27;s original synth-pop sound augmented by the use of the Mellotron (an instrument previously associated with progressive rock bands), adding atmospheric swatches of string, choir, and other sounds to their palette. Two more hit singles, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;Maid of Orleans&quot; (which became the biggest-selling single of 1982 in Germany) were on the album. Both songs were originally titled &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;; the name of the latter single was changed to &quot;Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)&quot; at the insistence of the publishers and to avoid confusion. Readers of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; voted OMD the seventh-best group of 1981, while &quot;Record Mirror&quot; readers named them the eighth-best band (as well as the 10th-best &quot;new artist&quot;) and the third-best live act of the year. The group came close to breaking up in 1982, with McCluskey later saying, &quot;We had never expected the success, we were exhausted.&quot;
In 1983, the band lost commercial momentum somewhat, with the release of their more experimental fourth studio album &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;, produced by Rhett Davies, perhaps best known for his previous work with Roxy Music and Brian Eno. The record mixed melancholy synth ballads and uptempo synth-pop with musique concrète and short wave radio tape collages. Its relative commercial failure caused a crisis of confidence for Humphreys and McCluskey, and brought about a deliberate move towards the mainstream. Their following studio album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Junk Culture&quot;, was a shift to a more pop-style sound, and the band used digital sampling keyboards such as the Fairlight CMI and the E-mu Emulator. The album was a success, reassuring the group about their new direction. The &quot;Locomotion&quot; single returned them to the top five in the UK. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; readers named OMD the eighth-best live act of 1984.

In 1985, the band expanded to a sextet with the addition of brothers Graham Weir (guitar, keyboards, trombone) and Neil Weir (keyboards, trumpet, bass guitar), and released their sixth studio album, &quot;Crush&quot;, produced by Stephen Hague in Paris and New York. Sessions were strained, with Humphreys briefly quitting the group. OMD had been an early presence in the Second British Invasion of the US, but achieved their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit with the no. 26 entry &quot;So in Love&quot;. This led to some success for &quot;Crush&quot;, which entered the American Top 40. Later in 1985, the band were asked to write a song for the John Hughes film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986). They offered &quot;Goddess of Love&quot;, although the ending of the film was re-shot due to a negative response from test audiences. OMD then wrote &quot;If You Leave&quot; in less than 24 hours, and it became a top 5 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand. Journalist Hugo Lindgren argued that the success of &quot;If You Leave&quot; has concealed from US audiences the group&#x27;s history of making innovative music.

In September 1986, the same six piece line-up also released their seventh studio album, &quot;The Pacific Age&quot;, but the band began to see their critical and public popularity wane notably in the UK. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;(Forever) Live and Die&quot;, was a top 10 hit across Europe and entered the top 20 in both the UK and US. On 18 June 1988, OMD supported Depeche Mode at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California where they played to over 60,000 people. They also released the top 20 US hit &quot;Dreaming&quot; and a successful greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of OMD&quot;. Graham and Neil Weir left the group at the end of the 1988 US tour.

===1989–1996: McCluskey-led OMD and disbandment===

As OMD appeared poised to consolidate their US success, the band continued to fracture. Humphreys departed in 1989 amid personal and creative dissension with McCluskey. Cooper and Holmes then left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called the Listening Pool. McCluskey recalled, &quot;We were all in agreement that something was wrong. How to fix it was where we disagreed.&quot;

Only McCluskey was left to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey&#x27;s first album from the new OMD was the dance-pop studio album &quot;Sugar Tax&quot; in May 1991, which charted at No. 3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, Stuart Kershaw, Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of &quot;Sugar Tax&quot;; writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful, with hits such as &quot;Sailing on the Seven Seas&quot; and &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, with lesser success on fellow chart entries &quot;Call My Name&quot; and &quot;Then You Turn Away&quot;. McCluskey&#x27;s live band was then composed of Nigel Ipinson (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) from late 1990. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; readers voted OMD the sixth-best British group of 1991.

The group&#x27;s next studio album was 1993&#x27;s &quot;Liberator&quot;, which ventured further into dance territory. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single &quot;Stand Above Me&quot; peaked at no. 21 on the UK Singles Chart, with a follow-up single, &quot;Dream of Me&quot;, charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys was credited as co-writer of the single &quot;Everyday&quot; (a No. 59 UK chart entry). The fifth track from &quot;Liberator&quot;, &quot;Dream of Me&quot;, was built around a sample from &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot; by Love Unlimited Orchestra, a song written and produced by Barry White. To release the track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release would remove the actual &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot; sample, but still be officially titled &quot;Dream of Me (Based on Love&#x27;s Theme)&quot;, and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White.

Also in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the Elektric Music album &quot;Esperanto&quot;, a project by former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos. McCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the more organic &quot;Universal&quot; (1996), which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the &quot;Esperanto&quot; sessions, co-written by Bartos. The record spawned OMD&#x27;s first Top 20 hit in five years, &quot;Walking on the Milky Way&quot;.

Although both &quot;Liberator&quot; and &quot;Universal&quot; produced minor hits, McCluskey retired OMD in late 1996, having faced waning public interest amid the grunge and Britpop movements. A particular source of frustration was the modest commercial response to &quot;Walking on the Milky Way&quot;, over which McCluskey said he &quot;sweated blood&quot;, considering it &quot;about as good a song as I could write&quot;. However, the track was not playlisted by BBC Radio 1, and Woolworths did not stock it. McCluskey said, &quot;I just thought: &#x27;Screw this, I&#x27;m not going to bang my head against a brick wall&#x27;.&quot; A second singles album was released in 1998, along with an EP of remixed material by such acts as Sash! and Moby.

Post-1996, McCluskey decided to focus on songwriting for such Liverpool-based acts as Atomic Kitten and Genie Queen, and trying to develop new Merseyside artists from his Motor Museum recording studio. With McCluskey focusing his talents elsewhere, Humphreys decided to work with his new musical partner Claudia Brücken (of the ZTT bands Propaganda and Act) as Onetwo. He also undertook a US live tour under the banner &quot;Paul Humphreys from OMD&quot;.

===2006–2012: Reformation and comeback releases===

An unexpected request to perform from a German television show led the group to reunite. On 1 January 2006, McCluskey announced plans to reform OMD with the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes, and Cooper. The original plan was to tour the studio album &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; and other pre-1983 material, then record a new studio album set for release in 2007. In May 2007, the &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; remastered CD was re-released together with a DVD featuring the Drury Lane concert from 1981 that had previously been available on VHS. The band toured throughout May and June, beginning their set with a re-ordered but otherwise complete re-staging of the &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; album. The second half of each concert featured a selection of their best known hits.

A live CD and DVD of the 2007 tour, &quot;OMD Live: Architecture &amp; Morality &amp; More&quot;, was released in the spring of 2008; it was recorded at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Also released was a 25th anniversary re-release of &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;, including six bonus tracks. To tie-in with the re-release, the band made the brief &quot;Messages 78-08 30th Anniversary Tour&quot;, featuring China Crisis as a support act. A cover of Atomic Kitten&#x27;s 2001 hit, &quot;Whole Again&quot; (which had been co-written by McCluskey), was included on &quot;Liverpool – The Number Ones Album&quot; (2008), marking OMD&#x27;s first new studio recording in 12 years.

In June 2009, an orchestral concert with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was played in Liverpool; a recording of this concert was released on DVD in December. The band toured arenas in November and December, supporting Simple Minds on their Graffiti Soul Tour. OMD had performed at the Night of the Proms festival in December 2006 in Germany, renewing the experience again in Belgium and the Netherlands that year. They were the headline act at Britain&#x27;s first Vintage Computer Festival at The National Museum of Computing in June 2010.

McCluskey recalled, &quot;Once we had toured again... there was only one dangerous but logical next step: to be crazy enough to dare to make new music. The process took about three years as we were conscious that a poor album would undermine all of the positive effects that we had achieved in the touring.&quot; Pet Shop Boys keyboardist Chris Lowe encouraged their return to the studio, declaring that &quot;the world needs more OMD records&quot;. The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;History of Modern&quot;, was released in September 2010, reaching No. 28 in the UK Albums Chart and being followed by a European tour. Reviews of the album were generally favourable.

On 28 September, OMD performed as a special guest at the &quot;first ever gig&quot; of the Buggles. In March 2011, the band played their first North American tour as the &quot;classic&quot; line-up since 1988. In September, they appeared at the 2011 Electric Picnic festival in Stradbally, Ireland. In November 2011, OMD returned to the studio and started work on their next album, &quot;English Electric&quot;. On 12 March 2012, the band played a concert in the Philippines at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. In August, OMD performed to South African audiences in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

===2013–2019: Return to prominence===

In 2013, OMD performed at Coachella, a festival in Indio, California, on 14 and 21 April. &quot;Metroland&quot;, the first single from the forthcoming studio album &quot;English Electric&quot;, was released on 25 March 2013. The album was released in the UK on 8 April, and entered the UK album chart at No. 12 and the German chart at No. 10. Reviews for both the album and their concerts were generally positive. &quot;The Future Will Be Silent&quot;, a 500-copy limited edition 10-inch picture disc EP from &quot;English Electric&quot;, was made available for Record Store Day 2013, and included a then-exclusive non-album track titled &quot;Time Burns&quot;. For Record Store Day 2015, a 1000-copy limited edition 10-inch EP of &quot;Julia&#x27;s Song (Dub Version)&quot; from &quot;Junk Culture&quot; was made available, which includes an exclusive non-album track titled &quot;10 to 1&quot;.

OMD performed a one-off concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London on 9 May 2016 to a sell-out crowd, playing both &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; and &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; in their entirety, along with other songs from before 1983. The only song post-1983 played was &quot;History of Modern Part 1&quot;. The concert was recorded and made available on double CD right after the show, with a triple LP vinyl recording of the concert also being made available. The band collaborated with Gary Barlow, Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman on the OMD song &quot;Thrill Me&quot;, co-written by Barlow and McCluskey for the soundtrack of the 2015 film &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;. Work began in October 2015 on what was to be their thirteenth studio album &quot;The Punishment of Luxury&quot;, which was released on 1 September 2017 and charted at no. 4 in the UK. OMD toured Europe and North America in support of the album, with Stuart Kershaw replacing Holmes as the band&#x27;s drummer, due to the latter&#x27;s health issues.

In 2018, OMD published a book titled &quot;Pretending to See the Future&quot;, which is a first-person &quot;autobiography&quot; about the band. It mixed fan-submitted memories with commentary from McCluskey, Humphreys, Cooper, Holmes, and Kershaw. For people who pre-ordered the book on PledgeMusic, they received a limited-edition flexi-disc containing a previously unheard demo of &quot;Messages&quot; from 1978.

As part of OMD&#x27;s 40th-anniversary celebrations, they embarked on a UK and European tour in 2019. The band won &quot;Group of the Year&quot; and &quot;Live Act of the Year&quot; in the 2019 &quot;Classic Pop&quot; Reader Awards. A retrospective deluxe box set titled &quot;Souvenir&quot; was also released. The 40th anniversary collection includes the band&#x27;s forty singles, including a new release titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. It also contains 22 previously unreleased recordings from the group&#x27;s archive, selected and mixed by Paul Humphreys. Two audio live shows (one from 2011 and one from 2013) are also included, together with two DVDs bringing together two more live concerts (Drury Lane in 1981 and Sheffield City Hall in 1985) plus &quot;Crush – The Movie&quot;, and various BBC TV performances from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;.

===2020–present: Continued acknowledgement===

During the COVID-19 lockdown imposed in March 2020, McCluskey &quot;rediscovered the creative power of boredom&quot; and began writing material for OMD&#x27;s next studio album. In October, the band returned to live performance with a limited-capacity gig at London&#x27;s indigo at The O2, with proceeds going to their road crew; the event was also streamed online. In 2021, the &quot;Souvenir&quot; box set was nominated for &quot;Best Historical Album&quot; at the Grammy Awards. Also that year, OMD celebrated the 40th anniversary of 1981&#x27;s &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; with a UK tour, and released a triple-vinyl set of the album&#x27;s singles containing associated B-sides, demo recordings, and live tracks. 

In March 2022, a pair of concerts with a heavy emphasis on the group&#x27;s more experimental work (rescheduled from September 2020), took place at the Royal Albert Hall, with a live album based on the shows released through the OMD store. Another re-issue of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;, featuring previously unheard recordings, was announced for a March 2023 release.

OMD&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Bauhaus Staircase&quot;, was released on 27 October 2023; it was preceded by a single, the title track, on 22 August. The record debuted at no. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, matching the peak achieved by &quot;The Best of OMD&quot; (1988). McCluskey has said that &quot;Bauhaus Staircase&quot; is likely to be the band&#x27;s final album. Their latest 2024 tour runs from March to October including gigs in the UK, South Africa, Canada and the US.

==Artistry and image==
===Early ethos and presentation===

Electronic band Kraftwerk served as OMD&#x27;s primary musical influence: McCluskey credits &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974) with piquing he and Humphreys&#x27; interest in electronic music. Other formative influences included the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Roxy Music, Brian Eno and David Bowie. The pair also drew inspiration from Factory Records label-mates Joy Division, particularly during the making of &quot;Organisation&quot; (1980). Disenchanted with the macho guitar rock that was popular among their friends, McCluskey and Humphreys were keen to &quot;slay the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll dragon&quot;.

&quot;Spin&quot; wrote that &quot;OMD set about reinventing punk with different applications of dance beats, keyboards, melodies, and sulks&quot;, rejecting the genre&#x27;s &quot;sonic trappings but not its intellectual freedom&quot;. The group found commercial success with a style of synth-pop described as &quot;experimental&quot;, &quot;minimal[ist]&quot; and &quot;edgy&quot;. OMD often eschewed choruses, replacing them with synthesizer lines, and opted for unconventional lyrical subjects such as industrial processes, micronations and telephone boxes; the BBC said that the band &quot;were always more intellectual&quot; than &quot;contemporaries like Duran Duran and Eurythmics&quot;. Despite the group&#x27;s experimentation, they employed pop hooks in their music, attaining what AllMusic described as &quot;the enviable position of at once being creative innovators and radio-friendly pop giants&quot;.

According to the &quot;NRC&quot;, OMD are &quot;known as the band that managed to wring emotion from synthesizer pop&quot;. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; stated that &quot;their music, even with its occasionally cerebral themes, has always been defined by warmth, heart and soul: the sound of machinery manipulated by a tender human touch.&quot; Musician Vince Clarke felt the group were responsible for educating mainstream audiences that electronic music could have emotion. Michael Grace Jr., founder of indie pop outfit My Favorite, said in 2018, &quot;The thing that strikes me now when I return to OMD is how remarkably human they sound. They are a soul band for an automated age. OMD proposed an honest rendering of the tension, fascination, and occasional terror they felt about how ghosts and machines would get along. It was more Philip K. Dick than Steve Jobs.&quot;

OMD have been recognised as the first of Britain&#x27;s many &quot;synth duo&quot; acts. Nostalgie wrote that they became &quot;a precursor of a whole generation of duos operating according to the same principle&quot;. Although the two original members enlisted other musicians over time, &quot;PopMatters&quot; said the band remained, &quot;in essence, the songwriting/recording duo of Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys&quot;. OMD continues to be termed a &quot;duo&quot; in the media.

OMD were indifferent to celebrity status, and avoided the calculated fashion stylings of many of their 1980s peers. During live performances, McCluskey developed a frenetic dancing style that has been dubbed the &quot;Trainee Teacher Dance&quot;; he explains that it stemmed &quot;from the perception that [OMD] were making boring robotic intellectual music that you couldn&#x27;t dance to&quot;. Journalist Hugo Lindgren noted that the group were perceived as &quot;oddballs, freaks&quot; on the Liverpool scene, while McCluskey has identified himself and Humphreys as &quot;synth punks&quot; and &quot;complete geeks&quot;. OMD weathered an &quot;uncool&quot; image, and faced hostility from sections of the music press in the 1980s. Critic Andrew Collins asserted, however, that the band would eventually &quot;become cool&quot; to the public.

&quot;Record Mirror&quot; pondered in 1980 whether McCluskey and Humphreys were emerging as &quot;the Lennon and McCartney of the electronic world&quot;. The press began to describe the duo as &quot;the Lennon–McCartney of synth-pop&quot;, which &quot;the A.V. Club&quot; saw as &quot;a weighty mantle that has as much to do with their hailing from Liverpool as anything&quot;. The &quot;Salt Lake City Weekly&quot; remarked that the label &quot;might be a bit hyperbolic, but OMD was indeed ahead of its time&quot;. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; had no reservations about the moniker, labelling OMD a &quot;thoroughly sparkling pop group&quot; with &quot;more hooks than a chain of angling megastores&quot;.

===Mid-1980s style change===

Although retrospectively lauded, the experimental &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; (1983) was a critical and commercial disappointment upon release. Facing potential excision from Virgin Records, OMD moved towards a more accessible sound on the black music-influenced &quot;Junk Culture&quot; (1984); they also donned more vibrant garments on the album&#x27;s accompanying tour. The band continued to incorporate elements of sonic experimentation, although their sound became increasingly polished on the Stephen Hague-produced studio albums &quot;Crush&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Pacific Age&quot; (1986).

&quot;The Quietus&quot; founder John Doran, who was supportive of the group&#x27;s reinvention, told how it became &quot;quite popular to see OMD as nose-diving into the effluence after &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;&quot;. Author Richard Metzger refused to &quot;stick up for anything they recorded&quot; afterwards, while &quot;the A.V. Club&quot; alleged that McCluskey would &quot;give up&quot; following that album. Conversely, music journalist Ian Peel observed &quot;two brilliant, but very different, bands. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, the early 80s Factory descendents... and OMD, the late 80s stadium pop act.&quot; The &quot;Miami New Times&quot; asserted that &quot;even their poppiest records of that postexperimental era, such as &quot;Junk Culture&quot; and &quot;Crush&quot;, were clever and beautifully arranged.&quot; Both of those albums were generally well-reviewed.

Musicians have commented on OMD&#x27;s post-&quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; output. Moby remarked, &quot;Their earlier records were just phenomenal... a few years on they were making music for John Hughes movies, and they were good at it and I&#x27;m glad that they had success with it, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as creatively inspiring.&quot; On the other hand, bassist Tony Kanal of No Doubt told how his group experimented with OMD-esque &quot;John Hughes prom-scene movie moment kind of songs&quot;, adding that &quot;&quot;Junk Culture&quot; is great&quot;. Angus Andrew of Liars hoped that tentative listeners would uncover &quot;the complexity and mastery in OMD&#x27;s later pop material&quot;, and declared himself a fan of the band&#x27;s work across &quot;all of their phases&quot;.

The group themselves describe &quot;Junk Culture&quot; as an enjoyable &quot;collection of songs&quot; as opposed to a &quot;deep, conceptual&quot; record, and argue that &quot;Crush&quot; features some strong material despite being hastily written and excessively produced. They concede, however, that &quot;The Pacific Age&quot; &quot;[does]n&#x27;t work&quot; and marks their &quot;musical nadir&quot;. Critic Jessica Bendinger reflected on OMD&#x27;s stylistic journey by the late 1980s, saying that &quot;their music has been colored by continual exploration... which has run the gamut from Gregorian-chant-inspired anthems of love to a union of Orchestral-Motown.&quot; &quot;SF Weekly&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to think of any 1980s new wave bands that could navigate the genre&#x27;s spectrum of sound and mood as well as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.&quot;

===Subsequent reinventions===
The McCluskey-led OMD explored a dance-oriented approach on &quot;Sugar Tax&quot; (1991) and &quot;Liberator&quot; (1993); the latter has since been dismissed by McCluskey. Ian Peel wrote that the band &quot;defied expectations by updating their sound and becoming, if only briefly, relevant in the 90s&quot;. The group disbanded shortly after the release of &quot;Universal&quot; (1996), on which they strained for a more organic and acoustic sound. In reviewing &quot;The OMD Singles&quot; (1998), AllMusic asserted that the band &quot;covered in a single career that same territory explored by the Human League, Erasure, Yaz[oo], New Order, and beyond.&quot;

Since OMD&#x27;s 2006 reformation, their material has been seen as more akin to their early output. &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that the group&#x27;s 21st century work represents &quot;one of the more successful second acts in modern pop history&quot;. The band are noted for their diverse contributions to the electronic, new wave, experimental, dance and post-punk genres. OMD have undertaken regular UK and international gigs since they reformed, staging their own tours and also embracing &#x27;80s revival festivals such as the Rewind Festival and Heritage Live.

==Legacy and influence==

OMD have sold over 40 million records, and are considered one of synth-pop&#x27;s most influential acts. They were identified by &quot;the A.V. Club&quot; as &quot;one of the earliest synthesizer-driven bands to break out of the post-punk scene and lead the charge toward the defining sound of the [1980s].&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted how OMD&#x27;s work &quot;gave credibility to ambitious pop&quot; and led to &quot;the emergence of a generation of electronic bands&quot;, including Talk Talk, ABC, Blancmange, and the Vince Clarke projects Depeche Mode, Yazoo and Erasure. Clarke recognised OMD as being &quot;ahead of their time&quot;, and credited their &quot;really great tunes and ideas&quot; with directly inspiring him to become an electronic musician. The Pet Shop Boys found common ground in their affection for OMD, drawing particular inspiration from &quot;Souvenir&quot; (1981). Lead singer Neil Tennant named the group as &quot;pioneers of electronic music&quot;—a viewpoint shared by multiple outlets.

OMD impacted the likes of Howard Jones, New Order, Tears for Fears, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, a-ha, Men Without Hats, Alphaville, China Crisis, and Duran Duran, for whom &quot;Electricity&quot; (1979) was an early influence. The band were cited as &quot;heroes&quot; by Kim Wilde songwriter/producer, Ricky Wilde. Within rock music, OMD directly inspired ZZ Top&#x27;s introduction of electronic instruments and onstage dancing in the early 1980s. The group were influential on U2, whose frontman, Bono, adorned his bedroom wall with a poster of their debut album cover; bandmate Adam Clayton later contributed to the official biography, &quot;OMD: Pretending to See the Future&quot; (2018). Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist, John Frusciante, drew inspiration from the group&#x27;s &quot;minimal&quot; synthesizer melodies, in which &quot;every note means something new&quot;. OMD were also influential on industrial artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy&#x27;s Nivek Ogre, and Front Line Assembly&#x27;s Rhys Fulber, who observed an &quot;amazing&quot; combination of &quot;art, experimentation and pop&quot;. Ministry&#x27;s Al Jourgensen found inspiration in &quot;Electricity&quot;.

Simple Minds&#x27; Jim Kerr recalled, &quot;I was more than instantly charmed by [OMD]... they had somehow arrived almost fully formed and with a talent for spitfire hooks that permeated right through their songs.&quot; Former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos lauded the band&#x27;s &quot;magnificent melodies&quot;, likening them to &quot;Italian folk music, the very music [Giacomo] Puccini absorbed&quot;. OMD have garnered praise from other 1980s peers including Trevor Horn, Toyah Willcox, the Human League&#x27;s Philip Oakey, Thompson Twins&#x27; Tom Bailey, and Mute Records founder Daniel Miller, while Gary Numan credited the group for &quot;some of the best pop songs ever written&quot;. Frontman McCluskey has gained the admiration of musicians such as Paul McCartney, Heaven 17&#x27;s Martyn Ware, The Teardrop Explodes&#x27;s David Balfe, and Joy Division&#x27;s Peter Hook, who labelled him a &quot;really underrated&quot; talent.

OMD helped to inform the 1990s dance music scene. They became an early influence on performers including Orbital, David Guetta, Paul van Dyk, Mike Paradinas, and Moby, who cited the band as &quot;synth heroes&quot; and a critical factor in his career choice. Among rock-oriented artists, OMD have inspired the likes of No Doubt, the Killers, the xx, Barenaked Ladies, MGMT, AFI, LCD Soundsystem, and James Mercer of the Shins and Broken Bells. Mercer affirmed, &quot;OMD are an integral thread in my musical history. You can hear them in my melodic sensibilities and at times in our production... I&#x27;ll always love them.&quot; The group have also influenced pop acts such as Gary Barlow, Robyn, La Roux, Peter Bjorn and John, Neil Hannon, and Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s Stevie Jackson. Singer Anohni said of &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; (1983): &quot;Those records, they really changed me when I was a kid. I&#x27;d never heard anything quite like it... this really scary, futuristic landscape.&quot; The experimental &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot; has influenced various artists, including Arcade Fire (and orchestrator Owen Pallett), Radiohead, Death Cab for Cutie, Saint Etienne, Future Islands, and producer Mark Ronson. Its content was sampled by the hip hop acts Kid Cudi and Lushlife.

Elsewhere, &quot;Electricity&quot; directly inspired the creation of indie pop band Nation of Language, as well as the radio career of Steve Lamacq. The synth-pop acts Our Daughter&#x27;s Wedding and Hot Chip paid &quot;homage&quot; to OMD in their work, while indie rock group Low wrote &quot;Cue the Strings&quot; (2005) as a &quot;shout-out&quot; to the band. Pop singer Boy George said he wished he had written OMD&#x27;s &quot;The View from Here&quot; (2017). The group&#x27;s influence extends to indie folk singer Sharon Van Etten, alternative metal band Deftones, country duo Sugarland, actor/writer Scott Aukerman, novelist Anna Smaill, filmmaker Noah Baumbach, physicist Brian Cox, and musician/producer Steven Wilson, who has worked in varied genres. Wilson dubbed OMD a &quot;wonderful collision of ideas&quot;, whose albums &quot;stand up very, very well as experimental pop records with the most enjoyable kind of songwriting&quot;. The group were inducted into the &quot;Goldmine&quot; Hall of Fame in 2014, being described as &quot;leader[s] in the synthpop movement&quot; and one of rock&#x27;s most &quot;underappreciated&quot; bands.

<doc id="171512" wikidata="Q5245307" url="?curid=171512" title="Dead Man Walking (book)">
<text>Dead Man Walking (1993) is a work of non-fiction by Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and one of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille based in New Orleans. Arising from her work as a spiritual adviser to two convicted murderers on death row, the book is set largely at the Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. It examines moral issues related to the men&#x27;s acknowledgement of their crimes and to the state&#x27;s use of the death penalty.

==Background==
Prejean has become a leading advocate for the abolition of capital punishment in the United States. Her campaign was initiated following her correspondence and visits that she maintained with two convicted murderers. She began this ministry in 1982. The first man was Elmo Patrick Sonnier, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his execution in the electric chair. The second was Robert Lee Willie for whom she also served as spiritual adviser.

Prejean gained insight into the minds of the convicted murderers, the process involved in executions, and the effects on the prison guards and other personnel. She became convinced that the state&#x27;s use of the death penalty was morally wrong and began speaking out against capital punishment. At the same time, she founded &quot;Survive&quot;, an organization devoted to providing counseling to the families of victims of violence.

==Name==
The title of the book comes from a once-traditional phrase in American prisons to designate men who had been sentenced to death. They were held on what was known as death row and were deprived of most social contact and barred from work or participation in prison programs. Before the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, &quot;Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!&quot; The origin of the phrase is unknown, although it may come from the title of an 1890 poem by Thomas Hardy about a person who turns into a corpse even when apparently alive. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners to let them know that they should be on their guard since a death row prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of honorific declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way, death row prisoners being seen as an elite within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a stigma attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him to avoid catching his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

In 1995, a film based on the book was made, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. The film was a critical and commerical success, and Sarandon won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

===Opera===

The book was adapted as an opera of the same name, composed by Jake Heggie with a libretto by playwright Terrence McNally. It premiered at the San Francisco Opera in October 2000. The international premiere of the opera was in August 2003, in Adelaide. It has been produced in several other cities, including by the Union Avenue Opera in St. Louis, Missouri. In November 2019, Lyric Opera of Chicago presented their premiere of the opera. It premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in September 2023.

===Stage version of the book/film===

Hoping to expand the influence of the book and her message, Sister Helen collaborated with director Tim Robbins to adapt the book into a stage play. According to the Catholic Mobilizing Network and the play&#x27;s website, &quot;Since the launch of the project in the fall of 2003, more than 250 high schools and colleges across the country have produced the play, conducted academic courses on the death penalty, and brought the issue to life on their campuses through art, music, and public education and action events.&quot;

<doc id="171513" wikidata="Q1355094" url="?curid=171513" title="Jetboat">
<text>A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft. Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses an external propeller in the water below or behind the boat, a jetboat draws the water from under the boat through an intake and into a pump-jet inside the boat, before expelling it through a nozzle at the stern.

The modern jetboat was developed by New Zealand engineer Sir William Hamilton in the mid-1950s. His goal was a boat to run up the fast-flowing rivers of New Zealand that were too shallow for propellers.

Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes, generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers. Unlike these previous waterjet developments, such as Campini&#x27;s and the Hanley Hydrojet, Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very shallow water, and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution. The popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly. It was found the waterjet was better than propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and waterjets are now used widely for many high-speed vessels including passenger ferries, rescue craft, patrol boats and offshore supply vessels.

Jetboats are highly manoeuvrable, and many can be reversed from full speed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length, in a manoeuvre known as a &quot;crash stop&quot;. The well known &quot;Hamilton turn&quot; or &quot;jet spin&quot; is a high-speed manoeuvre where the boat&#x27;s engine throttle is cut, the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again, causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water.

There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats, though whether they are useful depends on the type of application. Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about , but as boat speed increases, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders, shafts and so on means waterjets are more efficient up to . For very large propellers turning at slow speeds, such as in tugboats, the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical. The vast majority of waterjet units are therefore installed in high-speed vessels and in situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are the main concerns.

The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use and the high-speed passenger and car ferry industry. South Africa&#x27;s s (approximately long) and the long United States Littoral Combat Ship are among the biggest jet-propelled vessels . Even these vessels are capable of performing &quot;crash stops&quot;.

==Function==
A conventional screw propeller works within the body of water below a boat hull, effectively &quot;screwing&quot; through the water to drive a vessel forward by generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the propeller blades and by accelerating a mass of water rearward. By contrast, a waterjet unit delivers a high-pressure &quot;push&quot; from the stern of a vessel by accelerating a volume of water as it passes through a specialised pump mounted above the waterline inside the boat hull. Both methods yield thrust due to Newton&#x27;s third law— every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

In a jetboat, the waterjet draws water from beneath the hull, where it passes through a series of impellers and stators – known as stages – which increase the velocity of the waterflow. Most modern jets are single-stage, while older waterjets may have as many as three stages. The tail section of the waterjet unit extends out through the transom of the hull, above the waterline. This jetstream exits the unit through a small nozzle at high velocity to push the boat forward. Steering is accomplished by moving this nozzle to either side, or less commonly, by small gates on either side that deflect the jetstream. Because the jetboat relies on the flow of water through the nozzle for control, it is not possible to steer a conventional jetboat without the engine running.

Unlike conventional propeller systems where the rotation of the propeller is reversed to provide astern movement, a waterjet will continue to pump normally while a deflector is lowered into the jetstream after it leaves the outlet nozzle. This deflector redirects thrust forces forward to provide reverse thrust. Most highly developed reverse deflectors redirect the jetstream down and to each side to prevent recirculation of the water through the jet again, which may cause aeration problems, or increase reverse thrust. Steering is still available with the reverse deflector lowered so the vessel will have full maneuverability. With the deflector lowered about halfway into the jetstream, forward and reverse thrust are equal so the boat maintains a fixed position, but steering is still available to allow the vessel to turn on the spot – something which is impossible with a conventional single propeller.

Unlike hydrofoils, which use underwater wings or struts to lift the vessel clear of the water, standard jetboats use a conventional planing hull to ride across the water surface, with only the rear portion of the hull displacing any water. With the majority of the hull clear of the water, there is reduced drag, greatly enhancing speed and maneuverability, so jetboats are normally operated at planing speed. At slower speeds with less water pumping through the jet unit, the jetboat will lose some steering control and maneuverability and will quickly slow down as the hull comes off its planing state and hull resistance is increased. However, loss of steering control at low speeds can be overcome by lowering the reverse deflector slightly and increasing throttle – so an operator may increase thrust and thus control without increasing boat speed itself. A conventional river-going jetboat will have a shallow-angled (but not flat-bottomed) hull to improve its high-speed cornering control and stability, while also allowing it to traverse very shallow water. At speed, jetboats can be safely operated in less than 7.5 cm (3 inches) of water.
One of the most significant breakthroughs, in the development of the waterjet, was to change the design so it expelled the jetstream &quot;above&quot; the water line, contrary to many people&#x27;s intuition. Hamilton discovered early on that this greatly improved performance, compared to expelling below the waterline, while also providing a &quot;clean&quot; hull bottom (i.e. nothing protruding below the hull line) to allow the boat to skim through very shallow water. It makes no difference to the amount of thrust generated whether the outlet is above or below the waterline, but having it above the waterline reduces hull resistance and draught. Hamilton&#x27;s first waterjet design had the outlet below the hull and actually in front of the inlet. This probably meant that disturbed water was entering the jet unit and reducing its performance, and the main reason why the change to above the waterline made such a difference.

==Applications==
Applications for jetboats include most activities where conventional propellers are also used, but in particular passenger ferry services, coastguard and police patrol, navy and military, adventure tourism (which is becoming increasingly popular around the globe), pilot boat operations, surf rescue, farming, fishing, exploration, pleasure boating, and other water activities where motor boats are used. Jetboats can also be raced for sport, both on rivers (World Champion Jet Boat Marathon held in Mexico, Canada, USA and New Zealand) and on specially designed racecourses known as sprint tracks. Recently there has been increasing use of jetboats in the form of rigid-hulled inflatable boats and as luxury yacht tenders. Many jetboats are small enough to be carried on a trailer and towed by car.

As jetboats have no external rotating parts they are safer for swimmers and marine life, though they can be struck by the hull. The safety benefit itself can sometimes be reason enough to use this type of propulsion.

In 1977, Sir Edmund Hillary led a jetboat expedition, titled &quot;Ocean to Sky&quot;, from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. One of the jetboats was sunk by a friend of Hillary.

==Drawbacks==
The fuel efficiency and performance of a jetboat can be affected by anything that disrupts the smooth flow of water through the jet unit. For example, a plastic bag sucked onto the jet unit&#x27;s intake grill can have quite an adverse effect.

Another disadvantage of jetboats appears to be that they are more sensitive to engine/jet unit mismatch, compared with the problem of engine/propeller mismatch in propeller-driven craft. If the jet-propulsion unit is not well-matched to the engine performance, excessive fuel consumption and poor performance can result.

<doc id="171515" wikidata="Q166272" url="?curid=171515" title="Geoffrey Rush">
<text>Geoffrey Roy Rush (born 6 July 1951) is an Australian actor. Known for often playing eccentric roles on both stage and screen, he has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and a Tony Award, making him the only Australian to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting, in addition to three BAFTA Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. Rush is the founding president of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts and was named the 2012 Australian of the Year.

Rush began his professional acting career with the Queensland Theatre Company in 1971. He studied for two years at the L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq starting in 1975. Rush starred in international productions of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in the absurdist comedy &quot;Exit the King&quot; in 2009, where he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance. He received a nomination for Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play for &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; in 2011.

He gained prominence for his role in &quot;Shine&quot; (1996), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His other Oscar-nominated roles were for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;Quills&quot; (2000), and &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010). Rush gained mainstream popularity for his role as Captain Hector Barbossa in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise (2003–2017). His other notable films include in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1998), &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; (2003), &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Book Thief&quot; (2013).

Rush is also known for his performances in television receiving Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominations for his portrayals of comedian Peter Sellers in the HBO film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004), and scientist Albert Einstein in National Geographic anthology series &quot;Genius&quot; (2017), winning for the former.

==Early life and education==
Rush was born on 6 July 1951 in Toowoomba, Queensland, the son of Merle (Bischof), a department store sales assistant, and Roy Baden Rush, an accountant for the Royal Australian Air Force. His father was of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, and his mother was of German descent. He has an older sister. His parents divorced when he was five, and his mother subsequently took him to live with her parents in suburban Brisbane. Before he began his acting career, Rush attended Everton Park State High School, and graduated from the University of Queensland with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Arts. While at university, he was talent-spotted by Queensland Theatre Company (QTC) in Brisbane. Rush began his career with QTC in 1971, appearing in 17 productions.

In 1975, Rush went to Paris for two years and studied mime, movement and theatre at L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, before returning to resume his stage career with QTC. In 1979, he shared an apartment with actor Mel Gibson for four months while they co-starred in a stage production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

== Career ==
===1979–1995: Rise to prominence ===
Rush made his theatre debut in the QTC&#x27;s production of &quot;Wrong Side of the Moon&quot;. He worked with the QTC for four years, appearing in roles ranging across classical plays and pantomime, from &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; to &quot;Hamlet on Ice&quot;. Following these, Rush left for Paris where he studied further. Rush made his film debut in the Australian film &quot;Hoodwink&quot; in 1981. His next film was Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Starstruck&quot;, the following year. Rush&#x27;s acting credits include William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (with the State Theatre Company of South Australia in 1987 at The Playhouse in Adelaide) and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (at the Old Museum Building in 1989). He also appeared in an ongoing production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; as John Worthing (Ernest) (in which his wife, Jane Menelaus, appeared as Gwendolen).

In the 1990s Rush appeared in small roles on television dramas, including a role as a dentist in a 1993 episode of the British television series &quot;Lovejoy&quot;. Rush also continued his work in theatre. In 1994, Rush played Horatio in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; alongside Richard Roxburgh, Jacqueline McKenzie and David Wenham in the Company B production at the Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney.

=== 1996–2002: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Rush made his film breakthrough with his performance in 1996 with &quot;Shine&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush had once learned piano up until aged fourteen and retook piano lessons again thirty years later for the role, choosing to perform most of the piano playing himself rather than using a hand double. That same year, James L. Brooks flew him to Los Angeles to audition for the part of Simon Bishop in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; and offered him the role, but Rush declined it (it went to Greg Kinnear). In September 1998, Rush played the title role in the Beaumarchais play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; for the QTC. This was the opening production of the Optus Playhouse at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre at South Bank in Brisbane. A pun on Rush&#x27;s name (and the circumstances) was used in the opening prologue of the play with the comment that the &quot;Optus Playhouse was opening with a Rush&quot;. 

In 1998, he appeared in three major costume dramas. He played Javert opposite Liam Neeson as Jean Valjean in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The film directed by Bille August was an adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. Uma Thurman and Claire Danes also acted in the film. He also portrayed Sir Francis Walsingham alongside fellow Australian Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I in the historical drama &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. He received a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for his performance. Finally Rush portrayed Philip Henslowe in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; acting opposite Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, and Judi Dench. For his performance he received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 1999, Rush took the lead role as Steven Price in the horror film &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, and played the villain in the superhero comedy film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;.

In 2000, Rush starred in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Quills&quot; where he played the Marquis de Sade alongside Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix and Michael Caine. The film was written by Tony Award winning playwright Doug Wright who adapted the film&#x27;s screenplay from his play. Rush received widespread critical acclaim for his performance with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Peter Travers&#x27; describing his performance as &quot;volcanic&quot;, and &quot;scandalously good&quot;. For his performance in the film he received his third Oscar nomination this time for Best Actor. Rush&#x27;s career continued at a fast pace, with nine films released from 2001 to 2003. In 2002, Rush played Leon Trotsky to Salma Hayek&#x27;s Frida Kahlo in Julie Taymor&#x27;s &quot;Frida&quot;. In the reaction to the #MeToo Movement, Hayek wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailing the harassment Harvey Weinstein perpetrated against her. In the article she wrote about her determination to make the movie and praised Rush as a collaborator and for agreeing to act in the film.

=== 2003–2011: Established actor ===

Rush appeared in several films released in 2003. He played Superintendent Francis Hare in &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; with Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts. He voiced Nigel the brown pelican in the Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. Late in the year, he appeared in the Coen Brothers romantic comedy, &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; alongside George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Rush starred in the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, released in summer 2003, as Captain Hector Barbossa. The film was a massive financial success earning $654.3 million. Rush would continue to reprise the role in its sequels, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; (2011) and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). In addition, Rush reprised his character&#x27;s voice for the enhancements at the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; attractions at the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom theme parks, which involved an audio-animatronic with Rush&#x27;s likeness being installed (including one at Tokyo Disneyland).

Rush played actor Peter Sellers in the HBO television film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. For this performance, he won various awards including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie. In 2005, he appeared in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Munich&quot; as Ephraim, a Mossad agent. The film is an account of Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre, the Israeli government&#x27;s secret retaliation against the Palestine Liberation Organization after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. It was a critical and financial success earning five Academy Award nominations including for Best Picture. In 2017, the film was named the 16th &quot;Best Film of the 21st Century So Far&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2006, Rush hosted the Australian Film Institute Awards for the Nine Network. He was the master of ceremonies again at the 2007 AFI Awards.

The film focuses on their unlikely friendship as they work together after Edward VIII played by Guy Pearce, abdicates the throne. The new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany in 1939. The film also starred Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, and Jennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue. The film was a financial success earning $424 million at the box office. Rush&#x27;s performance was praised by critics and earned him a British Academy Film Award win and nominations for the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actor.

He won for this role the Helpmann Award and was nominated for the Drama Desk Award. From November 2011, Rush played the role of Lady Bracknell in the Melbourne Theatre Company production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. Other actors from the 1988 production include Jane Menelaus, this time as Miss Prism, and Bob Hornery, who had played Canon Chasuble, as the two butlers.

From 2011 to 2017, Rush was served as the foundation president of the newly formed Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. 

=== 2012–present ===
In 2013, Rush appeared alongside Jim Sturgess in psychological thriller &quot;The Best Offer&quot; with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noting in their mixed review, &quot;[The film] is worth watching for Geoffrey Rush’s sensitive, never pandering performance as an effete master auctioneer who gradually discovers he has a heart&quot;. Rush also appeared in the film adaptation of the best-selling novel &quot;The Book Thief&quot; (2013). Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety Magazine&quot; praised his performance writing, that &quot;Rush generously provides the movie&#x27;s primary warmth and humor&quot;. His performance earned him a nomination for the AACTA International Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2017, Rush starred in Stanley Tucci&#x27;s film &quot;Final Portrait&quot; alongside Armie Hammer. The film had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. The film received positive reviews from critics earning a 73% from Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, &quot;&quot;Final Portrait&quot; finds writer-director Stanley Tucci patiently telling a quietly absorbing story, brought to life by a talented ensemble led by Geoffrey Rush and Armie Hammer. 
Rush returned to television, portraying Albert Einstein in the first season of National Geographic&#x27;s limited anthology series &quot;Genius&quot;. The series was executive produced by Ron Howard and also starred Emily Watson. Luke Buckmaster of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;[The series] offers a predictably excellent performance from Rush, who since his breakthrough in 1996’s &quot;Shine&quot; as the tormented pianist David Helfgott, has been attracted to eccentric genius characters like a moth to the light.&quot; Rush won widespread acclaim earning nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor in a Limited Series or Television Film. In 2018, upon winning the Screen Actors Guild Award as Winston Churchill for &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, Gary Oldman praised Rush as a &quot;giant of acting&quot; along with Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Richard Jenkins, and Denzel Washington. 

In 2018, Rush played the character of adult Michael Kingley in the family drama &quot;Storm Boy&quot; alongside Finn Little, Jai Courtney, and Trevor Jamieson. It was released on 17 January 2019. Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that the film &quot;provide[s] the opportunity for Rush to deliver one of his more subtle, effective performances in recent years&quot;. In 2023 it was announced Rush would star opposite John Lithgow in the horror thriller &quot;The Rule of Jenny Pen&quot;. The film received positive reviews with Alison Foreman of &quot;IndieWire&quot; writing, &quot;Both Lithgow and Rush [are] fully committed to the twisted two-hander&quot; adding, &quot;Rush enjoys a wonderfully self-contradictory performance that’s equal parts desperate and ferocious. Summoning the bravado he once brought to the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films.&quot; Lithgow and Rush shared the Best Actor prize at Spain’s Sitges Film Festival in October 2024.

==== Upcoming projects ====
In 2022, he was announced to be starring as Groucho Marx in an adaptation of the memoir &quot;Raised Eyebrows&quot;. The film will be directed by Oren Moverman and co-star Sienna Miller and Charlie Plummer. Rush said of the project that the Marx film is not a biopic, but rather a “tragic comedy about mortality”, about the last three years of Marx’s life. Rush is also set to star opposite Emma Roberts in the action-comedy film &quot;Verona Spies&quot;. In 2025, it was announced Rush would star opposite Isabelle Huppert in a film adaptation of the Justin Fleming stage play &quot;Burnt Piano&quot; directed by Fred Schepisi.

=== Marriage and family ===
Since 1988, Rush has been married to actress Jane Menelaus, with whom he has a daughter and a son. Rush lives in Melbourne, and spent several years in Castlemaine, Victoria.

=== Legal issues ===
On 30 November 2017, the Sydney tabloid newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published a front-page article alleging that Rush engaged in &quot;inappropriate behaviour&quot; onstage with a co-star during the Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s 2015 production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. The story contained no corroboration for the allegations, though the STC divulged to the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that they had received a complaint about alleged sexual harassment by Rush. Eryn Jean Norvill, who had starred as Cordelia alongside Rush, alleged that the actor had touched her inappropriately without her consent. 

The &quot;Telegraph&quot;″s story was picked up by various newspapers in Australia but not by the Melbourne &quot;Herald Sun&quot; because of concerns that the &quot;Telegraph&quot; was &quot;running with a yarn which is highly libellous&quot;. Rush denied the allegations and, on 8 December 2017, announced that he had filed a defamation suit with the Federal Court of Australia, charging that the &quot;Telegraph&quot; &quot;made false, pejorative and demeaning claims, splattering them with unrelenting bombast on its front pages&quot;. In an affidavit, Rush stated that as a result of the allegations, he had been suffering from anxiety, insomnia and loss of appetite, and felt that &quot;his worth to the theatre and film industry is now irreparably damaged&quot;.

The trial was concluded on 9 November 2018. On 11 April 2019, the judge ruled in favour of Rush, awarding him $850,000. In his written statement defending his ruling, Justice Michael Wigney said that none of Norvill&#x27;s claims were proven, due to her evidence being &quot;not credible or reliable and contradicted by other members of the cast&quot;, and that Rush&#x27;s evidence was overwhelming. He also criticised the &quot;Telegraph&quot; for &quot;recklessly irresponsible pieces of sensationalist journalism of the very worst kind&quot;. A month later, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; was ordered to pay Rush an extended judgement of $2.87 million. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; motioned to appeal but the judgement was upheld.

 Further allegations

On 16 December 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an interview with Australian actress Yael Stone, who accused Rush of sexual misconduct during the production of a theatre adaptation of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; in 2010 and 2011. Among the allegations Stone made in interviews to the &quot;Times&quot; and ABC were incidents where Rush angled a hand mirror over a shower cubicle to observe her naked, sent her flirty text messages and danced naked in front of her in her dressing room. 

Rush responded in a statement to the &quot;Times&quot; through his attorneys, saying that Stone&#x27;s allegations were &quot;incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context. However, clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work. I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress. This, most certainly, has never been my intention.&quot;

<text>Helen Prejean ( ; born April 21, 1939) is a Catholic religious sister and a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty.

She is known for her best-selling book, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1993), based on her experiences with two convicts on death row for whom she served as spiritual adviser before their executions. In her book, she explored the effects of the death penalty on everyone involved. The book was adapted as a 1995 film of the same name, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. It was also adapted as an opera by Jake Heggie and Terrence McNally, first produced in 2000 by the San Francisco Opera.

Prejean served as the National Chairperson of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1993 to 1995. She helped establish The Moratorium Campaign, seeking an end to executions and conducting education on the death penalty. Prejean also founded the groups SURVIVE to help families of victims of murder and related crimes.

==Early life and education==
Helen Prejean was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the daughter of Augusta Mae (née Bourg; 1911–1993), a nurse, and Louis Sebastian Prejean (1893–1974), a lawyer. She joined the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille in 1957.

In 1962, she received a Bachelor of Arts in English and Education from St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College, New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1973, she earned a Master of Arts in religious education from Saint Paul University, a Pontifical university federated with the University of Ottawa. She has been the Religious Education Director at St. Frances Cabrini Parish in New Orleans, the Formation Director for the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille, and has taught junior and senior high school.

==Death row ministry==
Her efforts began in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1981. In 1982 an acquaintance asked her to correspond with convicted murderer Elmo Patrick Sonnier, held on death row in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola. Sonnier had been sentenced to death by electrocution. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his execution. The experience gave Prejean greater insight into the process involved in executions, for the convict, families, and others in the prison, and she began speaking out against capital punishment. At the same time, she founded &quot;Survive&quot;, an organization devoted to counseling the families of victims of violence.

Prejean has since ministered to other inmates on death row and witnessed several more executions. She served as National Chairperson of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1993 to 1995.
==&quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;==
She published &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1993), an account of her relationship with Sonnier and other inmates on death row, and the factors related to her growing opposition to the death penalty. The book was adapted for a 1995 feature film of the same name; she was portrayed by Susan Sarandon.

Her book also was adapted as an opera of the same name, first produced by the San Francisco Opera in 2000. The libretto is by Terrence McNally and the music composed by Jake Heggie. It has also been adapted as a play of the same name, which was first produced in autumn 2003.

For her book, she drew from her experiences with Sonnier and with the convict Robert Lee Willie. He had been sentenced to death after being convicted of kidnapping and murder in two attacks in May 1980. Prejean also explored the effects that conducting the death penalty has on attorneys, prison guards, other prison officials, and the families of both convicted murderers and their victims. Since then Prejean has worked with other men sentenced to death.

In December 2010, Prejean donated all of her archival papers to DePaul University.
==Campaigns, book, and awards==
In 1996, she was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, the oldest and most prestigious award for American Catholics.

In 1999, Prejean formed Moratorium 2000, a petition drive that eventually grew into a national education campaign, The Moratorium Campaign, seeking to declare a moratorium to executions. It was initially staffed by Robert Jones, Theresa Meisz, and Jené O&#x27;Keefe. The organization Witness to Innocence, composed of death row survivors who were exonerated after being convicted for crimes they did not commit, was started under The Moratorium Campaign.

Prejean wrote a second book, &quot;The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions&quot; (2004). She tells of two men, Dobie Gillis Williams and Joseph O&#x27;Dell, whom she accompanied to their executions. She believes that both men were innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted. The book also examines the recent history of death penalty decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States and the record of George W. Bush as Governor of Texas.

In 1998, Prejean was given the &quot;Pacem in Terris&quot; Award, named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls on all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. &quot;Pacem in terris&quot; is Latin for &quot;Peace on Earth.&quot;

Prejean now bases her work at the Ministry Against the Death Penalty in New Orleans. She gives talks about the issues across the United States and around the world. She and her sister Mary Ann Antrobus have also been deeply involved at a center in Nicaragua called Friends of Batahola.

In 2019 she wrote a memoir titled &quot;River of Fire: My Spiritual Journey&quot;. In it she talks about her spiritual journey leading her to engage in social justice work.

==Awards and recognition==

Prejean has given commencement addresses to more than 50 colleges and universities around the world.

One of Britain&#x27;s most popular and well-known actors, he has received various accolades, including a British Academy Film Award and a Tony Award, as well as nominations for three Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Born in Ipswich, Suffolk, Fiennes was trained at and graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1985.

In 1995, he made his Broadway debut playing Prince Hamlet in the revival of the William Shakespeare play &quot;Hamlet&quot; where he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. He was later Tony-nominated for his role as a traveling faith healer in the Brian Friel play &quot;Faith Healer&quot; (2006).

Fiennes made his film debut playing Heathcliff in &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; (1992). He has earned three Academy Award nominations for playing Amon Göth in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), László Almásy in &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), and Cardinal Thomas Lawrence in &quot;Conclave&quot; (2024).

He directed and starred in the films &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (2013) playing Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus and Charles Dickens respectively. Since 1999, Fiennes has served as an ambassador for UNICEF UK.

Fiennes studied painting at Chelsea College of Arts before deciding that acting was his true passion.

==Career==
=== 1983–1992: Theater work and film debut ===

Fiennes trained at RADA (the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London between 1983 and 1985. He began his career at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park, and also at the National Theatre. He achieved prominence at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 when he starred as T. E. Lawrence in the British television film &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot;. He made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; opposite Juliette Binoche. He had a major role in Peter Greenaway&#x27;s historical drama film &quot;The Baby of Mâcon&quot; with Julia Ormond, which provoked controversy and was poorly received.

=== 1993–2004: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
In 1993, he portrayed the brutal Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Göth in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s historical holocaust drama epic &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List.&quot; Todd McCarthy, film critic of &quot;Variety&quot; praised his performance describing it as &quot;extraordinary&quot; adding that he &quot;creates an indelible character in Goeth. With paunch hanging out and eyes filled with disgust both for his victims and himself , he’s like a minor-league Roman emperor gone sour with excess, a man in whom too much power and debauchery have crushed anything that might once have been good.&quot; For his performance in the film, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and won the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. His portrayal of Göth also saw him listed at number 15 on the AFI&#x27;s list of the top 50 film villains. Fiennes gained weight to portray Göth, but shed it afterwards. Fiennes later stated that playing the role had a profoundly disturbing effect on him.

In 1994, Fiennes portrayed the American academic Charles Van Doren in Robert Redford&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Quiz Show&quot; acting opposite John Turturro and Paul Scofield. The film centered around the &quot;Twenty-One&quot; quiz show scandals of the 1950s. The film received critical acclaim as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing László Almásy in the epic World War II romantic drama &quot;The English Patient,&quot; in which he starred with Kristin Scott-Thomas. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;once you&#x27;re hooked, it never loses its grip on your emotions. A great deal of the credit belongs to Fiennes and Scott Thomas, who ignite on screen together.&quot; He starred in the romantic drama &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; (1997) opposite Cate Blanchett, played John Steed in spy comedy &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998), and voiced Ramesses II in an animated Biblical epic &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998).

Fiennes&#x27;s film work has encompassed a variety of genres, including thrillers (&quot;Spider, Strange Days&quot;), romantic comedy (&quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot;), and historical drama (&quot;Sunshine&quot;). In 1999, Fiennes had the title role in &quot;Onegin,&quot; a film which he also helped produce. His sister Martha Fiennes directed, and brother Magnus composed the score. Fiennes portrayed Francis Dolarhyde in the 2002 film, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Fiennes&#x27;s performance as a sympathetic serial killer with a romantic relationship with a blind girl, played by Emily Watson, was praised. Film critic David Sterritt wrote, &quot;Ralph Fiennes is scarily good as [Hannibal Lecter&#x27;s] fellow lunatic.&quot; Fiennes voiced Jesus in &quot;The Miracle Maker&quot; (2000), a stop-motion animated film depicting the life of Jesus.
=== 2005–2011: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and stardom ===
In 2005, Fiennes starred in Fernando Meirelles&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, a film based off the 2001 novel of the same name by John le Carré acting alongside Rachel Weisz. The film is set in Kenya. It was filmed in part with residents from the slums of Kibera and Loiyangalani. The film received critical acclaim in particular for Fiennes and Weisz&#x27;s performances. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Fiennes does some of his finest screen acting&quot; in the film. He received a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The situation affected the cast and crew to such an extent that they set up the Constant Gardener Trust to provide basic education for children of these villages. Fiennes is a patron of the charity.

Fiennes is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. That same year, Fiennes voiced Lord Victor Quartermaine in the 2005 stop-motion animated comedy &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. The role saw him play a cruel upper class who courts Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter) and despises Wallace &amp; Gromit.
Fiennes gained worldwide prominence for his portrayal as Lord Voldemort, the antagonist in the Harry Potter franchise. His first appearance was in the 2005 fantasy film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. He returned to the role for three other films in the series: &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007) and both &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; (2010) and &quot;Part 2&quot; (2011). In an interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Fiennes said his portrayal of Voldemort was an &quot;instinctive, visceral, physical thing&quot;. In a 2024 interview with Collider, Fiennes expanded on playing the character saying, &quot;When I play Voldemort, I&#x27;m trying to access something without empathy. It&#x27;s about power and control and the manipulating of people for power. It&#x27;s a real, almost erotic pleasure in how I can control you. I know I have the power to do it. You have no chance.&quot;

In 2006, Fiennes returned to the stage in &quot;Faith Healer&quot; alongside Ian McDiarmid. The revival premiered at the Gate Theatre in Dublin before transferring to the Broadway stage at the Booth Theatre. For his performances, Fiennes received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play. In 2008, he worked with frequent collaborator director Jonathan Kent, playing the title role in &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; by Sophocles, at the National Theatre in London.

In 2008, he played the Duke of Devonshire in the film &quot;The Duchess&quot; opposite Keira Knightley; he also played the protagonist in &quot;The Reader,&quot; adapted from the novel of the same name alongside Kate Winslet. That same year he also appeared in Martin McDonagh&#x27;s black comedy crime thriller &quot;In Bruges&quot; starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. In February 2009, Fiennes was the special guest of the Belgrade&#x27;s Film Festival FEST. He filmed his version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (in his directorial debut) in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. Fiennes reunited with Kathryn Bigelow for her Iraq War film &quot;The Hurt Locker,&quot; released in 2009, appearing as an English Private Military Contractor. They had previously worked together on &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995). In April 2010, he played Hades in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name.

=== 2012–2019: Established career ===

In 2012, he starred in the twenty-third James Bond film, &quot;Skyfall,&quot; directed by Sam Mendes. He replaced Dame Judi Dench as M in subsequent Bond films. That same year he played Magwitch &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (2012), directed by Mike Newell based off the Charles Dickens novel of the same name. He acted alongside &quot;Harry Potter&quot; alums Robbie Coltrane and Helena Bonham Carter. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote of his performance that &quot;Fiennes is feral and frightening&quot; adding, &quot;[He] is a touching figure of unexpected integrity and enormous pathos&quot;. Also in 2012 he reprised his role of Hades again acting opposite Liam Neeson&#x27;s Zeus in the action fantasy sequel &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot;. Despite the film receiving negative reviews it was a financial success. In 2013, Fiennes returned to the directors chair helming over the biographical romance drama &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; where he also acted portraying the leading role of Charles Dickens opposite Felicity Jones as Ellen Ternan. The film was well-received with Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing, &quot;Fiennes himself portrays a complex figure: a showman, an egotist and an applause-addict whose lovers and children were his enablers, but also a genuine artist and social idealist. This is an engrossing drama, with excellent performances&quot;.
Though he is not commonly noted as a comic actor, in 2014, Fiennes made an impression with his farcical turn as concierge Monsieur Gustave in Wes Anderson&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel.&quot; Fiennes used his time as a young porter at London&#x27;s Brown&#x27;s Hotel to help construct the character. A film critic stated, &quot;In the end it&#x27;s Fiennes who makes the biggest impression. His stylised, rapid-fire delivery, dry wit and cheerful profanity keep the film bubbling along.&quot; For his performance, Fiennes was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Fiennes&#x27;s portrayal of Gustave as the 17th Greatest Movie Character of All Time.

In 2015, Fiennes starred in Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s thriller &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot; alongside Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton. In 2016, Fiennes appeared in the Coen brothers ensemble comedy film &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; which is set in 1950s Hollywood. Fiennes plays the fictional Laurence Laurentz, an acclaimed European film director in the movie. That same year, he lent his voice in the stop-motion animated film &quot;Kubo and the Two Strings&quot; where he played Raiden the Moon King, Kubo&#x27;s grandfather. In 2017, he voiced the British butler Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; and reprised the role in &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; (2019). In 2018, he directed and starred in &quot;The White Crow&quot;, a biographical drama film about the Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev. Fiennes speaks some Russian, which enabled him to play Alexander Pushkin in the film. He received the Special Achievement Award for Outstanding Artistic Contribution at the Tokyo International Film Festival for directing the film &quot;The White Crow&quot;. In 2019, Fiennes played the MI6 agent Norman Darbyshire in Taghi Amirani&#x27;s feature documentary &quot;Coup 53&quot;. Darbyshire, who died in 1993, was the co-author of 1953&#x27;s Operation Ajax, a joint MI6-CIA military coup that overthrew democracy in Iran.

=== 2020–present ===

In 2020, Fiennes voiced a tiger in the family fantasy adventure film &quot;Dolittle&quot; starring Robert Downey Jr. In the same year, he appeared in the monologue play &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; by David Hare at the Bridge Theatre in London, and then in the 2021 film version of the play. Also in 2021, he starred in the British drama film &quot;The Dig&quot; playing the Suffolk archaeologist Basil Brown alongside Carey Mulligan and Lily James. The film received positive reviews with critics praising his performance. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Mark Kermode described Fiennes&#x27;s portrayal as having an &quot;admirable eloquence&quot;. Later in 2021, Fiennes starred in Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s period spy film &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot; and Cary Joji Fukunaga&#x27;s James Bond film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;.

In 2021, Fiennes returned to the stage in David Hare&#x27;s latest play &quot;Straight Line Crazy&quot; at the Bridge Theatre in London. In the play, Fiennes portrays New York&#x27;s legendary urban planner Robert Moses. His performance has received rave reviews with &quot;Variety&quot; declaring, &quot;Fiennes is all boldly convincing, controlled threat, his monomania teetering on the edge of malevolence&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s five star rave review, critic Mark Lawson described Fiennes&#x27;s performance as &quot;enthralling&quot; and an &quot;acting triumph&quot;. It was announced that the production would make its New York stage debut, Off-Broadway at The Shed running from October to December in 2022. In 2022, Fiennes starred as chef Julian Slowik in the Mark Mylod-directed comedy horror &quot;The Menu&quot;. For his performance he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Also in 2022 Fiennes collaborated with his sister, the filmmaker Sophie Fiennes, translating to the screen his production and performance of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem, &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. The original on-stage performance was described as &quot;a magnificent theatrical experience&quot; and &quot;a poignant one-man show about a world under threat.&quot; In Sophie Fiennes&#x27;s film &quot;the lens and the screen bring a new, even more intimate, perspective&quot;.

In 2023, Fiennes reunited with the director Wes Anderson in an anthology of short films adapted from the works of British author, Roald Dahl, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More&quot; (2023). The series featured performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, and Ben Kingsley with the eponymous short going on to win the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 96th Academy Awards. Fiennes starred on stage as Macbeth in late 2023 as part of Simon Godwin&#x27;s touring production in the UK. The play, which also starred Indira Varma as Lady Macbeth, was a success, beginning at Liverpool&#x27;s The Depot in November, before moving on to Edinburgh, London, and Washington, DC. In 2024, Fiennes starred in the Edward Berger film &quot;Conclave&quot;, for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. In 2025, Fiennes will star in Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;28 Years Later&quot;, the third film in the series which is set in a post-apocalyptic Britain 28 years after &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002).

==Personal life==
Fiennes met English actress Alex Kingston while they were both students at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After dating for ten years, they married in 1993 and divorced in 1997 following his affair with Francesca Annis. Annis and Fiennes announced their separation on 7 February 2006, after 11 years together, in a parting described as &quot;acrimonious&quot;, following rumours that he had an affair with the Romanian singer Cornelia Crisan.

In 2007, Fiennes was embroiled in scandal after having sex with a Qantas flight attendant on a flight from Darwin to Mumbai. After initial denials, it was established that they had sex in the plane&#x27;s lavatory, and the flight attendant&#x27;s employment was terminated by Qantas. The incident was referenced in the Australian sketch TV show &quot;Comedy Inc&quot;.

On 7 September 2017, Fiennes was granted Serbian citizenship, signed by Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić.

===Advocacy and political views===

Fiennes is a UNICEF UK ambassador and has undertaken work in India, Kyrgyzstan, Uganda, and Romania. Fiennes is also a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

Fiennes opposed the UK leaving the European Union (Brexit). Following the EU membership referendum in 2016, Fiennes stated, &quot;I&#x27;m strongly a remainer. I think that our connection with Europe, faulty as it may be in its current state...it seems to me that the point of the EU was to take down barriers of interactive trade, culture, talk dynamic between cultures, nations.&quot;

In a March 2021 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; Fiennes voiced support for J. K. Rowling following backlash against her views on transgender people, arguing &quot;I can&#x27;t understand the vitriol directed at her. I can understand the heat of an argument, but I find this age of accusation and the need to condemn irrational. I find the level of hatred that people express about views that differ from theirs, and the violence of language towards others, disturbing.&quot;

Fiennes is an Honorary Associate of London Film School and received the Stanislavsky Award in 2019.

<text>Sling Blade is a 1996 American drama film written, directed by and starring Billy Bob Thornton. Set in Arkansas, it is the story of intellectually challenged Karl Childers and the friendship he develops with a boy and his mother. Karl was released from a psychiatric hospital where he had grown up due to having killed his mother and her lover when he was 12 years old. It also stars Dwight Yoakam, J. T. Walsh, John Ritter, Lucas Black, Natalie Canerday, James Hampton, and Robert Duvall.

The film was adapted by Thornton from his previous one-man show &quot;Swine Before Pearls&quot;, from which he also developed a screenplay for the 1994 short film &quot;Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade&quot;, directed by George Hickenlooper. &quot;Sling Blade&quot; became a sleeper hit, launching Thornton into stardom. Thornton won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and he was also nominated for Best Actor. The music for the soundtrack was provided by French-Canadian musician/producer Daniel Lanois.

&quot;Sling Blade&quot; was filmed in 24 days, on location in Benton, Arkansas, produced by David L. Bushell and Brandon Rosser.

==Plot==
Karl Childers is a developmentally disabled Arkansas man whose parents physically and mentally abused him when he was young. He has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 after murdering his mother and her teenage lover, who was also his tormentor, with a sling blade. Karl believed his mother was being raped and killed the teen in her defense. When he realized his mother was a willing participant in the affair, Karl killed her as well.

As a passive person, Karl spends his days quietly staring out a window at an open field and wringing his hands together. He is often forced by Charles, a fellow patient, to listen to his stories about unsolved crimes of murder and rape. Charles was, unbeknownst to the hospital, a serial killer. The state determines that Karl is no longer dangerous and releases him. Karl wants to stay, but is told that he has to leave. He goes back to his hometown, where he finds work as a small engine mechanic.

Karl befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley and shares details of his past, including the killings. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her gay best friend and boss, Vaughan. Vaughan is concerned about Karl&#x27;s history, but Linda asks him to move into her garage, which her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle begrudgingly accepts. Vaughan tells Karl that he fears Doyle could hurt or kill Linda and Frank one day.

Karl becomes a role model to Frank, who misses his deceased father and despises Doyle. As they grow closer, Karl tells Frank that he is haunted by an incident that happened when he was six or eight years old. His parents did not want his baby brother so his father made him dispose of the body. Karl found the baby was still moving, but buried him alive anyway. Karl later visits his sickly father and tries to reconcile, but is rejected. He scolds his father for his past cruelty to him and to his brother and says that he thought many times about killing him, but no longer sees the need as he is an old man and will be dead soon enough.

During Doyle&#x27;s latest drunken outburst, where he refuses to leave Linda&#x27;s house, Frank fights back. Linda later reconciles with Doyle, who announces that he is moving in with them. He tells Karl that he is no longer welcome. When Frank protests, Doyle grabs him, but Karl intervenes and warns him never to touch Frank again. Doyle insists that he is in charge and orders Karl to leave.

Realizing that an unhappy childhood or worse awaits Frank, Karl persuades him and Linda to spend the night at Vaughan&#x27;s house. Karl tells Frank that he loves him, and gives him a brotherly hug. Karl then asks Vaughan to promise to look after Frank and Linda. Later that evening, he returns to the Wheatley home carrying a sharpened lawn mower blade, and finds Doyle drunk and alone in the living room. After asking Doyle how to call for the police, Karl kills him, calls 9-1-1, and then sits down at the kitchen table to eat biscuits with mustard, a childhood favorite, while waiting for the police to arrive.

Karl is returned to the state hospital, but is now more assertive. Charles begins telling him more private stories about unsolved crimes involving sexual violence, and then questions him about his relationship with Frank. This angers Karl, and he turns on Charles and tells him to never speak to him again. As Charles walks away, Karl resumes looking out of the window toward the open field, a slight grin on his face.

Thornton conceived the character of Karl while working on the film &quot;The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains&quot;. He developed the idea into a monologue, which became a one-man show to fund the film. He expanded the monologue into a short film, &quot;Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade&quot;, directed by George Hickenlooper and starring Thornton, Molly Ringwald, and J.T. Walsh.

The film was made with a production budget of $1 million financed by The Shooting Gallery, and was sold to Miramax for $10 million, which at the time was a record price for an independent film.

==Release==
The film grossed $24,444,121 in the United States against a $1 million production budget. It grossed a further $9.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $34 million.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Sling Blade&quot; has a rating of 97% based on reviews from 58 critics with an average rating of 8.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states &quot;You will see what&#x27;s coming, but the masterful performances, especially Thornton&#x27;s, will leave you riveted.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 84% based on reviews from 26 critics.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;masterpiece of Southern storytelling&quot;. Kevin Thomas wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the film is &quot;a mesmerizing parable of good and evil and a splendid example of Southern storytelling at its most poetic and imaginative&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin praised the performances but said that &quot;it drifts gradually toward climactic events that seem convenient and contrived&quot;.

<doc id="171526" wikidata="Q841079" url="?curid=171526" title="Subaru Telescope">
<text>is the telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, located at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. It is named after the open star cluster known in English as the Pleiades. It had the largest monolithic primary mirror in the world from its commissioning until the Large Binocular Telescope opened in 2005.

== Overview ==

The Subaru Telescope is a Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope. Instruments can be mounted at a Cassegrain focus below the primary mirror; at either of two Nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount, to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror, an arrangement rare on large telescopes, to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys.

In 1984, the University of Tokyo formed an engineering working group to develop and study the concept of a telescope. In 1985, the astronomy committee of Japan&#x27;s science council gave top priority to the development of a &quot;Japan National Large Telescope&quot; (JNLT), and in 1986, the University of Tokyo signed an agreement with the University of Hawaii to build the telescope in Hawaii. In 1988, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan was formed through a reorganization of the University&#x27;s Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, to oversee the JNLT and other large national astronomy projects.

Construction of the Subaru Telescope began in April 1991, and later that year, a public contest gave the telescope its official name, &quot;Subaru Telescope&quot;. Construction was completed in 1998, and the first scientific images were taken in January 1999. In September 1999, Princess Sayako of Japan dedicated the telescope.

A number of state-of-the-art technologies were worked into the telescope design. For example, 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath, which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation. The telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence.

Subaru is one of the few state-of-the-art telescopes to have been used with the naked eye. For the dedication, an eyepiece was constructed so that Princess Sayako could look through it directly. It was enjoyed by the staff for a few nights until it was replaced with the much more sensitive working instruments.

Subaru is the primary tool in the search for Planet Nine. Its large field of view, 75 times that of the Keck telescopes, and strong light-gathering power are suited for deep wide-field sky surveys. The search, split between a research group led by Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown and another led by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo, is expected to take up to five years.

=== Accidents during construction ===
Two separate incidents claimed the lives of four workers during the construction of the telescope. On October 13, 1993, 42-year-old Paul F. Lawrence was fatally injured when a forklift tipped over onto him. On January 16, 1996, sparks from a welder ignited insulation which smoldered, generating noxious smoke that killed Marvin Arruda, 52, Ricky Del Rosario, 38, and Warren K. &quot;Kip&quot; Kaleo, 36, and sent twenty-six other workers to the hospital in Hilo. All four workers are memorialized by a plaque outside the base of the telescope dome and a sign posted temporarily each January along the Mauna Kea access road.

===Mishap in 2011===
On July 2, 2011, the telescope operator in Hilo noted an anomaly from the top unit of the telescope. Upon further examination, coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope.
Observation using Nasmyth foci resumed on July 22, and Cassegrain focus resumed on August 26.

===Mishap in 2023===
On September 15, 2023, an abnormal load sensor value of the primary mirror fixed point was observed during a maintenance operational test. Later, a part fell onto the primary mirror during repair work of the mirror cover. Science observation was suspended.

After the replacement of sensor and the repair work of the primary mirror damage, it returned to observation on 3 March 2024.

== Instruments ==
Several cameras and spectrographs can be mounted at Subaru Telescope&#x27;s four focal points for observations in visible and infrared wavelengths.

; Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) : Wide-field camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of multiple objects simultaneously, mounts at the Cassegrain focus.
; Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) : Used in conjunction with the new 188-element adaptive optics unit (AO188), mounted at the infrared Nasmyth focus.
; Cooled Mid Infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) : Mid-infrared camera and spectrometer with the ability to study cool interstellar dust, mounts on the Cassegrain focus. Decommissioned in 2020.
; Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS) : Visible-light camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of up to 100 objects simultaneously, mounts on the Cassegrain focus.
; Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) : 80-megapixel wide-field visible-light camera, mounts at the prime focus. Superseded by the Hyper Suprime-Cam in 2012, decommissioned in May 2017.
; High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) : Visible-light spectrograph mounted at the optical Nasmyth focus.
; Fiber Multi Object Spectrograph (FMOS) : Infrared spectrograph using movable fiber optics to take spectra of up to 400 objects simultaneously. Mounts at the prime focus.
; High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) : Infrared camera for hunting planets around other stars. Used with AO188, mounted at the infrared Nasmyth focus.

; Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) : This 900-megapixel ultra-wide-field (1.5° field of view) camera saw first light in 2012, and was offered for open-use in 2014. The extremely large wide-field correction optics (a seven-element lens with some elements up to a meter in diameter) was manufactured by Canon and delivered March 29, 2011. It will be used for surveys of weak lensing to determine dark matter distribution.
; Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) : The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument is a high-contrast imaging system for directly imaging exoplanets. The coronagraph uses a Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) design which means it will be able to image planets closer to their stars than conventional Lyot type coronagraph designs. For example, at a distance of 100 pc, the PIAA coronagraph on SCExAO would be able to image from 4 AU outwards while Gemini Planet Imager and VLT-SPHERE from 12 AU outwards. The system also has several other types of coronagraph: Vortex, Four-Quadrant Phase Mask and 8-Octant Phase Mask versions, and a shaped pupil coronagraph. The phase I of construction is complete and phase II construction to be complete by end of 2014 for science operations in 2015. SCExAO will initially use the HiCIAO camera but this will be replaced by CHARIS, an integral field spectrograph, around 2016.

<text>GNU Autoconf is a software development tool for generating a configure script that in turn generates files for building a codebase and for packaging or installing the resulting files. Autoconf is part of the GNU Build System along with Automake, Libtool, Autoheader and other tools.

Autoconf is agnostic about the programming language of the codebase to build. None-the-less, it is primarily used with C, C++, Fortran, Erlang, or Objective-C.

A configure script configures a software package for installation on a particular target system. After running a series of tests on the target system, the configure script generates header files and a makefile from templates, thus customizing the software package for the target system. 

== Usage overview ==

The developer specifies the desired behaviour of the configure script by writing a list of instructions in the GNU m4 language in a file called &quot;configure.ac&quot;. A library of pre-defined m4 macros is available to describe common configure script instructions. Autoconf transforms the instructions in &quot;configure.ac&quot; into a portable configure script.
The system that will be doing the building need not have Autoconf installed: Autoconf is needed only to build the configure script, that is usually shipped with the software.

== History ==
Autoconf was begun in the summer of 1991 by David Mackenzie to support his work at the Free Software Foundation. In the subsequent years it grew to include enhancements from a variety of authors and became the most widely used build configuration system for writing portable free or open-source software.

== Approach ==
Autoconf is similar to the Metaconfig package used by Perl. The imake system formerly used by the X Window System (up to X11R6.9) is closely related, but has a different philosophy.

The Autoconf approach to portability is to test for features, not for versions. For example, the native C compiler on SunOS 4 did not support ISO C. However, it is possible for the user or administrator to have installed an ISO C-compliant compiler. A pure version-based approach would not detect the presence of the ISO C compiler, but a feature-testing approach would be able to discover the ISO C compiler the user had installed. The rationale of this approach is to gain the following advantages:

* the configure script can get reasonable results on newer or unknown systems
* it allows administrators to customize their machines and have the configure script take advantage of the customizations
* there is no need to keep track of minute details of versions, patch numbers, etc., to figure out whether a particular feature is supported or not

Autoconf provides extensive documentation around the non-portability of many POSIX shell constructs to older shells and bugs therein. It also provides M4SH, a macro-based replacement for shell syntax.

== Behavior ==
Autoconf generates a codice_1 script based on the contents of a codice_2 file, which characterizes a particular body of source code. The codice_1 script, when run, scans the build environment and generates a subordinate codice_4 script which, in turn, converts other input files and most commonly codice_5 into output files (codice_6), which are appropriate for that build environment. Finally, the codice_7 program uses codice_6 to generate executable programs from source code.

The complexity of Autotools reflects the variety of circumstances under which a body of source code may be built.

* If a source code file is changed then it suffices to re-run codice_7, which only re-compiles that part of the body of the source code affected by the change.
* If a codice_10 file has changed then it suffices to re-run codice_4 and codice_7.
* If the body of source code is copied to another computer then it is sufficient to re-run codice_1 (which runs codice_4) and codice_7. (For this reason source code using Autotools is normally distributed without the files that codice_1 generates.)
* If the body of source code is changed more fundamentally, then codice_2 and the codice_10 files need to be changed and all subsequent steps also followed.

To process files, autoconf uses the GNU implementation of the m4 macro system.

Autoconf comes with several auxiliary programs such as codice_19, which is used to help manage C header files; codice_20, which can create an initial input file for Autoconf; and codice_21, which can list C pre-processor identifiers used in the program.

==Criticism==
There is some criticism that states that Autoconf uses dated technologies, has a lot of legacy restrictions, and complicates simple scenarios unnecessarily for the author of &quot;configure.ac&quot; scripts. In particular, often cited weak points of Autoconf are:
* General complexity of used architecture, most projects use multiple repetitions.
* Some people think that &#x27;configure&#x27; scripts generated by Autoconf provide only manual-driven command-line interface without any standardization. While it is true that some developers do not respect common conventions, such conventions do exist and are widely used.
* m4 is unusual and unknown to many developers. Developers will need to learn it to extend Autoconf with non-standard checks.
* Weak backward and forward compatibility requires a wrapper script.
* Autoconf-generated scripts are usually large and rather complex. Although they produce extensive logging, debugging them can still be difficult.

Due to these limitations, several projects that used GNU Build System switched to different build systems, such as CMake and SCons.

Harrelson received further Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his portrayal of Steve Schmidt in the HBO film &quot;Game Change&quot; (2012) and a detective in the HBO crime anthology series &quot;True Detective&quot; (2014). He also portrayed E. Howard Hunt in the HBO political limited series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
Woodrow Tracy Harrelson was born in Midland, Texas, to secretary Diane (née Oswald) and convicted hitman Charles Voyde Harrelson. He was raised in a Presbyterian household alongside his two brothers, Jordan and Brett, the latter of whom also became an actor. Their father received a life sentence for the 1979 killing of federal judge John H. Wood Jr. Harrelson has stated he had little contact with his father during childhood. Charles died in the United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility on March 15, 2007. 

Harrelson&#x27;s family was poor and relied on his mother&#x27;s wages. He attended The Briarwood School in Houston, Texas. In 1973, he moved to his mother&#x27;s native city of Lebanon, Ohio, where he attended Lebanon High School, from which he graduated in 1979. He spent the summer of 1979 working at Kings Island amusement park.

Harrelson attended Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana, where he studied theater and English. While there, he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and became friends with future vice president Mike Pence. He graduated in 1983.

==Career==

=== 1985–1993: &quot;Cheers&quot; and early film roles ===
Harrelson is widely known for his work on the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. He played bartender Woody Boyd, who replaced Coach (played by Nicholas Colasanto, who died in February 1985). He joined the cast in 1985 in season four, spending the final eight seasons (1985–1993) on the show. For this role, Harrelson was nominated for five Emmy Awards, winning once in 1989. His character, Woody Boyd, was from Hanover, Indiana, where Harrelson attended college. In 1999, Harrelson guest-starred in the &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off success &quot;Frasier&quot;, in which he reprised the role of Woody Boyd. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for this performance. He appeared in several 2001 episodes of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as Grace&#x27;s new boyfriend Nathan.
While still working on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Harrelson restarted his film career. His first movie had been &quot;Wildcats&quot;, a 1986 football comedy with Goldie Hawn. He followed his performance in &quot;Wildcats&quot; with the 1990 romantic comedy &quot;Cool Blue&quot;, alongside Hank Azaria. He reunited with Wesley Snipes (who also had debuted in &quot;Wildcats&quot;) in the box-office hit &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot; (1992) and the action movie &quot;Money Train&quot; (1995). In 1993, Harrelson starred opposite Robert Redford and Demi Moore in the drama &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, which was a box office success, earning a worldwide total of over $265,000,000. He then played Mickey Knox in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and Dr. Michael Raynolds in the Michael Cimino film &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;.

=== 1994–2011: Established actor ===
Starred alongside Kiefer Sutherland in &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot; (1994). In 1996, he starred in the comedy &quot;Kingpin&quot; for the Farrelly brothers. Harrelson&#x27;s career gained momentum when he starred in the Miloš Forman film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, in which he played Larry Flynt, publisher of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine. The film was a success and Harrelson&#x27;s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Actor. After that, Harrelson was cast in more serious film roles. He starred in the 1997 war film &quot;Welcome to Sarajevo&quot; and in 1997 had a featured role as Sergeant Schumann in &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; and as Will Huffman in the 1997 family film &quot;Road to Manhattan.&quot; In 1998, Harrelson starred in the thriller &quot;Palmetto&quot; and played Sergeant Keck in the Terrence Malick directed war film&quot; The Thin Red Line&quot;, which received nominations for seven Academy Awards in 1999 including for Best Picture. Harrelson made other films such as &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; and portrayed Ray Pekurny in the comedy &quot;EDtv&quot;. Also in 1999, he appeared as himself in a cameo at the end of the film &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and later as boxer Vince Boudreau in the Ron Shelton film &quot;Play It to the Bone&quot;. In 1999, Harrelson directed his own play, &quot;Furthest from the Sun&quot;, at the Theatre de la Jeune Lune in Minneapolis. He followed next in Roundabout&#x27;s Broadway revival of the N. Richard Nash play &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; in 2000, Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The Late Henry Moss&quot; in 2001, John Kolvenbach&#x27;s &quot;On an Average Day&quot; opposite Kyle MacLachlan in London&#x27;s West End in the fall of 2002, and in the summer of 2003, Harrelson directed the Toronto premiere of Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s &quot;This is Our Youth&quot; at the Berkley Street Theater. 

Harrelson did not appear in films again until 2003, when he co-starred as Galaxia/Gary in the comedy film &quot;Anger Management&quot;. He appeared in the action film &quot;After the Sunset&quot; and the Spike Lee film &quot;She Hate Me&quot;. In 2005, Harrelson was in &quot;The Big White&quot; and &quot;North Country&quot;. Also in 2005 he appeared as Kelly Ryan, husband of a contest-obsessed woman in the film &quot;The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio&quot;. In the winter of 2005–2006 Harrelson returned to London&#x27;s West End, starring in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Night of the Iguana&quot; at the Lyric Theater. Harrelson directed &quot;Bullet for Adolf&quot; (a play he wrote with Frankie Hyman) at the esteemed Hart House Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, which ran from April 21 to May 7, 2011. &quot;Bullet for Adolf&quot; opened Off-Broadway (New World Stages) with previews beginning July 19, 2012, and closed on September 30, 2012, canceling its announced extension through October 21. The play was panned by New York critics. Harrelson made two films in 2006, the animated film version of &quot;Free Jimmy&quot; and also &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; the latter being written and directed by Richard Linklater. 
In 2007 he played Carter Page III, gay escort of privileged Washington, D.C., women, in the film &quot;The Walker&quot;. In the Oscar-winning 2007 crime thriller &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, Harrelson had a key role as Carson Wells, a bounty hunter. The film won Best Picture and Best Director for Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. Harrelson also won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast, along with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald. In 2007&#x27;s &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot;, Harrelson played another key role of a Seattle police officer whose pregnant wife loses her baby during the 1999 World Trade Organization protests. In 2008, Harrelson appeared in several films, among them the Will Ferrell basketball comedy &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; and the stark Will Smith drama &quot;Seven Pounds&quot; as a blind vegan meat salesman named Ezra Turner. 

In 2009, Harrelson received significant praise for his role as Captain Tony Stone in &quot;The Messenger&quot;. In what many critics considered to be his best role, Harrelson was nominated for a Independent Spirit Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Harrelson has also won the Best Supporting Actor award in the 2009 National Board of Review award ceremonies and received accolades from various critics&#x27; societies. Also that same year, Harrelson co-starred in the horror comedy &quot;Zombieland&quot;, followed by Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;2012,&quot; where he played Charlie Frost, a man who warns of the end of the world. In 2010, he starred as a bartender and mentor in the futuristic western martial arts film &quot;Bunraku&quot;. On the November 12, 2009, episode of the Comedy Central show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, Harrelson was interviewed by Stephen Colbert, to promote his movie &quot;The Messenger&quot;. In response to Colbert&#x27;s questioning of his support for the troops, Harrelson agreed to let Colbert shave his head on camera. 

On June 6, 2010, Harrelson took part playing in Soccer Aid 2010 for UNICEF UK at Old Trafford in Manchester. The match was broadcast live on UK&#x27;s ITV television. After being brought on as a substitute for Gordon Ramsay, Harrelson took the final penalty in the penalty shootout, following a 2–2 draw after 91.2 minutes. Despite being initially unaware of exactly from where his kick had to be taken, Harrelson scored to win the game for &quot;The Rest of the World&quot; team, beating England for the first time since the tournament began. When later interviewed, he claimed that he &quot;didn&#x27;t even remember the moment of scoring.&quot; In 2011, he starred as Tommy in the movie &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot;. Harrelson narrated the 2011 film &quot;ETHOS&quot;, which explores the idea of a self-destructing modern society, governed by unequal power and failed democratic ideals. Harrelson also took part in Soccer Aid 2012 on May 27, 2012. The match ended 3–1 in favor of England.

=== 2012–present: Career expansion and acclaim ===
He played Haymitch Abernathy in 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, and reprised the role in all three subsequent films in the series which ended in 2015. In 2012, he had a leading role in the acclaimed HBO television film &quot;Game Change&quot; as republican strategist Steve Schmidt working for the 2008 Presidential campaign for John McCain and Sarah Palin. Harrelson acted alongside Julianne Moore, Sarah Paulson, and Ed Harris. The film was directed by Jay Roach and written by Danny Strong. For his performance he was nominated for numerous accolades including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie. On February 3, 2012, he participated in an &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session on the website Reddit. The AMA turned into a PR disaster when Harrelson failed to make meaningful responses to any questions and soon specifically refused to respond to anything not directly related to the then-upcoming worldwide release of the crime drama &quot;Rampart&quot; (2011), in which he starred and received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.
Harrelson returned to television in 2014, starring along with Matthew McConaughey in the first season of the HBO crime series &quot;True Detective&quot;, where he played Marty Hart, a Louisiana cop investigating murders that took place over a timespan of 17 years. He and McConaughey received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series losing to Bryan Cranston for the final season of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. In 2015, Woody Harrelson and daughter Zoe starred in a 7-minute short film for U2&#x27;s &#x27;Song for Someone.&#x27; In 2016, Harrelson announced that he would direct, write, produce, and star in a film, &quot;Lost in London&quot;, which was shot as a single take and premiered live on January 19, 2017. Harrelson played police chief Bill Willoughby in the black comedy crime film &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot;, released in 2017, for which he received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. In 2017, he played the antagonist The Colonel in the science fiction film &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot;. Also that year, he starred in comedic drama film &quot;The Glass Castle,&quot; an adaptation of Jeannette Walls&#x27;s memoir.

In 2018, Harrelson played Tobias Beckett, a criminal and Han Solo&#x27;s mentor in Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; In 2018, Harrelson appeared in a cameo at the end of the film &quot;Venom&quot;, portraying Cletus Kasady, and he reprised the role as the main antagonist, also voicing the symbiote Carnage who joins with Kasady, in the 2021 sequel &quot;.&quot; In 2019, he starred with Kevin Costner in &quot;The Highwaymen&quot;. In November 2019, he starred in Roland Emmerich&#x27;s blockbuster movie &quot;Midway&quot;, playing Admiral Chester Nimitz. The same year he reprised his role of Tallahassee in &quot;Zombieland 2: Double Tap&quot; (2019). Starting in 2019, Harrelson made numerous appearances portraying Joe Biden on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, before being replaced by Jim Carrey.

In March 2021, he is set to portray Felix Kersten in &quot;The Man with the Miraculous Hands&quot;, the feature film adaptation of Joseph Kessel&#x27;s 1960 novel of the same title. Harrelson starred in the HBO political limited series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot; (2023) where he portrayed intelligence officer E. Howard Hunt. The series is focused on the Watergate scandal and investigation. Harrelson also executive produced the series. Also in 2023, he starred in &quot;Champions&quot;, as a disgraced coach coerced to head up a Special Olympics basketball team, featuring many actors with special needs.

==Personal life==

In 1985, Harrelson married Nancy Simon (daughter of playwright Neil Simon) in Tijuana. The union was not intended to be serious, and the two had planned to divorce the following day, but the storefront marriage/divorce parlor was closed when they returned to it and they remained married for another ten months. In 2008, he married Laura Louie, a co-founder of the organic food delivery service Yoganics. They met in 1987 when she worked as his personal assistant. They reside in Maui, Hawaii, and have three daughters (born in 1993, 1996, and 2006).

Harrelson was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL) from Hanover College in 2014.

Harrelson is a fan of chess. In November 2018, he attended the first game of the World Chess Championship in London, played between Norwegian champion Magnus Carlsen and American contender Fabiano Caruana. He made the ceremonial first move for the game. He had also played the ceremonial first move for the previous World Chess Championship, held in New York in 2016.

In 1999 in Prague, Woody Harrelson, playing White, employed the Parham Attack, named after Bernard Parham, to draw World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov. However, Harrelson was aided by several chess Grandmasters who were in Prague to spectate the chess match between GM Alexei Shirov and GM Judit Polgár.

In 2007, he starred in the film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;; both the film and the 2005 novel, set in 1980, feature a line spoken by the sheriff: &quot;Here a while back in San Antonio they shot and killed a federal judge&quot;, which is a reference to his father Charles Harrelson, who murdered John H. Wood Jr.

In 2020, Harrelson was seen practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu while filming, having received the first stripe on his white belt.

Harrelson is a fan of the Cincinnati Bengals.

In 2023, Harrelson&#x27;s longtime friend and &quot;True Detective&quot; co-star/co-executive producer Matthew McConaughey stated that he and Harrelson could potentially be brothers. McConaughey&#x27;s mother claimed to have been intimate with Harrelson&#x27;s father, Charles Harrelson, around the time of McConaughey&#x27;s conception. 

Harrelson is friends with former Representative Dean Phillips. Phillips met and befriended Harrelson when Harrelson rented his house while shooting the movie &quot;Wilson&quot;. Harrelson joined Phillips on a trip to Vietnam, where Phillips&#x27;s father was killed in a helicopter crash.

===Lifestyle and views===
Harrelson follows a raw vegan diet. Along with not eating meat or dairy, Harrelson does not eat sugar or flour. In &quot;Zombieland&quot;, in which he plays a character with an affinity for Twinkies, the Twinkies were replaced with vegan faux-Twinkies made from cornmeal. He appeared on a postage stamp (as a PhotoStamp) in 2011 as one of PETA&#x27;s 20 famous vegetarians, and he was named PETA&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarian in 2012 (along with Jessica Chastain).

Harrelson was a religious Presbyterian as a child, and studied theology during college. Harrelson told &quot;Playboy&quot; in October 2009, &quot;I was getting into theology and studying the roots of the Bible, but then I started to discover the man-made nature of it. I started seeing things that made me ask, &#x27;Is God really speaking through this instrument?&#x27; My eyes opened to the reality of the Bible being just a document to control people.&quot; He describes himself as having &quot;a strong spiritual life&quot;.

In April 2020, Harrelson made a post on Instagram promoting the conspiracy theory that claims a link between 5G networks and COVID-19, which was later deleted. In May 2022, Harrelson said he &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in the germ theory&quot; and found the use of face masks as a preventative measure against COVID-19 to be &quot;absurd&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m sick of like, you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and you think it contains your breath—but if it did you&#x27;d die, you&#x27;d be breathing in your own carbon monoxide .&quot;

===Legal issues===
On June 1, 1996, Harrelson was arrested in Lee County, Kentucky, after symbolically planting four hemp seeds to challenge the state law that did not distinguish between industrial hemp and marijuana. Harrelson had arrived in the county with his attorney, former Kentucky governor Louie B. Nunn, an agent and a camera crew from CNN. While at a local hotel, Harrelson phoned the county sheriff, Junior Kilburn, to advise him of his intentions. Kilburn and deputy sheriff Danny Towsend arrived at the location where Harrelson informed them he would be. With the cameras rolling, Harrelson planted the hemp seeds into the ground. Once planted, Kilburn placed Harrelson under arrest for cultivating marijuana and booked him into the county jail. He was released on $200 bail the same day. He later signed autographs and posed for photos with deputies. He was acquitted of those charges with the help of Nunn after just 25 minutes. The events were featured in the 2010 Michael P. Henning documentary film &quot;&quot;.

In 2002, Harrelson was arrested in London after an incident in a taxi that ended in a police chase. Harrelson was taken to a London police station and later released on bail. The case was later dismissed after Harrelson paid the taxi driver involved in the incident £550 ($844). This became the inspiration for his 2017 live-streamed film &quot;Lost in London&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;TMZ&quot; photographer Josh Levine filed a lawsuit against Harrelson for an alleged attack outside a Hollywood nightclub in 2006. A video of the incident appeared to show Harrelson grabbing a camera and clashing with the photographer. Los Angeles prosecutors declined to press charges against the actor, but Levine filed a suit that summer asking for $2.5 million in damages. The case was dismissed in April 2010.

In October 2009, he was given an honorary degree by York University for his contributions in the fields of environmental education, sustainability, and activism.

In June 2010, Harrelson took part in Soccer Aid at Old Trafford in Manchester to raise money for UNICEF.

He played in the UNICEF game 2012, playing the last 10 minutes of the game for the Rest of the World team, losing 3–1 to England.

In 2002, Harrelson wrote an article in the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; condemning President George W. Bush&#x27;s preparation for a US invasion of Iraq as a &quot;racist and imperialist war&quot;. He also stated that he was against the U.S.&#x27;s previous war in Iraq and President Bill Clinton&#x27;s sanctions against Iraq. In 2013, Harrelson condemned President Barack Obama for failing to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, negatively comparing him to Richard Nixon. 

In 2023, he appeared to endorse Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In May 2024, Kennedy&#x27;s campaign released a short documentary on the life and career of RFK Jr, narrated by Harrelson.

<text>The Hasmonean dynasty (; &quot;Ḥašmōnāʾīm&quot;; ) was a ruling dynasty of Judea and surrounding regions during the Hellenistic times of the Second Temple period (part of classical antiquity), from BCE to 37 BCE. Between and BCE the dynasty ruled Judea semi-autonomously within the Seleucid Empire, and from roughly 110 BCE, with the empire disintegrating, gained further autonomy and expanded into the neighboring regions of Perea, Samaria, Idumea, Galilee, and Iturea. The Hasmonean rulers took the Greek title &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) and the kingdom attained regional power status for several decades. Forces of the Roman Republic intervened in the Hasmonean Civil War in 63 BCE, turning the kingdom into a client state and marking an irreversible decline of Hasmonean power; Herod the Great displaced the last reigning Hasmonean client-ruler in 37 BCE.

Simon Thassi established the dynasty in 141 BCE, two decades after his brother Judas Maccabeus ( &quot;Yehudah HaMakabi&quot;) had defeated the Seleucid army during the Maccabean Revolt of 167 to 141 BCE. According to 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and the first book of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; by historian Josephus (37 –  CE), the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes () moved to assert strict control over the Seleucid satrapy of Coele Syria and Phoenicia after his successful invasion of Ptolemaic Egypt (170–168 BCE) was turned back by the intervention of the Roman Republic. He sacked Jerusalem and its Temple, suppressing Jewish and Samaritan religious and cultural observances,
and imposed Hellenistic practices ( 168–167 BCE). The steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire allowed Judea to regain some autonomy; however, in 63 BCE, the kingdom was invaded by the Roman Republic, broken up and set up as a Roman client state.

Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Simon&#x27;s great-grandsons, became pawns in a proxy war between Julius Caesar and Pompey. The deaths of Pompey (48 BCE) and Caesar (44 BCE), and the related Roman civil wars, temporarily relaxed Rome&#x27;s grip on the Hasmonean kingdom, allowing a brief reassertion of autonomy backed by the Parthian Empire, rapidly crushed by the Romans under Mark Antony and Augustus.

The Hasmonean dynasty had survived for 103 years before yielding to the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE. The installation of Herod the Great (an Idumean) as king in 37 BCE made Judea a Roman client state and marked the end of the Hasmonean dynasty. Even then, Herod tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his Jericho palace. In 6 CE, Rome joined Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea into the Roman province of Judaea. In 44 CE, Rome installed the rule of a procurator side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically Agrippa I 41–44 and Agrippa II 50–100).

==Etymology==
The family name of the Hasmonean dynasty originates from the ancestor of the house, whom Josephus called by the Hellenised form Asmoneus or Asamoneus (), said to have been the great-grandfather of Mattathias, but about whom nothing more is known. The name appears to come from the Hebrew name &quot;Hashmonai&quot; (). An alternative view posits that the Hebrew name &quot;Hashmona&#x27;i&quot; is linked with the village of Heshmon, mentioned in . P.J. Gott and Logan Licht attribute the name to &quot;Ha Simeon&quot;, a veiled reference to the Simeonite Tribe.

==Background==

The lands of the former Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah (–586 BCE), had been occupied in turn by Assyria, Babylonia, the Achaemenid Empire, and Alexander the Great&#x27;s Hellenic Macedonian empire ( BCE), although Jewish religious practice and culture had persisted and even flourished during certain periods. The entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander&#x27;s empire, the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the six Syrian Wars of the 3rd–1st centuries BCE: &quot;After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its capital in Syria to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its capital in Egypt to the south. ... Between 319 and 302 BCE, Jerusalem changed hands seven times.&quot;

Under Antiochus III the Great, the Seleucids wrested control of Judea from the Ptolemies for the final time, defeating Ptolemy V Epiphanes at the Battle of Panium in 200 BCE. Seleucid rule over the Jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of Hellenistic cultural and religious practices: &quot;In addition to the turmoil of war, there arose in the Jewish nation pro-Seleucid and pro-Ptolemaic parties; and the schism exercised great influence upon the Judaism of the time. It was in Antioch that the Jews first made the acquaintance of Hellenism and of the more corrupt sides of Greek culture; and it was from Antioch that Judea henceforth was ruled.&quot;

==Historical sources==
The major source of information about the origin of the Hasmonean dynasty is the books 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees, held as canonical scripture by the Catholic, Orthodox, and most Oriental Orthodox churches and as apocryphal by Protestant denominations, although they do not comprise the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible.

The books cover the period from 175 BCE to 134 BCE during which time the Hasmonean dynasty became semi-independent from the Seleucid empire but had not yet expanded far outside of Judea. They are written from the point of view that the salvation of the Jewish people in a crisis came from God through the family of Mattathias, particularly his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and his grandson John Hyrcanus. The books include historical and religious material from the Septuagint that was codified by Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians.

The other primary source for the Hasmonean dynasty is the first book of &quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot; and a more detailed history in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; by the Jewish historian Josephus, (37– 100 CE). Josephus&#x27; account is the only primary source covering the history of the Hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 and 63 BCE. Notably, Josephus, a Roman citizen and former general in the Galilee, who survived the Jewish–Roman wars of the 1st century, was a Jew who was captured by and cooperated with the Romans, and wrote his books under Roman patronage.

==Seleucid rule over Judea==

===Hellenisation===

The continuing Hellenization of Judea pitted traditional Jews against those who eagerly Hellenized. The latter felt that the former&#x27;s orthodoxy held them back. Jews were divided both between those favoring Hellenization and those opposing it and over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids.

In 175 BCE, conflict broke out between High Priest Onias III (who opposed Hellenisation and favoured the Ptolemies) and his brother Jason (who favoured Hellenisation and the Seleucids). A period of political intrigue followed, with both Jason and Menelaus bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war. The Tobiads, a philo-Hellenistic party, succeeded in placing Jason into the powerful position of High Priest. He established an arena for public games close by the Temple. Author Lee I. Levine notes, &quot;The &#x27;piece de resistance&#x27; of Judaean Hellenisation, and the most dramatic of all these developments, occurred in 175 BCE, when the high priest Jason converted Jerusalem into a Greek polis replete with gymnasium and ephebeion (2 Maccabees 4). Whether this step represents the culmination of a 150-year process of Hellenisation within Jerusalem in general, or whether it was only the initiative of a small coterie of Jerusalem priests with no wider ramifications, has been debated for decades.&quot; Hellenised Jews are known to have engaged in non-surgical foreskin restoration (epispasm) in order to join the dominant Hellenistic cultural practice of socialising naked in the gymnasium, where their circumcision would have carried a social stigma; Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman culture found circumcision to be a cruel, barbaric and repulsive custom.

===Antiochus IV against Jerusalem===

In spring 168 BCE, after successfully invading the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt, Antiochus IV was humiliatingly pressured by the Romans to withdraw. According to the Roman historian Livy, the Roman senate dispatched the diplomat Gaius Popilius to Egypt who demanded Antiochus to withdraw. When Antiochus requested time to discuss the matter Popilius &quot;drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, &#x27;Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.&#x27;&quot;

While Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, a rumor spread in Judah that he had been killed. The deposed high priest Jason took advantage of the situation, attacked Jerusalem, and drove away Menelaus and his followers. Menelaus took refuge in Akra, the Seleucids fortress in Jerusalem. When Antiochus heard of this, he sent an army to Jerusalem to sort things out. Jerusalem was taken, Jason and his followers were driven out, and Menelaus reinstated as high priest.

He then imposed a tax and established a fortress in Jerusalem. Antiochus tried to suppress public observance of Jewish laws, apparently in an attempt to secure control over the Jews. His government set up an idol of Zeus on the Temple Mount, which Jews considered to be desecration of the Mount; it also forbade both circumcision and possession of Jewish scriptures, on pain of death. According to Josephus,&quot;Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine&#x27;s flesh upon the altar.&quot;
He also outlawed observance of the Sabbath and the offering of sacrifices at the Jerusalem Temple and required Jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols; punitive executions were also instituted. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offence. The motives of Antiochus are unclear. He may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee, Menelaus, he may have been responding to a Jewish revolt that had drawn on the Temple and the Torah for its strength, or he may have been encouraged by a group of radical Hellenisers among the Jews.

===Maccabean Revolt===
The author of the First Book of Maccabees regarded the Maccabean revolt as a rising of pious Jews against the Seleucid king who had tried to eradicate their religion and against the Jews who supported him. The author of the Second Book of Maccabees presented the conflict as a struggle between &quot;Judaism&quot; and &quot;Hellenism&quot;, words that he was the first to use. Modern scholarship tends to the second view.

Most modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenised Jews in Jerusalem. According to Joseph P. Schultz, modern scholarship, &quot;considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.&quot; In the conflict over the office of High Priest, traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contested against Hellenisers with Greek names like Jason or Menelaus. Other authors point to social and economic factors in the conflict. What began as a civil war took on the character of an invasion when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenising Jews against the traditionalists. As the conflict escalated, Antiochus prohibited the practices of the traditionalists, thereby, in a departure from usual Seleucid practice, banning the religion of an entire people. Other scholars argue that while the rising began as a religious rebellion, it was gradually transformed into a war of national liberation.
The two greatest twentieth-century scholars of the Maccabean revolt, Elias Bickermann and Victor Tcherikover, each placed the blame on the policies of the Jewish leaders and not on the Seleucid ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, but for different reasons.&lt;br&gt;Bickermann saw the origin of the problem in the attempt of &quot;Hellenised&quot; Jews to reform the &quot;antiquated&quot; and &quot;outdated&quot; religion practised in Jerusalem, and to rid it of superstitious elements. They were the ones who egged on Antiochus IV and instituted the religious reform in Jerusalem. One suspects that [Bickermann] may have been influenced in his view by an antipathy to Reform Judaism in 19th- and 20th-century Germany. Tcherikover, perhaps influenced by socialist concerns, saw the uprising as one of the rural peasants against the rich elite.

According to I and II Maccabees, the priestly family of Mattathias (Mattitiyahu in Hebrew), which came to be known as the &quot;Maccabees&quot;, called the people forth to holy war against the Seleucids. Mattathias&#x27; sons Judas (Yehuda), Jonathan (Yonoson/Yonatan), and Simon (Shimon) began a military campaign, initially with disastrous results: one thousand Jewish men, women, and children were killed by Seleucid troops because they refused to fight, even in self-defence, on the Sabbath. Other Jews then reasoned that they must fight when attacked, even on the Sabbath. The institution of guerrilla warfare practices by Judah over several years led to victory against the Seleucids:

It was now, in the fall of 165, that Judah&#x27;s successes began to disturb the central government. He appears to have controlled the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and thus to have cut off the royal party in Acra from direct communication with the sea and thus with the government. It is significant that this time the Syrian troops, under the leadership of the governor-general Lysias, took the southerly route, by way of Idumea.

Towards the end of 164, Judah felt strong enough to enter Jerusalem and the formal religious worship of Yahweh was re-established. The feast of Hanukkah was instituted to commemorate the recovery of the temple. Antiochus, who was away on a campaign against the Parthians, died at about the same time in Persis. Antiochus was succeeded by Demetrius I Soter, the nephew whose throne he had usurped. Demetrius sent the general Bacchides to Israel with a large army, in order to install Alcimus with the office of high priest. Bacchides subdued Jerusalem and returned to his King.

==From revolt to independence==

===Judah and Jonathan===

After five years of war and raids, Judah sought an alliance with the Roman Republic to remove the Greeks: &quot;In the year 161 BCE he sent Eupolemus the son of Johanan and Jason the son of Eleazar, &#x27;to make a league of amity and confederacy with the Romans.&#x27;&quot;

A Seleucid army under General Nicanor was defeated by Judah (ib. 7:26–50) at the Battle of Adasa, with Nicanor himself killed in action. Next, Bacchides was sent with Alcimus and an army of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and met Judah at the Battle of Elasa (Laisa), where this time it was the Hasmonean commander who was killed. (161/160 BCE). Bacchides now established the Hellenes as rulers in Israel; and upon Judah&#x27;s death, the persecuted patriots, under Jonathan, brother of Judah, fled beyond the Jordan River. (ib. 9:25–27) They set camp near a morass by the name of Asphar, and remained, after several engagements with the Seleucids, in the swamp in the country east of the Jordan.

Following the death of his puppet governor Alcimus, High Priest of Jerusalem, Bacchides felt secure enough to leave the country, but two years after the departure of Bacchides from Israel, the City of Acre felt sufficiently threatened by Maccabee incursions to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory. Jonathan and Simeon, now more experienced in guerrilla warfare, thought it well to retreat farther, and accordingly fortified in the desert a place called Beth-hogla; there they were besieged several days by Bacchides. Jonathan offered the rival general a peace treaty and exchange of prisoners of war. Bacchides readily consented and even took an oath of nevermore making war upon Jonathan. He and his forces then vacated Israel. The victorious Jonathan now took up his residence in the old city of Michmash. From there he endeavoured to clear the land of &quot;the godless and the apostate&quot;. The chief source, 1 Maccabees, says that with this &quot;the sword ceased in Israel&quot;, and in fact nothing is reported for the five following years (158–153 BCE).

===Seleucid civil conflict===

An important external event brought the design of the Maccabeans to fruition. Demetrius I Soter&#x27;s relations with Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamon (reigned 159–138 BCE), Ptolemy VI of Egypt (reigned 163–145 BCE), and Ptolemy&#x27;s co-ruler Cleopatra II of Egypt were deteriorating, and they supported a rival claimant to the Seleucid throne: Alexander Balas, who purported to be the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and a first cousin of Demetrius. Demetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those in the City of Acre and at Beth-zur, to bolster his strength. Furthermore, he made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the City of Acre. Jonathan gladly accepted these terms, took up residence at Jerusalem in 153 BCE, and began fortifying the city.

Alexander Balas offered Jonathan even more favourable terms, including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem, and despite a second letter from Demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee, Jonathan declared allegiance to Balas. Jonathan became the official religious leader of his people, and officiated at the Feast of Tabernacles of 153 BCE wearing the High Priest&#x27;s garments. The Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences. Hasmoneans held the office of High Priest continuously until 37 BCE.

Soon, Demetrius lost both his throne and his life, in 150 BCE. The victorious Alexander Balas was given the further honour of marriage to Cleopatra Thea, daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. Jonathan was invited to Ptolemais for the ceremony, appearing with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honour. Balas appointed Jonathan as strategos and &quot;meridarch&quot; (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), sent him back with honours to Jerusalem, and refused to listen to the Hellenistic party&#x27;s complaints against Jonathan.

====Hasmoneans under Balas and Demetrius II====
In 147 BCE, Demetrius II Nicator, a son of Demetrius I Soter, claimed Balas&#x27; throne. The governor of Coele-Syria, Apollonius Taos, used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the mountains and venture out into the plain. Jonathan and Simeon led a force of 10,000 men against Apollonius&#x27; forces in Jaffa, which was unprepared for the rapid attack and opened the gates in surrender to the Jewish forces. Apollonius received reinforcements from Azotus and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces. Jonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of Dagon and the surrounding villages.

Alexander Balas honoured the victorious High Priest by giving him the city of Ekron along with its outlying territory. The people of Azotus complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law, but Jonathan met Ptolemy at Jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.

====Hasmoneans under Demetrius and Diodotus====
In 145 BCE, the Battle of Antioch resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy himself, however, was among the casualties of the battle. Demetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of Cleopatra Thea.

Jonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the Acra, the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea. It was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists. Demetrius was greatly incensed; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him. Without raising the siege, Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three Samaritan toparchies of Mount Ephraim, Lod, and Ramathaim-Zophim. In consideration of a present of 300 talents the entire country was exempted from taxes, the exemption being confirmed in writing. Jonathan in return lifted the siege of the Acra and left it in Seleucid hands.

Soon, however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young Antiochus VI Dionysus, son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea. He was three years old at most, but general Diodotus Tryphon used him to advance his own designs on the throne. In the face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the City of Acre, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops. The 3,000 men of Jonathan protected Demetrius in his capital, Antioch, against his own subjects.

As Demetrius II did not keep his promise, Jonathan thought it better to support the new king when Diodotus Tryphon and Antiochus VI seized the capital, especially as the latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother Simon (Simeon) strategos of the Paralia (the sea coast), from the &quot;Ladder of Tyre&quot; to the frontier of Egypt.

Jonathan and Simon were now entitled to make conquests; Ashkelon submitted voluntarily while Gaza was forcibly taken. Jonathan vanquished even the strategoi of Demetrius II far to the north, in the plain of Hazar, while Simon at the same time took the strong fortress of Beth-zur on the pretext that it harboured supporters of Demetrius.

Like Judah in former years, Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples. He renewed the treaty with the Roman Republic and exchanged friendly messages with Sparta and other places. However, the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity.

Diodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to Scythopolis for a friendly conference, where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses. Jonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.

===Simon assumes leadership===
When Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon, ready for battle. Tryphon, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan&#x27;s two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan. Although Simon did not trust Diodotus Tryphon, he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother. But Diodotus Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan. Jonathan was buried by Simeon at Modin. Nothing is known of his two captive sons. One of his daughters was an ancestor of Josephus.

Simon assumed the leadership (142 BCE), receiving the double office of High Priest and Ethnarch (Prince) of Israel. The leadership of the Hasmoneans was established by a resolution, adopted in 141 BCE, at a large assembly &quot;of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet&quot; (1 Macc. 14:41). Ironically, the election was performed in Hellenistic fashion.

Simon, having made the Jewish people semi-independent of the Seleucid Greeks, reigned from 142 to 135 BCE and formed the Hasmonean dynasty, finally capturing the citadel [Acra] in 141 BCE. The Roman Senate accorded the new dynasty recognition BCE, when the delegation of Simon was in Rome.

Simon led the people in peace and prosperity, until in February 135 BCE, he was assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law Ptolemy, son of Abubus (also spelled Abobus or Abobi), who had been named governor of the region by the Seleucids. Simon&#x27;s eldest sons, Mattathias and Judah, were also murdered.

==Hasmonean expansion and civil war==

After achieving semi-independency from the Seleucid Empire, the dynasty began to expand into the neighboring regions. Perea was conquered already by Jonathan Apphus, subsequently John Hyrcanus conquered Samaria and Idumea, Aristobulus I conquered the territory of Galilee, and Alexander Jannaeus conquered the territory of Iturea. In addition to territorial conquests, the Hasmonean rulers, initially reigning only as rebel leaders, gradually assumed the religious office of High Priest during the reign of Jonathan Apphus in 152 BCE and the monarchical title of Ethnarch during the reign of Simon Thassi in 142 BCE, eventually assuming the title of King (basileus) in 104 BCE by Aristobulus I.

In BCE, John Hyrcanus, Simon&#x27;s third son, assumed the leadership as both the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) and Ethnarch, taking a Greek &quot;regnal name&quot; (see Hyrcania) in an acceptance of the Hellenistic culture of his Seleucid suzerains. Within a year of the death of Simon, Seleucid King Antiochus VII Sidetes attacked Jerusalem. According to Josephus, John Hyrcanus opened King David&#x27;s sepulchre and removed three thousand talents which he paid as tribute to spare the city. He remained governor as a Seleucid vassal. For the next two decades of his reign, Hyrcanus continued, like his father, to rule semi-autonomously from the Seleucids.

The Seleucid empire had been disintegrating in the face of the Seleucid–Parthian wars and in 129 BCE Antiochus VII Sidetes was killed in Media by the forces of Phraates II of Parthia, permanently ending Seleucid rule east of the Euphrates. In 116 BCE, a civil war between Seleucid half-brothers Antiochus VIII Grypus and Antiochus IX Cyzicenus broke out, resulting in a further breakup of the already significantly reduced kingdom.

This provided opportunity for semi-independent Seleucid client states such as Judea to revolt. In 110 BCE, John Hyrcanus carried out the first military conquests of the newly independent Hasmonean kingdom, raising a mercenary army to capture Madaba and Schechem, significantly increasing his regional influence.

Hyrcanus conquered Transjordan, Samaria, and Idumea (also known as Edom), and forced Idumeans to convert to Judaism: Hyrcanus ... subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, (25) and of the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.

He desired that his wife succeed him as head of the government, with his eldest of five sons, Aristobulus I, becoming only the high-priest.

Upon Hyrcanus&#x27; death in 104 BCE, however, Aristobulus I jailed his three brothers (including Alexander Jannaeus) and his mother and allowed her to starve there. By this means he came into possession of the throne and became the first Hasmonean to take the title of King (basileus), asserting the new-found independence of the state. Subsequently he conquered Galilee. Aristobulus I died after a painful illness in 103 BCE.

Aristobulus&#x27; brothers were freed from prison by his widow; one of them, Alexander Jannaeus, reigned as a king as well as a high priest from 103–76 BCE. During his reign he conquered Iturea and, according to Josephus, forcibly converted Itureans to Judaism. He died during the siege of the fortress Ragaba. In BCE, according to Josephus, following a six-year civil war involving Seleucid king Demetrius III Eucaerus, Hasmonean ruler Alexander Jannaeus crucified 800 Jewish rebels in Jerusalem.

The Hasmoneans lost the territories acquired in Transjordan during the 93 BCE Battle of Gadara, where the Nabataeans ambushed Jannaeus and his forces in a hilly area. The Nabataeans saw the acquisitions as a threat to their interests, and used a large number of camels to push the Hasmonean forces into a deep valley where Jannaeus was &quot;lucky to escape alive&quot;. Jannaeus returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem after his defeat, and had to cede the acquired territories to the Nabataeans so that he could dissuade them from supporting his opponents in Judea.

Alexander was followed by his wife, Salome Alexandra, who reigned from 76 to 67 BCE. She was the only &quot;regnant&quot; Jewish Queen in the Second Temple period, having followed usurper Queen Athalia who had reigned centuries prior. During Alexandra&#x27;s reign, her son Hyrcanus II held the office of High Priest and was named her successor.

===Pharisee and Sadducee factions===
It is difficult to state at what time the Pharisees, as a party, arose. Josephus first mentioned them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (&quot;Ant.&quot; xiii. 5, § 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.

During the Hasmonean period, the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties. Although the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus choose between being king and being High Priest. In response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, Salome Alexandra, whose brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees. The conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.

Josephus attested that Salome Alexandra was very favourably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the Sanhedrin. Later texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. The influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many. Although these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple period.

===Civil war===
Alexander Jannaeus&#x27; son, Hyrcanus II, had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother, Aristobulus II, rose in rebellion, whereupon Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of mercenaries and his Pharisee followers: &quot;Now Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus.&quot; [according to Josephus]

Hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem, but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest (comp. Emil Schürer, &quot;Gesch.&quot; i. 291, note 2), but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office, as Josephus states: &quot;but Hyrcanus, with those of his party who stayed with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the hostages (which were Aristobulus&#x27;s wife, with her children) that he might persevere; but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes, that Aristobulus should be king, and Hyrcanus should resign, but retain all the rest of his dignities, as being the king&#x27;s brother. Hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the Temple, and embraced one another in a very kind manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus.&quot; Aristobulus ruled from 67–63 BCE.

From 63 to 40 BCE, the government (by this time reduced to a protectorate of Rome as described below) was in the hands of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and Ethnarch, although effective power was in the hands of his adviser Antipater the Idumaean.

===Intrigues of Antipater===
The struggle would have ended here but for Antipater the Idumean. Antipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition, the control of Judea, under the government of the weak Hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic Aristobulus. He accordingly began to impress upon Hyrcanus&#x27; mind that Aristobulus was planning his death, finally persuading him to take refuge with Aretas, king of the Nabatæans. Aretas, bribed by Antipater, who also promised him the restitution of the Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans, readily espoused the cause of Hyrcanus and advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand. During the siege, which lasted several months, the adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the Jews: they stoned the pious Onias (see Honi ha-Magel) and, instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice, sent a pig. Honi, ordered to curse the besieged, prayed: &quot;Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Thy people, I beseech Thee not to answer the evil prayers of either.&quot; The pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources. According to Josephus, the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand drachmas they had asked for the lamb.

==Roman intervention==
===Pompey the Great===

While this civil war was going on, the Roman general Marcus Aemilius Scaurus went to Syria to take possession, in the name of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, of the kingdom of the Seleucids. The brothers appealed to him, each endeavouring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. At first Scaurus, moved by a gift of four hundred talents, decided in favour of Aristobulus. Aretas was ordered to withdraw his army from Judea, and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. But when Pompey came to Syria (63 BCE), a different situation arose. Pompey, who had just been awarded the title &quot;Conqueror of Asia&quot; due to his decisive victories in Asia Minor over Pontus and the Seleucid Empire, had decided to bring Judea under the rule of the Romans. He took the same view of Hyrcanus&#x27; ability, and was moved by much the same motives as Antipater: as a ward of Rome, Hyrcanus would be more acceptable than Aristobulus. When, therefore, the brothers, as well as delegates of the people&#x27;s party, which, weary of Hasmonean quarrels, desired the extinction of the dynasty, presented themselves before Pompey, he delayed the decision, in spite of Aristobulus&#x27; gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents. The latter, however, fathomed the designs of Pompey, and assembled his armies. Pompey defeated him multiple times however and captured his cities. Aristobulus II entrenched himself in the fortress of Alexandrium; but, soon realising the uselessness of resistance, surrendered at the first summons of the Romans, and undertook to deliver Jerusalem to them. The patriots, however, were not willing to open their gates to the Romans, and a siege ensued which ended with the capture of the city. Pompey entered the Holy of Holies; this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot. Judaea had to pay tribute to Rome and was placed under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria: In 63 BC, Judaea became a protectorate of Rome. Coming under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor&#x27;s business was to regulate trade and maximise tax revenue.

In 57–55 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into Galilee, Samaria, and Judea, with five districts of legal and religious councils known as &quot;sanhedrin&quot; (Greek: συνέδριον, &quot;synedrion&quot;): &quot;And when he had ordained five councils (συνέδρια), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee.&quot;

===Pompey and Caesar===

Julius Caesar initially supported Aristobulus against Hyrcanus and Antipater. Between the weakness of Hyrcanus and the ambition of Aristobulus, Judea lost its independence. Aristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner, and Hyrcanus was reappointed High Priest, but without political authority. When, in 50 BCE, it appeared that Julius Caesar was interested in using Aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of Judea from Hyrcanus and Antipater, who were beholden to Pompey, supporters of Pompey had Aristobulus poisoned in Rome and executed Alexander in Antioch.

However, Pompey&#x27;s pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side: At the beginning of the civil war between [Caesar] and Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered, Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard pressed at Alexandria. His timely help and his influence over the Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar&#x27;s favour, and secured for him an extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy. Joppa was restored to the Hasmonean domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome, and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed.&quot;

The timely aid from Antipater and Hyrcanus led the triumphant Caesar to ignore the claims of Aristobulus&#x27;s younger son, Antigonus the Hasmonean, and to confirm Hyrcanus and Antipater in their authority, despite their previous allegiance to Pompey. Josephus noted, Antigonus... came to Caesar... and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country... and that as to the assistance they had sent [to Caesar] into Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his enemy] Pompey.
Hyrcanus&#x27; restoration as ethnarch in 47 BCE coincided with Caesar&#x27;s appointment of Antipater as the first Roman Procurator, allowing Antipater to promote the interests of his own house: &quot;Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should choose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator of Judea.&quot;

Antipater appointed his sons to positions of influence: Phasael became Governor of Jerusalem, and Herod Governor of Galilee. This led to increasing tension between Hyrcanus and the family of Antipater, culminating in a trial of Herod for supposed abuses in his governorship, which resulted in Herod&#x27;s flight into exile in 46 BCE. Herod soon returned, however, and the honours to Antipater&#x27;s family continued. Hyrcanus&#x27; incapacity and weakness were so manifest that, when he defended Herod against the Sanhedrin and before Mark Antony, the latter stripped Hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title, bestowing them both upon the accused.

Caesar was assassinated in 44 BCE and unrest and confusion spread throughout the Roman world, including Judaea. Antipater the Idumean was assassinated in 43 BCE by the Nabatean king, Malichus I, who had bribed one of Hyrcanus&#x27; cup-bearers to poison and kill Antipater. However, Antipater&#x27;s sons managed to maintain their control over Judea and their father&#x27;s puppet Hasmonean, Hyrcanus.

===Parthian invasion, Antony, Augustus===
After Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE, Quintus Labienus, a Roman republican general and ambassador to the Parthians, sided with Brutus and Cassius in the Liberators&#x27; civil war; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BCE. The Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony&#x27;s Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause. The Parthians split their army, and under Pacorus conquered the Levant: Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had come. When Phasael and Hyrcanus II set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them. Antigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus&#x27;s ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death.
Antigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years, as he had not disposed of Herod, the most dangerous of his enemies. Herod fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony. Herod was designated &quot;King of the Jews&quot; by the Roman Senate in 40 BCE: Antony then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and Caesar [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.

The struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod. After the Parthians&#x27; defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in 37 BCE. Antigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter. The Romans assented to Herod&#x27;s proclamation as King of the Jews, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Judea.

===Herod and the end of the dynasty===
Antigonus was not, however, the last Hasmonean. The fate of the remaining male members of the family under Herod was not a happy one. Aristobulus III, grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed (36 BCE) due to Herod&#x27;s jealousy. His sister Mariamne was married to Herod, but also fell victim to his jealousy. Her sons by Herod, Aristobulus IV and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father.

Hyrcanus II had been held by the Parthians since 40 BCE. For four years, until 36 BCE, he lived amid the Babylonian Jews, who paid him every mark of respect. In that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews warned him in vain. Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him. As the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod. In the year 30 BCE, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed.

The later Herodian rulers Agrippa I and Agrippa II both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I&#x27;s father was Aristobulus IV, son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, as Herod was not as a Hasmonean by-blood. The Hasmoneans did not have defined rules for succession and Agrippa was viewed as legitimate via his grandmother, Mariamne I.

== Foreign views ==
In his &quot;Histories&quot;, Tacitus explained the background for the establishment of the Hasmonean state:While the East was under the dominion of the Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, the Jews were regarded as the meanest of their subjects: but after the Macedonians gained supremacy, King Antiochus endeavored to abolish Jewish superstition and to introduce Greek civilization; the war with the Parthians, however, prevented his improving this basest of peoples; for it was exactly at that time that Arsaces had revolted. Later on, since the power of Macedon had waned, the Parthians were not yet come to their strength, and the Romans were far away, the Jews selected their own kings. These in turn were expelled by the fickle mob; but recovering their throne by force of arms, they banished citizens, destroyed towns, killed brothers, wives, and parents, and dared essay every other kind of royal crime without hesitation; but they fostered the national superstition, for they had assumed the priesthood to support their civil authority.

==Legacy and scholarship==
While the Hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent Jewish kingdom, its successes were rather short-lived, and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the Maccabee brothers had gained.

===Jewish nationalism===
The fall of the Hasmonean Kingdom marked an end to a century of Jewish self-governance, but Jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under Roman rule, beginning with the Census of Quirinius in CE 6 and leading to a series of Jewish–Roman wars in the 1st–2nd centuries, including the Great Revolt (CE 66–73), the Kitos War (115–117), and Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt (132–135).

During the wars, temporary commonwealths were established, but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of Rome. Roman legions under Vespasian and Titus besieged and destroyed Jerusalem, looted and burned Herod&#x27;s Temple (in the year 70) and Jewish strongholds (notably Gamla in 67 and Masada in 73), and enslaved or a large part of the Jewish population. The defeat of the Jewish revolts against the Roman Empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the Jewish Diaspora, as many Jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into slavery throughout the empire.

Daniel R. Schwartz believes the thematic differences in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees reflect the ideological divide on whether Jews should be oriented around religion or politics, in the form of Jewish theocracies and/or secular nationalism.

===Jewish religious scholarship===
Jewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later Hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall, since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of King David. The Hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with Greek names, and the dynasty eventually became very Hellenised, to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally-minded Jewish subjects. Frequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among Jews of later generations that the latter Hasmoneans were degenerate. One member of this school was Josephus, whose accounts are in many cases the sole source of information about the Hasmoneans.

===Influence on Jewish religious attitudes and practice===
Since the 1990s, a growing body of research has explored several major changes in Jewish ideas and practice during the Hasmonean period. Shaye J. D. Cohen&#x27;s 1999 book, &quot;The Beginnings of Jewishness&quot; posited that Jewish identity first began to transcend the Judean nationality and become a religious identity only in the late 2nd century BCE, when the Hasmoneans began conquering and converting neighboring peoples to Judaism. Reinhard Gregor Kratz&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Historisches und Biblisches Israel&quot; (published in English in 2015 as &quot;Historical and Biblical Israel&quot;) argued that &quot;biblical&quot; and &quot;non-biblical&quot; Israelite/Jewish traditions existed for centuries in antiquity, with biblical Judaism only becoming predominant under the Hasmoneans. John J. Collins&#x27;s 2017 book, &quot;The Invention of Judaism&quot;, identified the mid-2nd century BCE as the first time in which contemporary literature is focused on specific questions of Jewish law (&quot;halakha&quot;). Finally, Yonatan Adler&#x27;s 2022 book, &quot;The Origins of Judaism&quot; presented archaeological evidence that many standard Jewish religious practices—such as &quot;kashrut&quot; and maintaining ritual purity—were not commonly observed before Hasmonean rule.

==Numismatics==
Hasmonean coins usually featured the Paleo-Hebrew script, an older Phoenician script that was used to write Hebrew. The coins are struck only in bronze. The symbols include a , cornucopia, palm-branch, lily, an anchor, star, pomegranate and (rarely) a helmet. Despite the apparent Seleucid influences of most of the symbols, the origin of the star is more obscure. Hasmonean coins are the first known coins in Judea to completely omit depictions of humans or animals, which Yonatan Adler posited was evidence that the Hasmoneans were the first Jewish authorities to enforce rules on creations of &quot;graven images&quot; in line with the Ten Commandments.

<text>The People vs. Larry Flynt is a 1996 American biographical drama film directed by Miloš Forman, chronicling the rise of pornographer Larry Flynt and his subsequent clash with religious institutions and the law. It stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love as his wife Althea, and Edward Norton as his attorney Alan Isaacman. The screenplay, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, spans about 35 years of Flynt&#x27;s life, from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot;.

Despite limited success at the box office, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; was acclaimed by critics and garnered Harrelson, Love, Norton, and Forman numerous accolades, including a Best Actor nomination for Harrelson and Best Director nomination for Forman at the 69th Academy Awards. Forman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.

==Plot==
In 1952, 10-year-old Larry Flynt is selling moonshine in Kentucky. Twenty years later, Flynt and his younger brother, Jimmy, run the Hustler Go-Go, a struggling strip club in Cincinnati. In a bid to improve his business, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club featuring nude photos of his strippers, which he names &quot;Hustler&quot;. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. After &quot;Hustler&quot; publishes photos of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis sunbathing nude in 1972, it becomes a national sensation, and Larry decides to focus on it full-time.

Flynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure, who he allows to work as a stripper despite her being underage. With his success comes enemies – as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, declaring that &quot;murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it, you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize. However, sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail.&quot; He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends his young and idealistic lawyer, Alan Isaacman.

In 1975, Flynt is convicted on pornography charges, but the decision is overturned on appeal; he is released from jail soon afterwards. Ruth Carter Stapleton, a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus; this results in Flynt attempting to turn his life around and even push for &quot;Hustler&quot; to become a more tasteful publication in line with his competitors. However, Althea, who blames molestation by nuns during her years in Catholic school for her problems in life, grows to resent him.

In 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a man with a rifle while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Broken by the experience, Flynt renounces his faith, turns over control of &quot;Hustler&quot; to Jimmy and Althea, and moves to Beverly Hills, where he quickly spirals into drug addiction to combat his depression and crippling pain. In 1983, Flynt undergoes surgery to deaden several nerves in his back damaged by the bullet wounds, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He soon returns to an active role with the publication.

Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the John DeLorean entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an Army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as &quot;I Wish I Was Black&quot; and &quot;Fuck This Court.&quot; After spitting water at the judge, Flynt is committed to a psychiatric ward, where he sinks into depression again. Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which Jerry Falwell tells of a drunken sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for libel and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for copyright infringement, because Falwell copied his ad and used it to raise funds for his legal bills. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found liable for inflicting emotional distress but not libel and is forced to pay damages to Falwell.

Althea, now a morphine addict, visits Flynt and reveals her HIV diagnosis; disgusted to learn that the &quot;Hustler&quot; staff won&#x27;t even shake her hand, Flynt arranges a company meeting via phone call and fires everyone. Althea comes to live with him, but later drowns in the bathtub after passing out. Flynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt&#x27;s courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he &quot;wants to be remembered for something meaningful&quot;. Isaacman finally agrees to represent him in front of the Supreme Court, in the case &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot; in December 1987. With Flynt sitting silently in the courtroom, the court overturns the original verdict in a unanimous decision. After the trial, Flynt is shown to be alone in his bedroom watching old videotapes of a happy, healthy Althea and himself before tragedy struck them both.

<text>The Apostle is a 1997 American drama film written and directed by Robert Duvall, who stars in the title role. John Beasley, Farrah Fawcett, Walton Goggins, Billy Bob Thornton, June Carter Cash, Miranda Richardson, and Billy Joe Shaver also appear. It was filmed on location in and around Saint Martinville and Des Allemands, Louisiana with some establishing shots done in the Dallas, Texas area. The majority of the film was shot in the Louisiana areas of Sunset and Lafayette.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. For his performance, Duvall was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film for 1997.

== Plot ==
Euliss F. &quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey is a charismatic Pentecostal preacher. His wife Jessie has begun an adulterous relationship with a youth minister named Horace. She refuses Sonny&#x27;s desire to reconcile, although she assures him that she will not interfere with his right to see his children. She has also conspired to use their church&#x27;s bylaws to have him removed from power. Sonny asks God what to do but receives no answer. Much of the congregation sides with Jessie in this dispute. Sonny, however, refuses to start a new church, insisting that the one which forced him out was &quot;his&quot; church. At his children&#x27;s Bible-camp softball game, Sonny, in an emotional and drunken fit, attacks Horace with a bat and puts him into a coma; Horace later dies.

A fleeing Sonny ditches his car in a river and gets rid of all identifying information. After destroying all evidence of his past, Sonny rebaptizes himself and anoints himself as &quot;The Apostle E. F.&quot; He leaves Texas and ends up in the bayous of Louisiana, where he persuades a retired minister named Blackwell to help him start a new church. He works various odd jobs and uses the money to build the church, and to buy time to preach on a local radio station. Sonny also begins dating the station&#x27;s receptionist.

With Sonny&#x27;s energy and charisma, the church soon has a faithful and racially integrated flock. Sonny even succeeds in converting a racist construction worker who shows up at a church picnic intent on destruction. While at work in a local diner, Sonny sees his new girlfriend out in public with her husband and children, apparently reconciled. Sonny walks out, vowing never to return there.

Jessie hears a radio broadcast of the Apostle E. F. and calls the police on Sonny. The police show up in the middle of an evening service but allow Sonny to finish it while they wait outside. In the poignant finale, Sonny delivers an impassioned sermon before telling his flock that he has to go. In the final scene, Sonny, now part of a chain gang, preaches to the inmates as they work along the side of a highway.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

===Development===
Making &quot;The Apostle&quot; had been a longtime passion project for Duvall, who first wrote the script in 1984, but could not find a studio willing to produce it. Duvall&#x27;s interest in playing a preacher stemmed from an experience he had in the 1960s visiting a small Pentecostal chapel in Arkansas while doing research for an off-Broadway play. Said Duvall, &quot;There was a certain simplicity and understanding. And also the feeling of the folklore. Preaching is one of the great American art forms. The rhythm, the cadence. And nobody knows about it except the preachers themselves.&quot; After finding no interest from studios, he eventually decided to direct and finance the film himself.

===Filming===
The film was primarily shot in western Louisiana over a period of seven weeks in the fall of 1996. The fictional town of Bayou Boutte is actually a small town in Louisiana called Sunset. Some members of the supporting cast were actual churchgoers from the area.

==Release==
The film was first screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 1997. In the middle of the screening, studio executives began leaving the theater to bid for distribution rights. October Films won the bidding war and gained the distribution rights that night.

&quot;The Apostle&quot; opened in limited release in North American theaters on December 19, 1997, eventually expanding nationwide through February and March 1998. It went on to gross $21.3 million worldwide, against a production budget of $5 million.

== Soundtrack ==
The score for &quot;The Apostle&quot; was scored by David Mansfield. Three songs, by country music artists Lyle Lovett, Patty Loveless, and contemporary Christian artist Steven Curtis Chapman, were recorded especially for the film. The song &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Grave Gonna Hold My Body Down&quot; was composed by Brother Claude Ely.

The soundtrack won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country, or Bluegrass Gospel Album.

The songs, &quot;I Will Not Go Quietly&quot; by Chapman, &quot;Two Coats&quot; by Loveless and &quot;I&#x27;m a Soldier in the Army of the Lord&quot; by Lovett were released on a soundtrack album that was supplemented with more exclusive songs &quot;inspired by&quot; (but not included in) the film. 
=== Track listing ===

=== Chart performance ===
== Reception ==
The film has an 88% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;A nuanced sermon on the contradictions of faith as well as a blistering showcase for its director and star, &quot;The Apostle&quot; will leave audiences evangelizing the immensity of Robert Duvall&#x27;s talent.&quot;

Critic Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and called the film &quot;a lesson in how movies can escape from convention and penetrate the hearts of rare characters.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an A− grade and described it as &quot;a seamless match of strong artistic vision and physical performance&quot;, with &quot;the Oscar-winning star of &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; [drawing] on more than three decades of experience personifying the hard contours and bruised souls of American men to create a fearless and fascinating piece of work.&quot;

American theologian Harvey Cox said, &quot;It&#x27;s the most explicit treatment of evangelical religious sensibility I&#x27;ve seen. One is stunned by Duvall&#x27;s performance. But beyond that, it is a film about sin and redemption, something Dostoevskian, deeply theological, not churchy. It&#x27;s in-your-face theology.&quot; &quot;The&quot; &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; noted how the film dealt with the subject of race as it &quot;presents the Christian message as universal, extending to all races and classes.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;The Apostle&quot; garnered numerous awards and nominations from major awards organizations. At the 70th Academy Awards, Duvall was nominated for Best Actor. The film won the awards for Best Film, Best Male Lead, and Best Director at the 13th Independent Spirit Awards. Miranda Richardson and Farrah Fawcett were also both nominated for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards.

In addition, Duvall won the awards for Best Actor from the Chicago Film Critics Association, Florida Film Critics, Las Vegas Film Critics Society, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics, Society of Texas Film Critics, and the Satellite Awards. Duvall was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor and an Un Certain Regard Award at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

<doc id="171549" wikidata="Q210148" url="?curid=171549" title="Peter Fonda">
<text>Peter Henry Fonda (February 23, 1940 – August 16, 2019) was an American actor, film director, and screenwriter. He was a two-time Academy Award nominee, both for acting and screenwriting, and a two-time Golden Globe Award winner for his acting. He was a member of the Fonda acting family, as the son of actor Henry Fonda, the brother of actress and activist Jane Fonda, and the father of actress Bridget Fonda.

Fonda began his career on stage, winning a New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award and the Theatre World Award for his performance in the play &quot;Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole&quot;. He became a prominent figure in the counterculture of the 1960s, starring in and co-writing the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He then made his directorial debut with the Revisionist Western film &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971), in which he also starred. During the following decade, he established himself as an action star, appearing in a variety of productions including &quot;Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry&quot; (1974) and &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976).

Fonda achieved a major critical comeback with his starring role in the drama film &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1997), receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He also won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot; (1999). In 2003, Fonda received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7018 Hollywood Blvd, for his contributions to the film industry.
== Early life ==

Fonda was born by caesarean section on February 23, 1940, at LeRoy Hospital in New York City, the only son of actor Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Ford Seymour; his older sister is actress Jane Fonda. He and Jane had a half-sister, Frances de Villers Brokaw (1931–2008), from their mother&#x27;s first marriage. Their mother committed suicide in a mental hospital when Peter, her youngest, was ten. He did not discover the circumstances or location of her death until he was fifteen.

One month prior to his eleventh birthday, he accidentally shot himself in the abdomen and nearly died. He went to the hill station of Nainital, India, and stayed for a few months for recovery. Years later, while taking LSD with John Lennon and George Harrison, he referred to this incident, saying, &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be dead.&quot; This inspired The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;She Said She Said&quot;.

Peter attended the Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts, and was a member of the Class of 1954. He then matriculated in Westminster School, a Connecticut boarding school in Simsbury, where he graduated in 1958.

Once he graduated, Fonda studied acting in Omaha, Nebraska, his father&#x27;s hometown. While attending the University of Nebraska-Omaha, Fonda joined the Omaha Community Playhouse.

== Career ==
=== Early years and film work ===

Upon his return to New York, Fonda joined the Cecilwood Theatre in 1960. Afterwards, he found work on Broadway and gained notice in &quot;Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole&quot;, written by James and William Goldman, which ran for 84 performances in 1961. Fonda began guest starring on television shows like &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The New Breed&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and &quot;The Defenders&quot;.

Fonda&#x27;s first film came when producer Ross Hunter was looking for a new male actor to romance Sandra Dee in &quot;Tammy and the Doctor&quot; (1963). He was cast in the role, in what was a minor hit. He followed this with a support part in &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963), a bleak look at American soldiers in World War II, directed by Carl Foreman. Fonda&#x27;s performance won him a Golden Globe Award for most promising newcomer.

Fonda continued to work in television, guest starring in &quot;Channing&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. He also tested for the role of John F. Kennedy in &quot;PT-109&quot;. Fonda impressed Robert Rossen who cast him in what would be Rossen&#x27;s last movie, &quot;Lilith&quot; (1964), alongside Warren Beatty, Jean Seberg and Gene Hackman. Fonda&#x27;s performance was well reviewed. Shortly before dying, Rossen signed him to a seven-film contract which was to start with an adaptation of &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot;. Fonda graduated to a starring role in &quot;The Young Lovers&quot; (1964), about out-of-wedlock pregnancy, the sole directorial effort of Samuel Goldwyn Jr.

=== Counterculture figure and Roger Corman ===

By the mid-1960s, Fonda was not a conventional &quot;leading man&quot; in Hollywood. As &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine reported, Fonda had established a &quot;solid reputation as a dropout&quot;. He had become outwardly nonconformist and grew his hair long and took LSD regularly, alienating the &quot;establishment&quot; film industry. Desirable acting work became scarce. Through his friendships with members of the band The Byrds, Fonda visited The Beatles in their rented house in Benedict Canyon in Los Angeles in August 1965. While John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, and Fonda were under the influence of LSD, Lennon heard Fonda say, &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be dead.&quot; Lennon used the phrase in the lyrics for his song, &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, which was included on their 1966 album, &quot;Revolver&quot;.

In August 1966 Fonda was charged with possession of marijuana, and was later acquitted in December of that year. In November 1966 Fonda was arrested in the Sunset Strip riot, which the police ended forcefully. The band Buffalo Springfield protested the department&#x27;s handling of the incident in their song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;. In 1967, Fonda recorded &quot;November Night&quot;, a 45-rpm single written by Gram Parsons for the Chisa label, backed with &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; by Donovan, produced by Hugh Masekela.

Fonda&#x27;s first counterculture-oriented film role was as a biker in Roger Corman&#x27;s B movie &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966). Fonda originally was to support George Chakiris, but graduated to the lead when Chakiris revealed he could not ride a motorcycle. In the film, Fonda delivered a &quot;eulogy&quot; at a fallen Angel&#x27;s funeral service. The movie was a big hit at the box office, screened at the Venice Film Festival, launched the biker movie genre, and established Peter Fonda as a movie name. Fonda made a television pilot, &quot;High Noon: The Clock Strikes Noon Again&quot;, filmed in December 1965. It was based on the film &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), starring Gary Cooper, with Fonda in the Cooper role. It did not become a series.

Fonda next played the male lead in Corman&#x27;s film &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967), a take on the experience and &quot;consequences&quot; of consuming LSD, which was written by Jack Nicholson. His co-stars included Susan Strasberg, Bruce Dern, and Dennis Hopper. The movie was a hit. Fonda then traveled to France to appear in the portmanteau horror movie &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot; (1968). His segment co-starred his sister Jane and was directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim. For American television, he appeared in a movie, &quot;Certain Honorable Men&quot; (1968), alongside Van Heflin, written by Rod Serling.

=== &quot;Easy Rider&quot; ===

Fonda produced, co-wrote and starred in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), directed by Dennis Hopper. &quot;Easy Rider&quot; is about two long-haired bikers traveling through the southwestern and southern United States where they encounter intolerance and violence. Fonda played &quot;Wyatt&quot;, a charismatic, laconic man whose motorcycle jacket bore a large American flag across the back. Dennis Hopper played the garrulous &quot;Billy&quot;. Jack Nicholson played George Hanson, an alcoholic civil rights lawyer who rides along with them. Fonda co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Southern and Hopper.

Fonda tried to secure financing from Roger Corman and American International Pictures (AIP), with whom he had made &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; and &quot;The Trip&quot;, but they were reluctant to finance a film directed by Hopper. They succeeded in getting money from Columbia Pictures. Hopper filmed the cross-country road trip depicted almost entirely on location. Fonda had secured funding of around $360,000, largely based on the fact he knew that it was the budget Roger Corman needed to make &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;. The guitarist and composer Robbie Robertson, of The Band, was so moved by an advance screening that he approached Fonda and tried to convince him to let him write a complete score, even though the film was nearly due for wide release. Fonda declined the offer, instead using Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot; sung by The Byrds&#x27; Roger McGuinn, and Robertson&#x27;s own composition &quot;The Weight&quot;, performed by The Band, among many other tracks.

The film was released to international success. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Fonda, Hopper and Southern were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film grossed over $40 million.

=== Director and action star===
After the success of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, both Hopper and Fonda were sought for film projects. Hopper directed the film &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971), in which Fonda co-starred along with singer Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas. Fonda directed and starred in the Western film &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971). He took the lead role in a cast that also featured Warren Oates, Verna Bloom and Beat Generation poet Michael McClure. The film received mixed reviews and failed commercially upon its initial release, but many years later, in 2001, a fully restored version was shown at various film festivals and was re-released by the Sundance Channel on DVD that same year in two separate editions. Fonda later directed the science fiction film &quot;Idaho Transfer&quot; (1973). He did not appear in the film, and the film received mixed reviews upon its limited release. Around the same time, he co-starred with Lindsay Wagner in &quot;Two People&quot; (also 1973) for director Robert Wise, in which he portrayed a Vietnam War deserter.

Fonda starred alongside Susan George and longtime-friend (and frequent co-star) Adam Roarke in the film &quot;Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry&quot; (1974), a film about two NASCAR hopefuls who execute a supermarket heist to finance their jump into big-time auto racing. The film was a box-office hit that year. It led to Fonda&#x27;s making a series of action movies: &quot;Open Season&quot; (1974), with William Holden; &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (1975), fleeing devil worshippers with Warren Oates (another hit); &quot;92 in the Shade&quot; (1975), again with Oates, for writer-director Thomas McGuane; &quot;Killer Force&quot; (1976) for director Val Guest; &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976), a sequel to &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973), financed by AIP; &quot;Fighting Mad&quot; (1976), a reuniting with Roger Corman, directed by Jonathan Demme.

&quot;Outlaw Blues&quot; (1977) was a drama, with Fonda playing a musician opposite Susan Saint James. After some more action with &quot;High-Ballin&#x27;&quot; (1978), Fonda returned to directing, with the controversial drama &quot;Wanda Nevada&quot; (1979), wherein the 39-year-old Fonda starred as the &quot;love&quot; interest of the then 13-year-old Brooke Shields. His father, Henry Fonda, made a brief appearance as well, and it is the only film in which they performed together.

=== 1980s and 1990s===
Fonda was top billed in &quot;The Hostage Tower&quot; (1980), a television movie based on a story by Alistair MacLean. Fonda appeared in the hit film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981) as the &quot;chief biker&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek nod to his earlier motorcycle films. He also played a charismatic cult leader in &quot;Split Image&quot; (1982), a film that also starred James Woods, Karen Allen and Brian Dennehy. Despite the strong cast and positive reviews, the film failed to find an audience.

Fonda later appeared in a series of films in the 1980s of varying genres — &quot;Daijōbu, My Friend&quot; (1983), shot in Japan; &quot;Dance of the Dwarfs&quot; (1983); &quot;Peppermint Peace&quot; (1983), shot in Germany; &quot; Spasms&quot; (1983), a Canadian horror film with Oliver Reed; &quot;A Reason to Live&quot; (1985), a TV movie; &quot;Certain Fury&quot; (1985), with Tatum O&#x27;Neal; &quot;Mercenary Fighters&quot; (1988); &quot;Hawken&#x27;s Breed&quot; (1988), a Western; &quot;Sound&quot; (1988); &quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; (1989) with Liv Ullmann; and &quot;The Rose Garden&quot; (1989).

In the early 1990s Fonda also contributed to the script of &quot;Enemy&quot; (1990), in which he starred. He had the lead in &quot;Family Express&quot; (1991) and &quot;South Beach&quot; (1993), but then drifted into supporting roles in many independent films: &quot;Deadfall&quot; (1993), directed by Christopher Coppola; &quot;Bodies, Rest &amp; Motion&quot; (1993), starring his daughter Bridget; &quot;Molly &amp; Gina&quot; (1994) with Frances Fisher and Natasha Gregson; &quot;Love and a .45&quot; (1994) with Renée Zellweger; &quot;Nadja&quot; (1994), produced by David Lynch. He had a good supporting role in &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996) from John Carpenter and was in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1996). He also guest starred on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

After years of films of varying success, Fonda received high-profile critical recognition and universal praise for his performance in &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1997). He portrayed a taciturn North Florida beekeeper and Vietnam veteran who tries to save his son and granddaughter from a life of drug abuse. For his performance, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He had the lead in &quot;Painted Hero&quot; (1997). In 1998, Fonda starred in the TV movie &quot;The Tempest&quot;, based in part on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name. It was directed by Jack Bender and starred Fonda, John Glover, Harold Perrineau, and Katherine Heigl.

He played Frank O&#x27;Connor in &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot; (1998), a performance for which he received a Golden Globe Award in 2000, then appeared in the crime film &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999) as Terry Valentine, an aging rock music producer who accidentally kills his younger girlfriend. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh.

Fonda wrote an autobiography, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Dad&quot; (1998).

In the 1990s, Fonda appeared in an advertisement for American Express.

=== 2000s ===
Fonda&#x27;s work in the 2000s included parts in &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot; (2000), &quot;Second Skin&quot; (2000), &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000) &quot;Wooly Boys&quot; (2001), &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; (2001), &quot;The Maldonado Miracle&quot; (2003), &quot;Capital City&quot; (2004), &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; (2004), &quot;A Thief of Time&quot; (2004), &quot;Back When We Were Grownups&quot; (2004), &quot;Supernova&quot; (2005), and &quot;El cobrador: In God We Trust&quot; (2006).

In 2002, Fonda was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

In 2004, he provided the voice of aging hippie weed grower &quot;The Truth&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, which was one of the best-selling video games of all time.

In a 2007 interview, Fonda said that riding motorcycles helped him to focus, stating,

Fonda made a return to the big screen as the bounty hunter Byron McElroy in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (2007), a remake of the 1957 Western. He appeared with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. The film received two Academy Award nominations and positive reviews from critics. He also appeared in the last scenes of the biker comedy &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; as Damien Blade, founder of the biker gang Del Fuegos and father of Jack, played by Ray Liotta. Fonda also portrayed Mephistopheles, one of two main villains in the film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (also 2007). Although he wanted to play the character in the sequel, he was replaced by Ciarán Hinds.

He appeared in &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (2008), &quot;Japan&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Perfect Age of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (2009) and as &quot;The Roman&quot;, the main villain in &quot;The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day&quot; (also 2009), the sequel to &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;. Fonda also appeared on the television series &quot;Californication&quot;.

=== Later career ===

Fonda&#x27;s later appearances include &quot;American Bandits: Frank and Jesse James&quot; (2010) for Fred Olen Ray; &quot;The Trouble with Bliss&quot; (2011); episodes of &quot;&quot;; &quot;Smitty&quot; (2012); &quot;Harodim&quot; (2012); &quot;As Cool as I Am&quot; (2013); &quot;Copperhead&quot; (2013); &quot;The Ultimate Life&quot; (2013); &quot;The Harvest&quot; (2013); &quot;HR&quot; (2014); &quot;House of Bodies&quot; (2014); &quot;Jesse James: Lawman&quot; (2015); &quot;The Runner&quot; (2015) with Nicolas Cage; &quot;The Ballad of Lefty Brown&quot; (2017); &quot;The Most Hated Woman in America&quot; (2017); &quot;Borderland&quot; (2017); &quot;You Can&#x27;t Say No&quot; (2018); and &quot;Boundaries&quot; (2018) with Christopher Plummer. He was an executive producer of the documentary &quot;The Big Fix&quot; (2012).

His final portrayal was in the Vietnam War movie &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot;, whose director Todd Robinson, has recounted that Peter Fonda was able to view that film in its entirety before his death, and got emotional upon viewing it.

== Honors ==
In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

== Personal life ==
Fonda was married three times, he married his first wife Susan Brewer in 1961; together they had three children, Bridget, Justin &amp; Thomas McGuane (step son). They divorced in 1974 after 13 years of marriage. Fonda married his second wife Portia Rebecca Crockett, in 1975. The marriage lasted for 36 years until they divorced in 2011. Fonda married his third wife Margaret DeVogelaere, in 2011. The marriage lasted for eight years until Fonda&#x27;s death in 2019.

=== Political views ===
In 2011, Fonda and Tim Robbins produced &quot;The Big Fix&quot;, a documentary that examined the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its effects on the Gulf of Mexico. At a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, Fonda stated that he had written to President Barack Obama about the spill and attacked him as a &quot;fucking traitor&quot; for allowing &quot;foreign boots on our soil telling our military—in this case the Coast Guard—what they can and could not do, and telling us, the citizens of the United States, what we could or could not do.

In June 2018, Fonda went on Twitter to criticize President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration&#x27;s enforcement of U.S. immigration policy by Jeff Sessions for separating children from their parents at the Mexican border, writing that &quot;We should rip Barron Trump from the arms of First Lady Melania Trump and put him in a cage with pedophiles.&quot; He also suggested that Americans should seek out names of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in order to protest outside of their homes and the schools of their children. The Secret Service opened an investigation based on a report from the Trump family. Huckabee&#x27;s daughter, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was also the object of Fonda&#x27;s tweets, in which he suggested that &quot;Maybe we should take her (Sanders&#x27;) children away...&quot;

In another later deleted tweet, Fonda targeted United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen by calling her a &quot;vulgar&quot; name and calling for Nielsen to be &quot;put in a cage and poked at by passersby ...&quot;

Fonda stated that he deleted his tweet regarding Barron Trump, saying that he &quot;immediately regretted it and sincerely apologize to the family for what I said and any hurt my words have caused.&quot; Backlash to Fonda&#x27;s tweets resulted in a call for a boycott of his newest film, &quot;Boundaries&quot;, and other Sony projects. Sony Pictures released &quot;Boundaries&quot; as planned on June 22, 2018, but released a statement stating that Fonda&#x27;s comments &quot;are abhorrent, reckless and dangerous, and we condemn them completely.&quot;

== Death ==
Fonda died from respiratory failure caused by lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles on August 16, 2019, at the age of 79.

Following Fonda&#x27;s death, his older sister Jane Fonda made the following statement: &quot;I am very sad. He was my sweet-hearted baby younger brother, the talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing.&quot;

<doc id="171550" wikidata="Q2060364" url="?curid=171550" title="Ulee's Gold">
<text>Ulee&#x27;s Gold is a 1997 American drama film written and directed by Victor Nuñez and starring Peter Fonda. Co-stars include Patricia Richardson, Christine Dunford, Tom Wood, Jessica Biel, J. Kenneth Campbell and Vanessa Zima. It was released by Orion Pictures, with Jonathan Demme receiving presenter credits for his role in the film&#x27;s financing.

The film&#x27;s title refers both to the honey the main character Ulee produces as a beekeeper, particularly that made from the nectar of the tupelo tree, and to the hidden money stolen by his son.

The film was the &quot;Centerpiece Premiere&quot; at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. Fonda won a Golden Globe Award for his performance and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Van Morrison sings &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; (the title song of his 1971 album) over the end credits.

==Plot==
Ulee Jackson is a widowed beekeeper in Wewahitchka, Florida. His son Jimmy is in prison following a botched bank robbery and Jimmy&#x27;s wife, Helen, has abandoned their two daughters and is living in Orlando. Ulee&#x27;s stubborn independence prevents him from asking for help, and he has his hands full running his business and acting as surrogate parent to Casey and Penny. Casey is a rebellious teenager and Penny is a timid 10-year-old who seems confused by her parents&#x27; absence and the tension at home.

When Ulee visits Jimmy in prison, Jimmy tells him that Helen has turned up at the Orlando home of petty criminals Eddie Flowers and Ferris Dooley. They were Jimmy&#x27;s accomplices in the robbery, but were never caught. Now they say Helen is sick, and Jimmy asks Ulee to bring her home.

Ulee goes to pick up Helen, but it turns out what Eddie and Ferris really want is the stolen money that Jimmy allegedly hid after the robbery. Ulee agrees to ask Jimmy about it, and then takes Helen home. Helen&#x27;s &quot;illness&quot; is actually drug addiction and, while she is almost comatose on the way home, she becomes violent and belligerent as she wakes up near the house. Ulee&#x27;s tenant and next door neighbor, a divorced nurse named Connie, is brought into the home by a frightened Penny, and over the next few days helps Helen through her drug withdrawal.

Meanwhile, Ulee learns that Jimmy hid the bank money in an ice chest under a wrecked pick-up truck left to rust in the swamp. He tells Eddie and Ferris he will bring the money to Orlando in a few days, but they decide they cannot wait and take Helen, Casey, and Penny hostage in Ulee&#x27;s home. They are then tied up and left in the house as Eddie and Ferris force Ulee at gunpoint to take them to the money. As they are leaving Ulee&#x27;s house, with Ulee driving, Ulee, uncharacteristically, makes the tires squeal. The unusual sound is enough to get the attention of Connie, who walks over to the house, finds the bound women and releases them. Most likely, she also calls the sheriff to alert him to Eddie and Ferris&#x27; actions. After the money has been retrieved, Ulee has an opportunity to kick the pistol into the swamp. The two criminals ride with Ulee back into town, then Eddie, angry about the lost gun, stabs him in the parking lot when they arrive. As Ulee stumbles away bleeding, Eddie and Ferris drive off but are pulled over almost immediately by the sheriff.

In a newly hopeful Jackson household, Helen has stepped back into her role as a mother, and Jimmy expects to be paroled soon. Ulee is happy to return to his bees, but has mixed feelings about giving up some of his responsibilities, as Jimmy has asked to work with Ulee. As he recovers from his wound he begins work on expanding his business to accommodate Jimmy&#x27;s return, and seems to finally be taking a romantic interest in Connie.

==Production==
Nuñez used the Lanier family, a third-generation beekeeping family in Wewahitchka, Florida as &quot;bee consultants&quot; for the film; the Lanier family swamp lands and bee yards served as filming locations, with some members of the family appearing as extras in the film. Other filming locations were Orlando, Carrabelle, Apalachicola and Port St. Joe in Florida. &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; was filmed during the late summer/early autumn of 1996.

During a 1997 interview held in Melbourne, Fonda commented on the character he portrayed:

The film would help revive Fonda&#x27;s career.

==Reception==
&quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; was well received by critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 51 critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Led by an outstanding Peter Fonda performance, &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; movingly depicts a family in crisis -- and a patriarch willing to sacrifice for the good of others.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 77 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Andrew Johnston wrote in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;: &quot;The plot poses ample opportunities for cliches, all of which Nunez deftly avoids. The characters are wonderfully drawn and bring out the best in the actors —the taciturn Fonda often seems to be channeling his father, and Richardson proves she&#x27;s too talented to be wasting her time on &quot;Home Improvement&quot;&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy described the film as a &quot;gem of rare emotional depth and integrity&quot;. Roger Ebert of 
the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3.5 out of 4, and wrote: &quot;Peter Fonda here reveals a depth of talent we did not suspect.&quot;

<text>Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (; September 20, 1789 – March 17, 1866) also known as the Tzemach Tzedek (Hebrew: &quot;Righteous Sprout&quot; or &quot;Righteous Scion&quot;) was an Orthodox rabbi, leading 19th-century posek, and the third rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement.

== Biography ==

Menachem Mendel Schneersohn was born in Liozna, on September 20, 1789 (September 9 OS). His mother Devorah Leah died three years later, and her father Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi raised him as his own son. He married his first cousin Chaya Mushka Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Schneuri. After his father-in-law/uncle&#x27;s death, and a three-year interregnum during which he tried to persuade the Hasidim to accept his brother-in-law Menachem-Nachum Schneuri or his uncle Chaim-Avraham as their leader, he assumed the leadership of Lubavitch on the eve of Shavuot 5591 (May 5, 1831, OS).

He was known as the Tzemach Tzedek after the title of a voluminous compendium of Halakha (Jewish law) that he authored. He also authored &quot;Derech Mitzvotecha&quot; (&quot;Way of Your Commandments&quot;), a mystical exposition of the &quot;Mitzvos&quot;. He compiled major works of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi for publication, including the &quot;Siddur L&#x27;Kol Ha&#x27;Shanah&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Siddur Im Dach&quot;), &quot;Likutei Torah&quot; and &quot;Torah Ohr&quot;. He also authored a philosophical text entitled &quot;Sefer Chakira: Derech Emuna&quot; (&quot;Book of Philosophy: The Way of Faith&quot;).

He enjoyed close ties with other Jewish leaders. In the course of his battle against the &quot;Haskalah&quot; in Russia, he forged a close alliance with Rabbi Yitzchak of Valozhyn, a major leader of the misnagdim, which led to warmer relations between them and the Hasidim.

According to Baruch Epstein, his father Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein spent six months under the Schneersohn&#x27;s tutelage, and learned most of his mystical knowledge during that time. This story is disputed by Hassidic historian Yehoshua Mondshine. Historian Eitam Henkin suggests that Rabbi Y. M. Epstein did meet with him, but only a few visits over a week or two, noting the testimony of Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon that he heard about this directly from his teacher. 

His close friendship with Professor J Berstenson, the Czar&#x27;s court physician, often helped the delicate negotiations relating to the welfare of the community. He set up an organisation called &quot;Hevras Techiyas Hameisim&quot; to assist Jewish boy-soldiers who were being recruited and converted to Christianity by the Russian army. These soldiers known as Cantonists were taken away from the Jewish community to other villages. Schneersohn arranged for his students to pay them regular visits to keep up their spirits and discourage them from converting.

In 1844–45 he took steps to increase the enrollment and viability of the Lubavitch yeshivas in Dubroŭna, Pasana, Lyozno, and Kalisz, expanding their enrollment to around 600 students in total.
Repeated attempts by the authorities to entrap him using informers such as Hershel Hodesh, Benjamin the Apostate and Lipman Feldman failed.

== Death and legacy ==
He died in Lubavitch on March 17, 1866, at the age of 76, leaving seven sons. He was succeeded by his youngest son, Shmuel as the Rebbe of Lubavitch, while three of his other sons formed breakaways of the Chabad movement which continue to some extent even today.

Several of his sons established Chasidic dynasties.

== Sons ==
He had seven sons:

1. Rabbi Baruch Shalom (1805–1869) did not become a rebbe in his own right; he chose to remain in Lubavitch and become a chasid of his youngest brother. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch, was his great-great-grandson.

2. Rabbi Yehuda Leib Schneersohn (Maharil) (1808–1866) settled in Kopys a few months after the death of his father, where he founded the Kopust branch of Chabad. He died two months later. He had three sons:
* Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Schneersohn (1830–1900), oldest son of Rabbi Yehuda Leib, assumed his father&#x27;s position in Kopust. He is the author of a work on Hasidism titled &quot;Magen Avot&quot; (&quot;Shield of the Fathers&quot;).
* Rabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn of Rechitsa (d. 1908), known as the Rashab of Rechitsa. Succeeding his brother, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman, Rabbi Shalom Dovber served as the Kopuster movement&#x27;s rebbe in the town of Rechitsa. Rabbi Shalom Dovber seems to have died without a successor.
* Rabbi Shmaryahu Noah Schneersohn (1842–1924), known as Shmaryahu Noah of Babruysk. Succeeding his brother, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman, Rabbi Shmaryahu Noah served as the Kopuster movement&#x27;s rebbe in the town of Babruysk. He was rav of the chasidim in Babruysk from 1872, and founded a yeshiva there in 1901. He authored a two volume work on Hasidism, titled &quot;Shemen LaMaor&quot; (&quot;Light for the Luminary&quot;).

3. Rabbi Chaim Schneur Zalman (1814–1880) was Rebbe in Lyady after his father died. He founded the Liadi branch of Chabad. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Yitzchak Dovber (1835–1910) of Liadi, author of &quot;Siddur Maharid&quot;, and his son-in-law, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak (d. 1905) of Siratin, a scion of the Rebbe of Radzimin.

4. Rabbi Yisroel Noach (1815–1883) of Nizhyn founded the Niezhin branch of Chabad. Although officially a Rebbe, he had only a small following. He had no successor. His son was Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Kischinev, whose daughter, Nechama Dina Schneersohn, married Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.

5. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak (1822–1876) was a Rebbe in Ovruch. He founded the Avrutch branch of Chabad. He was compelled to assume this position by his father-in-law, Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel of Cherkas (son of Rabbi Mordechai of Chernobyl and son-in-law of the Mitteler Rebbe) against his father&#x27;s wishes. His daughter, Shterna Sarah, married the Rebbe Rashab. Thus, he was the maternal grandfather and namesake of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.

6. Rabbi Yaakov, although leaving descendants, died at quite a young age. He lived in Orsha. Little is known about him.

7. Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (Maharash) (1834–1882) of Lubavitch, his youngest son, succeeded him as the Rebbe of Lubavitch.

<text>Collision detection is the computational problem of detecting an intersection of two or more objects in virtual space. More precisely, it deals with the questions of &quot;if&quot;, &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot; two or more objects intersect. Collision detection is a classic problem of computational geometry with applications in computer graphics, physical simulation, video games, robotics (including autonomous driving) and computational physics. Collision detection algorithms can be divided into operating on 2D or 3D spatial objects.

== Overview ==
Collision detection is closely linked to calculating the distance between objects, as two objects (or more) intersect when the distance between them reaches zero or even becomes negative. Negative distance indicates that one object has penetrated another. Performing collision detection requires more context than just the distance between the objects.

Accurately identifying the points of contact on both objects&#x27; surfaces is also essential for the computation of a physically accurate collision response. The complexity of this task increases with the level of detail in the objects&#x27; representations: the more intricate the model, the greater the computational cost.

Collision detection frequently involves dynamic objects, adding a temporal dimension to distance calculations. Instead of simply measuring distance between static objects, collision detection algorithms often aim to determine whether the objects’ motion will bring them to a point in time when their distance is zero—an operation that adds significant computational overhead.

In collision detection involving multiple objects, a naive approach would require detecting collisions for all pairwise combinations of objects. As the number of objects increases, the number of required comparisons grows rapidly: for formula_1 objects, formula_2 intersection tests are needed with a naive approach. This quadratic growth makes such an approach computationally expensive as formula_1 increases.

Due to the complexity mentioned above, collision detection is computationally intensive process. Nevertheless, it is essential for interactive applications like video games, robotics, and real-time physics engines. To manage these computational demands, extensive efforts have gone into optimizing collision detection algorithms.

A commonly used approach towards accelerating the required computations is to divide the process into two phases: the broad phase and the narrow phase. The broad phase aims to answer the question of whether objects might collide, using a conservative but efficient approach to rule out pairs that clearly do not intersect, thus avoiding unnecessary calculations.

Objects that cannot be definitively separated in the broad phase are passed to the narrow phase. Here, more precise algorithms determine whether these objects actually intersect. If they do, the narrow phase often calculates the exact time and location of the intersection.

== Broad phase ==
This phase aims at quickly finding objects or parts of objects for which it can be quickly determined that no further collision test is needed. A useful property of such approach is that it is output sensitive. In the context of collision detection this means that the time complexity of the collision detection is proportional to the number of objects that are close to each other. An early example of that is the I-COLLIDE where the number of required narrow phase collision tests was formula_4 where formula_1 is the number of objects and formula_6 is the number of objects at close proximity. This is a significant improvement over the quadratic complexity of the naive approach.

=== Spatial partitioning ===
Several approaches can grouped under the spatial partitioning umbrella, which includes octrees (for 3D), quadtrees (for 2D), binary space partitioning (or BSP trees) and other, similar approaches. If one splits space into a number of simple cells, and if two objects can be shown not to be in the same cell, then they need not be checked for intersection. Dynamic scenes and deformable objects require updating the partitioning which can add overhead.

===Bounding volume hierarchy===
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) a tree structure over a set of bounding volumes. Collision is determined by doing a tree traversal starting from the root. If the bounding volume of the root doesn&#x27;t intersect with the object of interest, the traversal can be stopped. If, however there is an intersection, the traversal proceeds and checks the branches for each there is an intersection. Branches for which there is no intersection with the bounding volume can be culled from further intersection test. Therefore, multiple objects can be determined to not intersect at once. BVH can be used with deformable objects such as cloth or soft-bodies but the volume hierarchy has to be adjusted as the shape deforms. For deformable objects we need to be concerned about self-collisions or self intersections. BVH can be used for that end as well. Collision between two objects is computed by computing intersection between the bounding volumes of the root of the tree as there are collision we dive into the sub-trees that intersect. Exact collisions between the actual objects, or its parts (often triangles of a triangle mesh) need to be computed only between intersecting leaves. The same approach works for pair wise collision and self-collisions.

=== Exploiting temporal coherence ===
During the broad-phase, when the objects in the world move or deform, the data-structures used to cull collisions have to be updated. In cases where the changes between two frames or time-steps are small and the objects can be approximated well with axis-aligned bounding boxes, the sweep and prune algorithm can be a suitable approach.

Several key observation make the implementation efficient: Two bounding-boxes intersect if, and only if, there is overlap along all three axes; overlap can be determined, for each axis separately, by sorting the intervals for all the boxes; and lastly, between two frames updates are typically small (making sorting algorithms optimized for almost-sorted lists suitable for this application). The algorithm keeps track of currently intersecting boxes, and as objects move, re-sorting the intervals helps keep track of the status.

=== Pairwise pruning ===
Once we&#x27;ve selected a pair of physical bodies for further investigation, we need to check for collisions more carefully. However, in many applications, individual objects (if they are not too deformable) are described by a set of smaller primitives, mainly triangles. So now, we have two sets of triangles, formula_7 and formula_8 (for simplicity, we will assume that each set has the same number of triangles.)

The obvious thing to do is to check all triangles formula_9 against all triangles formula_10 for collisions, but this involves formula_11 comparisons, which is highly inefficient. If possible, it is desirable to use a pruning algorithm to reduce the number of pairs of triangles we need to check.

The most widely used family of algorithms is known as the &quot;hierarchical bounding volumes&quot; method. As a preprocessing step, for each object (in our example, formula_12 and formula_13) we will calculate a hierarchy of bounding volumes. Then, at each time step, when we need to check for collisions between formula_12 and formula_13, the hierarchical bounding volumes are used to reduce the number of pairs of triangles under consideration. For simplicity, we will give an example using bounding spheres, although it has been noted that spheres are undesirable in many cases.

If formula_16 is a set of triangles, we can pre-calculate a bounding sphere formula_17. There are many ways of choosing formula_17, we only assume that formula_17 is a sphere that completely contains formula_16 and is as small as possible.

Ahead of time, we can compute formula_21 and formula_22. Clearly, if these two spheres do not intersect (and that is very easy to test), then neither do formula_12 and formula_13. This is not much better than an &quot;n&quot;-body pruning algorithm, however.

If formula_25 is a set of triangles, then we can split it into two halves formula_26 and formula_27. We can do this to formula_12 and formula_13, and we can calculate (ahead of time) the bounding spheres formula_30 and formula_31. The hope here is that these bounding spheres are much smaller than formula_21 and formula_22. And, if, for instance, formula_21 and formula_35 do not intersect, then there is no sense in checking any triangle in formula_12 against any triangle in formula_37.

As a precomputation, we can take each physical body (represented by a set of triangles) and recursively decompose it into a binary tree, where each node formula_38 represents a set of triangles, and its two children represent formula_39 and formula_40. At each node in the tree, we can pre-compute the bounding sphere formula_41.

When the time comes for testing a pair of objects for collision, their bounding sphere tree can be used to eliminate many pairs of triangles.

Many variants of the algorithms are obtained by choosing something other than a sphere for formula_22. If one chooses axis-aligned bounding boxes, one gets AABBTrees. Oriented bounding box trees are called OBBTrees. Some trees are easier to update if the underlying object changes. Some trees can accommodate higher order primitives such as splines instead of simple triangles.

== Narrow phase ==
Objects that cannot be definitively separated in the broad phase are passed to the narrow phase. In this phase, the objects under consideration are relatively close to each other. Still, attempts to quickly determine if a full intersection is needed are employed first. This step is sometimes referred to as mid-phase. Once these tests passed (e.g. the pair of objects may be colliding) more precise algorithms determine whether these objects actually intersect. If they do, the narrow phase often calculates the exact time and location of the intersection.

===Bounding volumes===
A quick way to potentially avoid a needless expensive computation is to check if the bounding volume enclosing the two objects intersect. If they don&#x27;t, there is no need to check the actual objects. However, if the bounding volumes do intersect, the more expensive computation has to be performed. In order for the bounding-volume test to add value, two properties need to be balanced: a) the cost of intersecting the bounding volume needs to be low and b) the bounding volume needs to be tight enough so that the number of &#x27;false positive&#x27; intersection will be low. A false positive intersection in this case means that the bounding volumes intersect but the actual objects do not. Different bounding volume types offer different trade-offs for these properties.

Axis-Align Bounding Boxes (AABB) and cuboids are popular due to their simplicity and quick intersection tests. Bounding volumes such as Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB), K-DOPs and Convex-hulls offer a tighter approximation of the enclosed shape at the expense of a more elaborate intersection test.

Bounding volumes are typically used in the early (pruning) stage of collision detection, so that only objects with overlapping bounding volumes need be compared in detail. Computing collision or overlap between bounding volumes involves additional computations, therefore, in order for it to beneficial we need the bounding volume to be relatively tight and the computation overhead to due the collisions to be low.

=== Exact pairwise collision detection ===
Objects for which pruning approaches could not rule out the possibility of a collision have to undergo an exact collision detection computation.

==== Collision detection between convex objects ====
According to the separating planes theorem, for any two disjoint convex objects, there exists a plane so that one object lies completely on one side of that plane, and the other object lies on the opposite side of that plane. This property allows the development of efficient collision detection algorithms between convex objects. Several algorithms are available for finding the closest points on the surface of two convex polyhedral objects - and determining collision. Early work by Ming C. Lin that used a variation on the simplex algorithm from linear programming and the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm are two such examples. These algorithms approach constant time when applied repeatedly to pairs of stationary or slow-moving objects, and every step is initialized from the previous collision check.

The result of all this algorithmic work is that collision detection can be done efficiently for thousands of moving objects in real time on typical personal computers and game consoles.

=== A priori pruning ===
Where most of the objects involved are fixed, as is typical of video games, a priori methods using precomputation can be used to speed up execution.

Pruning is also desirable here, both &quot;n&quot;-body pruning and pairwise pruning, but the algorithms must take time and the types of motions used in the underlying physical system into consideration.

When it comes to the exact pairwise collision detection, this is highly trajectory dependent, and one almost has to use a numerical root-finding algorithm to compute the instant of impact.

As an example, consider two triangles moving in time formula_43 and formula_44. At any point in time, the two triangles can be checked for intersection using the twenty planes previously mentioned. However, we can do better, since these twenty planes can all be tracked in time. If formula_45 is the plane going through points formula_46 in formula_47 then there are twenty planes formula_48 to track. Each plane needs to be tracked against three vertices, this gives sixty values to track. Using a root finder on these sixty functions produces the exact collision times for the two given triangles and the two given trajectory. We note here that if the trajectories of the vertices are assumed to be linear polynomials in formula_49 then the final sixty functions are in fact cubic polynomials, and in this exceptional case, it is possible to locate the exact collision time using the formula for the roots of the cubic. Some numerical analysts suggest that using the formula for the roots of the cubic is not as numerically stable as using a root finder for polynomials.

=== Triangle centroid segments ===
A triangle mesh object is commonly used in 3D body modeling. Normally the collision function is a triangle to triangle intercept or a bounding shape associated with the mesh. A triangle centroid is a center of mass location such that it would balance on a pencil tip. The simulation need only add a centroid dimension to the physics parameters. Given centroid points in both object and target it is possible to define the line segment connecting these two points.

The position vector of the centroid of a triangle is the average of the position vectors of its vertices. So if its vertices have Cartesian coordinates formula_50, formula_51 and formula_52 then the centroid is formula_53.

Here is the function for a line segment distance between two 3D points. formula_54

Here the length/distance of the segment is an adjustable &quot;hit&quot; criteria size of segment. As the objects approach the length decreases to the threshold value. A triangle sphere becomes the effective geometry test. A sphere centered at the centroid can be sized to encompass all the triangle&#x27;s vertices.

== Usage ==

=== Collision detection in computer simulation ===

Physical simulators differ in the way they react on a collision. Some use the softness of the material to calculate a force, which will resolve the collision in the following time steps like it is in reality. This is very CPU intensive for low softness materials. Some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation, roll back the simulation, and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws.

Some iterate the linear interpolation (Newton&#x27;s method) to calculate the time of collision with a much higher precision than the rest of the simulation. Collision detection utilizes time coherence to allow even finer time steps without much increasing CPU demand, such as in air traffic control.

After an inelastic collision, special states of sliding and resting can occur and, for example, the Open Dynamics Engine uses constraints to simulate them. Constraints avoid inertia and thus instability. Implementation of rest by means of a scene graph avoids drift.

In other words, physical simulators usually function one of two ways: where the collision is detected &quot;a posteriori&quot; (after the collision occurs) or &quot;a priori&quot; (before the collision occurs). In addition to the &quot;a posteriori&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; distinction, almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms. Often the terms &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; are used rather than &quot;a posteriori&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot;.

==== &quot;A posteriori&quot; (discrete) versus &quot;a priori&quot; (continuous) ====

In the &quot;a posteriori&quot; case, the physical simulation is advanced by a small step, then checked to see if any objects are intersecting or visibly considered intersecting. At each simulation step, a list of all intersecting bodies is created, and the positions and trajectories of these objects are &quot;fixed&quot; to account for the collision. This method is called &quot;a posteriori&quot; because it typically misses the actual instant of collision, and only catches the collision after it has actually happened.

In the &quot;a priori&quot; methods, there is a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies. The instants of collision are calculated with high precision, and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate. This is called &quot;a priori&quot; because the collision detection algorithm calculates the instants of collision before it updates the configuration of the physical bodies.

The main benefits of the &quot;a posteriori&quot; methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need not be aware of the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn&#x27;t need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies. In addition, the &quot;a posteriori&quot; algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the &quot;a priori&quot; algorithms. An &quot;a priori&quot; algorithm must deal with the time variable, which is absent from the &quot;a posteriori&quot; problem.

On the other hand, &quot;a posteriori&quot; algorithms cause problems in the &quot;fixing&quot; step, where intersections (which aren&#x27;t physically correct) need to be corrected. Moreover, if the discrete step is too large, the collision could go undetected, resulting in an object which passes through another if it is sufficiently fast or small.

The benefits of the &quot;a priori&quot; algorithms are increased fidelity and stability. It is difficult (but not completely impossible) to separate the physical simulation from the collision detection algorithm. However, in all but the simplest cases, the problem of determining ahead of time when two bodies will collide (given some initial data) has no closed form solution—a numerical root finder is usually involved.

Some objects are in &quot;resting contact&quot;, that is, in collision, but neither bouncing off, nor interpenetrating, such as a vase resting on a table. In all cases, resting contact requires special treatment: If two objects collide (&quot;a posteriori&quot;) or slide (&quot;a priori&quot;) and their relative motion is below a threshold, friction becomes stiction and both objects are arranged in the same branch of the scene graph.

=== Video games ===
Video games have to split their very limited computing time between several tasks. Despite this resource limit, and the use of relatively primitive collision detection algorithms, programmers have been able to create believable, if inexact, systems for use in games.

For a long time, video games had a very limited number of objects to treat, and so checking all pairs was not a problem. In two-dimensional games, in some cases, the hardware was able to efficiently detect and report overlapping pixels between sprites on the screen. In other cases, simply tiling the screen and binding each &quot;sprite&quot; into the tiles it overlaps provides sufficient pruning, and for pairwise checks, bounding rectangles or circles called hitboxes are used and deemed sufficiently accurate.

Three-dimensional games have used spatial partitioning methods for formula_1-body pruning, and for a long time used one or a few spheres per actual 3D object for pairwise checks. Exact checks are very rare, except in games attempting to simulate reality closely. Even then, exact checks are not necessarily used in all cases.

Because games do not need to mimic actual physics, stability is not as much of an issue. Almost all games use &quot;a posteriori&quot; collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules. For instance, if a character becomes embedded in a wall, they might be simply moved back to their last known good location. Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow them to move that far.

In many cases for video games, approximating the characters by a point is sufficient for the purpose of collision detection with the environment. In this case, binary space partitioning trees provide a viable, efficient and simple algorithm for checking if a point is embedded in the scenery or not. Such a data structure can also be used to handle &quot;resting position&quot; situation gracefully when a character is running along the ground. Collisions between characters, and collisions with projectiles and hazards, are treated separately.

A robust simulator is one that will react to any input in a reasonable way. For instance, if we imagine a high speed racecar video game, from one simulation step to the next, it is conceivable that the cars would advance a substantial distance along the race track. If there is a shallow obstacle on the track (such as a brick wall), it is not entirely unlikely that the car will completely leap over it, and this is very undesirable. In other instances, the &quot;fixing&quot; that posteriori algorithms require isn&#x27;t implemented correctly, resulting in bugs that can trap characters in walls or allow them to pass through them and fall into an endless void where there may or may not be a deadly bottomless pit, sometimes referred to as &quot;black hell&quot;, &quot;blue hell&quot;, or &quot;green hell&quot;, depending on the predominant color. These are the hallmarks of a failing collision detection and physical simulation system. &quot;Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&quot; is an infamous example of a game with a failing or possibly missing collision detection system.

==== Hitbox ====
A hitbox is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection; it is a type of bounding box. It is often a rectangle (in 2D games) or cuboid (in 3D) that is attached to and follows a point on a visible object (such as a model or a sprite). Circular or spheroidial shapes are also common, though they are still most often called &quot;boxes&quot;. It is common for animated objects to have hitboxes attached to each moving part to ensure accuracy during motion.

Hitboxes are used to detect &quot;one-way&quot; collisions such as a character being hit by a punch or a bullet. They are unsuitable for the detection of collisions with feedback (e.g. bumping into a wall) due to the difficulty experienced by both humans and AI in managing a hitbox&#x27;s ever-changing locations; these sorts of collisions are typically handled with much simpler axis-aligned bounding boxes instead. Players may use the term &quot;hitbox&quot; to refer to these types of interactions regardless.

A hurtbox is a hitbox used to detect incoming sources of damage. In this context, the term &quot;hitbox&quot; is typically reserved for those which deal damage. For example, an attack may only land if the hitbox around an attacker&#x27;s punch connects with one of the opponent&#x27;s hurtboxes on their body, while opposing hitboxes colliding may result in the players trading or cancelling blows, and opposing hurtboxes do not interact with each other. The term is not standardized across the industry; some games reverse their definitions of &quot;hitbox&quot; and &quot;hurtbox&quot;, while others only use &quot;hitbox&quot; for both sides.

<doc id="171554" wikidata="Q76318" url="?curid=171554" title="Rogers Centre">
<text>Rogers Centre (originally SkyDome) is a retractable roof stadium in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated at the base of the CN Tower near the northern shore of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1989 on the former Railway Lands, it is home to the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). As well as being improved over the decades, during the MLB offseasons of 2022–24, the stadium was renovated by upgrading the sports facilities and hospitality whilst reducing the capacity for baseball games. While it is primarily a sports venue, the stadium also hosts other large events such as conventions, trade fairs, concerts, travelling carnivals, circuses and monster truck shows.

Previously, the stadium was also home to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. The stadium served as the site of both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2015 Pan American Games (renamed the Pan-Am Dome or Pan-Am Ceremonies Venue due to sponsorship regulations).

The stadium was renamed &quot;Rogers Centre&quot; following the 2005 purchase of the stadium by Rogers Communications, the corporation that also owns the Toronto Blue Jays. The venue is noted for being the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized roof, as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it with 70 rooms overlooking the field. It is the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both football and baseball.

== History ==

===Background and design===
The idea of building a domed stadium can be traced back to the bid that Toronto lost to Montreal as the Canadian candidate city for the 1976 Summer Olympics. In the proposal, an 80,000–100,000 seat complex would be part of the planned Harbour City development on the site of Maple Leaf Stadium.

The contemporary impetus for building an enclosed sports venue in Toronto came following the Grey Cup game in November 1982, held at the outdoor Exhibition Stadium. The game, in which the hometown Toronto Argonauts (also known as the Argos) were making their first Grey Cup appearance since 1971, was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, leading the media to call it &quot;the Rain Bowl&quot;. As many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was Bill Davis, the Premier of Ontario, and the poor conditions were seen by the largest television audience in Canada (over 7.862 million viewers) to that point. The following day, at a rally for the Argos at Toronto City Hall, tens of thousands of people who attended the game began to chant, &quot;We want a dome! We want a dome!&quot;

Seven months later, in June 1983, Davis formally announced a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at Exhibition Place. The committee consisted of Paul Godfrey, Larry Grossman and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.

The committee examined various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to BC Place in Vancouver. In 1985, an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, Downsview Airport, and York University. The final site was at the base of the CN Tower not far from Union Station, a major railway and transit hub. The Railway Lands were a major Canadian National Railway rail switching yard encompassing the CNR Spadina Roundhouse (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes CityPlace). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.

The stadium was designed by architect Rod Robbie and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed by the EllisDon Construction company of London, Ontario and the Dominion Bridge Company of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium&#x27;s construction lasted about years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was C$570 million ($ in dollars) which was paid for by the federal government, Ontario provincial government, the City of Toronto, and a large consortium of corporations.

=== Financing ===
The stadium was funded by a public–private partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the cost. The initial cost of $150 million was greatly underestimated, as the final cost was C$570 million ($ in dollars). Two levels of government (Metro Toronto and provincial) each initially contributed $30 million ($ in dollars). This does not include the value of the land that the stadium sits on, which was owned by the Canada Lands Company (a Crown corporation of Canada) and the City of Toronto and was leased for $900,000 a year through 2088. Canada&#x27;s three main breweries (Labatt&#x27;s, Molson, and Carling O&#x27;Keefe) and the Toronto Blue Jays each paid $5 million ($ in dollars) to help fund the stadium. An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected by invitation only) also contributed $5 million, for which they received one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an opportunity for renewal) and a 99-year exclusive option on stadium advertising. The initial cost of leasing a Skybox ranged from $150,000 to $225,000 ($ to $ in dollars) a year in 1989 – plus the cost of tickets for all events.

The then unusual financing structure created controversy. First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, companies that paid the $5 million fee, such as Coca-Cola, TSN and CIBC, received 100 percent stadium exclusivity, including advertising rights, for the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99 years. Third, the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning there was some doubt the contracts were made at a market rate: Pepsi stated at the time that had it known the terms of the contract it would have paid far more than $5 million for the rights. Local media like &quot;NOW Magazine&quot; called the amount charged to the companies &quot;scandalously low&quot;.

=== Construction ===
Construction of the &quot;Ontario Stadium Project&quot; was spearheaded by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the John Street pumping station across the street to the south of the stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility (in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on its new location had yet to be completed.

Because the stadium was the first of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move the roof. It was important the design would work and be reliable as to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. The 31-storey-high roof consists of four panels: one (on the north end) is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven &#x27;train&#x27; engines, that run on high-strength railway rails. The roof, which takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane.

Because of its location south of the major railway corridor, new pedestrian connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason for the high cost of the stadium. The SkyWalk is an approximately enclosed walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects to Union Station (and is part of the Path network). The John Street cable-stayed bridge was built to provide north–south passage over the rail tracks, linking Front Street with the stadium.

Construction at the site, which at one time was south of the shoreline, unearthed over 1,500 artifacts. These included a 200-year-old French cannon used as ballast for a ship, cannonballs, pottery and a telescope. The stadium was completed two months late, having been planned to open for the first regular season game of the 1989 Toronto Blue Jays season; the team played the first two months of its home schedule at Exhibition Stadium that year.

=== Naming ===

The official name prior to and during construction was the &#x27;Ontario Stadium Project&#x27; but was widely referred to in local media as simply &#x27;the Dome&#x27; or &#x27;Toronto Domed stadium&#x27;. As completion neared the name &quot;SkyDome&quot; was chosen as part of a province-wide &quot;name the stadium&quot; contest in 1987. Sponsored by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, ballots were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: &quot;Towerdome&quot;, &quot;Harbourdome&quot;, &quot;SkyDome&quot;, and simply &quot;the Dome&quot;. The judges&#x27; final selection was SkyDome. Premier David Peterson drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that proposed &quot;SkyDome&quot;. At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the crown corporation created to run SkyDome, commented: &quot;The sky is a huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite and that&#x27;s what this is all about.&quot; Kellie Watson received lifetime seating of choice at SkyDome, which is still honoured after the stadium was renamed to Rogers Centre, under new ownership.

=== Opening ===

The stadium officially opened on June 3, 1989, and hosted an official grand opening show: &quot;The Opening of SkyDome: A Celebration&quot;, broadcast on CBC Television the following evening hosted by Brian Williams. With a crowd of over 50,000 in attendance, the event included appearances by Alan Thicke, Oscar Peterson, Andrea Martin of &quot;SCTV&quot;, impressionist André-Philippe Gagnon and rock band Glass Tiger. The roof was ceremonially &quot;opened&quot; by Ontario Premier David Peterson (no relation to Oscar) with a laser pen. The roof&#x27;s opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants of &quot;close the roof&quot;, Magwood insisted the roof remain fully open.

=== Financial problems and fallout ===
The stadium became a thorn in the side of David Peterson&#x27;s Ontario Liberal government for repeated cost overruns. After the Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the 1990 Ontario election, a review by the new Bob Rae government in October 1990 revealed Stadco&#x27;s debt meant the Dome would have to be booked 600 days a year to turn a profit, almost twice as many days as there are days in a calendar year. The stadium income was only $17 million in its first year of operations, while debt service was $40 million. It was determined the abrupt late inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112 million to the cost of the building.

As the province slipped into a recession, Rae appointed University of Toronto professor Bruce Kidd and Canadian Auto Workers President Bob White to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium&#x27;s growing debt, but the original $165 million debt had increased to $400 million by 1993. Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government treasury and sold the stadium for $151 million to a private consortium that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays&#x27; owner.

In November 1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49 percent of total, filed for bankruptcy protection, triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers. Most of the 161 Skybox tenants had signed on for 10-year leases; a marked decrease in interest in the stadium&#x27;s teams and the construction of the Air Canada Centre, which hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, resulted in few renewals for Skybox leases. That same month, the Blue Jays re-signed for an additional ten years in the facility.

In April 1999, Sportsco International LP bought the stadium out of bankruptcy protection for $80 million.

=== Purchase and renaming ===

In November 2004, Rogers Communications, parent company of the Blue Jays, acquired SkyDome, excluding the attached SkyDome hotel, which had been sold to Renaissance for a reported $31 million in 1999, from Sportsco for about $25 million – roughly four percent of the cost of construction.

On February 2, 2005, Ted Rogers, President and CEO of Rogers Communications, announced a three-year corporate contract to change the name of SkyDome to Rogers Centre. The name change remains controversial and is unpopular with many fans, most of whom continue to refer to it as SkyDome in opposition to increased commercialism from the purchase of naming rights. One example is a 25,000-name petition started by TTC bus driver Randy Rajmoolie. A baseball diamond in Toronto&#x27;s Trinity Bellwoods Park is officially named SkyDome after the stadium&#x27;s former and popular name.

After the purchase, Rogers refurbished the stadium by, among other things, replacing the Jumbotron with a Daktronics video display, and erecting other new monitors, including several built into the outfield wall. They also installed a new FieldTurf artificial playing surface.

In May 2005, the Toronto Argonauts agreed to three five-year leases at Rogers Centre, which could have seen the Argonauts play out of Rogers Centre up to and including 2019. The team had the option to leave at the end of each of the three lease agreements. Proposed plans to lock Rogers Centre into its baseball configuration permanently in order to install a natural grass surface forced the Argonauts to relocate to BMO Field before the 2016 season.

In November 2005, Rogers Centre received a complete makeover to &quot;open&quot; the 100 Level concourse to the playing field and convert 43 luxury boxes to &quot;party suites&quot;. This required some seats to be removed, which decreased overall capacity.

In April 2006, Rogers Centre became one of the first buildings of its size to adopt a completely smoke-free policy in Canada, anticipating an act of provincial legislature that required all Ontario public places to go smoke-free by June 1, 2006.

Alcohol was not available to patrons of Rogers Centre on April 7, 2009, as the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) imposed the first of a three-day alcohol suspension at the stadium for &quot;infractions (that) took place at certain past events&quot;, according to the press release.

=== Major renovation in the 2020s ===
By 2020, with the Rogers Centre over 30 years old and one of the oldest stadiums in MLB, Rogers had begun to explore options for the long-term home of the team. Rogers Communications and Brookfield Asset Management reportedly discussed replacing Rogers Centre with a smaller, baseball-specific stadium plus residential towers, office buildings, retail stores and public space. The new venue would be constructed on the southern end of the current stadium and adjacent parking lots, while the mixed-use development would be built on the northern portion of the site. An alternate site was also been considered for a new baseball park at Quayside in Toronto&#x27;s east end next to Lake Ontario.

However, the Blue Jays instead decided to undertake a major $400 million renovation of the stadium&#x27;s interior in two phases, during the 20222023 and 20232024 offseasons. The objective of the renovations was to extend the ballpark&#x27;s shelf life by another 10–15 years, while continuing to plan for a new stadium or more significant rebuild of the Rogers Centre within the next 10 to 12 years.

====2022–2023====

The first phase of the renovations was designed by Populous and involved re-orienting outfield seats to face home plate, raising bullpens, adjusting the outfield dimensions to be asymmetrical, adding social spaces with bars in the outfield sections of the 500 Level (the highest level), and removing some seats to widen all remaining seats, thereby reducing capacity to 41,500 attendees. The 2023 Blue Jays home opener was moved a few days later to accommodate the first phase of the renovation.

====2023–2024====
The second phase involved re-orienting the infield seats to face home plate, the addition of cupholders to the seats in the 100 Level, as well as reducing the size of foul territory, improving the dugouts for the Blue Jays and their opponents, and the addition of LED backstop advertising to cover the entire backstop, which is much more visible during television broadcasts. Following the second phase, capacity of the stadium was reduced further to 39,150. The 2024 Blue Jays home opener was also moved a few days later to accommodate the second phase of the renovation.

=== List of improvements ===

Significant improvements to the facility since opening in 1989 include:
* Exterior roof lighting that can be programmed for themes and events.
* The Blue Jays clubhouse was substantially renovated, including a larger training room, an open concept lounge and personal lockers. In total, the clubhouse expanded from .
* Main level concourse expansion, making the space brighter, more fan-friendly with expanded wheelchair seating.
* The FieldTurf was upgraded to AstroTurf Gameday Grass for 2010.
* The main video board was upgraded in 2005, from a JumboTron to a modern Daktronics video board, measuring .
* Jays Shop – Stadium Edition, was expanded to an retail space along the main concourse (2007).
* Two video boards were built into the outfield fence that each measure . These boards provide player stats, out-of-town scores and other information related to the game and league.
* A continuous, ribbon-style video board was installed on the facing of the 300 Level, providing statistics and scores.
* Installation of 150 new flat-screen video monitors in the main- and second-level concourses, bringing the number of stadium monitors to around 300.
* Upgrade of the entire field lighting system in a two-month conversion process with all 840 of the 2,000-watt bowl lights replaced.
* A centre-field porch (later named the WestJet Flight Deck) in the 200 Level was added following the removal of the windows of the former Windows Restaurant (2013, $2 million).
* The AstroTurf Gameday Grass was upgraded to AstroTurf Gameday Grass 3D Extreme for the 2015 season.
* A full dirt infield was installed for for the previous six seasons, Rogers Centre was the only MLB ballpark with 
* A two-year, $10 million roof upgrade, completed for the 2017 season, updated the aging OT network and control system to speed up the opening and closing process, reduce monitoring staff requirements, and added a rooftop weather station to better predict incoming weather systems.
* A new AstroTurf field was installed prior to the 2021 season. The new turf is attached to the floor, so the stands will no longer be able to be rolled and will be permanently locked into baseball configuration.
* Further lighting and video board upgrades were made for the 2022 season.
* For the 2024 The Eras Tour by Taylor Swift, new antennas were installed in the Rogers Centre for 5G Wi-Fi, at a cost of $8 million. Also, the stadium street entrance was renamed “1 Taylor Swift Way” specifically for the concerts.

== Stadium features ==
The venue was the first major team sports stadium in North America with a functional, fully retractable roof (Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium also had a retractable roof, but due to operational issues, it was replaced with a permanent fixed roof). The roof is composed of four panels and covers an area of . The two middle panels slide laterally to stack over the north semi-circular panel, and then the south semi-circular panel rotates around the stadium and nests inside the stack. It takes 20 minutes for the roof to open or close. It is not possible to move the roof in cold weather because the mechanism that closes the roof could fail in cooler weather.

The original AstroTurf installation was replaced with FieldTurf from 2005 to 2010. The FieldTurf took about 40 hours to remove for events such as concerts or trade shows, as it used 1,400 trays that needed to be stacked and transported off the field. Prior to the 2010 baseball season, to reduce the amount of time required to convert the playing field, a new, roll-based version of AstroTurf was installed. Similar to FieldTurf, the installation uses a sand- and rubber-based infill within the synthetic fibres. Rogers Centre is one of five venues in Major League Baseball that use artificial turf (the others are Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, LoanDepot Park in Miami, Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, and Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona) and was the last venue to use &quot;sliding pits&quot; before switching to a full dirt infield for the 2016 baseball season. Before the Argonauts moved out, the pitcher&#x27;s mound could be lowered or raised hydraulically when converting from baseball to football (or vice versa).

The use of natural grass was long thought to be unfeasible since the stadium was designed as a closed structure with a roof that opens, and as such, the interior was not intended or built to deal with weather, including low temperatures and drainage. As of the 2020 season, they are one of two teams to have never played a home game on grass at their main stadium (the Tampa Bay Rays played some home games in 2007 and 2008 at Champion Stadium in Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and during the 2020 and much of the 2021 seasons, due to travel restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Toronto Blue Jays were playing most of their home games at their AAA affiliate&#x27;s home stadium of Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York with the Blue Jays also playing home games in TD Ballpark in Dunedin, Florida, during the first two months of the 2021 season). Along with Tropicana Field, the Rogers Centre warning track consists of brown turf, which does not provide any tactile differences from the rest of the field.

However, the Blue Jays have long explored the possibility of converting the Rogers Centre to a natural grass surface, and plans were examined in order to install a grass field by 2018 to allow enough time for research and growing of the sod. Installing grass would require digging up the floor, adding a drainage system, and installing of dirt. The stadium would need to be permanently locked into its baseball configuration; the lower stands, which roll into position for football, would be permanently fixed in position for baseball. The plan became more definite when Rogers renewed the Argonauts&#x27; lease through 2017, but ruled out any further extensions; in May 2015, it was announced the Argonauts would move to BMO Field for the 2016 season. The Blue Jays subsequently confirmed the Argonauts&#x27; early departure would not accelerate their own plans to install grass in 2018, though it did allow for a dirt infield to be installed for the 2016 season. However, it does not appear likely the field will be converted to natural grass, as no further announcements for replacing the surface have been made since, and the field continues to retain its artificial surface.

There are a total of 5,700 club seats and 161 luxury suites at the Rogers Centre. The complex had a Hard Rock Café restaurant until December 2009 when the restaurant closed after its lease expired. The Toronto Marriott City Centre Hotel is also within Rogers Centre with 70 rooms, and a restaurant and bar called the Sportsnet Grill overlooks the field. The Blue Jays in partnership with theScore Bet announced plans in April 2022 to create a new premium branded flagship sports bar and restaurant that would be open 365 days a year at the Rogers Centre and provide sports betting lines, including for daily fantasy sports.

Over $5 million of artwork was commissioned in 1989 ($ million in dollars):

* &quot;The Audience&quot; – by Michael Snow is a collection of larger-than-life depictions of fans above the northeast and northwest entrances. Painted gold, the sculptures show fans in various acts of celebration.
* &quot;A Tribute to Baseball&quot; – by Lutz Haufschild, above the Southeast and Southwest entrances of Gate 5.
* &quot;The Art of the Possible&quot; – by Mimi Gellman, inside along the north side of the concourse on the 100 Level. The glass and steel sculpture incorporates the signatures of 2,000 builders of SkyDome, and is a tribute to their work. Some of the artifacts found during excavation, such as musket balls and pottery, have also been included. The brightly illuminated sculpture became an issue to baseball players when the stadium first opened. The bright lights were considered a distraction to batters.
* &quot;Salmon Run&quot; – by Susan Schelle, outside by the Southeast entrance in Bobbie Rosenfeld Park; it is a large fountain with various stainless steel salmon cutouts.
* &quot;Spiral Fountain&quot; – by Judith Schwarz.

The stadium&#x27;s parking lot is located under the stadium itself. The underground parking lot is divided into four sections (Sun, Moon, Star, and Cloud) and the ramps within the stadium correspond to these sections, while the fifth section, the Hotel Zone, being the northernmost section, is reserved for hotel uses by the Toronto Marriott City Centre Hotel directly above this section.

=== Seating capacity ===


=== Rogers Centre video board ===
The Rogers Centre video board is high and across. The panel is made up of modular LED units that can be replaced unit by unit, and can be repaired immediately should it be damaged during an event. Originally, this screen was a Sony Jumbotron, which was the largest in North America at the time of the stadium&#x27;s opening, but it has since been replaced a few times. There are also two ribbon boards made up of LED that run along the East and West sides of the stadium interior. Each board is long by high. In addition, two video boards make up parts of the left and right outfield walls while the stadium is in baseball configuration. These are wide by nearly high.

The main video board was upgraded again for the 2022 Blue Jays season, this time by using more modern technology and adding four &quot;wings&quot;, two on each side of the central part of the main video board with the lower wings on each side being wider, making the main video board no longer rectangular. This was to accommodate the windows of the hotel behind the main video board.

The video board and the stadium played host to several serial television events, including the series finales for &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, along with live coverage of the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997.

== Stadium usage ==

=== Baseball ===

The Blue Jays have won two World Series championships at Rogers Centre, hosting Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1992 World Series and Games 1, 2, and 6 of the 1993 World Series at the stadium, then known as SkyDome, with Game 3 of the 1992 series the first World Series game ever played in Canada. The stadium also hosted the 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The 1991 American League Championship Series was the first Major League Baseball playoff series played entirely indoors with the first two games at the Metrodome in Minneapolis and the final three at SkyDome.

Games in the first round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic were played at the Rogers Centre.

=== Basketball ===
Besides baseball, Rogers Centre was the original home of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Toronto Raptors, who played at the venue from November 1995 to February 1999, while the Air Canada Centre (later renamed Scotiabank Arena) was being planned and built. It proved to be somewhat problematic as a basketball venue, even considering it was only a temporary facility. For instance, many seats theoretically in line with the court were so far away that fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. However, the Raptors sometimes opened the 500 Level, which is the stadium&#x27;s uppermost level, when popular opponents came to town, such as the Chicago Bulls when Michael Jordan was a member of the team, expanding capacity to 29,000 and held over 36,000 attendees at one point.

=== Football ===
Rogers Centre hosted Canadian football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to BMO Field in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the 95th Grey Cup, its first since 1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of Toronto since the championship&#x27;s inception in 1909.

From 1989 to 2003, SkyDome hosted the Vanier Cup championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (later renamed U Sports in 2016) football.

In 1994, then-part owner of SkyDome Labatt considered purchasing a National Football League and a Major League Soccer team to play at the stadium.

The International Bowl, an NCAA college football game between two American schools – one from the Big East Conference and one from the Mid-American Conference – has been played at Rogers Centre four times. The Big East school has won all four bowl games. On January 6, 2007, the University of Cincinnati Bearcats defeated the Western Michigan University Broncos, 27–24. The Scarlet Knights of Rutgers University won the second bowl game in the series on January 5, 2008, by beating the Cardinals of Ball State University, 52–30. The Bulls of the University at Buffalo, a school within a ninety-minute drive of Rogers Centre, lost the third International Bowl to the University of Connecticut Huskies, 38–20. On January 2, 2010, the University of South Florida Bulls beat the Huskies of Northern Illinois University, 27–3.

Rogers Centre was also the venue for the 43rd Vanier Cup on Friday, November 23, 2007, just two days before Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by Hamilton, Ontario (2004 and 2005) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship&#x27;s inception in 1965.

====NFL====

The National Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills announced its intentions to play five &quot;home&quot; games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 2007, so beginning the Bills Toronto Series; the first of these regular-season games took place on December 7 of the 2008 season versus the Miami Dolphins. It marked the first time an NFL team has established a &quot;home&quot; stadium outside the United States for regular-season games. The Bills played a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Rogers Centre on August 14, 2008; the Toronto Series was played every year through the 2013 season.

=== Soccer ===

From the mid-2000s, soccer matches have been regularly held in SkyDome / Rogers Centre; they had been rarely played at the venue when its AstroTurf surface had been in place. Examples of soccer (association football) matches:

*On June 8, 2005, an international soccer friendly between Serbia and Montenegro and Italy took place, ending in a 1–1 draw.

*On May 25, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between Italy&#x27;s ACF Fiorentina and Juventus FC with Fiorentina winning 1–0.

*On July 16, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between England&#x27;s Manchester United F.C. and Scotland&#x27;s Celtic F.C. Manchester United F.C. defeated Celtic F.C. with a score of 3–1. The match was played on a temporary grass surface harvested from Burford, Ontario and transported via 18 tractor-trailers.

*On July 21, 2012, the stadium hosted the friendly between Toronto FC and Liverpool F.C., a match that finished in a 1–1 draw.

*On November 19, 2013, Rogers Centre hosted a friendly soccer match between Brazil and Chile, a match that finished in a 2–1 victory for the Brazilian side.

=== Motorsports ===
Having originated in 1980 at Exhibition Stadium, the Toronto Supercross moved to the Rogers Centre upon its opening in 1989. The event was held annually through 1996 before going on hiatus. It was revived as a part of the FIM World Supercross GP series in 2004 and joined the AMA Supercross Championship after the two series fully merged in 2008. The event ran until 2014 and returned for 2016 and 2017. Then, on January 16, 1993, the stadium hosted the Skydome Grand Prix featuring the USAC National Midget Car Series. The night of racing featured NASCAR stars John Andretti, Kenny Irwin Jr., Tony Stewart and Indianapolis 500 winner Tom Sneva racing on an 1/6 mile oval track and was broadcast across Canada on TSN.

=== Other sports ===

Rogers Centre has also hosted exhibition cricket, gaelic football, hurling, Australian rules football and tennis.

It hosted the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Track and Field Championships.

On May 31, 1997, the venue hosted a post-Olympic track and field event that pitted Olympic track champions Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson, in a 150 m race billed as a competition for the title of the &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Man&quot;, given media disputes over that title during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Bailey won the race, completing it in a time of 15 seconds and winning the $1.5 million prize. Johnson pulled up lame at the 110 m mark claiming a quadriceps injury.

Rogers Centre is the site of several major high school and collegiate sporting competitions, such as the Prentice Cup for high school baseball. Since 2008, the Rogers Centre is the host of the Greater Toronto high schools&#x27; Metro Bowl.
On April 30, 2011, UFC 129 was hosted at Rogers Centre, in the first major mixed martial arts event to ever be held in Ontario after the province lifted a ban on prizefighting. Due to overwhelming demand for tickets (with the initial slate of 42,000 selling in around half an hour), the UFC and Rogers Centre reconfigured the event for 55,000 tickets. The event broke a UFC attendance record set at UFC 124 in Montreal, and also set records for the largest single-day gate revenue in both UFC (surpassing UFC 66 by at least double) and Rogers Centre history.

For the 2015 Pan American Games, the Rogers Centre was used for the opening and closing ceremonies.

=== Professional wrestling ===

WWE has hosted WrestleMania at Rogers Centre twice. WrestleMania VI was held on April 1, 1990, with the main event being a title vs title match which saw the WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior defeat the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, set the SkyDome attendance record of 67,678. The attendance record was broken when 68,237 attended WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002, the main event seeing Triple H win the Undisputed WWF Championship from Canadian Chris Jericho.

In February 1999, the stadium hosted a taping for the February 13, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (a special Saturday-night airing of &quot;Raw&quot; due to USA Network&#x27;s coverage of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show), featuring Stone Cold Steve Austin being defeated by Mr. McMahon in a gauntlet match against The Corporation. It had the largest crowd in &quot;Raw&quot; history, with a reported attendance of 41,432.

On March 1, 2025, WWE will return to the Rogers Centre for the first time since WrestleMania X8 to host their annual Elimination Chamber premium live event.

=== Music concerts ===
The stadium has several concert configurations, including smaller &quot;Theatre&quot; (capacity 5,000 to 7,000) and &quot;Concert Hall&quot; (formerly &quot;SkyTent&quot;; capacity 10,000 to 25,000). Due to the stadium&#x27;s design and building materials, the acoustics are poor, and the loudness/quality can vary greatly around the stadium. Its popularity with artists and fans has diminished over the years, and the Scotiabank Arena now hosts most major concerts. The SkyTent, a group of acoustical curtain sails hoisted on rigging above the floor, helps reduce sound distortion and improve sound quality by dampening reverberations around the stadium.

Soon after its opening, the stadium became a popular venue for large-scale rock concerts and is the largest indoor concert venue in Toronto. Artists have included: 
*Bruce Springsteen, U2 with two concerts in 2009, as well as their concert in 2011, all part of their 360° Tour.
*Bon Jovi performed two sellout shows on July 20 and 21, 2010, at Rogers Centre as part of The Circle Tour. 
*Bruce Springsteen performed on August 24, 2012, during his Wrecking Ball World Tour in front of 39,000 attendees.
*The Rolling Stones played two sold-out concerts at the stadium: on December 4, 1989, during the Steel Wheels Tour and on September 26, 2005, during their highest-grossing tour A Bigger Bang Tour. 
*Madonna performed three shows from 27 May, 1990 at the Skydome, the shows were part of the Blond Ambition World Tour, and were Canada&#x27;s only dates. Later, she performed two concerts at the stadium again during The Girlie Show World Tour for October 11 &amp; 12, 1993.
*Rogers Centre has been a venue for large electronic dance music events. During 2013, the stadium hosted two electronic dance music events, including two sold-out shows on Swedish House Mafia&#x27;s One Last Tour, and Sensation.
*Guns N&#x27; Roses performed at Rogers Centre on July 16, 2016, during their Not in This Lifetime... Tour in front of 48,016 attendees with Billy Talent. 
*Metallica also played a sold-out show at the stadium as part of their WorldWired Tour on July 16, 2017, with special guests Avenged Sevenfold and Volbeat. 
*Shawn Mendes headlined his first stadium show to a sold-out crowd on September 6, 2019, at Rogers Centre during his Shawn Mendes: The Tour.

*It has also hosted many public speakers, including appearances by the Dalai Lama, Christian evangelist Billy Graham, Nelson Mandela, and for a book reading with J. K. Rowling and Margaret Atwood.

*In addition to being a venue that hosts sports, concerts and other events, the Rogers Centre also houses the head offices of a number of businesses. The Toronto Blue Jays have its office headquarters in the building and until 2008, the Toronto Argonauts did as well. It is also the home of the head offices of Ticketmaster Canada and Zuffa Canada, the former also having the main Ticketmaster outlet (ticket centre) for eastern Canada, at the south end of the building beside Gate 9.

*In addition, the building contains the Toronto Renaissance Hotel, a Premier Fitness/Health Club, (formerly) a Hard Rock Cafe (now John Street Terrace), and (formerly) Windows Restaurant (now WestJet Flight Deck). From 2006 until its closure in 2009, the Hard Rock Cafe only opened when there was a performance in the building. On non-event days, there are daily tours of the Rogers Centre.

=== Attendance records ===
* World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s WrestleMania X8 attracted the largest paid crowd to SkyDome. The March 17, 2002, event gathered 68,237 fans. WrestleMania VI held the previous record of 67,678 on April 1, 1990.

=== Stadium-related ===

* The stadium roof had a patent, which prevented its design from being easily copied: U.S. Patent #4676033. The patent was filed on May 1, 1986, and published June 30, 1987, to dome designers, architect Rod Robbie and structural engineer Michael Allen. The patent expired in 2006.
* The original mascot of the stadium was a turtle by the name of Domer. Domer has not been widely used since the mid-1990s, although he did make a return on June 6, 2014, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Rogers Centre.
* When the retractable roof is open, people standing on the observation deck of the nearby CN Tower can look down on the field.
* Over 50 million people have visited SkyDome/Rogers Centre.
* When the roof is open, 91 percent of the seats and 100 percent of the field is open to the sky, covering an area of .
* The roof weighs and is held together by 250,000 bolts.
* The stadium&#x27;s inward-looking hotel rooms have regular two-way windows, yielding instances of what some could consider indecent exposure and leading to nicknames such as &quot;SexDome&quot; and &quot;Exhibitionist Stadium&quot;. When SkyDome first opened, a couple engaging in sexual intercourse was televised on the scoreboard Jumbotron during a baseball game, thanks to illumination from stadium lighting despite the room&#x27;s lights being off. Days later, a man was caught masturbating during a game in full view of the packed stands. The man, later tracked down by a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reporter, calmly said, &quot;I thought they were one-way windows.&quot; Patrons now have to sign contracts stipulating they will not perform any lewd acts within view of the stadium. The last reported such instance occurred in 1996. Occasionally, broadcasts will zoom into humorous instances from these hotel rooms, such as a pillow fight during the 1992 World Series.
* When the stadium first opened, the Toronto Transit Commission was worried about the challenge of moving the large crowds. As a way to streamline the entry to the subway and to encourage public transit use to the stadium, all tickets for the first 30 days also worked as a Metropass, which was the commission&#x27;s monthly pass.
* The stadium corporation has been requested to help in the planning of other venues from the U.S., the Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, to Singapore, China and Germany &quot;(Source: Rogers Centre Press release)&quot;.
* It was the most expensive stadium in both the Canadian Football League and Major League Baseball, constructed at a price of C$570 million (C$ in dollars). This record was passed by the New Yankee Stadium at a cost of US$1.5 billion. If Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium (which was formerly the home field of the Expos, only used for CFL playoff games since the late 2000s and MLS playoff games since the mid-2010s) were counted, it would take the title, with a 1976 cost of C$1.6 billion (C$ in dollars).
* Because of the orientation of the baseball playing field at Rogers Centre, when a player is at bat, the direction he is facing looks farther to the west than at any other Major League Baseball park.
* Rogers Centre has hosted regular-season games of five of the six major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada throughout the stadium&#x27;s history; all but a National Hockey League (NHL) game, despite the Toronto Maple Leafs being in the NHL.

== In popular culture ==
*The stadium is the setting of the climax in the 2022 Pixar animated film &quot;Turning Red&quot;, in which the fictional boy band 4*Town performs a large-scale concert during which the stadium is partially destroyed. As the Toronto-set film&#x27;s time period is set in 2002, the stadium is referred to by its original SkyDome name.

*The exterior part of the venue has been used in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s 2024 film, &quot;Trap&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Tanaka Arena&quot; for the story&#x27;s outline, hosting a Lady Raven concert, who is the movie&#x27;s popstar.

<text>Gods and Monsters is a 1998 period drama film written and directed by Bill Condon, based on Christopher Bram&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Father of Frankenstein&quot;. The film stars Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita Davidovich, and David Dukes. Its plot is a partly fictionalized account of the last days of the life of film director James Whale (McKellen), known for directing &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935). A veteran of World War I, the aged Whale develops a complicated relationship with his gardener, Clayton Boone (Fraser), a fictitious character originally created by Bram for the source novel.

An international co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is produced by Paul Colichman, Gregg Fienberg, and Mark R. Harris; Clive Barker served as executive producer. As well as featuring reconstructions of the production of the &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, the film&#x27;s title is derived from a scene in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, in which the character Dr. Pretorius toasts Dr. Frankenstein, &quot;To a new world of gods and monsters!&quot;

&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for McKellen and Best Supporting Actress for Redgrave, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay. Despite receiving positive reviews, the film was a box office failure. It was later adapted as a play of the same name which premiered in London at the Southwark Playhouse in February 2015.

==Plot==
In the 1950s, James Whale, the director of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, has retired. Whale lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. He has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;. Whale slips into his past and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan. He battles depression, and at times contemplates suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away.

Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener, Clayton Boone, and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale&#x27;s sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale&#x27;s spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale&#x27;s fame, watches &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; on television as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale&#x27;s intentions.

Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives Whale&#x27;s assurance that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such &quot;locker room&quot; discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with &quot;his Monsters&quot;: Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from &quot;ancient&quot; movie fame. This event exacerbates Whale&#x27;s depression. A sudden rainstorm becomes an excuse to leave.

Back at Whale&#x27;s home, Clayton needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Clayton wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Clayton one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Clayton, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Clayton drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a World War I gas mask and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Clayton, kissing his shoulder and neck, and forcefully reaches for his genitals. An enraged Clayton fights off Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Clayton to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Clayton refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she cannot find Whale, prompting a search by Clayton and Hanna. Clayton finds Whale floating dead in the pool as a distraught Hanna runs out, clutching a suicide note. Clayton and Hanna agree that he should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal.

A decade later, Clayton and his son, Michael, watch &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; on television. Michael is skeptical of his father&#x27;s claim that he knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, &quot;To Clayton. Friend?&quot;. Clayton later walks down a street at night in the rain, miming the movements of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with McKellen&#x27;s, Fraser&#x27;s and Redgrave&#x27;s performances singled out for particular praise. &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;not a complicated film, but warm and clever&quot;.

The film has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a spellbinding, confusing piece of semi-fiction, featuring fine performances; McKellen leads the way, but Redgrave and Fraser don&#x27;t lag far behind.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Real life basis==
James Whale had several men (and women) pose nude for him, and some of these are shown in the making-of featurette. Several of his paintings were bought by a collector and loaned to the studio for the making of this film.

Whale suffered from strokes towards the end of his life, which affected his mental abilities, and he was found dead in his pool. There were rumours that this was a homicide, but the evidence only pointed at suicide.

In the documentary included on the DVD and in interviews, novelist Christopher Bram explains that the character of Clayton Boone is completely fictitious.

<text>Shneur Zalman of Liadi, (; September 4, 1745 – December 15, 1812 O.S. / 18 Elul 5505 – 24 Tevet 5573) commonly known as the Alter Rebbe or Baal Hatanya, was a rabbi and the founder and first Rebbe of Chabad, a branch of Hasidic Judaism. He wrote many works and is best known for &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot;, &quot;Tanya&quot;, and his &quot;Siddur Torah Or&quot;, compiled according to the &quot;Nusach Ari&quot;.

== Names ==
Zalman is a Yiddish variant of Solomon and Shneur (or Shne&#x27;or) is a Yiddish composite of the two Hebrew words &quot;shnei ohr&quot; (שני אור &quot;two lights&quot;).

He is also known as Shneur Zalman Baruchovitch, using the Russian patronymic of his father Baruch, and by a variety of other titles and acronyms including &quot;Baal HaTanya VeHaShulchan Aruch&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Author of the Tanya and the Shulchan Aruch&quot;), &quot;Alter Rebbe&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;Old Rabbi&quot;), &quot;Admor HaZaken&quot; (Hebrew for ″Our Old Master and Teacher″), &quot;Rabbenu HaZaken&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Our Old Rabbi&quot;), &quot;Rabbenu HaGadol&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Our Great Rabbi&quot;)&quot;, &quot;RaShaZ&quot; ( for Rabbi Shneor Zalman), &quot;GRaZ&quot; ( for Ga&#x27;on Rabbi Zalman), and &quot;HaRav&quot; (The Rabbi, par excellence).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Shneur Zalman was born in 1745 in the small town of Liozna, Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Belarus). He was the son of Baruch, who was a paternal descendant of the mystic and philosopher Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel. According to Meir Perels of Prague, the Maharal was the great-great-grandson of Judah Leib the Elder who was said to have descended paternally from Hai Gaon and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty; however, several modern historians such as Otto Muneles and Shlomo Engard have questioned this claim. Shneur Zalman was a prominent (and the youngest) disciple of Dov Ber of Mezeritch, the &quot;Great Maggid&quot;, who was in turn the successor of the founder of Hasidic Judaism, Yisrael ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov.
He displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was eight years old, he wrote an all-inclusive commentary on the Torah based on the works of Rashi, Nahmanides and Abraham ibn Ezra.

Until the age of 12, he studied under Issachar Ber in Lyubavichi (Lubavitch); he distinguished himself as a Talmudist, such that his teacher sent him back home, informing his father that the boy could continue his studies without the aid of a teacher. At the age of 12, he delivered a discourse concerning the complicated laws of Kiddush Hachodesh, to which the people of the town granted him the title &quot;Rav&quot;.

At age 15 he married Sterna Segal, the daughter of Yehuda Leib Segal, a wealthy resident of Vitebsk, and he was then able to devote himself entirely to study. During these years, Shneur Zalman was introduced to mathematics, geometry, and astronomy by two learned brothers, refugees from Bohemia, who had settled in Liozna. One of them was also a scholar of the Kabbalah. Thus, besides mastering rabbinic literature, he also acquired a fair knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and Kabbalah. He became an adept in Isaac Luria&#x27;s system of Kabbalah, and in 1764 he became a disciple of Dov Ber of Mezeritch. In 1767, at the age of 22, he was appointed maggid of Liozna, a position he held until 1801.

==== Parents ====
According to the Chabad Hasidic tradition, Shneur Zalman&#x27;s father, Baruch, was a laborer who preferred to earn a living as a gardener rather than accept a post as a community rabbi or as a preacher (&quot;magid&quot;). In this tradition, Baruch was one of the disciples of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov. However, he only occasionally joined his teacher on his legendary travels. This tradition is used to justify why Hasidic records do not refer to Baruch with a rabbinic title, claiming that Baruch was averse to any public acknowledgment of his status.

===Misnagdim===

In the course of the Hasidic movement&#x27;s establishment, opponents (Misnagdim) arose among the local Jewish community. Disagreements between Hasidim and their opponents included debates concerning knives used by butchers for &quot;shechita&quot;, and the phrasing of prayers, among others. Shneur Zalman and a fellow Hasidic leader, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk (or, according to the tradition in the Soloveitchik family, Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev), attempted to persuade the leader of Lithuanian Jewry, the Vilna Gaon, of the legitimacy of Hasidic practices. However, the &quot;Gaon&quot; refused to meet with them.

=== Children and succession ===
Shneur Zalman&#x27;s sons were Dov Ber Schneuri (who eventually succeeded him), Chaim Avraham, and Moshe. Shneur Zalman&#x27;s daughters were named Freida, Devorah Leah and Rochel. Other families have lore telling that they are also descendants, but they are undocumented in existing family records.

==== Dov Ber Shneuri ====
Dovber Schneuri succeeded his father as Rebbe of the Chabad movement. At the age of 39, while studying in the city of Kremenchug, Shneur Zalman died. Shneuri then moved to the small border-town of Lubavichi, from which the movement would take its name. His accession was disputed by one of his father&#x27;s prime students, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye, however the majority of Shneur Zalman&#x27;s followers stayed with Schneuri, and moved to Lubavichi. Thus Chabad had now split into two branches, each taking the name of their location to differentiate themselves from each other. He established a Yeshivah in Lubavitch, which attracted gifted young scholars. His nephew/son-in-law, Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch, headed the Yeshivah, and later became his successor.

Thus, while Schneuri succeeded his father as Rebbe of the Chabad movement, a senior disciple of his father, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye, a popular and respected figure, differed with him on a number of issues and led a breakaway movement.

==== Strashelye ====
When Schneur Zalman died, many of his followers flocked to one of his top students, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye. He had been Shneur Zalman&#x27;s closest disciple for over thirty years. While many more became followers of Dovber Shneuri, the Strashelye school of Chassidic thought was the subject of many of Dovber&#x27;s discourses. Aharon HaLevi emphasized the importance of basic emotions in divine service (especially the service of prayer). Dovber Shneuri did not reject the role of emotion in prayer, but emphasized that if the emotion in prayer is to be genuine, it can only be a result of contemplation and understanding (hisbodedus) of the explanations of Chassidus, which in turn will lead to an attainment of &quot;bittul&quot; (self-nullification before the Divine). In his work entitled &quot;Kuntres Hispa&#x27;alus&quot; (&quot;Tract on Ecstasy&quot;), Dovber Shneuri argues that only through ridding oneself of what he considered disingenuous emotions could one attain the ultimate level in Chassidic worship (that is, &quot;bittul&quot;).

==== Moshe Schneersohn ====
Moshe Schneersohn (born c. 1784 - died, before 1853) was the youngest son of Shneur Zalman. According to scholars he converted to Christianity and died in a St. Petersburg asylum. Chabad sources say that his conversion and related documents were faked by the Church, but Belarusian State archives in Minsk uncovered by historian Shaul Stampfer support the conversion.

=== Lithuania ===
During the latter portion of Dovber&#x27;s life, his students dispersed over Europe, and after Dovber&#x27;s death, Shneur Zalman became the leader of Hasidism in Lithuania, along with his senior colleague Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk. When Menachem Mendel died (in 1788), Shneur Zalman was recognized as leader of the Chassidim in Lithuania.

At the time Lithuania was the center of the &quot;misnagdim&quot; (opponents of Hasidism), and Shneur Zalman faced much opposition. In 1774 he and Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk traveled to Vilna in an attempt to create a dialogue with the Vilna Gaon who led the Misnagdim and had issued a ban (&quot;cherem&quot;) against the Hasidim, but the Gaon refused to see them (see Vilna Gaon: Antagonism to Hasidism and Hasidim and Mitnagdim).

Undaunted by this antagonism, he succeeded in creating a large network of Hasidic centers. He also joined opposition to Napoleon&#x27;s advance on Russia by recruiting his disciples to the Czar&#x27;s army. He was also active in canvassing financial support for the Jewish settlements in the Land of Israel, then under the control of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Philosophy: Chabad ===

:&quot;See Hasidic philosophy&quot;

As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In his seminal work, &quot;Tanya&quot;, he defines his approach as &quot;&quot; (&quot;mind ruling over the heart/emotions&quot;). He chose the name &quot;Chabad&quot; for this philosophy—the Hebrew acronym for the intellectual attributes (&quot;sefirot&quot;) &quot;Chochma&quot; (&quot;wisdom&quot;), &quot;Bina&quot; (&quot;understanding&quot;), and &quot;Da&#x27;at&quot; (&quot;knowledge”). According to Shneur Zalman, a man is neither a static nor a passive entity. He is a dynamic being who must work to develop his potential talent and perfect himself.

Both in his works and in his sermons he &quot;indicated an intelligent and not a blind faith&quot;, and assumed an intellectual accessibility of the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah. This intellectual basis differentiates Chabad from other forms of Hasidism - in this context referred to as &quot;Chagas&quot;—the &quot;emotional&quot; attributes (&quot;sefirot&quot;) of &quot;Chesed&quot; (&quot;kindness&quot;), &quot;Gevurah&quot; (&quot;power&quot;), and &quot;Tiferes&quot; (&quot;beauty&quot;).

In Likkutei Sichos talks, the 7th Rebbe equates the Hasidic Rebbes followed in Chabad with different Sephirot divine manifestations: the Baal Shem Tov with Keter infinite faith, Shneur Zalman with Chokhmah (wisdom), the 2nd Chabad Rebbe with Binah (understanding), etc.

=== Opposition to Napoleon and support for the Tsar ===


During the French invasion of Russia, while many Polish Hasidic leaders supported Napoleon or remained quiet about their support, Shneur Zalman openly and vigorously supported the Tsar.

While fleeing from the advancing French army he wrote a letter explaining his opposition to Napoleon to a friend, Moshe Meizeles:
Some argue that Shneur Zalman&#x27;s opposition stemmed from Napoleon&#x27;s attempts to arouse a messianic view of himself in Jews, opening the gates of the ghettos and emancipating their residents as he conquered. He established an ersatz &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;, recruiting Jews to his ranks, and spreading rumors about his conquest of the Holy Land to make Jews subversive for his own ends. Thus, his opposition was based on a practical fear of Jews turning to the false messianism of Napoleon as he saw it.

Yisroel Hopsztajn of Kozienice, another Hasidic leader, also considered Napoleon a menace to the Jewish people, but believed that after victory over Russia, Messiah will arrive. Menachem Mendel Schneerson identifies Hopsztajn as the Chasidic leader who preferred that Napoleon defeat the Czar.

=== Arrests ===

In 1797 following the death of the Gaon, leaders of the Vilna community accused the Hasidim of subversive activities - on charges of supporting the Ottoman Empire, since Shneur Zalman advocated sending charity to support Jews living in the Ottoman territory of Palestine. In 1798 he was arrested on suspicion of treason and brought to St. Petersburg where he was held in the Petropavlovski fortress for 53 days, at which time he was subjected to an examination by a secret commission. Ultimately he was released by order of Paul I of Russia. The Hebrew day of his acquittal and release, 19 Kislev, 5559 on the Hebrew calendar, is celebrated annually by Chabad Hasidim, who hold a festive meal and make communal pledges to learn the whole of the Talmud; this practice is known as &quot;Chalukat HaShas&quot;.

In Chabad tradition, his imprisonment is interpreted as a reflection of accusations in Heaven that he was revealing his new dimensions of mystical teachings too widely. The traditional tendency to conceal Jewish mysticism is founded on the Kabbalistic notion of the Sephirot. The side of Divine Chesed seeks to give physical and spiritual blessing without restriction. This is counterbalanced by the side of Gevurah, which measures and restricts the flow to the capacity and merit of the recipient. The subsequent Sephirah of Hod implements any restriction in order to preserve the glory of the Divine majesty. In the Hasidic story of an earlier episode among the &quot;Holy Society&quot; disciples of Dov Ber of Mezeritch, one of the great followers saw a page of Hasidic writings blowing around the courtyard. He regretted the undue dissemination of Hasidut for its desecration of Divine holiness. In the account, his vocalisation of these thoughts caused a Heavenly accusation against the Maggid, for revealing too much. The young Schneur Zalman replied with a famous Hasidic parable:

A king had an only son who became ill and all the attending doctors were at a loss of how to heal him. A wise person understood the only possible cure. He told the king that he would have to desecrate the royal crown by removing its most precious jewel. This would have to be ground up and fed to the king&#x27;s son. The king regretted the loss to his majesty but immediately agreed that the life of his son was more important. The jewel was ground and the solution was fed to the son. Most of the cure fell to the ground, but the son received a few drops and became cured. Concluded Schneur Zalman in defence of Hasidic dissemination, the king represents God, and the son represents the Jewish community, who recognise the &quot;God of Israel&quot;. At the time of the emerging Hasidic movement, the Jewish people were at a physical and spiritual low ebb. The only cure would be the dissemination of the inner Divine teachings of Hasidic thought. Even though this would also involve their desecration, this would fully be justified in order to heal the people. The accusing student of the Maggid realised the wisdom of this, and agreed with Schneur Zalman. When the Maggid heard about this, he told Schneur Zalman that &quot;you have saved me from the Heavenly accusation&quot;.

The story of this parable is famous across other Hasidic dynasties as well. Chabad commentary asks about this the question of why a new Heavenly accusation would have arisen against Shneur Zalman himself, and result in his incarceration in St. Petersburg. Had he not already received the Heavenly agreement to the wisdom of disseminating Chassidic teachings? Since Chabad thought presented Hasidic thought with a new degree of elucidation in intellectual form, this caused a new, more severe Heavenly accusation to emerge. This went beyond the justified spiritual revival and healing of mainstream Hasidism. Here, in Hasidic thought, Schneur Zalman was seeking to fulfill the Messianic impulse to disseminate Hasidic philosophy as a preparation for Mashiach. Therefore, his subsequent exoneration by the Tzarist authorities is interpreted in Chabad as a new Heavenly agreement to begin the fullest dissemination of Hasidic thought without its prior limitations. Chabad tradition tells that in prison, Schneur Zalman was visited by the deceased Baal Shem Tov and Maggid of Mezeritch, who told him the reason for his imprisonment. In reply to the question of whether he should stop, they replied that once released, he should continue with even more dedication. Therefore, in Chabad thought, the 19th day of Kislev is called the &quot;New Year of Hasidut&quot;, complementing the other 4 Halachic &quot;New Year&quot; dates in the Hebrew calendar.

In 1800 Rav Shneur Zalman was again arrested and transported to St. Petersburg, this time along with his son Moshe who served as interpreter, as his father spoke no Russian or French. He was released after several weeks but banned from leaving St. Petersburg. The accession of Tsar Alexander I (Alexander I of Russia) to the throne a few weeks later led to his release; he was then “given full liberty to proclaim his religious teachings” by the Russian government.

According to some, his first arrest was not the result of anti-Hasidic agitators fabricating charges, or officials seeking extortion monies. An accusation was made on May 8, 1798 by Hirsh ben David of Vilna accused him of trying to assist the French Revolution, by sending money to Napoleon and the Sultan. Since this Hirsch ben David was untraceable, some were led to believe that there was no such person as Hirsh and the authorities were attempting to stir up internecine fighting among the Jews.

=== Liadi ===
After his release he moved his base to Liadi, Vitebsk Region, Imperial Russia; rather than returning to Liozna. He took up his residence in the town of Liadi at the invitation of Polish Prince Stanisław Lubomirski, voivode of the town, where Zalman settled for the next 12 years. His movement grew there immensely, and to this day he is associated with the town. In 1812, fleeing the French Invasion, he left Mogilev, intending to go to Poltava, but died on the way in the small village of Pena, Kursk Oblast. He is buried in Hadiach.

=== Subsequent history of Chabad ===
:&quot;See Chabad#History&quot;

Dovber Schneuri moved the movement to the town of Lubavitch (Lyubavichi) in present-day Russia. A top follower of Shneur Zalman, Aharon HaLevi Horowitz, established a rival Chabad school in Strashelye, which did not last after his death.

In 1940, under the leadership of the previous Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement moved its headquarters to Brooklyn, New York in the United States. Under the leadership of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Chabad established branches all over the world staffed by its own Lubavitch-trained and ordained rabbis with their wives and children. The number of branches continues to grow to this day, and existing branches continue to expand.

Many descendants of Shneur Zalman carry surnames such as Shneur, Shneuri, Schneerson, and Zalman.

== Works ==
Shneur Zalman was a prolific writer. He produced works of both Hasidic philosophy and Jewish law. Chabad tradition recasts his Yiddish name, &quot;Shneur&quot; (שניאור), as the Hebrew words &quot;Shnei&quot; and &quot;Ohr&quot; (שני אור, &quot;Two Lights&quot;), referring to Schneur Zalman&#x27;s mastery of both the outer dimensions of Talmudic Jewish study and the inner dimensions of Jewish mysticism. His works form the cornerstone of Chabad philosophy.

=== Tanya ===

He is probably best known for his systematic exposition of Hasidic Jewish philosophy, entitled &quot;Likkutei Amarim&quot;, more widely known as the &quot;Tanya&quot;, said to be first published in 1797. The legendary &quot;1797 Tanya&quot; was lost in a fire and no copies survived. The extant version of the work dates from 1814. Due to the popularity of his book, Hasidic Jews often refer to Shneur Zalman as the &quot;Baal HaTanya&quot; (lit. &quot;Master of the &quot;Tanya&quot;&quot;). The &quot;Tanya&quot; deals with Jewish spirituality and psychology from a Kabbalistic point of view and philosophically expounds on such themes as the oneness of God, &quot;Tzimtzum&quot;, the &quot;Sefirot&quot;, &quot;simcha&quot;, &quot;bitachon&quot; (confidence), and many other mystical concepts.

=== Shulchan Aruch HaRav ===
Shneur Zalman is well known for the &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot;, a collection of authoritative codes of Jewish laws and customs commissioned by Dovber of Mezeritch and composed at the legendary age of twenty-one. The Maggid of Mezeritch sought a new version of the classic &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; for the Hasidic movement. The work states a selection of decided halakha and the underlying reasoning and common Hasidic customs. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot; is considered authoritative by other Hasidim, and citations to this work are many times found in non-Hasidic sources such as the &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; used by Lithuanian Jews and the &quot;Ben Ish Chai&quot; used by Sephardic Jews. Shneur Zalman is also one of three halachic authorities on whom Shlomo Ganzfried based his &quot;Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh&quot; (Concise version of Jewish law).

=== Siddur ===
He also edited the first Chabad siddur, based on the &quot;Ari Siddur&quot; of the famous kabbalist Isaac Luria of Safed, but he altered it for general use and corrected its textual errors. Today&#x27;s &quot;Siddur Tehillat HaShem&quot; is a later print of Shneur Zalman&#x27;s Siddur.

=== Music ===
Shneur Zalman composed a number of Hassidic melodies. Some accompany specific prayers, others are sung to Biblical verses or are melodies without words. Depending on the tune, they are meant to arouse joy, spiritual ecstasy, or teshuvah. One particular melody, commonly referred to as The Alter Rebbe&#x27;s Niggun or Dalet Bovos, is reserved by Chabad Hassidim for ushering a groom and bride to their wedding canopy and other select occasions.

<text>Affliction is a 1997 American neo-noir crime drama directed and written by Paul Schrader. Based on the 1989 novel by Russell Banks, the film stars Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn, and Willem Dafoe.

&quot;Affliction&quot; had its world premiere at the 54th Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 1997, and was released in the United States on December 30, 1998, by Lions Gate Films. The film received positive reviews from critics, who mostly lauded the performances of Nolte and Coburn. At the 71st Academy Awards, Nolte was nominated for Best Actor and Coburn won for Best Supporting Actor. It earned six nominations at the 14th Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Feature.

==Plot==
Rolfe Whitehouse begins the film, announcing the story of his brother Wade&#x27;s &quot;strange criminal behavior&quot; and subsequent disappearance.

Wade Whitehouse is a small-town policeman in New Hampshire. On Halloween night, Wade meets his daughter Jill, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother, Wade&#x27;s ex-wife, to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her husband against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter.

The next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. Jack Hewitt, a local hunting guide, claims that Evan Twombley, with whom he was hunting, accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man&#x27;s death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction.

A while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade&#x27;s alcoholic father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from hypothermia. Glen reacts to her death with little surprise, and later gets drunk at her wake and gets into a fight with Wade.

Rolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade&#x27;s murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town Selectman Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a conspiracy. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off.

Finally, Wade is fired for harassing Jack and trashing Lariviere&#x27;s office. He collects Jill from her mother&#x27;s house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates him over his plans to sue for full custody. At a local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay, but Jill rushes up and tries to stop the fight. In response, Wade angrily pushes Jill, giving her a bloody nose, forcing both her and Margie to drive off.

Wade is then approached by Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a &quot;real man&quot;. The latent aggression between the men culminates in another fight in which Wade hits his father with the butt of a rifle, accidentally killing him. Wade burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking.

Rolfe&#x27;s narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack&#x27;s truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere, but he had nothing to do with either Jack or Twombley. Rolfe concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.

== Production ==
According to Paul Schrader, he came across a paperback copy of the novel in a bookstore and bought it after he was &quot;grabbed&quot; by its first sentence. After he finished reading the book, Schrader bought the film rights from Russell Banks. The director said in an interview with &quot;Filmmaker&quot; that he identified with the characters in the story: &quot;I had a very strong father and an older male sibling. My father was not abusive, he was not alcoholic, but there were enough similarities. I came from that part of the country with long cold winters, so I knew these people, and I knew their violence.&quot; Although it has been compared to his previous films (e.g. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;American Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;), Schrader has stated that the ending of &quot;Affliction&quot; was what made it different from them: &quot;One of the differences between things that I have written and Russell&#x27;s book is that I tend to end my pieces on a kind of grace note, and this one has none. I like some sense of moral grace. But &quot;Affliction&quot; is pretty bleak at the end.&quot; He also added, &quot;I view the film as a collaboration between myself and Russell Banks.&quot;

Nick Nolte was Schrader&#x27;s first choice for the role of Wade Whitehouse. Schrader told Charlie Rose that he envisioned Nolte in his mind while he was writing the script. According to Schrader, he offered Nolte the part five years before filming began, when the actor had become a bankable star following his success with the box office hits &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; and &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, both released in 1991. Although Nolte was interested in playing Wade, Schrader could not afford him at first. It was not until five years later when Nolte agreed to do &quot;Affliction&quot; for less money. However, Nolte says he initially turned it down because he was working on other projects at the time and that he was not ready to portray the role. It was Nolte who brought &quot;Affliction&quot; to the attention of Bart Potter, the head of Largo Entertainment. Nolte told Rose that by the time the five years passed by, &quot;I think I understood Wade better.&quot; Schrader also admitted that the five years of preparation helped Nolte&#x27;s performance. In addition to acting in the film, Nolte also served as one of its executive producers.

Nolte says that he was the one who convinced Sissy Spacek, whom he worked with in &quot;Heart Beat&quot; (1980), to appear in &quot;Affliction&quot; alongside him. According to Schrader, it was Spacek&#x27;s husband Jack Fisk who came up with the idea of having the characters of Wade and Glen Whitehouse lick salt off their hands to show how similar the father and son are to each other.

Schrader told Roger Ebert that he gave the part of Glen to James Coburn because he was bigger than and could &quot;convincingly dominate&quot; Nolte. When Schrader encouraged the actor to prepare for the role, Coburn reportedly said in response, &quot;Oh, you mean you want me to really act? I can do that. I haven&#x27;t often been asked to, but I can.&quot;

Schrader claimed that Willem Dafoe wanted to play the part of Wade. Dafoe himself would admit, &quot;I knew I couldn&#x27;t play Wade Whitehouse whether Nick Nolte was around or not.&quot; Schrader instead offered Dafoe the role of Rolfe Whitehouse, and the latter accepted it because he loved the novel. According to Dafoe, Schrader showed him the novel during the making of &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;.

&quot;Affliction&quot; was filmed in Quebec, with principal shooting starting in February 1997. Although first presented at the Venice Film Festival on August 28 the same year, &quot;Affliction&quot; did not see a theatrical release until some time later in most countries. After a limited release in New York in December 1998, it saw its regular US release in January 1999.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Affliction&quot; has an approval rating of 88% based on 50 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Dark and bleak, the &#x27;kick-ass&#x27; performances, especially Nolte&#x27;s &#x27;effective&#x27; portrayal of an abused soul, is the reason to see this film.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 79 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 4 stars. Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;[Nick Nolte] gives the performance of his career in Paul Schrader&#x27;s quietly stunning new film [...] Like &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, a more meditative and elegant but less immediate, volcanic film, &quot;Affliction&quot; finds the deeper meaning in an all too believable tragedy.&quot;

In a negative review in the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot;, Geoff Andrew called the film a &quot;sensitive but rather dull adaption of Russell Banks&#x27; novel [...] the narrative&#x27;s too unfocused and low-key really to engage the heart or mind.&quot;

<text>Metropolis light transport (MLT) is a global illumination application of a Monte Carlo method called the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to the rendering equation for generating images from detailed physical descriptions of three-dimensional scenes.

The procedure constructs paths from the eye to a light source using bidirectional path tracing, then constructs slight modifications to the path. Some careful statistical calculation (the Metropolis algorithm) is used to compute the appropriate distribution of brightness over the image. This procedure has the advantage, relative to bidirectional path tracing, that once a path has been found from light to eye, the algorithm can then explore nearby paths; thus difficult-to-find light paths can be explored more thoroughly with the same number of simulated photons. In short, the algorithm generates a path and stores the path&#x27;s &#x27;nodes&#x27; in a list. It can then modify the path by adding extra nodes and creating a new light path. While creating this new path, the algorithm decides how many new &#x27;nodes&#x27; to add and whether or not these new nodes will actually create a new path.

Metropolis light transport is an unbiased method that, in some cases (but not always), converges to a solution of the rendering equation faster than other unbiased algorithms such as path tracing or bidirectional path tracing.

Energy Redistribution Path Tracing (ERPT) uses Metropolis sampling-like mutation strategies instead of an intermediate probability distribution step.

<doc id="171562" wikidata="Q208572" url="?curid=171562" title="American History X">
<text>American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye (in his feature directorial debut) and written by David McKenna. The film stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the white power skinhead and neo-Nazi movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter, is rehabilitated during this time, and then tries to prevent his brother (Furlong) from being indoctrinated further. The supporting cast includes Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo.

McKenna wrote the script based on his own childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. He sold the script to New Line Cinema, which was impressed by the writing. &quot;American History X&quot; was Kaye&#x27;s first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film&#x27;s release, Kaye and the film studio were in disagreements about the final cut of the film, which Norton had played a pivotal role in conceiving. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, thus negatively affecting his directing career.

Distributed by New Line Cinema, the film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 in limited theaters and received a wide theatrical release on November 20, 1998, grossing $23.9 million against a $20 million budget. &quot;American History X&quot; was critically praised, with Norton and Furlong&#x27;s performances and the film&#x27;s message drawing acclaim. Norton received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries. A follow-up, &quot;African History Y&quot;, with Kaye returning as director and starring Djimon Hounsou, was in active development as of 2020.

==Plot==
Danny Vinyard antagonizes his Jewish history teacher Murray by writing an essay on &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. As a result, African-American principal and outreach worker Dr. Bob Sweeney give an ultimatum to either study history directly under him through current events, &quot;American History X,&quot; or be expelled. Danny must write a paper on his older brother Derek, Sweeney&#x27;s former student and neo-Nazi leader, whose prison release is scheduled that day.

Years earlier, Danny and Derek&#x27;s firefighter father is shot and killed by a black drug dealer while extinguishing a fire at their home. Immediately afterwards, Derek erupts in a televised, racially-motivated tirade. High-profile neo-Nazi Cameron Alexander becomes his mentor, and they form a violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Cameron (D.O.C.) in Venice Beach.

A skilled basketball player, Derek defeats several Crips members, winning control of the local ball courts. Later, he organizes an attack on an Asian-owned supermarket employing black people and immigrants.

Derek&#x27;s mother Doris invites Murray, her then boyfriend, to dinner, where an argument about Rodney King and the 1992 Los Angeles riots ensues. Derek assaults his sister Davina and openly berates Murray, causing Doris to banish Derek.

That night, several Crips members, whom Derek had defeated on the basketball court, attempt to steal his truck. When Danny alerts him, he kills two of them, one with a bullet and the other, by curb stomping him in front of Danny. He is arrested and sentenced to three years in the California Institution for Men for voluntary manslaughter.

In prison, Derek joins the Aryan Brotherhood and befriends black inmate Lamont, who was assigned as his workmate in the prison laundry. Disillusioned by prison gang politics, Derek learns the Aryan Brotherhood is buying drugs from the Mexican Mafia and then selling to other White inmates. Derek realizes they are a criminal gang using Neo-Nazism and white supremacy as a façade, and he loses his belief even further when nobody from the D.O.C. visits him. He ultimately abandons the Aryan Brotherhood, who then beat and gang rape him in the communal shower.

Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney rebukes him for wanting to avoid dealing with the consequences of his actions, revealing his own racist past and warning that Danny has joined the D.O.C. to follow in Derek&#x27;s footsteps. After recovering and leaving the hospital wing, Derek publicly snubs the Aryan Brotherhood and Lamont warns that he will be murdered by African-American inmates as the Brotherhood no longer protects him. No attack ever comes, though, and, upon his release, Derek thanks Lamont for intervening on his behalf.

Returning home, Derek finds Danny sporting a D.O.C. tattoo and becoming a skinhead. When Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, Danny feels betrayed. Derek&#x27;s best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek&#x27;s mother and sister while grooming Danny for the group; Cameron controls Seth and Danny closely.

At a D.O.C. compound party, Derek confronts Cameron for using and then abandoning him for three years. He declares his departure from the group and refusal to allow them to use Danny similarly. When mocked, Derek brutally beats Cameron. Seth and the others, including Derek&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Stacey, attack Derek. Seth pulls a gun, but Derek disarms him and holds everyone at gunpoint before fleeing, tossing the gun into a nearby bin.

Danny finds Derek and angrily confronts him over his actions. Derek tells him about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in him. They return home and remove neo-Nazi posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on how Derek initially adopted racist views from their father, as shown in a flashback.

Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a diner. Sweeney and a police officer inform him that Seth and Cameron were attacked the night before and are in an intensive care unit. He denies knowing anything or being involved in any way, but reluctantly agrees to inspect the people he denounced.

Danny is shot dead in a bathroom by a Black student he had confronted the day before. Derek runs to the school, pushing past crowds and police officers to find Danny&#x27;s bloodied corpse. He cradles Danny&#x27;s body in hysterics, blaming himself for influencing his views and actions. In a voiceover, Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s first inaugural address.

=== Development ===

Screenwriter David McKenna wrote the screenplay for &quot;American History X&quot; and sold the rights to New Line Cinema when he was 26. The inspiration for the story came from the punk-rock scene of McKenna&#x27;s childhood, where he often witnessed violent behavior. &quot;I saw a lot of bigotry growing up, and it made me think about writing something about the world of hate-mongers. The point I tried to make in the script is that a person is not born a racist. It is learned through environment and the people that surround you. The question that intrigued me is: why do people hate and how does one go about changing that? My premise was that hate starts in the family&quot;. In order to make the characters as realistic as possible, McKenna interviewed and observed the behavior of skinheads during the writing process. He said &quot;I had seen documentaries that just didn&#x27;t ring true to me, and I wanted to write an accurate portrayal of how good kids from good families can get so terribly lost&quot;.

Producer John Morrissey, who read the script three years prior, was impressed by the script&#x27;s intense characters and dialogue. Michael De Luca, then-production president of New Line Cinema, said &quot;I was intrigued by its intensity, conviction and brutal honesty. There was a brilliant character study woven into the screenplay, and I knew we had something special if we did it correctly&quot;. In 1996, the producers first approached Dennis Hopper to direct the film. Hopper turned down the offer, Larry Clark was approached to direct the film, but turned it down due to a scheduling conflict, Tony Kaye was then approached to direct. Kaye, who had been De Luca&#x27;s preferred choice from the beginning, accepted and made his directorial debut in a feature film on &quot;American History X&quot;. He took the contract to a synagogue, &quot;I signed it in front of the rabbi. I thought it would make it good&quot;, Kaye said. After the film was released, De Luca stated &quot;It&#x27;s everything I had hoped for. The performances are explosive and frightening, and the film dramatically demonstrates both the subtle and overt roots of racism while also showing the possibility for redemption&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Joaquin Phoenix was offered the role of Derek Vinyard, but he was not interested. After holding casting calls, Kaye was unable to find a suitable actor for the lead role, but casting director Valerie McCaffrey suggested Edward Norton. Kaye initially objected, feeling that Norton lacked the &quot;weight or presence&quot;, but he eventually conceded. According to executive producer Steve Tisch, Norton&#x27;s passion for the project was &quot;contagious&quot;, and he even agreed to a pay cut of more than $500,000 from his usual $1 million fee, to be cast in the lead. McCaffrey also cast Edward Furlong for the role of Danny Vinyard. To prepare for the role, Norton increased his calorie intake and spent hours in the gym to gain 25 pounds (11 kg) of muscle.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography took place in Los Angeles and Venice Beach, lasting for several months and finishing in May 1997. Kaye served as cinematographer and camera operator, and would often silently walk around the set, scouting for camera angles or visuals. During filming, Kaye established a casual environment for the cast and crew. He welcomed visitors on set, including singer Courtney Love, Norton&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, and British historian John Richardson. Kaye would arrive for work in a Lincoln Town Car with a chauffeur, and a license plate that read &quot;JEWISH&quot;. He carried four cell phones and a fax machine, and during the Passover holidays, Kaye had boxes of matzo delivered to the set. He also discovered at the time a newsletter published by a British political group, the National Front, which said he was a prominent Jew who supposedly controlled Britain&#x27;s media.

Both Furlong and Ethan Suplee found taking on their roles that had hateful views to be uncomfortable. Furlong said &quot;It&#x27;s pretty intense, having to say this incredibly hateful stuff&quot;. The actors had &quot;white power&quot; tattoos painted on their arms, which Suplee forgot to remove one day after filming, and was confronted by a man in a convenience store. Norton recalls &quot;Doing that film created the strangest distortion of perception on me ... the degree to which that film and the magic of camera and art and black and white photography ... made a lot of people think that I was a larger and tougher person than I am&quot;. The flashback scenes were edited to be in black-and-white, whereas the present-day scenes were edited to be in color.

=== Music ===
Kaye hired British composer Anne Dudley to score the film, and wanted the music to be &quot;big and elegiac&quot;. She employed a full orchestra and a boys&#x27; choir, and decided against using hip-hop sounds. She said, &quot;The neo-Nazi faction is personified in the music by a boys choir – what could be a more Aryan sound? ... A calming string orchestra instead provides a much more expressive and timeless palette&quot;.
==Release==
Kaye&#x27;s original cut of the finished film had a run time of 95 minutes, which was delivered on time and within budget. Although it generated a positive response from test screenings, New Line Cinema insisted on further edits to the film. Kaye was mortified, saying &quot;I&#x27;m fully aware that I&#x27;m a first-time director, but I need the same autonomy and respect that Stanley Kubrick gets&quot;. Soon afterwards, Norton was involved with editing alongside Kaye, which was a difficult experience for the pair. At one point, Kaye punched a wall which resulted in stitches to his hand.

In June 1998, the film studio test-screened a second cut of the film which included changes made by Norton. The studio tried to persuade Kaye to release Norton&#x27;s cut, but he objected. Although the differences between the two cuts are disputed, Kaye objected to an additional 18 minutes of footage, and they disagreed with the length of certain scenes such as a family argument, Norton&#x27;s anti-immigration speech, and a flashback where Norton&#x27;s father is criticizing a teacher. Subsequently, the studio compromised and gave Kaye an extra eight weeks to edit and submit a new cut of the film.

During this period, Kaye took a number of combative actions. He spent $100,000 on cryptic advertisements in the Hollywood press that quoted John Lennon and Abraham Lincoln, and condemned the behavior of Norton and the studio. At one point, Kaye brought a priest, a rabbi and a Buddhist monk to a meeting with producers while videotaping the entire encounter. When the company offered him an additional eight weeks to re-cut the film, Kaye said he had a &quot;radical&quot; new vision in mind, which he did not know when he would finish. He collaborated with Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott on new narration for the film.

&quot;American History X&quot; was due to premiere at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival, but Kaye requested that organizer Piers Handling withdraw the film. On July 28, 1998, after the eight week deadline, Kaye had nothing new to show and the studio announced that it would release Norton&#x27;s cut. Kaye attempted to remove his name from the film credits, applying for various pseudonyms, including &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, a request that the Directors Guild of America (DGA) refused. Kaye subsequently filed a $200 million lawsuit against DGA and New Line Cinema, although the case was dismissed in 2000. Kaye disowned the film, describing the released version, which was 24 minutes longer than his own cut, as a &quot;total abuse of creativity&quot; and &quot;crammed with shots of everyone crying in each other&#x27;s arms&quot;. Kaye&#x27;s behavior caused Hollywood to view him as unemployable, and he did not watch the film until June 2007. He later admitted that &quot;My ego got in the way. That was entirely my fault. [...] Whenever I can, I take the opportunity to apologize&quot;. He did not direct another film until 2006&#x27;s &quot;Lake of Fire&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released by New Line Home Video on DVD on April 6, 1999, on laserdisc on April 13, and on VHS on August 24 of the same year. The film was later released on Blu-ray on April 7, 2009, including seven minutes of deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;American History X&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on October 28, 1998, and on the same week in New York. It received a wider release in the United States on October 30. The film grossed $156,076 in 17 theaters during its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $6,719,864 from 513 theaters in the United States, for a worldwide total of $23,875,127.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;American History X&quot; has an approval rating of 84% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;American History X&quot; doesn&#x27;t contend with its subject matter as fully as it could, but Edward Norton&#x27;s performance gives this hard-hitting drama crucial weight.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted score of 62 out of 100 based on 32 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, gave &quot;American History X&quot; four out of four stars, describing it as &quot;a shockingly powerful screed against racism that also manages to be so well performed and directed that it is entertaining as well&quot;, adding it was &quot;also effective at demonstrating how hate is taught from one generation to another&quot;. He said Norton was an &quot;immediate front-runner&quot; for an Academy Award. Todd McCarthy, writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, gave the film a positive review stating &quot;This jolting, superbly acted film will draw serious-minded upscale viewers interested in cutting-edge fare&quot;. He particularly praised Norton&#x27;s performance, saying &quot;His Derek mesmerizes even as he repels, and the actor fully exposes the human being behind the tough poses and attitudinizing&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Though its story elements are all too easily reduced to a simple outline, &quot;American History X&quot; has enough fiery acting and provocative bombast to make its impact felt. For one thing, its willingness to take on ugly political realities gives it a substantial . For another, it has been directed with a mixture of handsome photo-realism and visceral punch&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, but was critical of the underdeveloped areas, stating &quot;the movie never convincingly charts Derek&#x27;s path to race hatred&quot;. Ebert concluded &quot;This is a good and powerful film. If I am dissatisfied, it is because it contains the promise of being more than it is&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film &quot;riveting&quot;, and praised the narrative structure despite &quot;thinness of the script&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; expressed disappointment with the picture. LaSalle felt that while it succeeded in portraying Derek&#x27;s descent into neo-Nazism, it failed to portray his renouncement of his past beliefs, &quot;We had to watch him think his way in. We should see him think his way out&quot;. LaSalle also noted that &quot;In some places the dialogue is surprisingly stilted. Far worse, the ending is a misfire&quot;. However, he complimented Norton&#x27;s performance. Stephen Hunter, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, was highly critical of the film and gave it a negative review, calling it &quot;an old melodramatic formula hidden under pretentious TV-commercial-slick photography&quot;. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan wrote &quot;There are moments when Anne Dudley&#x27;s string-laden score overpowers the stark simplicity of the film&#x27;s message and other times when the moral of brotherly love is hammered a bit heavily&quot;, but conceded &quot;the blunt and brutal &quot;American History X&quot; is ultimately only as imperfect as we ourselves are&quot;.

===Accolades===
Edward Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Derek Vinyard, but lost to Roberto Benigni for &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;. Norton&#x27;s loss was included on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;22 Incredibly Shocking Oscars Injustices&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
In 1999, Amnesty International USA used &quot;American History X&quot; for an educational campaign, screening the film in colleges and in nationwide events for raising awareness on human rights. Zara Toussaint, of Amnesty International in France, organized screenings in her country followed by debates. &quot;The reactions [to the film] were varied. Some people thought that this was only an extreme case, that this kind of group was very marginal and that there could be no equivalent in France&quot;, she said. In response to the French screening, Sébastien Homer of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; wrote, &quot;Police violence, the Rodney King affair, unsanitary prisons, ill-treatment, rejection of asylum seekers, the United States has still not assimilated what human rights, freedom, equality meant&quot;. In September 1999, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked the film 311th in a list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. In 2008, Norton&#x27;s performance was ranked by &quot;Total Film&quot; as the 72nd greatest film performance of all time. Although director Kaye did not watch the film until 2007, he has acknowledged that it has become &quot;quite a little classic in its own befuddled way&quot;. In 2012, he said that he was &quot;very proud of what we all achieved&quot;.

For its 20th anniversary, Christopher Hooton writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; opined that the film &quot;feels more essential now that it ever has&quot;. Clayton Schuster of &quot;Vice&quot; drew comparisons between the film and both the racial rhetoric of Donald Trump and real life atrocities; the murders of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in 2015, a far-right march in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, and a year later, a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue. He argues that these violent acts are no different to the hate represented in the movie, adding, &quot;White supremacy has existed for centuries. It&#x27;s lurked on the fringes of American power since the birth of this nation&quot;. He added &quot;there is at least one notable difference ... The movie portrays skinheads as visually different ... They&#x27;re suited up in boots with red laces, heads gleaming from a fresh shave, and tatted with Nazi insignia and racist slogans. White supremacists today have largely adopted a policy of fitting into society rather than standing out&quot;. Writing for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 2018, Justin Kirkland stated that he believed that &quot;Perhaps the reason that &quot;American History X&quot; still feels so relevant two decades after its release is because we haven&#x27;t done enough for it not to be ... I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;re going to be writing about &quot;American History X&quot; forever. I&#x27;m afraid of what will happen if we don&#x27;t&quot;.

<text>Terrazo is a book written in 1947 by Puerto Rican writer Abelardo Díaz Alfaro. The book won many awards, including that of the Sociedad de Periodistas Universitario y Instituto de Literatura Puertorriqueña, and made it to the national libraries of many other Latin American countries where Diaz Alfaro was a known and respected writer.

&quot;Terrazo&quot; tells the stories, in fiction, of various Puerto Rican villages and people. The majority of these stories are told from the perspective of &quot;jíbaros&quot; (simple country people with little to no education). The stories use jíbaro language, which is slang Spanish. The writer&#x27;s father was a social worker in Puerto Rico and passed these stories to A. David Alfaro. The stories, while fiction, are based on stories they heard or were told by the country people. Its 20 chapters, while made up of fictional stories, talk in comical terms about the way many of the jíbaros used to talk and describe their lives and their reasoning, such as how they perceived Santa Claus.

The book has been considered by many as one of the tools that helped Puerto Rican people realize the ways, stories and life of the poor in Puerto Rico&#x27;s past.

A Republican, he is the son of former New Hampshire Governor and former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, and the older brother of Chris Sununu, the governor of New Hampshire from 2017 to 2025. In 2008, Sununu lost his re-election bid to former governor Jeanne Shaheen.

==Early life and education==
Sununu, one of eight siblings, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of former New Hampshire First Lady Nancy (née Hayes) and former Governor of New Hampshire and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.

His father&#x27;s paternal ancestors came to the United States from the Middle East around the start of the 20th century, while his paternal grandmother was an immigrant from El Salvador, born to a prominent Salvadoran family of Lebanese, Hispanic and Greek descent who were Greek Orthodox Christians. His father&#x27;s paternal ancestry is Lebanese and Greek, both from the Greek Orthodox communities in Jerusalem. Despite the family&#x27;s emigration from Jerusalem, some members of the family were from Beirut. His father&#x27;s maternal ancestry was Greek and Hispanic. His father, John, was born in Havana, Cuba. His paternal grandfather, also named John, was born in the United States, and most of the last two generations of Sununus were also born in the United States. His mother&#x27;s ancestors include immigrants from Ireland, as well as Scotland and England.

Sununu earned both B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in 1991. After graduating, he worked in the high-tech industry, at one time for the company of Dean Kamen and as a management consultant for PRTM.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1996, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Bill Zeliff decided to run for Governor of New Hampshire. Sununu narrowly defeated Democrat Joe Keefe. In 1998, he won re-election with 67% of the vote beating Democrat Peter Flood. In 2000, he won re-election defeating Democrat Martha Fuller Clark with 53% of the vote.

===Tenure===
In 1999, New Hampshire&#x27;s Christian Coalition gave &quot;pro-family&quot; awards to both New Hampshire Representatives, Sununu and Charles Bass, honoring the vote by both men to impeach President Bill Clinton.

On November 8, 2000, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; noted Sununu&#x27;s defeat of Democratic newcomer Martha Fuller Clark, noting that Sununu had &quot;one of the House&#x27;s most conservative voting records&quot;—opposing abortion and increased minimum wages while favoring school vouchers and the death penalty. He earned a 100% rating from the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. He has also been presented the &quot;Spirit of Enterprise Award&quot; by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the &quot;Guardian of Small Business Award&quot; by the National Federation of Independent Business, and the &quot;Friend of the Taxpayer Award&quot; by the Americans for Tax Reform.

===Committee assignments===
He served on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees. He held subcommittee seats on the Veterans Administration-Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, the Treasury Postal Subcommittee, and the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee, and also served as a member of the Republican Policy Committee.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

====2002====
In 2002, Sununu ran for a United States Senate seat from New Hampshire. In the Republican primary, he defeated the Republican incumbent Bob Smith 54%–45%. In the November election, he subsequently defeated Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen 51%–46%. The election was marred by members of the Republican Party who organized the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal which disrupted Democratic efforts.

====2008====
In a rematch, Shaheen defeated Sununu 52% to 45%. She won every county but Carroll, Belknap, and Rockingham counties. Sununu slightly outperformed Republican presidential candidate John McCain in the 2008 national election, as McCain got about 45% of the vote but did not win any counties.

===Tenure===
According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; study, Sununu voted with the Republican Party&#x27;s position 84% of the time. However, he broke with his party on prominent issues, joining Democrats in filibusters of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bush administration&#x27;s 2003 energy bill. Sununu strongly supported greater access to firearms, voting against the proposed renewal of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 2004. In 2006, he voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. He strongly opposed amnesty for illegal aliens, voting against the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill in July 2007. Sununu called for a tougher federal regulator for government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and with Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), he filed a dramatic overhaul of regulation of the insurance industry. A long proponent of technology, in January 2007, Sununu called for a permanent ban on taxes of Internet connections and online sales.

The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Sununu a composite rating of 65.8% conservative and 34% liberal in 2008. Sununu was one of only three senators whose voting record received a score of 100% from the fiscally conservative Club for Growth, in both 2005 and 2006, tying for 1st place. However, his rating fell to 23rd place in 2007, and to 34th place in 2008. The Club for Growth endorsed Sununu&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for re-election in February 2007 against Jeanne Shaheen (she subsequently during 2009–2012 earned Club for Growth ratings of 64th place to 100th place).

In 2007, Sununu was the lead Republican co-sponsor of the Clean Air Planning Act of 2007 which sought to address air quality and climate change by establishing a schedule to reduce harmful emissions from power plants—in particular, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides—as well as decrease carbon dioxide emissions through a cap and trade system. The legislation, which was never enacted, also addressed mercury pollution, calling for a 90% reduction in emissions of the chemical by 2015. He also supported the bipartisan Clean Energy Stimulus Act of 2008 that provides tax incentives for the development of clean and renewable energy sources. In 2006 Sununu sponsored the bipartisan New England Wilderness Act which added tens of thousand of acres of land to federally protected forests. Sununu opposed the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, which would have also created a cap-and-trade program. His vote was criticized by the New Hampshire Democratic Party which claimed that he had acted &quot;against reducing greenhouse gases&quot;. The &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot; praised his decision, citing the Energy Information Agency&#x27;s estimation that the legislation would cost the American economy $507 billion over 22 years.

Sununu took a few positions contrary to the Bush administration and the Republican leadership. Though he voted for the flag-burning amendment, he voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment and he opposed restrictions on travel and trade with Cuba, and was one of only two Republicans to vote in favor of terminating funds for TV Martí, which broadcasts anti-Castro programming in Cuba. He was one of a small group of Republicans to vote in favor of banning loans to China for any nuclear projects, and in September 2005 he voted to disapprove a new rule set in place by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) delisting coal and other energy sources from the Clean Air Act.

He also became well known as one of the five Republican senators who joined Democrats in a filibuster of the USA PATRIOT Act renewal conference report, concerned about possible negative impacts the bill had on civil liberties. This caused the Republican leadership to extend the original legislation until a compromise bill was forged.

In January 2006, at a hearing in front of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on the Broadcast Flag, Sununu was one of the very few present to criticize the legislation, saying &quot;In all cases [of previous technological advancements in the US], we didn&#x27;t need to step in with a significant statutory government-regulated mandate on technology that consumers use to enjoy this material&quot;.

In October 2006, Sununu voted against a portion of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that would suspend the right of habeas corpus for non-citizen detainees. After voting in favor of the final bill, he defended his vote by telling reporters &quot;The Constitution is not a suicide pact&quot;.

On March 14, 2007, Sununu became the first Republican senator to call for the firing of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after a controversy over U.S. Attorney firings. Sununu cited his anger with the mismanagement by Gonzales and the lack of trustworthiness by GOP senators towards Gonzales.

In July 2005, Sununu shaved his head to show solidarity with Senator Arlen Specter, who had lost his hair due to chemotherapy for Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

In September 2008, Sununu became one of twenty senators (ten Democrats and ten Republicans) co-sponsoring a bipartisan energy bill, the New Energy Reform Act of 2008. The bill was offered as an alternative to the Democrats&#x27; energy bill, sponsored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Both bills proposed to increase offshore drilling, while promoting conservation and alternative energy. The &quot;Gang of Twenty&quot; bill also lets coastal states participate in decisions and in revenue about drilling in the fifty-to-one-hundred-mile range off their coasts. It also differs from the Democrats&#x27; bill in allowing drilling off Florida&#x27;s west coast, a proposal both Florida&#x27;s senators have protested. To quote the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;Nearly every potentially vulnerable Senate Republican, from Norm Coleman [of Minnesota] to Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire, has signed on to the legislation.&quot;

==Later career==

On July 7, 2010, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP announced that Sununu was joining the firm as an adjunct senior policy advisor. Akin Gump is one of the largest law firms and lobbying firms in Washington, D.C.

Sununu was appointed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP) for the Troubled Asset Relief Program funds, whose purpose is to assess how the TARP program is working, in order to help Congress determine whether to continue injecting capital into the financial sector.

Sununu is a regular op-ed contributor to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;.

Prior to the 2014 election cycle, speculation had abounded that he would pursue a rematch against Shaheen, but in April 2013, he said that he would not run for his old seat.

On January 30, 2019, Lloyd&#x27;s of London announced Sununu had been appointed to its governing council.

==Personal life==
Sununu married Catherine (Kitty) Halloran on July 9, 1988. They have three children: John, (Catherine) Grace, and Charlotte.

<text>Shmuel Schneersohn (or Rabbi Shmuel of Lubavitch or The Rebbe Maharash) (29 April 1834 – 14 September 1882 OS) was an Orthodox rabbi and the fourth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch Chasidic movement.

==Biography==

Shmuel Schneersohn was born in Lyubavichi, on 2 Iyar 5594 (1834), the seventh son of Menachem Mendel Schneersohn. He faced competition from three of his brothers, primarily from Yehuda Leib Schneersohn who established a dynasty in Kapust upon their father&#x27;s death. Other brothers also established dynasties in Lyady, Nizhyn, and Ovruch.

In 1848, Schneersohn was married to the daughter of his brother, Chaim Shneur Zalman Schneersohn. After several months she died, and he then married Rivkah, a granddaughter of his own grandfather Dovber Schneuri. He had three sons, Zalman Aharon, Shalom Dovber, and Menachem Mendel, as well as one daughter, Devorah Leah.

Schneersohn was said to have had chariots on call for the evacuation of books in time of fire.

Besides his communal activism, he had wide intellectual interests. He spoke several languages, including Latin. He wrote widely on a range of religious and secular topics, and much of his writing has never been published and remains in manuscript form alone. His discourses began to be published for the first time under the title &quot;Likkutei Torat Shmuel&quot; in 1945 by Kehot, and 12 volumes have so far been printed.

He died in Lyubavichi, on 13 Tishrei 5643 (1882), leaving three sons and two daughters, and was succeeded by his son Sholom Dovber.

Schneersohn urged the study of Kabbalah as a prerequisite for one&#x27;s humanity:
A person who is capable of comprehending the &quot;seder hishtalshelus&quot; (kabbalistic secrets concerning the coming-into-being of all existence every moment) - and fails to do so - cannot be considered a human being. At every moment and time one must know where his soul stands. It is a mitzvah (commandment) and an obligation to know the &quot;seder hishtalshelus&quot;.

==Aphorisms==
&quot;The world says, &#x27;If you can&#x27;t crawl under, climb over.&#x27; But I say, &quot;Lechatchilah Ariber&quot;--&#x27;At the outset, one should climb over.&#x27;&quot;
&quot;You cannot fool God; ultimately, you cannot fool others either. The only one you can fool is yourself. And to fool a fool is no great achievement.&quot;
&quot;because better is better, is good not good? rather good is good, and better is better!&quot;

&quot;Why are you demanding of me? Demand of yourself! If you toil and fill your mind with Torah there won&#x27;t be any space for foreign thoughts! break your desires and you will feel great pleasure in prayer!&quot;

<text>The Hurricane is a 1999 American biographical sports drama film directed and produced by Norman Jewison. The film stars Denzel Washington as Rubin &quot;The Hurricane&quot; Carter, a former middleweight boxer who was wrongly convicted of a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. The script was adapted by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon from Carter&#x27;s 1974 autobiography &quot;The Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender To 45472&quot; and the 1991 non-fiction work &quot;Lazarus and the Hurricane: The Freeing of Rubin &quot;The Hurricane&quot; Carter&quot; by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton.

The film depicts Carter&#x27;s arrest, his life in prison, and how he was freed by the love and compassion of a teenager from Brooklyn named Lesra Martin and his Canadian foster family. The film received positive reviews and won several awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama for Washington&#x27;s performance. Washington was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

The film was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on December 29, 1999. It grossed $74 million against a budget of $50 million.

==Plot==
In 1966, Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter was a promising and top-ranked middleweight boxer from Patterson, New Jersey, who was expected by many fans in to become the world&#x27;s greatest boxing champion. However, when three people, specifically the club&#x27;s bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police moments after the crime while the police were investigating the killings.

Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, &quot;were never suspects,&quot; letting them go after questioning them, a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, who was also questioned by police claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders and committed the killings themselves. On the basis of Bello&#x27;s testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the bar, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences.

Throughout his time in prison, Carter proclaimed his innocence, claiming that his race was the real reasons for his conviction while he wrote and published his autobiography. Eight years later, Bello and a co-suspect, Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, renounced and recanted their testimony. However, Carter and Artis were convicted once again.

Following the second trial that sent Carter and Artis back to prison, Lesra Martin, an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, goes to live in Toronto with a group of Canadian activists who see his academic potential and offter to raise him as his tutors. In the 1980s, he becomes interested in Carter&#x27;s life after purchasing a copy of Carter&#x27;s autobiography which he reads and is convinced of his innocence after which he and his Canadian foster family commit themselves to Carter&#x27;s case as they join Carter&#x27;s legal team to push the State of New Jersey to reexamine Carter&#x27;s case.

In 1985, a Federal District Court presided over by Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, ruled that the prosecution in Carter&#x27;s second trial committed &quot;grave constitutional violations&quot; and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. As a result, Carter (and later Artis) were finally freed. Both before and after the verdict that set him free, Carter summed up his story by saying, &quot;Hate got me into prison, love got me out.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Background===
Norman Jewison became interested in a &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter biopic in 1992. Armyan Bernstein purchased the filming rights through Beacon Pictures, and went on to write the first scripts while establishing a financing partnership with Irving Azoff. At first, Jewison felt the story was so extensive that it would fit better as a television miniseries.

Once Denzel Washington signed to play the title character, he went through long boxing training, and worked closely with Rubin Carter. Washington said, &quot;He went through pots and pots of coffee and packs of cigarettes. I&#x27;d drink a little coffee. It&#x27;s interesting and challenging when the person is there, alive and in the room.&quot;

Filming began in November 1998, with locations in both New Jersey – East Jersey State Prison in Rahway and the cities of Avenel and Paterson – and Toronto.

===Soundtrack===

==Release==
===Premiere===

&quot;The Hurricane&quot; premiered on September 17, 1999, at the Toronto International Film Festival. It also was featured at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2000.

Two weeks prior to its opening in North America, a premiere for &quot;The Hurricane&quot; was held at the Mann Village Theater in Los Angeles. Many of the depicted people were in attendance. When asked about being portrayed by Denzel Washington, Rubin Carter replied that “I didn’t know I was that good-looking.&quot; The film was praised by Lesra Martin, who described it as &quot;a stupendous depiction of accurate events&quot;, and John Artis, Carter&#x27;s friend who was convicted with him, said he “was in awe to see what unfolded and not have to feel the pressure I felt at the time.” An objection was held by H. Lee Sarokin, the federal judge who freed Carter, saying that unlike his portrayal by Rod Steiger “I’m a lower-key guy.”

===Box office===
The film opened in North American limited release on December 29, 1999. The first week&#x27;s gross was $384,640 (11 screens) and the total receipts for the run were $50,668,906. In its widest release the film was featured in 2,148 theaters. It closed the week of April 14, 2000. The motion picture was in circulation sixteen weeks.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Hurricane&quot; has an 83% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 115 reviews. The consensus reads: &quot;Thanks in large part to one of Denzel Washington&#x27;s most powerful on-screen performances, &quot;The Hurricane&quot; is a moving, inspirational sports drama, even if it takes few risks in telling its story.&quot; Roger Ebert, film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, liked the film and the acting, and wrote, &quot;This is one of Denzel Washington&#x27;s great performances, on a par with his work in &quot;Malcolm X.&quot;... Washington as Hurricane Carter is spare, focused, filled with anger and pride... This is strong stuff, and I was amazed, after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film, to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts, until at the end I was blinking at tears. What affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness, but goodness.&quot; Metacritic gave the score a film of 74 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Ebert discussed his perspective on the &quot;fictionalized&quot; aspects of the film: &quot;Several people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was &#x27;fictionalized&#x27;. Well, of course it was. Those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. Most biopics, like most grandmothers, see the good in a man and demonize his enemies. They pass silently over his imprudent romances. In dramatizing his victories, they simplify them. And they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters. If they didn&#x27;t, we wouldn&#x27;t pay to see them.&quot; He added, &quot;&quot;The Hurricane&quot; is not a documentary but a parable, in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word.&quot;

Film critic Stephen Holden, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, had mixed views of the film but praised the acting. He wrote: &quot;In telling the story of Mr. Carter&#x27;s protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice, &quot;The Hurricane&quot; rides to glory on an astonishing performance by Denzel Washington... That is to say, Mr. Washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark. If his Hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility, it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character&#x27;s forcefully articulate surface.&quot;

Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian, gave the film a &quot;B&quot;, but cited issues with historical accuracy, including depictions of Carter&#x27;s military service, prior criminal record, and the Giardello fight. She also stated that the inclusion of negative aspects of Carter&#x27;s life would not have made it acceptable &quot;that he was wrongfully convicted of three murders.&quot;

Jewison considered &quot;The Hurricane&quot; his best work.

==Lawsuit==
Former middleweight World Champion Joey Giardello sued the film&#x27;s producers for libel over the depiction of his fight with Carter as a &quot;racist fix.&quot; Giardello stated: &quot;Virtually every boxing expert then and now will tell you I won the fight.&quot; Referee Robert Polis who scored the fight 72–66 in Giardello&#x27;s favor stated: &quot;They portrayed Joey Giardello as an incompetent fighter. I thought it was ludicrous.&quot;. Even Carter himself agreed that Giardello was the rightful victor of the fight.

Eventually, the case was settled out of court, with the producers paying the retired champion damages and with Jewison agreeing to make a statement on the DVD version that &quot;Giardello no doubt was a great fighter.&quot;

<doc id="171574" wikidata="Q6517325" url="?curid=171574" title="Legacy of the Great Irish Famine">
<text>The legacy of the Great Famine in Ireland ( or &quot;An Drochshaol&quot;, litt: &quot;The Bad Life&quot;) followed a catastrophic period of Irish history between 1845 and 1852 during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 50 percent.

The Great Famine (1845–1849) was a watershed in the history of Ireland. Its effects permanently changed the island&#x27;s demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various nationalist movements. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as &quot;pre-Famine&quot;.

==Political and cultural impact==

===In Ireland===
Political reaction resulting from the Great Irish Famine was muted, because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time. Irish politics in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the Catholic Emancipation and &quot;Repeal&quot; movements under Daniel O&#x27;Connell. (The Independent Irish Party, formed in June 1852, disintegrated within four years, but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices.)

Outside the mainstream, too, reaction was slow. The 1848 Young Ireland rebellion under Thomas Davis, though occurring at the start of the Famine, was hardly impacted upon &quot;by&quot; the Famine, as much as by the clash between the &quot;constitutional&quot; nationalism and Catholicism of O&#x27;Connell and the pluralist republicanism of Davis. Another rebellion would not occur again until the 1860s under the Fenians/Irish Republican Brotherhood. Historians have speculated that, such was the economic and social impact on Ireland, the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards; in other words, that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

Though its electorate was a small part of the population (as elsewhere in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), those Irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major British political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals, with more votes and seats going to the latter, even though it had been the party of government during the Famine. The introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 enabled the Home Rule League to largely replace the Liberals in Irish politics in 1874. The Home Rule League was reconstituted as the Irish Parliamentary Party, under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s; Parnell was also instrumental in establishing the Irish Land League, to achieve land reform. A large body of voters continued to vote for unionists, who wished to maintain the Union that joined Britain and Ireland.

The British Royal Family avoided some censure, due to their perceived impotence in political affairs. Although some believed the myth that Queen Victoria (known in Ireland in later decades as the &quot;Famine Queen&quot;) had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief, in fact the sum was £2,000, the equivalent of between £217,000 and £8,120,000 in 2022, from her personal resources. She also was patron of a charity that fundraised. On instruction of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849. However, this visit was conducted under stringent security measures and was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit just after the famine were compared to &quot;illuminating a graveyard&quot; in a newspaper editorial at the time.

An additional social impact due to the high numbers of children orphaned was that for some young women, prostitution was one of few options available. Some of these young women became known as Wrens of the Curragh.

===Linguistic consequences===

It is estimated that one and a half million people died during the Famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851. A large proportion of these were Irish speakers, and the poorest districts, from which emigration continued to flow, were generally Irish-speaking. The Famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language (the general exclusion of Irish from public life and the influence of the English-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part) but it was a conspicuous element. This led to the creation of an Ireland which thought of itself as essentially English-speaking, though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the Gaelic League and the growth of a network of urban Irish-speaking activists from the late nineteenth century on.

In pre-Famine Ireland Irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition. The latter persisted in the form of Irish language manuscripts containing both prose and poetry: a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature. Many such manuscripts were taken to America by emigrants in the 1840s and after.

The emigration of numerous Irish speakers to America as an immediate or long-term result of the Famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the Irish language. This was marked in part by the foundation of Philo-Celtic Societies and the founding of the monthly journal &quot;An Gaodhal&quot; in 1881, the first such publication anywhere in which Irish was extensively used.

===Irish emigrants abroad===

If the political elite in Ireland remained tolerant of British political parties and the monarchy, emigrants were not so. Many Irish emigrants to the United States quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the IRB. The political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the States confirmed for them the potential of an independent Ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home.

The Famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger, as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place. John Mitchel, a journalist by trade (who had written for Thomas Davis&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Nation&quot; before leaving to set up his own paper, only to be arrested, tried for sedition and transported to the penal colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) who continued to campaign against British rule in Ireland after moving to the United States. Analysing the famine, he wrote:

Mitchel&#x27;s commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants, who saw themselves as the dispossessed, forced from Ireland by a famine they blamed on British government policies. The famine became a constant issue with Irish Americans, who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the United States, remained emotionally attached to their native land. Leaders such as John Devoy in later decades came to play a major role in supporting Irish independence. It was no accident that the President of Dáil Éireann, Éamon de Valera in 1920 chose to travel to the United States, not elsewhere, in his efforts to get the Irish Republic recognised and accepted, or that when Michael Collins launched special bonds to fund the new Republic, many were sold to Irish Americans.

==Genocide==
During and after the famine, some commentators have claimed that the British government&#x27;s response, while it occurred, amounted to genocide, a contention which is disputed. American professor of international law and human rights campaigner Francis Boyle has claimed in his 2011 work &quot;United Ireland, Human Rights and International Law&quot; that the famine amounted to genocide by the British government, a view which was supported by historian James Mullin. However, numerous Irish, British and American scholars, such as academics F. S. L. Lyons, John A. Murphy, R. F. Foster, and James S. Donnelly Jr., as well as historians Cecil Woodham-Smith, Peter Gray, Ruth Dudley Edwards, and Cormac Ó Gráda have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the Ministry of Lord John Russell) were misguided, ill-informed, and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government&#x27;s response would have been different.

There are public records that there was enough grain and meal in Ireland during that period to have prevented the food shortage caused by the potato blight. Famine conditions were allowed to continue for a number of years in the 1840s, while the surplus food was not distributed. Some have claimed that because emigration was allowed, the Famine period does not qualify as genocide. The poverty, evictions, workshops where workers paid off the cost of their tickets, and the overcrowding and unhygienic conditions on emigration ships, all combined to make the journey of emigrating as great a risk as staying and trying to survive starvation. By modern definitions, the term &quot;refugee&quot; would be more accurate than &quot;emigrant&quot; to describe those who fled Ireland.

==Commemorations==
Ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in the 1990s. It was a contrast, in many ways, with the 100th anniversary in the 1940s. Then, only a few commemorations were held – the most significant of which was a commissioned volume of Famine history edited by R. Dudley Edwards and T. Desmond Williams (though not published until 1956), and the important &#x27;Famine Survey&#x27; undertaken by the Irish Folklore Commission in 1945. Beyond these important cultural aspects, emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of Irish political life in the 1940s, and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims, who had died or emigrated. Some commentators were embarrassed that their ancestors had somehow fed themselves by inevitably not sharing food with the victims, a form of &quot;survivor guilt&quot;.

The 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the Famine, as hundreds of events took place in Ireland and throughout the Irish diaspora, some of which received sponsorship from the National Famine Commemoration Committee based in the Department of the Taoiseach, led by Avril Doyle TD. At the Great Famine Event held in Millstreet, County Cork, a statement from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was read aloud, apologising for the failure of past British governments to adequately address the crisis. A large number of new research studies on the Famine were produced, many detailing for the first time local experiences. Historians re-examined all aspects of the Famine experience; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants, to the long-term impact it had on society, sexual behaviour, land holdings, property rights and the entire Irish identity, personified in the conservatism of Cardinal Cullen, that persisted into the 1900s.

In 2010, Britain failed to send a diplomatic representative to the opening of the National Famine Commemoration at the Murrisk Millennium Peace Park, at the foot of Croagh Patrick, County Mayo. Representatives of 14 other nations were present including the United States and Australia as well as the European Parliament. The Irish government was represented by several ministers. The Taoiseach and President did not attend in person, but sent staff members.

==The Famine in song==
The Famine is also commemorated in song, both from the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, Brendan Graham has written a number of novels and songs on An Gorta Mór – the Great Irish Famine. His book publishing deal with HarperCollins originated from a number of songs he had written about An Gorta Mór, resulting in the publication of his best selling &#x27;documentary novel&#x27; of the Famine – The Whitest Flower (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The Whitest Flower – &#x27;An important addition to the Irish national story&#x27;. The Whitest Flower, with its song &#x27;soundtrack&#x27;, was a required text for Boston&#x27;s MIT Women&#x27;s Studies Course. Along with its sequel The Element of Fire (HarperCollins, 2001), The Whitest Flower was also listed as &#x27;support fiction&#x27; for Ireland&#x27;s Leaving Certificate, History syllabus.

&quot;The Voice&quot; written by Brendan Graham and performed by Eimear Quinn won the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest for Ireland. The lyrics refer to Ireland&#x27;s troubled history and point clearly to Famine times in Ireland, &quot;I am The Voice of your hunger and pain&quot;. As well as entering the British Pop Charts, The Voice was one of the songs studied for the UK GCSE Music Syllabus, 1998. Eimear Quinn&#x27;s version featured in the Pierce Brosnan movie – The Nephew, while the song found a new life in America with the recording and widespread PBS broadcasting of it as part of the group Celtic Woman&#x27;s rise to prominence there. Author and sociologist E. Moore Quinn in her book &#x27;Irish American Folklore in New England&#x27;, published in 2009, quotes the full lyric of The Voice.

&quot;The Fairhaired Boy&quot; – This song written by Brendan Graham was recorded by Cathy Jordan and Dervish on their 2003 album, &#x27;Spirit&#x27;. Carmel Conway also recorded the song on her 2009 album &#x27;This Beautiful Day&#x27;. It is also performed in the &#x27;Cois Tine – Stories of Liam O&#x27; Flaherty&#x27; – by singer and violinist Fionnuala Howard. A song of emigration from Ireland during Famine times, The Fairhaired Boy tells of the sorrow of parting – &#x27;Soon you&#x27;ll in California be or Colorado bound&#x27;. In The Whitest Flower, Graham&#x27;s heroine Ellen sings the song to Roberteen, a young neighbour from Ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto (fever shed) at Canada&#x27;s Quarantine Island of Grosse Ile, Quebec. The song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses, the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener&#x27;s interest alive.

&quot;Crucán na bPáiste&quot; – &#x27;the burial place of (unbaptised) children&#x27; – lies on a hilltop in Maumtrasna, County Mayo, overlooking Loch Na Fooey, and Lough Mask in Ireland. It is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during &quot;Aimsir an Drochshaoil&quot; (&#x27;The Time of the Bad Life&#x27; – the Famine). The song was written by Graham for Ellen Rua, one of the characters in his second novel, The Brightest Day, The Darkest Night, also published by HarperCollins. It has been recorded and performed by a number of artistes most notably Karen Matheson (as part of the Transatlantic Sessions), Cathy Jordan of Dervish and Eimear Quinn. Graham reveals the story of how the song came to be written in his Sunday Miscellany radio piece for RTÉ, called &quot;Effin&#x27; Songs&quot;, recorded live in Ireland&#x27;s National Concert Hall, with Eimear Quinn and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and piper Neil Martin, following with the song itself.

&quot;Crucán na bPáiste had become a claw in my gut – and my pilgrimage. Over many months it inched out in me its cry...focal by focal...line by line...until I was set free and it had found its epiphany. I had learned to keep out of the way...let the song write itself. This, I suppose is the real answer to the question with which we started. The truly special songs write us...we don&#x27;t write them; we don&#x27;t find them...they find us&quot;.

Another of Graham&#x27;s Famine songs, &quot;Ochón an Ghorta Mhóir / Lament of the Great Hunger&quot;, was commissioned by the Irish Government, as part of the Ceól Reoite (Frozen Music – after Goethe&#x27;s &#x27;Architecture is frozen music&#x27;) Millennial Project. Fourteen Irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within. Graham chose the Curvilinear Glasshouses at Dublin&#x27;s National Botanic Gardens (Ireland), constructed at the time of An Gorta Mór, by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting Ireland. The glasshouses looked down over the Gardens&#x27; &#x27;vegetable patch&#x27;, where the blight was first discovered in Ireland in August 1845. Graham has described the &#x27;frozen music&#x27; locked within the architecture of the Curvilinear Glasshouses as &#x27;a lament for a famished people&#x27;. A song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by Róisín Elsafty, on the Ceól Reoite album and as a &#x27;hidden track&#x27; by Cathy Jordan on the Dervish album, Spirit. The song was also performed by Nuala Ní Chanainn in the 2002 production of Aistir/Voyage by the Swiss-based, Cathy Sharp Dance Ensemble.

&quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; – It was in fact reading Graham&#x27;s novel The Whitest Flower, that led Norwegian composer, Rolf Lovland to contact Graham with a melody. This melody in turn inspired Graham to write the lyric – You Raise Me Up, which has been recorded by some 400 artists (including Westlife, Josh Groban, Brian Kennedy and Secret Garden, Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, Helene Fischer, Il Divo, Russell Watson and Paul Potts) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history.

Brendan Graham has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including Writing the Famine in Fiction and Song, for The National Famine Commemoration Week in Ireland, 2010. This was narrated by the author with songs performed by Cathy Jordan accompanied on piano by Feargal Murray.

In Quebec, 2011, his shorter narrative and song piece – From Famine to Freedom – Ireland to Grosse Ile – was performed by the Quebec Symphony Orchestra and soloist Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, with Graham&#x27;s narration translated into French. It included a first performance with orchestra of The Whitest Flower, Graham&#x27;s title song for the soundtrack to his book. In response to the view handed down at the time of Ireland&#x27;s Famine that &quot;The judgement of God ... sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated&quot; (Charles E. Trevelyan – Permanent Assistant Secretary at the British Treasury with prime responsibility for Famine relief in Ireland), Graham&#x27;s song calls to task a vengeful God.

In August 2012 Brendan Graham composed and presented From Famine to Freedom – Ireland to Australia, a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during An Gorta Mór – The Great Irish Famine – and of those who fled the Famine to establish a new life Australia. Graham wrote a new song called, &quot;Orphan Girl&quot;, dedicated to the memory of the 4,112, mainly teenage Irish orphan girls, who were given a free passage to Australia from Workhouses in every county of Ireland between 1848 and 1850. Brendan Graham was joined by Australian singer-songwriter, Sarah Calderwood who unites classic with contemporary folk. She is the charismatic front woman of Australia&#x27;s premier Celtic group, Sunas, who released the ABC best-selling debut album &#x27;As Night Falls&#x27;. Graham and Calderwood were also joined on the day by the inspirational Australian Girls Choir, who have previously performed for Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama. The commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering, especially for those who are descendants of these Irish Workhouse young women. For more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org

More recently in March 2013 The Possible Dreams Choir toured Victoria in Australia, singing &quot;Orphan Girl&quot; (sung by Fortunate and Nomcebo) and &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; as part of their Voices for the Voiceless tour. Possible Dreams International, Inc is a non-profit organisation which partners with rural and remote communities in Swaziland, Southern Africa to empower families and individuals living with extreme poverty, malnutrition and endemic disease. So in Graham&#x27;s &quot;Famine in Song&quot; lyrics, there resonates a global reach.

A famous modern song on the famine is &quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot;, by Pete St. John. Written in three verses, it deals with a fictitious but realistic story of &quot;Michael&quot; being deported to Botany Bay for stealing corn to feed his starving family. Performed in folk, traditional and even reggae versions, it is often sung by supporters of Glasgow&#x27;s Celtic F.C., many of whom are of Irish descent. The song itself sums up the sense of despair, anger and bitterness of famine victims. The song was also covered by Boston punk rock band, the Dropkick Murphys on their 2003 &quot;Blackout&quot; album.
Luka Bloom&#x27;s song &#x27;Forgiveness&#x27; from his album Salty Heaven is sung from the point of view of an Irish Famine refugee who has relocated to Canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness.

Luka Bloom&#x27;s brother Christy Moore also has a song, written by Bloom but recorded by Moore, called &#x27;The City of Chicago,&#x27; that chronicles the effects of the Famine and the subsequent mass emigration.

Pagan metal band Primordial also have a song about the Famine named &quot;The Coffin Ships&quot; on their 2005 album &quot;The Gathering Wilderness&quot;.

Another related song is &quot;Famine&quot; by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, released on the Universal Mother album. The lyrics emphasise the political aspect of the famine.

==Ireland and modern famine relief==
Ireland has been at the forefront of international famine relief. In 1985 Bob Geldof, Irish rock star and founder of Live Aid, revealed that the people of Ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world. Irish NGOs &quot;Goal&quot;, &quot;Concern&quot;, &quot;Trócaire&quot; and &quot;Gorta&quot; play a central role in helping famine victims throughout Africa. In 2000, Bono, lead singer with Irish band U2, played a central role in campaigning for debt relief for African nations in the Jubilee 2000 campaign. The Irish famine experience continues to influence many Irish people in their attitudes towards the developing world and famine victims everywhere.
