<text>Matthew Paige Damon ( ; born October 8, 1970) is an American actor, film producer, and screenwriter. He was ranked among &quot;Forbes&quot;″ most bankable stars in 2007, and in 2010 was one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. He has received various awards and nominations, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for three British Academy Film Awards and seven Primetime Emmy Awards.

Damon made his acting debut in the film &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; (1988) before gaining prominence in 1997 when he and Ben Affleck wrote and starred in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which won them the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. He established himself as a leading man by starring as Tom Ripley in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), Jason Bourne in the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise (2002–2007; 2016), and Linus Caldwell in the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; trilogy (2001–2007). He received a nomination for an Academy Award and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for playing an astronaut stranded on Mars in &quot;The Martian&quot; (2015). He also acted in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006), &quot;The Informant!&quot; (2009), &quot;Invictus&quot; (2009), &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010), &quot;Contagion&quot; (2011), &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; (2019), &quot;Stillwater&quot; (2021), &quot;Air&quot; (2023), and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), the last of which is his highest-grossing feature.

On television, Damon portrayed Scott Thorson in the HBO biopic &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot; (2013), for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. He was Emmy-nominated for his guest role in &quot;30 Rock&quot; in 2011 and hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2019. He also produced the reality series &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; (2001–2015) as well as the film &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; (2016). Damon has performed voice-over work in both animated and documentary films as well as established two production companies with Affleck, Artists Equity, and the former, Pearl Street Films. He has been involved in charitable work with organizations including the One Campaign, H2O Africa Foundation, Feeding America, and Water.org.

== Early life and education ==
Matthew Paige Damon was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 8, 1970, the second son of Kent Telfer Damon, a stockbroker, and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. His father had English and Scottish ancestry, while his mother is of Finnish and Swedish descent; her family surname had been changed from Pajari to Paige. Damon and his family moved to Newton for two years. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and he and his brother returned with their mother to Cambridge, where they lived in a six-family communal house. His brother, Kyle, is a sculptor and artist. Damon has said that, as a teenager, he had felt lonely, as if he did not belong, and that his mother&#x27;s by-the-book approach to child-rearing had made it hard for him to define his own identity.

Damon attended Cambridge Alternative School and Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, and was a good student. He acted in several high-school theater productions, and has credited his drama teacher, Gerry Speca, as having had an important artistic influence on him, although noting wryly that Speca had given Ben Affleck (Damon&#x27;s close friend and schoolmate) the &quot;biggest roles and longest speeches&quot;. He attended Harvard University as a member of the class of 1992, residing in Lowell House, but left before receiving his degree to take a lead role in the film &quot;&quot;. While at Harvard, as an exercise for an English class, Damon wrote an essay in the form of a film treatment which was later developed into the screenplay &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (for which he received an Academy Award). At Harvard, Damon was a member of the Delphic Club, one of the university&#x27;s elite Final Clubs. In 2013, he was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal.

== Career ==
=== 1988–1999: Early work and breakthrough ===

Damon entered Harvard University in 1988, where he appeared in student theater plays, such as &quot;Burn This&quot; and &quot;A... My Name is Alice&quot;. Later, he made his film debut at the age of 18, with a single line of dialogue in the romantic comedy &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;. As a student at Harvard, he acted in small roles such as in the TNT original film &quot;Rising Son&quot; and the ensemble prep-school drama &quot;School Ties&quot;. He left the school in 1992, a semester (12 credits) shy of completing his Bachelor of Arts in English to feature in &quot;Geronimo: An American Legend&quot; in Los Angeles, erroneously expecting the movie to become a big success. Damon next appeared as an opiate-addicted soldier in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, for which he lost in 100 days on a self-prescribed diet and fitness regimen. &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; gained him critical notice, when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; labeled his performance &quot;impressive&quot;.

During the early 1990s, Damon and Affleck wrote &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), a screenplay about a young mathematics genius, an extension of a screenplay he wrote for an assignment at Harvard, having integrated advice from director Rob Reiner, screenwriter William Goldman, and writer/director Kevin Smith. He asked Affleck to perform the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck&#x27;s Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script more seriously. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994, but after a conflict with the company, they convinced Miramax to purchase the script. The film received critical praise; Quentin Curtis of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found &quot;real wit and vigour, and some depth&quot; in their writing and Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Damon &quot;gives a charismatic performance in a demanding role that&#x27;s bound to catapult him to stardom. Perfectly cast, he makes the aching, step-by-step transformation of Will realistic and credible.&quot; It received nine Academy Awards nominations, including Best Actor for Damon; he and Affleck won the Oscar and Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office. The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith&#x27;s 2001 movie &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;.

Speaking of his &quot;overnight success&quot; through &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, Damon said by that time he had been working in the cinema for 11 years, but still found the change &quot;nearly indescribable—going from total obscurity to walking down a street in New York and having everybody turn and look&quot;. Before the film, Damon played the lead in the critically acclaimed drama &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), where he was recognized by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a talented young actor on the brink of stardom.&quot; For the role, Damon regained most of the weight he had lost for &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;. After meeting Damon on the set of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, director Steven Spielberg cast him in the brief title role in the 1998 World War II film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. He co-starred with Edward Norton in the 1998 poker film &quot;Rounders&quot;, where he plays a reformed gambler in law school who must return to playing high-stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks. Despite meager earnings at the box-office, it is considered one of the best poker movies of all time.

Damon then portrayed antihero Tom Ripley in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), a role for which he lost . Damon said that he wanted to display his character&#x27;s humanity and honesty on screen despite his criminal actions. An adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s 1955 novel of same name, the film costarred Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Cate Blanchett, and received praise from critics. &quot;Damon outstandingly conveys his character&#x27;s slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation&quot;, according to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. In &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), he played a fallen angel who discusses pop culture as intellectual subject matter with Affleck&#x27;s character. The film received generally positive reviews, but proved controversial among religious groups who deemed it blasphemous.

=== 2000–2008: Worldwide recognition ===
In 2000, Damon, Affleck, and producers Chris Moore and Sean Bailey founded the production company LivePlanet to create the Emmy-nominated documentary series &quot;Project Greenlight,&quot; which aimed to find and fund worthwhile film projects from novice filmmakers. Among the company&#x27;s projects was the short-lived mystery-hybrid series &quot;Push, Nevada&quot;.

Damon&#x27;s attempts at leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000&#x27;s &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; were commercially and critically unsuccessful. &quot;Variety&quot; said of his work in &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;: &quot;[Damon] just doesn&#x27;t quite seem like a young man who&#x27;s spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with [Penelope] Cruz.&quot; He was similarly deemed &quot;uncomfortable being the center&quot; of Robert Redford&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; by Peter Rainer of &quot;New York&quot; magazine.

During this period, Damon joined two lucrative film series—&quot;Ocean&#x27;s Trilogy&quot; (2001–2007) and &quot;Bourne&quot; (2002–2016)—and produced the television series &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; (2001–2005, 2015). He co-starred as thief Linus Caldwell in the former&#x27;s first installment, Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 2001 ensemble film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, a remake of the Rat Pack&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960). The role was originally meant for Mark Wahlberg, who refused it in favor of other projects. The film grossed $450 million on a budget of $83 million. Damon, alongside Affleck and others, produced the documentary series &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;, aired on HBO and later Bravo, which helped newcomers develop their first film. The series was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004, and 2005. Damon later said that he and Affleck felt proud that the show helped launch the careers of several directors; Damon later served as the executive producer of a number of projects directed by the winners of the show.

Damon began 2002 with writing and starring in &quot;Gerry&quot;, a drama about two friends who forget to bring water and food when they go hiking in a desert. The reviews for the film were generally positive, but it was a box-office failure. He then played amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne in Doug Liman&#x27;s action thriller &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002). Liman considered several actors for the role before he cast Damon. Damon insisted on performing many of the stunts himself, undergoing three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and eskrima. Damon said that before &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; he was jobless for six months, and many of his films during that period under-performed at the box-office. He doubted the film&#x27;s financial prospects, but it proved a commercial success. Reviews for the film were also positive; Roger Ebert praised it for its ability to absorb the viewer in its &quot;spycraft&quot; and &quot;Damon&#x27;s ability to be focused and sincere&quot;. For his role, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Damon among &quot;the decade&#x27;s best mixer of brawn and brains.&quot;

Damon voiced the role of Spirit in the animated film &quot;&quot; (2002) and later played a conjoined twin in &quot;Stuck on You&quot; (2003), which received a mixed critical reception. His major releases in 2004 included starring roles in the sequels &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;. Both films earned more than $280 million at the box-office. In a review for &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, BBC&#x27;s Nev Pierce called the film &quot;a brisk, engrossing and intelligent thriller&quot;, adding, &quot;Damon is one hell of an action hero. He does a lot with very little, imbuing his limited dialogue with both rage and sorrow, looking harder and more haunted as the picture progresses&quot;. For the film, he earned an Empire Award for Best Actor; the award&#x27;s presenter &quot;Empire&quot; attributed Damon&#x27;s win to his &quot;astute, underplayed performance, through which he totally eschews movie star vanity&quot;. He played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm alongside Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy adventure &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; concluded, &quot;Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster&#x27;s teeth and flaunting a fake, &#x27;Masterpiece Theatre&#x27; dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.&quot;

Later in 2005, he appeared as an energy analyst in the geopolitical thriller &quot;Syriana&quot; alongside George Clooney and Jeffrey Wright. The film focuses on petroleum politics and the global influence of the oil industry. Damon says starring in the film broadened his understanding of the oil industry and that he hoped the people would talk about the film afterward. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was mainly impressed with Clooney&#x27;s acting, but also found Damon&#x27;s performance &quot;whiplash&quot;. In 2006, Damon joined Robert De Niro in &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; as a career CIA agent, and played an undercover mobster working for the Massachusetts State Police in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Departed&quot;, a remake of the Hong Kong police thriller &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. Assessing his work in the two films, Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Damon has the unique &quot;ability to recede into a film while also being fully present, a recessed intensity, that distinguishes how he holds the screen.&quot; &quot;The Departed&quot; received critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; in August 2007, Damon was the most bankable star of the actors reviewed, his last three films at that time averaged US$29 at the box office for every dollar he earned. Two of his major releases in 2007 were the films &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, which were the third installments of their respective film series. Both films earned more than $300 million at the box-office. Damon had an uncredited cameo in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Youth Without Youth&quot; (2007) and another cameo in the 2008 Che Guevara biopic &quot;Che&quot;. While he was working on the &quot;Bourne&quot; films, Damon declined an offer from James Cameron to star in his upcoming film &quot;Avatar&quot;, as he did not want to break his &quot;Bourne&quot; contract. Cameron offered Damon 10% of the profits for the film, which went on to become the most successful of all time. Damon said later: &quot;I will go down in history… you will never meet an actor who turned down more money.&quot;

=== 2009–2019: Established actor ===
He made a guest appearance in 2009 on the sixth-season finale of &quot;Entourage&quot; as himself, where he tries to pressure Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) into donating to his real foundation &quot;ONEXONE&quot;. His next role was Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;The Informant!&quot; (2009), in which his Golden Globe-nominated work was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as such: &quot;The star – who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor – is in nimble control as he reveals his character&#x27;s deep crazies.&quot; Also in 2009, Damon portrayed South Africa national rugby union team captain François Pienaar in the Clint Eastwood-directed film &quot;Invictus&quot;, which is based on the 2008 John Carlin book &quot;Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation&quot; and features Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. &quot;Invictus&quot; earned Damon an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. &quot;The New Republic&quot; observed that he brought &quot;it off with low-key charm and integrity.&quot; Damon also lent his voice to the English version of the animated film &quot;Ponyo&quot;, which was released in the United States in August 2009.

In March 2010, Damon and Ben Affleck collaborated once again to create another production company titled Pearl Street Films, a Warner Bros.-based production company. That year, he reunited with director Paul Greengrass, who directed him in the &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, for the action thriller &quot;Green Zone&quot;, which flopped commercially and received a score of 53% on Rotten Tomatoes and ambivalent reception from critics. He appeared as a guest star in an episode of &quot;Arthur&quot;, titled &quot;The Making of Arthur&quot;, as himself. During season 5 of &quot;30 Rock&quot;, he appeared as a guest star in the role of Liz Lemon&#x27;s boyfriend in the episodes &quot;I Do Do&quot;, &quot;The Fabian Strategy&quot;, &quot;Live Show&quot;, and &quot;Double-edged Sword&quot;. Damon&#x27;s 2010 projects included Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Hereafter&quot; and the Coen brothers&#x27; remake of the 1969 John Wayne-starring Western &quot;True Grit&quot;. He also narrated &quot;Inside Job&quot;, a documentary film about the effects of financial deregulation in the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In 2010, he was one of the highest-grossing actors of all time, ranking 37th. In 2011, he starred in &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot;, &quot;Contagion&quot;, and &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;. That same year, the documentary which he narrated, &quot;American Teacher&quot;, opened in New York before national screening. Also in 2011, he voiced a krill named Bill in the animated film &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;. In January 2012, Damon signed a multiyear deal to be the voice of TD Ameritrade advertisements, replacing Sam Waterston as the discount brokerage&#x27;s spokesman. Damon donated all fees from the advertisements to charity. In April 2012, Damon filmed &quot;Promised Land&quot;, directed by Gus Van Sant, which Damon co-wrote with John Krasinski. Damon&#x27;s next film with frequent collaborator Steven Soderbergh was &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot;, a drama about the life of pianist/entertainer Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) with Damon playing Liberace&#x27;s longtime partner Scott Thorson. The film premiered on HBO on May 26, 2013.

Damon starred in the science fiction film &quot;Elysium&quot; (2013), where he played former car-thief-turned-factory-worker Max DeCosta. He also appeared in the science fiction movie &quot;The Zero Theorem&quot; in 2013, directed by Terry Gilliam. That same year, Damon appeared in a 20-second advertisement for Nespresso, directed by Grant Heslov, with whom he worked on &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;. The deal earned him $3 million. Damon also provided voice-over for United Airlines&#x27; resurrected &quot;Fly the Friendly Skies&quot; advertisement campaign in 2013. In 2014, he starred in George Clooney&#x27;s &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;, and played the minor role of scientist Dr. Mann in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar&quot;. That same year, Damon appeared as a celebrity correspondent for &quot;Years of Living Dangerously&quot;.

In 2015, Damon portrayed the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Martian&quot;, based on Andy Weir&#x27;s bestselling novel of the same name, a role that earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Having not returned for the fourth film in the &quot;Bourne&quot; film series, Damon reprised his role in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, reuniting with Paul Greengrass. In 2017, Damon played the lead role in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, a hit internationally and a disappointment at the domestic box office. The film, and Damon&#x27;s casting, were not well received by critics. Later in 2017, he starred in two satires, George Clooney&#x27;s 1950s-set &quot;Suburbicon&quot;, which was released in October, and Alexander Payne&#x27;s comedy &quot;Downsizing&quot;, which was released in December. In September 2018, he portrayed jurist Brett Kavanaugh on the late night sketch series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2019, Damon portrayed Carroll Shelby in the action biographical drama &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, directed by James Mangold.

=== 2021–present: Continued positive critical reception ===
, the films in which he had appeared had collectively earned over $3.88 billion at the North American box office. In 2021, Damon starred in Tom McCarthy&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Stillwater&quot;, playing an unemployed oil rig worker from Oklahoma who sets out with a French woman to prove his convicted daughter&#x27;s innocence. The film had its world premiere at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. IndieWire praised Damon&#x27;s performance as &quot;graced with a quiet softness that offsets the sheer volume of the character he&#x27;s playing&quot;. That same year saw the release of the historical drama &quot;The Last Duel&quot;, which he starred in and co-wrote alongside Ben Affleck. The film, set in medieval France and based on the book of the same name, focuses on the true story of a knight, Jean de Carrouges, portrayed by Damon, who challenges his former friend to a judicial duel after he&#x27;s accused of raping his wife. It premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival and earned positive reviews while being a financial failure at the box office.

In 2023, Damon starred as Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro in &quot;Air&quot;, a drama film about the launch of Air Jordan, co-starring and directed by Affleck. It marked the first release from Affleck and Damon&#x27;s independent production company, Artists Equity, which they had formed in 2022. He also reunited with Christopher Nolan in the biographical film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, playing Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project. The film was a critical and commercial success. Damon will work with Nolan once again on &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, portraying Odysseus.

== Activism ==
Damon, alongside George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch Project, an organization that focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities such as in Darfur. Damon supports One Campaign, which is aimed at fighting AIDS and poverty in Third World countries. He has appeared in their print and television advertising. He is an ambassador for ONEXONE, a nonprofit foundation committed to supporting, preserving, and improving the lives of children at home in Canada, the United States, and around the world.

Damon is a spokesperson for Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization, and a member of their Entertainment Council, participating in their Ad Council public service announcements. He is a board member of Tonic Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes), a company that attempts to halt junk mail delivered to American homes each day. Damon was the founder of the H2O Africa Foundation, the charitable arm of the Running the Sahara expedition, which merged with WaterPartners to create Water.org in July 2009. Water.org has partnered with corporate sponsors to promote awareness and raise funds to support its mission of bringing safe, clean, cost-effective drinking water and sanitation to developing countries. In this context, Damon has been the face of advertising campaigns to promote Water.org in conjunction with products from major sponsors.

In October 2011, Water.org received an $8 million grant from the PepsiCo Foundation to scale up WaterCredit, which provides microloans to families throughout India. Damon has been part of promoting those efforts, tying in with the Aquafina and Ethos Water brands of bottled water owned by PepsiCo and Starbucks. Since 2015, Damon has promoted Anheuser-Busch InBev&#x27;s Stella Artois beer brand as a Water.org partner, including the sale of limited-edition &quot;blue chalice&quot; glasses imprinted with an embellished blue version of the brand&#x27;s logo. In a television advertisement made for broadcast during the 2018 Super Bowl of the United States&#x27; National Football League (NFL), he promoted Water.org and Stella Artois&#x27;s role in supporting its work.

In October 2021, he announced a new partnership with the cryptocurrency trading platform Crypto.com, under which Crypto.com was to make a $1 million donation to Water.org. In the announcement, Damon said, &quot;Crypto.com gave us this great donation, which is amazing. The money that I make for the commercials to promote them, I give 100% of that to Water.org as well. So, it&#x27;s millions of dollars coming in to us.&quot; Damon&#x27;s Crypto.com commercial started rolling out in cinemas late in 2021, and then on television in January 2022, mainly during sports programming such as NFL games. Once it was broadcast widely on television, it sparked much criticism, as did its accompanying &quot;making of&quot; featurette. In &quot;The Independent&quot;, Nathan Place wrote, &quot;Twitter is cringing after a TV commercial starring Matt Damon compared trading cryptocurrency to mankind&#x27;s greatest achievements. In the ad, which aired during Sunday night’s NFL games, Mr Damon makes an abstract plug for crypto.com – a platform for exchanging digital currencies like Bitcoin – while striding past images of explorers and astronauts. &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; published an article by Lexie Cartwright summing up viewer reaction: &quot;Matt Damon&#x27;s new commercial plugging cryptocurrency has been absolutely savaged on social media, with viewers dubbing it &#x27;insulting&#x27; and &#x27;disgusting&#x27;.&quot; The story included a series of tweets, among them one by Carole Cadwalladr of &quot;The Observer&quot; in which she wrote, &quot;There isn&#x27;t enough yuck in the world to describe Matt Damon advertising a Ponzi scheme and comparing it to the moon landings.&quot; Jody Rosen in the New York Times said that &quot;There is something unseemly, to put it mildly, about the famous and fabulously wealthy urging crypto on their fans&quot; and &quot;The bleakness of that pitch is startling.&quot;

== Public image ==
Comedian Jimmy Kimmel had a running gag on his ABC television show, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, where he apologized for not being able to interview Damon at the end of each show. It culminated in a planned skit on September 12, 2006, when Damon stormed off after having his interview cut short. Damon appeared in several of E! Entertainment&#x27;s top ten &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; spoofs. On January 24, 2013, Damon took over his show and mentioned the long-standing feud and having been bumped from years of shows. It involved celebrities who were previously involved in the &quot;feud&quot;, including Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Sarah Silverman.

== Personal life ==
Damon met his Argentine wife, Luciana Bozán, while filming &quot;Stuck on You&quot; in Miami in April 2003. They became engaged in September 2005 and married in a private civil ceremony at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau on December 9, 2005. They have three daughters together born in June 2006, August 2008, and October 2010. He also has a stepdaughter Alexia Barroso (born 1998) from Bozán&#x27;s previous marriage, and considers her to be his own.

The couple has lived in Miami and New York City; and since 2012, they have lived in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles. In 2018, Damon bought a luxury penthouse in New York City&#x27;s Brooklyn Heights neighborhood for $16.5 million.

He is a fan of the Boston Red Sox. After the team won the 2007 World Series, he narrated the commemorative DVD release of the event. He has competed in several World Series of Poker (WSOP) events, including the 2010 World Series of Poker main event. He was eliminated from the 1998 WSOP by poker professional Doyle Brunson.
=== Political and social views===
While discussing the Iraq War on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; in December 2006, Damon expressed concern about inequities across socioeconomic classes with regard to who is tasked with the responsibility of fighting wars.

In an interview with the Sunday Herald in January 2003, Damon expressed his support for gun control with &quot;I actually hate guns. They freak me out.&quot;

Damon is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has made several critical attacks on Republican Party figures. However, he also expressed disappointment over the policies of President Barack Obama. He had a working relationship with the Obama administration, primarily due to his friendship with Jason Furman, his former Harvard roommate who became Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to Obama. In 2012, Damon joined Ben Affleck and John Krasinski in hosting a fundraiser for Democratic Senate nominee Elizabeth Warren. Damon endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

In October and December 2017, Damon made headlines when he made a series of comments regarding the Me Too movement against sexual harassment and misconduct. On October 10, Sharon Waxman, a former reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, mentioned that Damon and Russell Crowe had made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo. In her report, she suspected Lombardo of facilitating incidents of Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s sexual misconduct in Europe. However, Damon clarified later that the calls were solely to reassure her of Lombardo&#x27;s professional qualifications in the film industry. Waxman endorsed Damon&#x27;s statement on Twitter hours later. Also during this time, Damon said that he had heard a story from Ben Affleck that Gwyneth Paltrow, a co-worker on a feature film of his, had been harassed by Weinstein in 1996, but thought &quot;she had handled it&quot; because they continued to work together, and Weinstein &quot;treated her incredibly respectfully&quot;.

In another series of interviews during December 2017, Damon advocated for a &quot;spectrum of behavior&quot; analysis of sexual misconduct cases, noting that some are more serious than others. The comment caused offense to prominent members of the Me Too movement and the public for being &quot;tone-deaf in understand[ing] what abuse is like&quot;. On January 17, 2018, Damon apologized on &quot;The Today Show&quot; for his social commentary, stating that he &quot;should get in the back seat and close [his] mouth for a while&quot;.

In March 2018, Damon and Affleck announced they would adopt the inclusion rider agreement in all their future production deals through their company Pearl Street Films.

In August 2021, Damon sparked controversy after stating in an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he had only &quot;months ago&quot; stopped using the word &quot;fag&quot;, saying that it &quot;was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application&quot;. This had come after an incident in which his daughter left the table due to his usage of the word and &quot;wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous&quot;. He denied ever using the six-letter word &quot;faggot&quot; in his personal life, and, in regard to the word &quot;fag&quot;: &quot;I explained that that word was used constantly and casually and was even a line of dialogue in a movie of mine as recently as 2003... To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but thrilled at her passion, values and desire for social justice.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==

Aside from awards he has garnered for his role as an actor and producer, Damon became the 2,343rd person to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 25, 2007. He reacted to the award by stating: &quot;A few times in my life, I&#x27;ve had these experiences that are just kind of too big to process and this looks like it&#x27;s going to be one of those times.&quot;

* Karl Thopia (Albanian: &quot;Karl Topia&quot;; 1331 – January 1388) was an Albanian feudal prince and warlord who ruled Albanian domains from 1358 until the first Ottoman conquest of Albania in 1388. He claimed the titles &quot;Prince of Albania, Lord of Krujë&quot; and &quot;Duke of Durrës&quot;
* Andrea II Muzaka (c. 1318-1372) was an Albanian nobleman of the Muzaka family and the ruler of the Principality of Muzaka in the 14th century. He inherited the principality from his father, Teodor I Muzaka, who died around 1331. Andrea II is known for having expanded the Principality of Muzaka to its greatest extent, from the southern Adriatic coastline of Albania in the west to Kastoria in the east by the time of his death in 1372. He claimed the titles &quot;Despot of the Kingdom of Albania, Marshal of Albania&quot; and &quot;Despot of Epirus.&quot;
* Demetrio Progoni (Albanian: &quot;Dhimitër Progoni&quot;) was an Albanian leader who ruled as &quot;Prince of the Albanians&quot; from 1208 to 1216 the Principality of Arbanon, the first Albanian state. He was the successor and brother of Gjin Progoni and their father, Progon of Kruja.Gjin Progoni (Latin: &quot;Ginius&quot;) was an &quot;archon&quot; (or lord) of Kruja, located in present-day Albania, from c. 1198 until his death in 1208. He succeeded his father, Progon of Kruja, becoming the second ruler of the Principality of Arbanon. During his reign, he controlled the areas around Elbasan and the fortress of Krujë. He also maintained good ties with the Despotate of Epirus due to the Venetian threat in northern Epirus. Gjin was succeeded by his younger brother Dhimitër Progoni.
* Progon was the first Albanian ruler known by name, an &quot;archon&quot; of the Kruja Fortress (modern Krujë) and its surroundings, known as the Principality of Arbanon. He ruled between 1190 and 1198. Progon was succeeded by his two sons, Gjin, and Dimitri.
* Gregorios Kamonas (fl. c. 1215 – ?) was the Greek-Albanian Lord or Prince of Krujë (Arbanon) in c. 1215. Demetrios Chomatenos (1216–1236) mentioned him as having the title of &quot;sebastos&quot;, given to him by the emperor Alexios III Angelos after 1205, during his stay in the Despotate of Epirus at the court of his nephew Michael I Komnenos Doukas. He first married the daughter of Gjin Progoni, then married Serbian princess Komnena Nemanjić, the daughter of King Stefan Nemanjić and widow of Dimitri Progoni, thus inheriting the rule of Arbanon. He strengthened ties with Serbia and secured Arbanon through an Orthodox alliance. He had a daughter together with Komnena, who married Golem of Kruja the later lord of Kruje.
* Golem of Kruja was an Albanian nobleman who ruled the Principality of Arbanon, in its phase of semi-independency. He was the last ruler of Arbanon before its final annexation in the reemerging Byzantine Empire. His holdings included Krujë and probably Ohrid.
* Leke III Dukagjini (1410-1481) was a 15th-century member of the Albanian nobility, from the Dukagjini family. A contemporary of Skanderbeg, Dukagjini is known for the &quot;Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit&quot;, a code of law instituted among the tribes of northern Albania.

<text>George Lansbury (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929–31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women&#x27;s rights, and world disarmament.

Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury became a socialist in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to the UK Parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action.

In 1912, Lansbury helped to establish the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War, the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury&#x27;s failure to be elected to Parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar Rates Rebellion of 1921.

After his return to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 UK general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.

==Early life==

===East End upbringing===

George Lansbury was born in Halesworth in the county of Suffolk on 22 February 1859. He was the third of nine children born to a railway worker, also named George Lansbury, and Anne Lansbury (née Ferris). George senior&#x27;s job involved the supervision of railway construction gangs; the family was often on the move, and living conditions were primitive. Through his progressive-minded mother and grandmother, young George became familiar with the names of great contemporary reformers—Gladstone, Richard Cobden and John Bright—and began to read the radical &quot;Reynolds&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;. By the end of 1868, the family had moved into the East End of London, the district in which Lansbury would live and work for almost all his life.

The essayist Ronald Blythe has described the East End of the 1860s and 1870s as &quot;stridently English ... The smoke-blackened streets were packed with illiterate multitudes [who] stayed alive through sheer birdlike ebullience&quot;. Interspersed with spells of work, Lansbury attended schools in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel. He then held a succession of manual jobs, including work as a coaling contractor in partnership with his elder brother, James, loading and unloading coal wagons. This was heavy and dangerous work, and led to at least one near-fatal accident.

During his adolescence and early adulthood, Lansbury was a regular attender at the public gallery at the House of Commons, where he heard and remembered many of Gladstone&#x27;s speeches on the main foreign policy issue of the day, the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;. He was present at the riots which erupted outside Gladstone&#x27;s house on 24 February 1878 after a peace meeting in Hyde Park. Shepherd writes that Gladstone&#x27;s Liberalism, proclaiming liberty, freedom and community interests was &quot;a heady mix that left an indelible mark&quot; on the youthful Lansbury.

George Lansbury senior died in 1875. That year young George met fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Brine, whose father Isaac Brine owned a local sawmill. The couple eventually married in 1880, at Whitechapel parish church, where the vicar, J. Franklin Kitto, had been Lansbury&#x27;s spiritual guide and counsellor. Apart from a period of doubt in the 1890s when he temporarily rejected the Church, Lansbury remained a staunch Anglican until his death.

===Australia===
In 1881 Lansbury was a railway contractor employing three men and living in Whitechapel with his wife Elizabeth and the first of twelve children, the new-born Bessie; another daughter, Annie, followed in 1882. Seeking to improve his family&#x27;s prospects, Lansbury decided that their best hopes of prosperity lay in emigrating to Australia. The London agent-general for Queensland depicted a land of boundless opportunities, with work for all; seduced by this appealing prospect, Lansbury and Bessie raised the necessary passage money, and in May 1884 set sail with their children for Brisbane.

On the outward passage, the family experienced illness, discomfort and danger; on one occasion the ship came close to foundering during a monsoon. On arrival at Brisbane in July 1884, Lansbury found that, contrary to the London agent&#x27;s promises, there was a superfluity of labour and work was hard to come by. His first job, breaking stone, proved to be too physically punishing; he moved to a better-paid position as a van driver, but was sacked when, for religious reasons, he refused to work on Sundays. He then contracted to work on a farm some 80 miles inland, to find upon arrival that his employer had misled him about living conditions and terms of employment.

For several months, the Lansbury family lived in extreme squalor before Lansbury secured release from the contract. Back in Brisbane, he worked for a while at the newly built Brisbane cricket ground. As a keen follower of the game he hoped to see the visiting English touring team play but, as Lansbury&#x27;s biographer Raymond Postgate records, &quot;he learned that cricket watching was not a pleasure for workmen&quot;.

Throughout his tenure in Australia, Lansbury sent letters home, revealing the truth about conditions facing immigrants. To a friend he wrote in March 1885: &quot;Mechanics are &quot;not&quot; wanted. Farm labourers are &quot;not&quot; wanted ... Hundreds of men and women are not able to get work ... The streets are foul day and night, and if I had a sister I would &quot;shoot her dead&quot; rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth&quot;. In May 1885, having received from his father-in-law Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home, the Lansbury family left Australia for good and returned to London.

==Radical Liberal==

===First campaigns===
On his return to London, Lansbury took a job in Brine&#x27;s timber business. In his spare time he campaigned against the false prospectuses offered by colonial emigration agents. His speech at an emigration conference at King&#x27;s College in London in April 1886 impressed delegates; shortly afterwards, the government established an Emigration Information Bureau under the Colonial Office. This body was required to provide accurate information on the state of labour markets in all the government&#x27;s overseas possessions.

Having joined the Liberal Party shortly after his return from Australia, Lansbury became first a ward secretary and then general secretary for the Bow and Bromley Liberal and Radical Association. His effective campaigning skills had been noted by leading Liberals, including Samuel Montagu, the Liberal MP for Whitechapel, who persuaded the young activist to be his agent in the 1885 general election. Lansbury&#x27;s handling of this election campaign prompted Montagu to urge him to stand for parliament himself. Lansbury declined this, partly on practical grounds (MPs were then unpaid and he had to provide for his family), and partly on principle; he was becoming increasingly convinced that his future lay not as a radical Liberal but as a socialist. He continued to serve the Liberals, as an agent and local secretary, while expressing his socialism in a short-lived monthly radical journal, &quot;Coming Times&quot;, which he founded and co-edited with a fellow-dissident, William Hoffman.

===London County Council elections, 1889===

In 1888 Lansbury agreed to act as election agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. Cobden, an early supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women&#x27;s rights group, had proposed Cobden as the candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst for Brixton. Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, and control of the police. Specific questions of women&#x27;s rights were largely avoided during the campaign. On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst&#x27;s qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a series of legal actions, she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, to &quot;go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant&quot;. Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.

Lansbury was offended by his party&#x27;s lukewarm support for women&#x27;s rights. In a letter published in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; he made an open call to Bow and Bromley&#x27;s Liberals to &quot;shake themselves free of party feeling and throw the energy and ability they are now wasting on minor questions into ... securing the full rights of citizenship to every woman in the land&quot;. He was further disillusioned by his party&#x27;s failure to endorse the eight-hour maximum working day. Lansbury had formed the view, expressed some years later, that &quot;Liberalism would progress just as far as the great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress&quot;. By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury&#x27;s political home; most of his current associates were avowed socialists: William Morris, Eleanor Marx, John Burns and Henry Hyndman, founder of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Nevertheless, Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election agent for John Murray MacDonald, the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley. He saw his candidate victorious in the July 1892 general election; as soon as the result was declared, Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF.

==Socialist reformer==

===Social Democratic Federation===
Lansbury&#x27;s choice of the SDF, from several socialist organisations, reflected his admiration for Hyndman, whom he considered &quot;one of the truly great ones&quot;. Lansbury quickly became the federation&#x27;s most tireless propagandist, travelling throughout Britain to address meetings or to demonstrate solidarity with workers involved in industrial disputes. Around this time, Lansbury temporarily set aside his Christian beliefs and became a member of the East London Ethical Society. One factor in his disillusion with the Church was the local clergy&#x27;s unsympathetic approach to poor relief, and their opposition to collective political action.

In 1895 Lansbury fought two parliamentary elections for the SDF in Walworth, first a by-election on 14 May, then the 1895 general election two months later. Despite his energetic campaigning he was heavily defeated on each occasion, with tiny proportions of the vote. After these dismal results, Lansbury was persuaded by Hyndman to give up his job at the sawmill and become the SDF&#x27;s full-time salaried national organiser. He preached a straightforward revolutionary doctrine: &quot;The time has arrived&quot;, he informed an audience at Todmorden in Lancashire, &quot;for the working classes to seize political power and use it to overthrow the competitive system and establish in its place state cooperation&quot;. Lansbury&#x27;s time as SDF national organiser did not last long; in 1896, when Isaac Brine died suddenly, Lansbury thought that his family duty required him to take charge of the sawmill, and he returned home to Bow.

In the general election of 1900 a pact with the Liberals in the Bow and Bromley constituency gave Lansbury, the SDF candidate, a straight fight against the Conservative incumbent, Walter Murray Guthrie. Lansbury&#x27;s cause was hindered by his public opposition to the Boer War at a time when war fever was strong, while Guthrie, a former soldier, stressed his military credentials. Lansbury lost the election, though his total of 2,258 votes against Guthrie&#x27;s 4,403 was considered creditable by the press. This campaign was Lansbury&#x27;s last major effort on behalf of the SDF. He became disenchanted by Hyndman&#x27;s inability to work with other socialist groups, and in about 1903 resigned from the SDF to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP). At around this time, Lansbury rediscovered his Christian faith and rejoined the Anglican Church.

===Poor Law guardian===

In April 1893 Lansbury achieved his first elective office when he became a Poor Law guardian for the district of Poplar. In place of the traditionally harsh workhouse regime that was the norm, Lansbury proposed a programme of reform, whereby the workhouse became &quot;an agency of help instead of a place of despair&quot;, and the stigma of poverty was removed. Lansbury was one of a minority socialist bloc which was often able, through its energy and commitment, to win support for its plans.

Education for the poor was one of Lansbury&#x27;s major concerns. He helped to transform the Forest Gate District School, previously a punitive establishment run on quasi-military lines, into a proper place of education that became the Poplar Training School, and was still in existence more than half a century later. At the 1897 annual Poor Law Conference Lansbury summarised his views on poor relief in his first published paper: &quot;The Principles of the English Poor Law&quot;. His analysis offered a Marxist critique of capitalism: only the reorganisation of industry on collectivist lines would solve contemporary problems.

Lansbury added to his public duties when, in 1903, he was elected to Poplar Borough Council. In the summer of that year he met Joseph Fels, a rich American soap manufacturer with a penchant for social projects. Lansbury persuaded Fels, in 1904, to purchase a 100-acre farm at Laindon, in Essex, which was converted into a labour colony that provided regular work for Poplar&#x27;s unemployed and destitute. Fels also agreed to finance a much larger colony at Hollesley Bay in Suffolk, to be operated as a government scheme under the Local Government Board. Both projects were initially successful, but were undermined after the election of a Liberal government in 1906. The new Local Government minister was John Burns, a former SDF stalwart now ensconced in the Liberal Party who had become a firm opponent of socialism. Burns encouraged a campaign of propaganda to discredit the principle of labour colonies, which were presented as money-wasting ventures that pampered idlers and scroungers. A formal enquiry revealed irregularities in the operation of the scheme, though it exonerated Lansbury. He retained the confidence of his electorate and was easily re-elected to the Board of Guardians in 1907.

In 1905 Lansbury was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which deliberated for four years. Lansbury, together with Beatrice Webb of the Fabian Society, argued for the complete abolition of the Poor Laws and their replacement by a system that incorporated old age pensions, a minimum wage, and national and local public works projects. These proposals were embodied at the commission&#x27;s conclusion in a minority report signed by Lansbury and Webb; the majority report was, according to Postgate, &quot;an ill-considered jumble of suggestions ... so preposterously inadequate that no attempts were ever made to implement it.&quot; Most of the minority&#x27;s recommendations in time became national policy; the Poor Laws were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1929.

==National prominence==

===Campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage===

In the general election of January 1906 Lansbury stood as an independent socialist candidate in Middlesbrough, on a strong &quot;votes for women&quot; platform. This was his first campaign based on women&#x27;s rights since the LCC election of 1889. He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels, who agreed to meet his expenses. The local ILP leadership was committed by an electoral pact to support the Liberal candidate, and could not endorse Lansbury, who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote. The campaign had been managed by Marion Coates Hansen, a prominent local suffragist. Under Hansen&#x27;s influence Lansbury took up the cause of &quot;votes for women&quot;; he allied himself with the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU), the more militant of the main suffragist organisations, and became a close associate of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family.

The Liberal government elected in 1906 with a large majority showed little interest in the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage; when they lost their parliamentary majority in the general election of January 1910 they were dependent on the votes of the 40-odd Labour members. To Lansbury&#x27;s dismay, Labour did not use this leverage to promote votes for women, instead giving the government virtually unqualified support to keep the Conservatives out of power. Lansbury had failed to win election as Labour&#x27;s candidate at Bow and Bromley in January 1910; however, the continuing political crisis which developed from David Lloyd George&#x27;s controversial 1909 &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; led to another general election in December 1910. Lansbury again fought Bow and Bromley, and this time was successful.

Lansbury found little support in his fight for women&#x27;s suffrage from his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as &quot;a weak, flabby lot&quot;. In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: &quot;You are beneath contempt ... you ought to be driven from public life&quot;. He was temporarily suspended from the House for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot;. In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his seat to fight a by-election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women&#x27;s suffrage. The suffragettes sent Grace Roe to help with the campaign. He lost to his Conservative opponent, who campaigned on the slogan &quot;No Petticoat Government&quot;. Commenting on the result, the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women.

Out of parliament, on 26 April 1913 Lansbury addressed a WSPU rally at the Albert Hall, and openly defended violent methods: &quot;Let them burn and destroy property and do anything they will, and for every leader that is taken away, let a dozen step forward in their place&quot;. For this, Lansbury was charged with incitement, convicted and, after the dismissal of an appeal, sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment. He immediately went on hunger strike, and was released after four days; although liable to rearrest under the so-called &quot;Cat and Mouse Act&quot;, he was thereafter left at liberty. In the autumn of 1913, at the invitation of Fels, Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday. On his return, he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

===War, &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and Bolshevism===
The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; began as a temporary bulletin during the London printers&#x27; strike of 1910–11. After the strike ended, Lansbury and others raised sufficient funds for the &quot;Herald&quot; to be relaunched in April 1912 as a socialist daily newspaper. The paper attracted contributions from distinguished writers such as H. G. Wells, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw, some of whom, Blythe notes, &quot;weren&#x27;t socialists at all but simply used [the paper] as a platform for their personal literary anarchy.&quot; Lansbury contributed regularly in support of his various causes, in particular the militant suffrage campaign, and early in 1914 assumed the paper&#x27;s editorship.

Before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the &quot;Herald&quot; took a strong anti-war line. Addressing a large demonstration in Trafalgar Square on 2 August 1914, Lansbury blamed the coming conflict on capitalism: &quot;The workers of all countries have no quarrel. They are ... exploited in times of peace and sent out to be massacred in times of war&quot;. Lansbury&#x27;s position was at odds with that of most of the Labour movement, which allied itself with the wartime coalition governments of Asquith and, from 1916, Lloyd George. In the prevailing jingoistic mood, numerous readers looked to the &quot;Herald&quot;—reduced by wartime economies to a weekly format—to present a balanced news perspective, untainted by war fever and chauvinism. During the winter of 1914–15, Lansbury visited the Western Front trenches. He sent eye-witness accounts to the paper, which supported calls for a negotiated peace with Germany in line with President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s later &quot;peace note&quot; of January 1917. The paper also gave sympathetic coverage to conscientious objectors, and to Irish and Indian nationalists.
Lansbury used the pages of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to welcome the February 1917 revolution in Russia as &quot;a new star of hope ... arisen over Europe&quot;. At an Albert Hall rally on 18 March 1918 he hailed the spirit and enthusiasm of &quot;this Russian movement&quot;, and urged his audience to &quot;be ready to die, if necessary, for our faith&quot;. When the war ended in November 1918, Lloyd George called an immediate general election, correctly calculating that victory euphoria would keep his coalition in power. In this triumphalist climate, candidates such as Lansbury who had opposed the war found themselves unpopular, and he failed to retake his Bow and Bromley seat.

The &quot;Herald&quot; re-emerged as a daily paper in March 1919. Under Lansbury&#x27;s direction it maintained a strong and ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury travelled to Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. He published an account: &quot;What I Saw in Russia&quot;, but the impact of the visit was overshadowed by accusations that the &quot;Herald&quot; was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: &quot;We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds&quot;. Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the &quot;Herald&quot;s financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.

===&quot;Poplarism&quot;: the 1921 rates revolt===
Throughout his national campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served a three-year term as a London County Councillor. In 1919 he became the first Labour mayor of Poplar. Under the then-existing financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where rates revenues were low and poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, &quot;The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council&quot;. In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy precepts to pay for services provided by bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police. Lansbury had long argued that a degree of rates equalisation across London was necessary, to share costs more fairly.

At its meeting on 22 March 1921 the Poplar Council resolved not to make its precepts and to apply these revenues to the costs of local poor relief. This illegal action created a sensation, and led to legal proceedings against the council. On 29 July the thirty councillors involved marched in procession from Bow to the High Court, headed by a brass band. Informed by the judge that they must apply the precepts, the councillors would not budge; early in September, Lansbury and 29 fellow-councillors were imprisoned for contempt of court. Among those sentenced were his son Edgar and Edgar&#x27;s wife, Minnie.

The defiance of the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy, and the publicity embarrassed the government. Several other Labour-controlled councils (including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader Clement Attlee) threatened similar policies. After six weeks&#x27; incarceration the councillors were released, and a government conference was convened to resolve the matter. This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury: the passage of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. As a result, the rates in Poplar fell by a third, and additional revenues of £400,000 was gained by the borough. Lansbury was hailed as a hero; in the 1922 general election he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7,000, and would hold it for the rest of his life. The term &quot;Poplarism&quot;, always identified closely with Lansbury, became part of the political lexicon, applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society.

==Parliament and national office==

===Labour backbencher===

In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, resigned for health reasons. In December his successor, Stanley Baldwin, called another election in which the Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. King George V advised Baldwin, as leader of the largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by a vote in the House of Commons.
Defeat duly occurred on 21 January 1924, when the Liberals decided to throw in their lot with Labour. The king then asked Labour&#x27;s leader, Ramsay MacDonald, to form a government. Lansbury caused royal offence by publicly implying that the king had colluded with other parties to keep Labour out, and by his references to the fate of Charles I. Despite his seniority, Lansbury was offered only a junior non-cabinet post in the new government, which he declined. He believed that his exclusion from the cabinet followed pressure from the king. At the 1923 Labour Party conference, while declaring himself a republican, Lansbury opposed two motions calling for the abolition of the monarchy, deeming the issue a &quot;distraction&quot;. Social revolution, he said, would one day remove the monarchy.
MacDonald&#x27;s administration lasted less than a year before, in November 1924, the Liberals withdrew their support; Blythe comments that the first Labour government had been &quot;neither exhilarating nor competent&quot;. According to Shepherd, MacDonald&#x27;s chief priority was to show that Labour was &quot;fit to govern&quot;, and he had thus acted with conservative caution. The December general election returned the Conservatives to power; Lansbury maintained that Labour&#x27;s cause &quot;marches forward irrespective of electoral results&quot;. After the defeat Lansbury was briefly touted as an alternative party leader to MacDonald, a proposition he rejected. In 1925, free from the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, he founded and edited &quot;Lansbury&#x27;s Labour Weekly&quot;, which became a mouthpiece for his personal creed of socialism, democracy and pacifism until it merged with the &quot;New Leader&quot; in 1927 . Before the General Strike of May 1926, Lansbury used the &quot;Weekly&quot; to instruct the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on preparations for the coming struggle. However, when the strike came the TUC did not want his assistance; among the reasons for their distrust was Lansbury&#x27;s continuing advocacy of the right of communist organisations to affiliate to the Labour Party—he privately opined that British communists on their own &quot;couldn&#x27;t run a whelk-stall&quot;.

Lansbury continued his private campaigns in parliament, saying &quot;I intend on every occasion to ... hinder the progress of business&quot;. In April 1926 he and 12 other opposition MPs prevented a vote in the House of Commons by obstructing the voting lobbies; they were temporarily suspended by the Speaker. During frequent clashes in the House with Neville Chamberlain, the Minister of Health responsible for Poor Law administration and reform, Lansbury referred to the &quot;Ministry of Death&quot;, and called the minister a &quot;pinchbeck Napoleon&quot;. However, within the Labour Party itself, Lansbury&#x27;s status and popularity led to his election as the party&#x27;s chairman (a largely titular office) in 1927–28. Lansbury also became president of the International League Against Imperialism, where among his fellow executive members were Jawaharlal Nehru, Mme. Sun Yat-sen and Albert Einstein. In 1928, short of money following the failure of the family business, Lansbury published his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, for which he received what he termed &quot;a fairly generous cheque&quot; from the publishers, Constable &amp; Co.

===Cabinet minister, 1929–31===
In the 1929 general election Labour emerged as the largest party, with 287 seats—but without an overall majority. Once again, MacDonald formed a government dependent on Liberal support. Lansbury joined the new cabinet as First Commissioner of Works, with responsibilities for historic buildings and monuments and for the royal parks. This position was widely regarded as a sinecure; nevertheless, Lansbury proved an active minister who did much to improve public recreation facilities. His most notable achievement was the Lido on the Serpentine in Hyde Park; according to the historian A. J. P. Taylor &quot;the only thing which keeps the memory of the second Labour government alive&quot;. A circular memorial plaque to Lansbury can be seen on the exterior wall of the Lido Bar and Cafe. Lansbury&#x27;s duties brought him into frequent contact with the King, who as Ranger of the royal parks insisted on regular consultation. Contrary to the expectations of some the two formed a cordial relationship.

The years of MacDonald&#x27;s second government were dominated by the economic depression that followed the Wall Street crash of October 1929. Lansbury was appointed to a committee, chaired by J.H. Thomas and including Sir Oswald Mosley, charged with finding a solution to unemployment. Mosley produced a memorandum which called for a large-scale programme of public works; this was rejected by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, on grounds of cost. At the end of July 1931 the May Committee, appointed in February to investigate government spending, prescribed heavy cuts, including a massive reduction in unemployment benefit.

During August, in an atmosphere of financial panic and a run on the pound, the government debated the report. MacDonald and Snowden were prepared to implement it, but Lansbury and nine other cabinet ministers rejected the cut in unemployment benefit. Thus divided, the government could not continue; MacDonald, however, did not resign as prime minister. After discussions with the opposition leaders and the king he formed a national all-party coalition, with a &quot;doctor&#x27;s mandate&quot; to tackle the economic crisis. The great majority of Labour MPs, including Lansbury, were opposed to this action; MacDonald and the few who followed him were expelled from the party, and Arthur Henderson became leader. MacDonald&#x27;s move was broadly welcomed in the country, however, and in the general election held in October 1931 the national government was returned with an enormous majority. Labour was reduced to 46 members; Lansbury was the only senior member of the Labour leadership to retain his seat.

==Party leader==
Although defeated in the election, Henderson remained the party leader while Lansbury headed the Labour group in parliament—the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). In October 1932 Henderson resigned and Lansbury succeeded him. In most historians&#x27; reckonings, Lansbury led his small parliamentary force with skill and flair. He was also, says Shepherd, an inspiration to the dispirited Labour rank and file. As leader he began the process of reforming the party&#x27;s organisation and machinery, efforts which resulted in considerable by-election and municipal election successes—including control of the LCC under Herbert Morrison in 1934. According to Blythe, Lansbury &quot;represented political hope and decency to the three million unemployed.&quot; During this period Lansbury published his political credo, &quot;My England&quot; (1934), which envisioned a future socialist state achieved by a mixture of revolutionary and evolutionary methods.

The small Labour group in parliament had little influence over economic policy; Lansbury&#x27;s term as leader was dominated by foreign affairs and disarmament, and by policy disagreements within the Labour movement. The official party position was based on collective security through the League of Nations and on multilateral disarmament. Lansbury, supported by many in the PLP, adopted a position of Christian pacifism, unilateral disarmament and the dismantling of the British Empire. Under his influence the party&#x27;s 1933 conference passed resolutions calling for the &quot;total disarmament of all nations&quot;, and pledged to take no part in war. Pacifism became temporarily popular in the country; on 9 February 1933 the Oxford Union voted by 275 to 153 that it would &quot;in no circumstances fight for its King and Country&quot;, and the Fulham East by-election in October 1933 was easily won by a Labour candidate committed to full disarmament. Lansbury sent a message to the constituency in his position as Labour Leader: &quot;I would close every recruiting station, disband the Army and disarm the Air Force. I would abolish the whole dreadful equipment of war and say to the world: &#x27;Do your worst&#x27;.&quot; October 1934 saw the emergence of the Peace Pledge Union. In response to the Peace Pledge Union, the League of Nations Union conducted the 1934–35 Peace Ballot, an unofficial public referendum, which produced massive majorities in support of the League of Nations, multilateral disarmament, and conflict resolution through non-military means – though crucially, a three-fold majority supported military measures as a last resort. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany, and had withdrawn from the international Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Blythe observes that Britain&#x27;s noisy flirtations with pacifism &quot;drowned out the sounds from German dockyards&quot;, as German rearmament began.

As fascism and militarism advanced in Europe, Lansbury&#x27;s pacifist stance drew criticism from the trade union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury &quot;thinks the country should be without defence of any kind ... it certainly isn&#x27;t our policy.&quot; The party&#x27;s 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, under the shadow of Italy&#x27;s impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, which Lansbury opposed as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a policy, agreed by all the party&#x27;s main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of &quot;hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it&quot;. Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later. His deputy, Clement Attlee, succeeded him as party leader prior to the 1935 general election; Lansbury thus contested no general elections as party leader. , he is the last Labour leader to stand down without contesting a general election. 

==Final years==

Lansbury was 76 years old when he resigned the Labour leadership; he did not, however, retire from public life. In the general election of November 1935 he kept his seat at Bow and Bromley; Labour, now led by Attlee, improved its parliamentary representation to 154. Lansbury devoted himself entirely to the cause of world peace, a quest that took him, in 1936, to the United States. He addressed large crowds in 27 cities before meeting President Roosevelt in Washington to present his proposals for a world peace conference. In 1937 he toured Europe, visiting leaders in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April secured a private meeting with Hitler. No official report of the discussion was issued, but Lansbury&#x27;s personal memorandum indicates that Hitler expressed willingness to join in a world conference if Roosevelt would convene it. Later that year Lansbury met Mussolini in Rome; he described the Italian leader as &quot;a mixture of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill&quot;. Lansbury wrote several accounts of his peace journeys, notably &quot;My Quest for Peace&quot; (1938). His mild and optimistic impressions of the European dictators were widely criticised as naïve and out of touch; some British pacifists were dismayed at Lansbury&#x27;s meeting with Hitler, while the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; accused him of diverting attention from the aggressive realities of fascist policies. Lansbury continued to meet European leaders through 1938 and 1939, and was nominated, unsuccessfully, for the 1940 Nobel Peace Prize.
At home, Lansbury served a second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936–37. He argued against direct confrontation with Mosley&#x27;s Blackshirts during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the Battle of Cable Street. In October 1937 he became president of the Peace Pledge Union, and a year later he welcomed the Munich Agreement as a step towards peace. During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was going down in ruins, he added: &quot;I hope that out of this terrible calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force.&quot;

Early in 1940 Lansbury&#x27;s health began to fail; although unaware, he was suffering from stomach cancer. In an article published in the socialist magazine &quot;Tribune&quot;, published on 25 April 1940, he made a final statement of his Christian pacifism: &quot;I hold fast to the truth that this world is big enough for all, that we are all brethren, children of one Father&quot;. Lansbury died on 7 May 1940, at the Manor House Hospital in Golders Green. His funeral in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bow, was followed by cremation at Ilford Crematorium, before a memorial service in Westminster Abbey. His ashes were scattered at sea, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will: &quot;I desire this because although I love England very dearly ... I am a convinced internationalist&quot;.

==Tributes and legacy==
Most historical assessments of Lansbury have tended to stress his character and principles rather than his effectiveness as a party political leader. His biographer Jonathan Schneer writes:


Historian A. J. P. Taylor labelled Lansbury as &quot;the most lovable figure in modern politics&quot; and the outstanding figure of the English revolutionary left in the 20th century, while Kenneth O. Morgan, in his biography of a later Labour leader, Michael Foot, regards Lansbury as &quot;an agitator of protest, not a politician of power&quot;. Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of sentimentality, and party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity. Nevertheless, his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers to him as a &quot;prophet&quot;. Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man&#x27;s achievements in establishing the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, given his complete lack of journalistic training. Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury&#x27;s pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin&#x27;s demolition at the 1935 conference was justified.

There is much agreement among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his Christian socialist principles, was consistent in his efforts on behalf of the poorest in society. Shepherd believes that &quot;there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks&quot;. In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury&#x27;s death, Chamberlain said of him: &quot;There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism&quot;. Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: &quot;He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered ... [H]e was ever the champion of the weak, and ... to the end of his life he strove for that in which he believed&quot;.

After the Second World War, a stained glass window designed by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors was placed in the Kingsley Hall community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, completed in 1951. A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, is the extent to which the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating before the turn of the 20th century had become accepted mainstream doctrine little more than a decade after his death.

His name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

The George Lansbury Memorial Trust was founded in 2012, and organises an annual George Lansbury Memorial Lecture. 

==Personal and family life==
George Lansbury married Elizabeth Jane (Bessie) Brine on 22 May 1880 in Whitechapel, London. Four years later, in May 1884, he took his wife and their three young children to Australia as emigrants with high hopes based on British government propaganda, which suggested plentiful work and a rosy life there. The truth was otherwise, with paid work very hard to find, and terrible living conditions for many. By May 1885 they had had enough of Australia, and returned to London. Lansbury took up work in his father-in-law&#x27;s Whitechapel sawmill and began his political career speaking about the harsh conditions in Australia.

For most of their married life, George and Bessie Lansbury lived in Bow, originally in St Stephen&#x27;s Road and from 1916 at 39 Bow Road, a house which, Shepherd records, became &quot;a political haven&quot; for those requiring assistance of any kind. Bessie died in 1933, after 53 years of a marriage that had produced 12 children between 1881 and 1905.

Of the 10 children who survived to adulthood, Edgar followed his father into local political activism as a Poplar councillor in 1912, serving as the borough&#x27;s mayor in 1924–25. He was for a time a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). After the death of his first wife Minnie in 1922, Edgar married Moyna Macgill, an actress from Belfast; their daughter Dame Angela Lansbury (1925–2022), became a stage and screen actress. George Lansbury&#x27;s youngest daughter, Violet (1900–72), was an active CPGB member in the 1920s, who lived and worked as a translator in Moscow for many years. She married Clemens Palme Dutt, the brother of the Marxist intellectual Rajani Palme Dutt.

Another daughter, Dorothy (1890–1973), was a women&#x27;s rights activist and later a campaigner for contraceptive and abortion rights. She married Ernest Thurtle, the Labour MP for Shoreditch, and was herself a member of Shoreditch council, serving as mayor in 1936. She and her husband founded the Workers&#x27; Birth Control Group in 1924. Dorothy&#x27;s younger sister Daisy (1892–1971) served as Lansbury&#x27;s secretary for over 20 years. During the suffragette protests in 1913 Daisy Lansbury helped Sylvia Pankhurst to evade police capture by disguising herself as Pankhurst. In 1918 she married the left-wing writer and historian Raymond Postgate, who was George Lansbury&#x27;s first biographer, and founder of &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot;. Their son Oliver Postgate was a successful writer, animator and producer for children&#x27;s television. The former Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt is a distant relative of Lansbury.

The Lansbury home at 39 Bow Road was destroyed by bombing during the London Blitz of 1940–41. There is a small memorial stone dedicated to Lansbury in front of the current building, named George Lansbury House, which itself carries a memorial plaque. There is also a memorial to Lansbury in the nearby Bow Church, where Lansbury was a long-term member of the congregation and churchwarden.

<doc id="166969" wikidata="Q184750" url="?curid=166969" title="Slavoj Žižek">
<text>Slavoj Žižek ( ; ; born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian Marxist philosopher, cultural theorist and public intellectual.

He is the international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, professor of philosophy and psychoanalysis at the European Graduate School and senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana. He primarily works on continental philosophy (particularly Hegelianism, psychoanalysis and Marxism) and political theory, as well as film criticism and theology.

Žižek is the most famous associate of the Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis, a group of Slovenian academics working on German idealism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, ideology critique, and media criticism. His breakthrough work was 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Sublime Object of Ideology&quot;, his first book in English, which was decisive in the introduction of the Ljubljana School&#x27;s thought to English-speaking audiences. He has written over 50 books in multiple languages and speaks Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, English, German, and French. The idiosyncratic style of his public appearances, frequent magazine op-eds, and academic works, characterised by the use of obscene jokes and pop cultural examples, as well as politically incorrect provocations, have gained him fame, controversy and criticism both in and outside academia.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Žižek was born in Ljubljana, PR Slovenia, Yugoslavia, into a middle-class family. His father Jože Žižek was an economist and civil servant from the region of Prekmurje in eastern Slovenia. His mother Vesna, a native of the Gorizia Hills in the Slovenian Littoral, was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were atheists. He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of Portorož, where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture. When Žižek was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended Bežigrad High School. Originally wanting to become a filmmaker himself, he abandoned these ambitions and chose to pursue philosophy instead.

===Education===
In 1967, during an era of liberalization in Titoist Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the University of Ljubljana and studied philosophy and sociology.

Žižek had already begun reading French structuralists prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by Jacques Derrida into Slovenian. Žižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the Heideggerian philosophers Tine Hribar and Ivo Urbančič, and published articles in alternative magazines, such as &quot;Praxis&quot;, &quot;Tribuna&quot; and &quot;Problemi&quot;, which he also edited. In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master&#x27;s thesis was denounced by the authorities as being &quot;non-Marxist&quot;. He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a Doctor of Arts in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled &quot;The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism&quot;. He spent the next few years in what was described as &quot;professional wilderness&quot;, also fulfilling his legal duty of undertaking a year-long national service in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in Karlovac.

===Academic career===
During the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, and Louis Althusser. He used Lacan&#x27;s work to interpret Hegelian and Marxist philosophy.

In 1986, Žižek completed a second doctorate (Doctor of Philosophy in psychoanalysis) at the University of Paris VIII under Jacques-Alain Miller, entitled &quot;La philosophie entre le symptôme et le fantasme&quot;.

Žižek wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s and John le Carré&#x27;s detective novels.
In 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to film theory, &quot;Pogled s strani&quot;. The following year, he achieved international recognition as a social theorist with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, &quot;The Sublime Object of Ideology&quot;.

Žižek has been publishing in journals such as &quot;Lacanian Ink&quot; and &quot;In These Times&quot; in the United States, the &quot;New Left Review&quot; and &quot;The London Review of Books&quot; in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian left-liberal magazine &quot;Mladina&quot; and newspapers &quot;Dnevnik&quot; and &quot;Delo&quot;. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine &quot;Krytyka Polityczna&quot;, regional southeast European left-wing journal &quot;Novi Plamen&quot;, and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal &quot;Problemi&quot;. Žižek is a series editor of the Northwestern University Press series Diaeresis that publishes works that &quot;deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; listed Žižek on its list of Top 100 Global Thinkers, calling him &quot;a celebrity philosopher&quot;, while elsewhere he has been dubbed the &quot;Elvis of cultural theory&quot; and &quot;the most dangerous philosopher in the West&quot;. Žižek has been called &quot;the leading Hegelian of our time&quot;, and &quot;the foremost exponent of Lacanian theory&quot;. A journal, the &quot;International Journal of Žižek Studies&quot;, was founded by professors David J. Gunkel and Paul A. Taylor to engage with his work.

===Political career===
In the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine &quot;Mladina&quot;, which was critical of Tito&#x27;s policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the militarization of society. He was a member of the League of Communists of Slovenia until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the JBTZ trial together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals. Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and civil society movements which fought for the democratization of Slovenia, most notably the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights. In the first free elections in 1990, he ran as the Liberal Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for the former four-person collective presidency of Slovenia.

Žižek is a member of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) founded in 2016.

===Public life===
In 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany Bruce Weber&#x27;s photographs in a catalog for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!&quot;

Žižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 &quot;Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!&quot; is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 &quot;The Reality of the Virtual&quot;, Žižek gave an hour-long lecture on his interpretation of Lacan&#x27;s tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real. &quot;Zizek!&quot; is a 2005 documentary by Astra Taylor on his philosophy. The 2006 &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Cinema&quot; and 2012 &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Ideology&quot; also portray Žižek&#x27;s ideas and cultural criticism. &quot;Examined Life&quot; (2008) features Žižek speaking about his conception of ecology at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 &quot;Marx Reloaded&quot;, directed by Jason Barker.

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Žižek one of its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers &quot;for giving voice to an era of absurdity&quot;.

In 2019, Žižek began hosting a mini-series called &quot;How to Watch the News with Slavoj Žižek&quot; on the RT network. In April, Žižek debated psychology professor Jordan Peterson at the Sony Centre in Toronto, Canada over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.

==Personal life==
Žižek has been married four times and has two adult sons, Tim and Kostja. His second wife was Slovene philosopher and socio-legal theorist Renata Salecl, fellow member of the Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis. His third wife was Argentinian model and Lacanian scholar Analia Hounie, whom he married in 2005. Currently, he is married to Slovene journalist, author and philosopher, Jela Krečič.

In early 2018, Žižek experienced Bell&#x27;s palsy on the right side of his face. He went on to give several lectures and interviews with this condition; on March 9 of that year, during a lecture on political revolutions in London, he commented on the treatment he had been receiving, and used his paralysis as a metaphor for political idleness.

Aside from his native Slovene, Žižek is a fluent speaker of Serbo-Croatian, French, German and English.

===Taste===
In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, Žižek listed his 10 favourite films: &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Hitman&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;, &quot;Opfergang&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and &quot;We the Living&quot;. On this list, he clarified: &quot;I opted for pure madness: the list contains only &#x27;guilty pleasures&#x27;&quot;. In his tour of The Criterion Collection closet, he chose &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, &quot;Murmur of the Heart&quot;, &quot;The Joke&quot;, &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s History Films, &quot;City Lights&quot;, a box set of Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s films, &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; and &quot;Antichrist&quot;.

In an article called &quot;My Favourite Classics&quot;, Žižek states that Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; is the piece of music he would take to a desert island. He goes on to list other favourites, including Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;. He expresses a particular love for Wagner, particularly &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;. He ranks Schoenberg over Stravinsky, and insists on Eisler&#x27;s importance among Schoenberg&#x27;s followers.

Žižek often lists Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Andrei Platonov as his &quot;three absolute masters of 20th-century literature&quot;. He ranks/prefers Varlam Shalamov over Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Marina Tsvetaeva and Osip Mandelstam over Anna Akhmatova, Daphne du Maurier over Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett over James Joyce. His theories have been applied to studying a variety of literature, including &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

==Thought and positions==
Žižek and his thought have been described by many commentators as &quot;Hegelo-Lacanian&quot;. In his early career, Žižek claimed &quot;a theoretical space moulded by three centres of gravity: Hegelian dialectics, Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, and contemporary criticism of ideology&quot;, designating &quot;the theory of Jacques Lacan&quot; as the fundamental element. In 2010, Žižek instead claimed that for him Hegel is more fundamental than Lacan—&quot;Even Lacan is just a tool for me to read Hegel. For me, always it is Hegel, Hegel, Hegel.&quot;—while in 2019, he claimed that &quot;For me, in some sense, all of philosophy happened in [the] fifty years&quot; between Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781) and the death of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1831). Alongside his academic, theoretical works, Žižek is a prolific commentator on current affairs and contemporary political debates.

===Subjectivity===
For Žižek, although a subject may take on a symbolic (social) position, it can never be reduced to this attempted symbolisation, since the very &quot;taking on&quot; of this position implies a separate &#x27;I&#x27;, beyond the symbolic, that does the taking on. Yet, under scrutiny, nothing positive can be said about this subject, this &#x27;I&#x27;, that eludes symbolisation; it cannot be discerned as anything but &quot;that which cannot be symbolised&quot;. Thus, without the initial, attempted, failed symbolisation, subjectivity cannot present itself. As Žižek writes in his first book in English: &quot;the subject of the signifier is a retroactive effect of the failure of its own representation; that is why the failure of representation is the only way to represent it adequately.&quot;

Žižek attributes this position on the subject to Hegel, particularly his description of man as &quot;the night of the world&quot;, and to Lacan, with his description of the barred, split subject, who he sees as developing the Cartesian notion of the cogito. According to Žižek, these thinkers, in insisting on the role of the subject, run counter to &quot;culturalist&quot; or &quot;historicist&quot; positions held by thinkers such as Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault, which posit that &quot;subjects&quot; are bound by and reducible to their historical/cultural(/symbolic) context.

===Political theory===
====Ideology====
Žižek&#x27;s Lacanian-informed theory of ideology is one of his major contributions to political theory; his first book in English, &quot;The Sublime Object of Ideology&quot;, and the documentary &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Ideology&quot;, in which he stars, are among the well-known places in which it is discussed. Žižek believes that ideology has been frequently misinterpreted as dualistic and, according to him, this misinterpreted dualism posits that there is a real world of material relations and objects outside of oneself, which is accessible to reason.

For Žižek, as for Marx, ideology is made up of fictions that structure political life; in Lacan&#x27;s terms, ideology belongs to the symbolic order. Žižek argues that these fictions are primarily maintained at an unconscious level, rather than a conscious one. Since, according to psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious can determine one&#x27;s actions directly, bypassing one&#x27;s conscious awareness (as in parapraxes), ideology can be expressed in one&#x27;s behaviour, regardless of one&#x27;s conscious beliefs. Hence, Žižek breaks with orthodox Marxist accounts that view ideology purely as a system of mistaken beliefs (see False consciousness). Drawing on Peter Sloterdijk&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Cynical Reason&quot;, Žižek argues that adopting a cynical perspective is not enough to escape ideology, since, according to Žižek, even though postmodern subjects are consciously cynical about the political situation, they continue to reinforce it through their behaviour.

====Freedom====
Žižek claims that (a sense of) political freedom is sustained by a deeper unfreedom, at least under liberal capitalism. In a 2002 article, Žižek endorses Lenin&#x27;s distinction between formal and actual freedom, claiming that liberal society only contains formal freedom, &quot;freedom of choice &quot;within&quot; the coordinates of the existing power relations&quot;, while prohibiting actual freedom, &quot;the site of an intervention that undermines these very coordinates.&quot; In an oft-quoted passage from a book published in the same year, he writes that, in these conditions of liberal censorship, &quot;we &#x27;feel free&#x27; because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom&quot;. In a 2019 article, he writes that Marx &quot;made a valuable point with his claim that the market economy combines in a unique way political and personal freedom with social unfreedom: personal freedom (freely selling myself on the market) is the very form of my unfreedom.&quot; However, in 2014, he rejects the &quot;pseudo-Marxist&quot; total derision of &#x27;formal freedom&#x27;, claiming that it is necessary for critique: &quot;When we are formally free, only then we become aware how limited this freedom actually is.&quot;

Žižek co-signed a petition condemning the &quot;use of disproportionate force and retaliatory brutality by the Hong Kong Police against students in university campuses in Hong Kong&quot; during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. The petition concludes with the statement: &quot;We believe the defence of academic freedom, the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and association, and the responsibility to protect the safety of our students are universal causes common to all.&quot;

===Theology===
Žižek has asserted that &quot;Atheism is a legacy worth fighting for&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, he nonetheless finds extensive conceptual value in Christianity, particularly Protestantism: the subtitle of his 2000 book &quot;The Fragile Absolute&quot; is &quot;Or, Why Is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For?&quot;. Hence, he labels his position &#x27;Christian Atheism&#x27;, and has written about theology at length.

In &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Ideology&quot;, Žižek suggests that &quot;the only way to be an Atheist is through Christianity&quot;, since, he claims, atheism often fails to escape the religious paradigm by remaining faithful to an external guarantor of meaning, simply switching God for natural necessity or evolution. Christianity, on the other hand, in the doctrine of the incarnation, brings God down from the &#x27;beyond&#x27; and onto earth, into human affairs; for Žižek, this paradigm is more authentically godless, since the external guarantee is abolished.

===Communism===
Although sometimes adopting the title of &#x27;radical leftist&#x27;, Žižek also controversially insists on identifying as a communist, even though he rejects 20th century communism as a &quot;total failure&quot;, and decries &quot;the communism of the 20th century, more specifically all the network of phenomena we refer to as Stalinism as &quot;maybe the worst ideological, political, ethical, social (and so on) catastrophe in the history of humanity.&quot; Žižek justifies this choice by claiming that only the term &#x27;communism&#x27; signals a genuine step outside of the existing order, in part since the term &#x27;socialism&#x27; no longer has radical enough implications, and means nothing more than that one &quot;care[s] for society.&quot;

In &quot;Marx Reloaded&quot;, Žižek rejects both 20th-century totalitarianism and &quot;spontaneous local self-organisation, direct democracy, councils, and so on&quot;. There, he endorses a definition of communism as &quot;a society where you, everyone would be allowed to dwell in his or her stupidity&quot;, an idea with which he credits Fredric Jameson as the inspiration.

Žižek has labelled himself a &quot;communist in a qualified sense&quot; and as a &quot;moderately conservative Communist&quot;. When he spoke at a conference on &quot;The Idea of Communism&quot;, he applied (in qualified form) the &#x27;communist&#x27; label to the Occupy Wall Street protestors:
===Electoral politics===
In May 2013, during Subversive Festival, Žižek commented: &quot;If they don&#x27;t support SYRIZA, then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] gulag.&quot; In response, the center-right New Democracy party claimed Žižek&#x27;s comments should be understood literally, not ironically.

Just before the 2017 French presidential election, Žižek stated that one could not choose between Macron and Le Pen, arguing that the neoliberalism of Macron just gives rise to neofascism anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.

In 2022, Žižek expressed his support for the Slovenian political party Levica (The Left) at its 5th annual conference.

====Support for Donald Trump&#x27;s election====
In a 2016 interview with Channel 4, Žižek said that were he American, he would vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election:
These views were derisively characterised as accelerationist by &quot;Left Voice&quot;, and were labelled &quot;regressive&quot; by Noam Chomsky.

In 2019 and 2020, Žižek defended his views, saying that Trump&#x27;s election &quot;created, for the first time in I don&#x27;t know how many decades, a true American left&quot;, citing the boost it gave Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

However, regarding the 2020 United States presidential election, Žižek reported himself &quot;tempted by changing his position&quot;, saying &quot;Trump is a little too much&quot;. In another interview, he stood by his 2016 &quot;wager&quot; that Trump&#x27;s election would lead to a socialist reaction (&quot;maybe I was right&quot;), but claimed that &quot;now with coronavirus: no, no—no Trump. ... difficult as it is for me to say this, but now I would say &#x27;Biden better than Trump&#x27;, although he is far from ideal.&quot; In his 2022 book, &quot;Heaven in Disorder&quot;, Žižek continued to express a preference for Joe Biden over Donald Trump, stating &quot;Trump was corroding the ethical substance of our lives&quot;, while Biden lies and represents big capital more politely.

===Social issues===
Žižek&#x27;s views on social issues such as Eurocentrism, immigration and LGBT people have drawn criticism and accusations of bigotry.

====Europe and multiculturalism====
In his 1997 article &#x27;Multiculturalism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Multinational Capitalism&#x27;, Žižek critiqued multiculturalism for privileging a culturally &#x27;neutral&#x27; perspective from which all cultures are disaffectedly apprehended in their particularity because this distancing reproduces the racist procedure of Othering. He further argues that a fixation on particular identities and struggles corresponds to an abandonment of the universal struggle against global capitalism.

In his 1998 article &#x27;A Leftist Plea for &quot;Eurocentrism&quot;&#x27;, he argued that Leftists should &#x27;undermine the global empire of capital, not by asserting particular identities, but through the assertion of a new universality&#x27;, and that in this struggle the European universalist value of &quot;egaliberte&quot; (Etienne Balibar&#x27;s term) should be foregrounded, proposing &#x27;a Leftist appropriation of the European legacy&#x27;. Elsewhere, he has also argued, defending Marx, that Europe&#x27;s destruction of non-European tradition (e.g. through imperialism and slavery) has opened up the space for a &#x27;double liberation&#x27;, both from tradition and from European domination.

In her 2010 article &#x27;The Two Zizeks&#x27;, Nivedita Menon criticised Žižek for focusing on differentiation as a colonial project, ignoring how assimilation was also such a project; she also critiqued him for privileging the European Enlightenment Christian legacy as neutral, &#x27;free of the cultural markers that fatally afflict all other religions.&#x27; David Pavón Cuéllar, closer to Žižek, also criticised him.

In the mid-2010s, over the issue of Eurocentrism, there was a dispute between Žižek and Walter Mignolo, in which Mignolo (supporting a previous article by Hamid Dabashi, which argued against the centrality of European philosophers like Žižek, criticised by Michael Marder) argued, against Žižek, that decolonial struggle should forget European philosophy, purportedly following Frantz Fanon; in response, Žižek pointed out Fanon&#x27;s European intellectual influences, and his resistance to being confined within the black tradition, and claimed to be following Fanon on this point. In his book &quot;Can Non-Europeans Think?&quot; (foreworded by Mignolo), Dabashi also critiqued Žižek for privileging Europe; Žižek argued that Dabashi slanderously and comically misrepresents him through misattribution, a critique supported by Ilan Kapoor.

====Transgender issues====
In his 2016 article &quot;The Sexual Is Political&quot;, Žižek argued that all subjects are, like transgender subjects, in discord with the sexual position assigned to them. For Žižek, any attempt to escape this antagonism is false and utopian: thus, he rejects both the reactionary attempt to violently impose sexual fixity and the &quot;postgenderist&quot; attempt to escape sexual fixity entirely; he aligns the latter with &#x27;transgenderism&#x27;, which he claims does not adequately describe the behaviour of actual transgender subjects, who seek a stable &quot;place where they could recognise themselves&quot; (e.g., a bathroom that confirms their identity). Žižek argues for a third bathroom: a &quot;GENERAL GENDER&quot; bathroom that would represent the fact that both sexual positions (Žižek insists on the unavoidable &quot;twoness&quot; of the sexual landscape) are missing something and thus fail to adequately represent the subjects that take them on.

In his 2019 article &quot;Transgender dogma is naive and incompatible with Freud&quot;, Žižek argued that there is &quot;a tension in LGBT+ ideology between social constructivism and (some kind of biological) determinism&quot;, between the idea that gender is a social construct, and the idea that gender is essential and pre-social. He concludes the essay with a &quot;Freudian solution&quot; to this deadlock:
Che Gossett criticized Žižek for his use of the &quot;pathologising&quot; term &quot;transgenderism&quot; throughout the 2016 article, and for writing &quot;about trans subjectivity with such assumed authority while ignoring the voices of trans theorists (academics and activists) entirely&quot;, as well as for purportedly claiming that a &quot;futuristic&quot; vision underlies so-called &quot;transgenderism&quot;, ignoring present-day oppression. Sam Warren Miell and Chris Coffman, both psychoanalytically inclined, have separately criticized Žižek for conflating transgenderism and postgenderism; Miell further criticised the 2014 article for rehearsing homophobic/transphobic clichés (including Žižek&#x27;s designation of inter-species marriage as a possible &quot;anti-discriminatory demand&quot;), and misusing Lacanian theory; Coffman argued that Žižek should have engaged with contemporary Lacanian trans studies, which would have shown that psychoanalytic and transgender discourses were aligned, not opposed. In response to the title of the 2019 article, McKenzie Wark had t-shirts made with the transgender flag and &quot;Incompatible with Freud&quot; printed on them.

Žižek defended his 2016 article in two follow-up pieces. The first addresses purported misreadings of his position, while the second is a more sustained defence (against Miell) of the article&#x27;s application of Lacanian theory, to which Miell responded in turn. Douglas Lain also defended Žižek, claiming that context makes it clear that Žižek is &quot;not opposed [to] the struggle of LGBTQ people&quot; but is instead critiquing &quot;a phony liberal ideology that set up the terms of the LGBTQ struggle&quot;, &quot;a certain utopian postmodern ideology that seeks to eliminate all limits, to eliminate all binaries, to go beyond norms because the imposition of a limit is patriarchal and oppressive.&quot;

In a 2023 piece for Compact Magazine, Žižek took a hard stance against access to puberty blockers for trans youth, and against trans adults being sent to prisons matching their gender, citing the case of Isla Bryson, whom he referred to as &quot;a person who identifies itself as a woman using its penis to rape two women&quot;. Both of these things were attributed by Žižek to wokeness (the wider subject of the article).

===Other===
Žižek wrote that the convention center in which nationalist Slovene writers hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, &quot;Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don&#x27;t mean it literally.&quot;

In 2013, Žižek corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova.

He criticized Western military interventions in developing countries and wrote that it was the 2011 military intervention in Libya &quot;which threw the country in chaos&quot; and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq &quot;which created the conditions for the rise&quot; of the Islamic State.

Žižek believes that China is the combination of capitalism and authoritarianism in their extreme forms, and the Chinese Communist Party is the best protector of the interests of capitalists. From the Cultural Revolution to Deng&#x27;s reforms, &quot;Mao himself created the ideological condition for rapid capitalist development by tearing apart the fabric of traditional society.&quot;
In an opinion article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Žižek argued in favour of giving full support to Ukraine after the Russian invasion and for creating a stronger NATO in response to Russian aggression, later arguing that it would also be a tragedy for Ukraine to yoke itself to western neoliberalism. He compared the struggle of Ukraine against its occupiers to the Palestinians&#x27; struggle against the Israeli occupation. In April 2024, Žižek criticized Israel&#x27;s actions in the Gaza Strip.

==Criticism and controversy==

===Inconsistency and ambiguity===
Žižek&#x27;s philosophical and political positions have been described as ambiguous, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance. While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project, his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.

In a very negative review of Žižek&#x27;s book &quot;Less than Nothing&quot;, John Gray attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his &#x27;formless radicalism&#x27; which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek&#x27;s work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: &quot;Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek&#x27;s work amounts in the end to less than nothing.&quot;

Žižek&#x27;s refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class. For example, post-Marxist Ernesto Laclau argued that &quot;Žižek uses class as a sort of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils.&quot;

In his book &quot;Living in the End Times&quot;, Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral:

===Stylistic confusion===
Žižek has been criticized for his chaotic and non-systematic style: Harpham calls Žižek&#x27;s style &quot;a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention&quot;. O&#x27;Neill concurs: &quot;a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance.&quot; Noam Chomsky deems Žižek guilty of &quot;using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever&quot;, adding that his views are often too obscure to be communicated usefully to common people.

Conservative thinker Roger Scruton claims that: 
===Careless scholarship===
Žižek has been accused of approaching phenomena without rigour, reductively forcing them to support pre-given theoretical notions. For example, Tania Modleski alleges that &quot;in trying to make Hitchcock &#x27;fit&#x27; Lacan, he [Žižek] frequently ends up simplifying what goes on in the films&quot;. Similarly, Yannis Stavrakakis criticises Žižek&#x27;s reading of &quot;Antigone&quot;, claiming it proceeds without regard for both the play itself and the interpretation, given by Lacan in his 7th Seminar, which Žižek claims to follow. According to Stavrakakis, Žižek mistakenly characterises Antigone&#x27;s act (illegally burying her brother) as politically radical/revolutionary, when in reality &quot;Her act is a &quot;one-off&quot; and she couldn&#x27;t care less about what will happen in the polis after her suicide.&quot;

Noah Horwitz alleges that Žižek (and the Ljubljana School to which Žižek belongs) mistakenly conflates the insights of Lacan and Hegel, and registers concern that such a move &quot;risks transforming Lacanian psychoanalysis into a discourse of &quot;self-consciousness&quot; rather than a discourse on the psychoanalytic, Freudian &quot;unconscious&quot;.&quot;

====Allegations of plagiarism====
Žižek&#x27;s tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of self-plagiarism by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2014, after Žižek published an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book. In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.

In July 2014, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that online bloggers led by Steve Sailer had discovered that in an article published in 2006, Žižek plagiarized long passages from an earlier review by Stanley Hornbeck that first appeared in the journal &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, a publication condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the organ of a &quot;white nationalist hate group&quot;. In response to the allegations, Žižek stated:

<text>Edwin Thompson Jaynes (July 5, 1922 – April 30, 1998) was the Wayman Crow Distinguished Professor of Physics at Washington University in St. Louis. He wrote extensively on statistical mechanics and on foundations of probability and statistical inference, initiating in 1957 the maximum entropy interpretation of thermodynamics as being a particular application of more general Bayesian/information theory techniques (although he argued this was already implicit in the works of Josiah Willard Gibbs). Jaynes strongly promoted the interpretation of probability theory as an extension of logic.

In 1963, together with his doctoral student Fred Cummings, he modeled the evolution of a two-level atom in an electromagnetic field, in a fully quantized way. This model is known as the Jaynes–Cummings model.

A particular focus of his work was the construction of logical principles for assigning prior probability distributions; see the principle of maximum entropy, the principle of maximum caliber, the principle of transformation groups and Laplace&#x27;s principle of indifference. Other contributions include the mind projection fallacy.

Jaynes&#x27; book, &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&quot; (2003) gathers various threads of modern thinking about Bayesian probability and statistical inference, develops the notion of probability theory as extended logic, and contrasts the advantages of Bayesian techniques with the results of other approaches. This book, which he dedicated to Harold Jeffreys, was published posthumously in 2003 (from an incomplete manuscript that was edited by Larry Bretthorst).

Other of his doctoral students included Joseph H. Eberly and Douglas James Scalapino.

<doc id="166974" wikidata="Q4694525" url="?curid=166974" title="Agudath Israel of America">
<text>Agudath Israel of America (; also called the Agudah) is an American organization that represents Haredi Orthodox Jews. It is loosely affiliated with the international World Agudath Israel. Agudah seeks to meet the needs of the Haredi community, advocates for its religious and civil rights, and services its constituents through charitable, educational, and social service projects across North America.

==Functions==
Agudah serves as a leadership and policy umbrella organization for Haredi Jews in the United States, representing the vast majority of members of the yeshiva world, sometimes known by the old label of &quot;misnagdim&quot;, as well as a large number of Hasidic groups. However, not all Hasidic groups are affiliated with Agudath Israel. For example, the Hasidic group Satmar, which is vehemently anti-Zionist, dislikes Agudah&#x27;s relatively moderate stance towards the State of Israel.

Agudah has ideological connections with both Agudat Israel and with Degel HaTorah (), two Israeli Haredi political parties that have representation in the Knesset (Israel&#x27;s parliament). In Israel, Degel and Agudah are in a political coalition called United Torah Judaism (UTJ).

==History==

The original Agudath Israel movement was established in Europe in 1912 by some of the most famous Orthodox rabbis of the time, including Rabbi Yisroel Meir Kagen (the Chafetz Chaim), Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski of Vilna, the Radziner Rebbe, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Elazar Leiner, the Gerrer Rebbe (the Imrei Emes), and the Chortkover Rebbe. It grew during the 1920s and 1930s to be the political, communal, and cultural voice of those Orthodox Jews who were not part of Zionism&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish Mizrachi party.

Rabbi Eliezer Silver, an Eastern European-trained rabbi, established the first office of Agudath Israel in America during the 1930s, organizing its first conference in 1939. Some of the early rabbinic leaders of the organization included Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo Friedman, Rabbi Shlomo Heiman, Rabbi Leo Jung, Rabbi Herbert Goldstein, Rabbi Joshua Bäumel, and Rabbi Joseph B Soloveitchik. After the Holocaust, some prominent rabbis who made their home in America established a &quot;moetzes&quot; (&quot;supreme council&quot;) known as the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, and the movement began to grow rapidly, with the rise of the &quot;yeshiva&quot;-based and Hasidic Orthodox communities.

Mike Tress led the expansion of the movement during the early 1940s as its chief lay leader, until his death in 1967. His cousin Rabbi Moshe Sherer then took the reins as president, and the organization flourished further in size and accomplishments. After his passing in May 1998, he was succeeded by Rabbi Shmuel Bloom, as Executive Vice President. In 2008, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel, having served Agudah as general counsel and director of government affairs, took over as Executive Vice-President. In 2016, his salary was $220,000.

In April 2020, Agudath Israel of America head Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe, 89 years old, died after contracting COVID-19, one month after he urged American Orthodox Jews to follow social distancing and other precautionary guidelines in response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying: &quot;We cannot behave the way we did last week or two weeks ago. We&#x27;re told that the halakha (Jewish law) is that we must listen to doctors, whether it&#x27;s about a sick person or Yom Kippur&quot;.

==Structure==
Agudah&#x27;s policies and leadership are directed by its &quot;Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah&quot; (Council of Torah Sages), composed primarily of &quot;rosh yeshivas&quot; (the chief spiritual and scholarly authority in a yeshiva) and Hasidic &quot;rebbes&quot; (who head Hasidic dynasties and organizations). The &quot;Moetzes&quot; sets all major policies and guides the organization according to its precepts of &quot;Da&#x27;as torah&quot; (), generally translated as Torah knowledge/direction. Rabbi Yaakov Perlow (deceased), who was the Novominsker Rebbe and a member of the &quot;Moetzes&quot;, was appointed as the &quot;Rosh Agudat Yisrael&quot; (&quot;Head of Agudath Israel&quot;).

The executive staff includes Rabbi Yitzchok Ehrman as COO, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel as the Executive Vice President, Rabbi Labish Becker as the Executive Director, Rabbi Naftali Miller as CDO, Rabbi Moshe Danzger as CFO, Rabbi A.D. Motzen as the National Director for State Relations, and Rabbi Abba Cohen as Vice President for Government Affairs.

There are close to one hundred Agudah-affiliated synagogues across the United States and Canada.

==Positions==
The Agudah takes positions on many political, religious, and social issues, primarily guided by its &quot;Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah&quot;. It uses these stances to advise its members, advocate for its constituency in the halls of government, and file amicus briefs on behalf of the Haredi Orthodox Jewish community in the United States.

===Conservative, Reform, and Modern Orthodox Judaism===
In 1956, for example, the &quot;moetzes&quot; issued a written ruling forbidding Orthodox rabbis to join with any Reform or Conservative rabbis in rabbinical communal professional organizations that then united the various branches of America&#x27;s Jews, such as the Synagogue Council of America.

This position was not endorsed by the Modern Orthodox. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views on these matters and a host of other issues, such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular-led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik believed it important to nurture the more modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America (RCA).

===Women===
In 2015 and 2017, Agudah denounced moves to ordain women. It went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Open Orthodoxy, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Avi Shafran, director of public affairs, wrote: &quot;... women ... assuming positions of public leadership is ... antithetical to the concept of &quot;tzniut&quot; (modesty).&quot; Agudah forbade ordained Orthodox female clergy from being hired to lead congregations. Dr. Noam Stadlan, a board member of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, wrote: &quot;On this issue, the Agudah is irrelevant to Modern Orthodoxy in the same way Satmar or Neturei Karta views are irrelevant on issues of Zionism.&quot;

===Abortion===
In 2019, commenting on abortion, Agudath Israel said: &quot;Jewish tradition teaches that a human fetus has status and dignity, and that abortion is prohibited in the vast majority of pregnancies&quot;, with certain exceptions in which it is permitted and in others where it is required. Other Orthodox New York rabbis offered opposing positions.

===Vaccination===
Also in 2019, Agudath lobbied against a New Jersey bill that would have ended a policy allowing New Jersey parents to not immunize their children—because of religious beliefs, but to still enroll them in school. The bill included an exemption for private schools. In the 2018-2019 school year, religious exemptions in New Jersey had grown to 2.6%. Doctors and public health experts had said the bill was urgently needed to prevent the level of measles outbreak that spread across the region in 2018 (the largest outbreak in three decades in the area emphasized that there is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are safe and effective.

===Zionism===
While Agudath was created as a bulwark to fight against Zionism, the Rabbinic leadership of Agudath did permit &quot;with great reluctance&quot; participation in the government after the Israeli state was established in 1948. The reason given was that &quot;the parliament is not an ideological organization; its purpose is to perform the mundane task of running the everyday life of the citizens of the country. It was against our will that this parliament was formed, and it has the power to interfere with inyanei hadas [religious matters] and to prevent the religious community from living a life of Torah. Thus, we were forced to send representatives there to fight for our survival.&quot; Agudah takes stances on issues affecting the Haredi sector in Israel; in contradistinction to the more stridently anti-Zionist Haredi communal organizations.

==Activities==

===Political activity===
Aside from its national branch in Manhattan, Agudah has active branches in the regions of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Missouri, New England, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Ontario, Quebec, and Washington, D.C. The regional director of each branch lobbies the judicial and legislative branches of their state and local governments on any issue deemed morally or religiously important to their constituency (for example, abortion, physician-assisted suicide, same-sex marriage, school vouchers/school choice). Agudah&#x27;s advocacy in New York state is led by Rabbi Yeruchim Silber, Director of New York Government Affairs. 

Agudath Israel&#x27;s federal activities are coordinated by Rabbi Abba Cohen, the Director and Counsel of the organization&#x27;s Washington, D.C. office. Agudah was the first Orthodox Jewish group to open an office in Washington, in 1988, and maintains ongoing relations with the White House and executive agencies, as well as with the U.S. Congress, on various domestic and foreign issues. Agudath Israel World Organization also has a representative at the United Nations.

Agudah files amicus briefs in cases at all levels of the judiciary, often signing on as one of the organization signatories to a brief authored by Nat Lewin or the National Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs.

In 2023, Agudah&#x27;s New Jersey state director Avi Schnall was elected as a Democrat to the New Jersey General Assembly from the otherwise solidly Republican 30th District, in what political commentators called a &quot;massive demonstration&quot; of the Orthodox community&#x27;s political power.

====Fingerprinting controversy====
Official spokesman Rabbi Avi Shafran denied claims by The Jewish Week that Aguda &quot;is opposed to both the mandated reporting and fingerprinting, and background check legislation&quot; then under consideration, and cited a memorandum from 2 years prior expressing strong support for the legislation. The difference is Aguda&#x27;s 2006 support was for legislation that passed in 2007 permitting but not mandating fingerprinting/background checking.

===Youth services===
Agudah maintains a network of summer youth camps (including Camp Agudah, Machane Ephraim, Camp Bnos, Camp Chayl Miriam, and Camp Bnoseinu in the Catskills in New York, as well as camps in the Midwest and California).

Sometimes referred to as &quot;Pirchei / Zeirei&quot;, this was part of the work by Mike Tress.

&quot;JEP&quot; (Jewish Education Program) is known for its release hour work, and was identified by Harav Yaakov Perlow as &quot;the JEP operation of Zeirei Agudath Israel&quot; in a 1977 interview, in which he spoke about &quot;to take off a seder from yeshiva and go out and speak at a release hour at a public school.&quot;

===Social services===
Agudah has a number of social service branches that cater to the elderly, poor, or disabled. It has a job training program called COPE, a job placement division, and a housing program. The Agudah is responsible for the founding of other national institutions and projects, including the Beis Yaakov girls&#x27; school system, and the national Daf Yomi Commission.

==Communications==
Agudah advocates its positions in several ways:
* Publication of an e-newsletter, &quot;Weekly Window &quot;
* Publication of a general-interest monthly magazine, &quot;The Jewish Observer&quot;, from 1963 (no longer published)
* Maintains full-time offices in Washington, DC, and the US west coast, Midwest, and South

<text>In order theory, a field of mathematics, an incidence algebra is an associative algebra, defined for every locally finite partially ordered set
and commutative ring with unity. Subalgebras called reduced incidence algebras give a natural construction of various types of generating functions used in combinatorics and number theory.

==Definition==
A locally finite poset is one in which every closed interval
:[&quot;a, b&quot;] = {&quot;x&quot; : &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;}
is finite.

The members of the incidence algebra are the functions &quot;f&quot; assigning to each nonempty interval [&quot;a, b&quot;] a scalar &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), which is taken from the &quot;ring of scalars&quot;, a commutative ring with unity. On this underlying set one defines addition and scalar multiplication pointwise, and &quot;multiplication&quot; in the incidence algebra is a convolution defined by

:formula_1

An incidence algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if the underlying poset is finite.

===Related concepts===
An incidence algebra is analogous to a group algebra; indeed, both the group algebra and the incidence algebra are special cases of a category algebra, defined analogously; groups and posets being special kinds of categories.

==== Upper-triangular matrices ====
Consider the case of a partial order ≤ over any -element set . We enumerate as , and in such a way that the enumeration is compatible with the order ≤ on , that is, implies , which is always possible.

Then, functions as above, from intervals to scalars, can be thought of as matrices , where whenever , and otherwise&quot;.&quot; Since we arranged in a way consistent with the usual order on the indices of the matrices, they will appear as upper-triangular matrices with a prescribed zero-pattern determined by the incomparable elements in under ≤.

The incidence algebra of ≤ is then isomorphic to the algebra of upper-triangular matrices with this prescribed zero-pattern and arbitrary (including possibly zero) scalar entries everywhere else, with the operations being ordinary matrix addition, scaling and multiplication.

==Special elements==
The multiplicative identity element of the incidence algebra is the delta function, defined by

:formula_2

The zeta function of an incidence algebra is the constant function &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = 1 for every nonempty interval [&quot;a, b&quot;]. Multiplying by &quot;ζ&quot; is analogous to integration.

One can show that ζ is invertible in the incidence algebra (with respect to the convolution defined above). (Generally, a member &quot;h&quot; of the incidence algebra is invertible if and only if &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) is invertible for every &quot;x&quot;.) The multiplicative inverse of the zeta function is the Möbius function &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;a, b&quot;); every value of &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;a, b&quot;) is an integral multiple of 1 in the base ring.

The Möbius function can also be defined inductively by the following relation:
:formula_3

Multiplying by &quot;μ&quot; is analogous to differentiation, and is called Möbius inversion.

The square of the zeta function gives the number of elements in an interval:
formula_4

==Examples==
;Positive integers ordered by divisibility
:The convolution associated to the incidence algebra for intervals [1, &quot;n&quot;] becomes the Dirichlet convolution, hence the Möbius function is &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;a, b&quot;) = &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;b/a&quot;), where the second &quot;μ&quot; is the classical Möbius function introduced into number theory in the 19th century.
;Finite subsets of some set &quot;E&quot;, ordered by inclusion
:The Möbius function is formula_5
:whenever &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are finite subsets of &quot;E&quot; with &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;T&quot;, and Möbius inversion is called the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
:Geometrically, this is a hypercube: formula_6
;Natural numbers with their usual order
:The Möbius function is formula_7 and Möbius inversion is called the (backwards) difference operator.
:Geometrically, this corresponds to the discrete number line.
:The convolution of functions in the incidence algebra corresponds to multiplication of formal power series: see the discussion of reduced incidence algebras below. The Möbius function corresponds to the sequence (1, −1, 0, 0, 0, ... ) of coefficients of the formal power series 1 − &quot;t&quot;, and the zeta function corresponds to the sequence of coefficients (1, 1, 1, 1, ...) of the formal power series formula_8, which is inverse. The delta function in this incidence algebra similarly corresponds to the formal power series 1.
;Finite sub-multisets of some multiset &quot;E&quot;, ordered by inclusion
:The above three examples can be unified and generalized by considering a multiset &quot;E,&quot; and finite sub-multisets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; of &quot;E&quot;. The Möbius function is formula_9
:This generalizes the positive integers ordered by divisibility by a positive integer corresponding to its multiset of prime factors with multiplicity, e.g., 12 corresponds to the multiset formula_10
:This generalizes the natural numbers with their usual order by a natural number corresponding to a multiset of one underlying element and cardinality equal to that number, e.g., 3 corresponds to the multiset formula_11
;Subgroups of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group &quot;G&quot;, ordered by inclusion
:The Möbius function is formula_12 if formula_13 is a normal subgroup of formula_14 and formula_15 and it is 0 otherwise. This is a theorem of Weisner (1935).
;Partitions of a set
:Partially order the set of all partitions of a finite set by saying &quot;σ&quot; ≤ &quot;τ&quot; if &quot;σ&quot; is a finer partition than &quot;τ&quot;. In particular, let &quot;τ&quot; have &quot;t&quot; blocks which respectively split into &quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;t&quot; finer blocks of &quot;σ&quot;, which has a total of &quot;s&quot; = &quot;s&quot;1 + ⋅⋅⋅ + &quot;s&quot;&quot;t&quot; blocks. Then the Möbius function is: formula_16

==Euler characteristic==
A poset is &quot;bounded&quot; if it has smallest and largest elements, which we call 0 and 1 respectively (not to be confused with the 0 and 1 of the ring of scalars). The Euler characteristic of a bounded finite poset is &quot;μ&quot;(0,1). The reason for this terminology is the following: If &quot;P&quot; has a 0 and 1, then &quot;μ&quot;(0,1) is the reduced Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex whose faces are chains in &quot;P&quot; \ {0, 1}. This can be shown using Philip Hall&#x27;s theorem, relating the value of &quot;μ&quot;(0,1) to the number of chains of length &quot;i&quot;.

==Reduced incidence algebras==

The reduced incidence algebra consists of functions which assign the same value to any two intervals which are equivalent in an appropriate sense, usually meaning isomorphic as posets. This is a subalgebra of the incidence algebra, and it clearly contains the incidence algebra&#x27;s identity element and zeta function. Any element of the reduced incidence algebra that is invertible in the larger incidence algebra has its inverse in the reduced incidence algebra. Thus the Möbius function is also in the reduced incidence algebra.

Reduced incidence algebras were introduced by Doubillet, Rota, and Stanley to give a natural construction of various rings of generating functions.

=== Natural numbers and ordinary generating functions ===
For the poset formula_17 the reduced incidence algebra consists of functions formula_18 invariant under translation, formula_19 for all formula_20 so as to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [&quot;a&quot;+&quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;+&quot;k&quot;] and [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Let &quot;t&quot; denote the function with &quot;t&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;+1) = 1 and &quot;t&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = 0 otherwise, a kind of invariant delta function on isomorphism classes of intervals. Its powers in the incidence algebra are the other invariant delta functions &quot;t&quot; &quot;n&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;+&quot;n&quot;) = 1 and &quot;t&quot; &quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 otherwise. These form a basis for the reduced incidence algebra, and we may write any invariant function as formula_21. This notation makes clear the isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of formal power series formula_22 over the scalars &quot;R,&quot; also known as the ring of ordinary generating functions. We may write the zeta function as formula_23 the reciprocal of the Möbius function formula_24

=== Subset poset and exponential generating functions ===
For the Boolean poset of finite subsets formula_25 ordered by inclusion formula_26, the reduced incidence algebra consists of invariant functions formula_27 defined to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;] and [&quot;S&quot;′,&quot;T&quot;&amp;hairsp;′] with |&quot;T&quot; \ &quot;S&quot;| = |&quot;T&quot;&amp;hairsp;′ \ &quot;S&quot;′|. Again, let &quot;t&quot; denote the invariant delta function with &quot;t&quot;(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) = 1 for |&quot;T&quot; \ &quot;S&quot;| = 1 and &quot;t&quot;(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) = 0 otherwise. Its powers are:
formula_28 where the sum is over all chains formula_29 and the only non-zero terms occur for saturated chains with formula_30 since these correspond to permutations of &quot;n&quot;, we get the unique non-zero value &quot;n&quot;!. Thus, the invariant delta functions are the divided powers formula_31 and we may write any invariant function as formula_32 where [&quot;n&quot;] = {1, . . . , &quot;n&quot;}. This gives a natural isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of exponential generating functions. The zeta function is formula_33 with Möbius function:
formula_34
Indeed, this computation with formal power series proves that formula_35 Many combinatorial counting sequences involving subsets or labeled objects can be interpreted in terms of the reduced incidence algebra, and computed using exponential generating functions.

=== Divisor poset and Dirichlet series ===
Consider the poset &quot;D&quot; of positive integers ordered by divisibility, denoted by formula_36 The reduced incidence algebra consists of functions formula_18 that are invariant under multiplication: formula_38 for all formula_39 (This multiplicative equivalence of intervals is a much stronger relation than poset isomorphism; e.g., for primes &quot;p&quot;, the two-element intervals [1,&quot;p&quot;] are all inequivalent.) For an invariant function, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) depends only on &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot;, so a natural basis consists of invariant delta functions formula_40 defined by formula_41 if &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = &quot;n&quot; and 0 otherwise; then any invariant function can be written formula_42

The product of two invariant delta functions is:
:formula_43
since the only non-zero term comes from &quot;c&quot; = &quot;na&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;mc&quot; = &quot;nma&quot;. Thus, we get an isomorphism from the reduced incidence algebra to the ring of formal Dirichlet series by sending formula_40 to formula_45 so that &quot;f&quot; corresponds to formula_46

The incidence algebra zeta function ζ&quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) = 1 corresponds to the classical Riemann zeta function formula_47 having reciprocal formula_48 where formula_49 is the classical Möbius function of number theory. Many other arithmetic functions arise naturally within the reduced incidence algebra, and equivalently in terms of Dirichlet series. For example, the divisor function formula_50 is the square of the zeta function, formula_51 a special case of the above result that formula_52 gives the number of elements in the interval [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]; equivalenty, formula_53

The product structure of the divisor poset facilitates the computation of its Möbius function. Unique factorization into primes implies &quot;D&quot; is isomorphic to an infinite Cartesian product formula_54, with the order given by coordinatewise comparison: formula_55, where formula_56 is the &quot;k&quot;th prime, corresponds to its sequence of exponents formula_57 Now the Möbius function of &quot;D&quot; is the product of the Möbius functions for the factor posets, computed above, giving the classical formula: 
:formula_58

The product structure also explains the classical Euler product for the zeta function. The zeta function of &quot;D&quot; corresponds to a Cartesian product of zeta functions of the factors, computed above as formula_59 so that formula_60 where the right side is a Cartesian product. Applying the isomorphism which sends &quot;t&quot; in the &quot;k&quot;th factor to formula_61, we obtain the usual Euler product.

<doc id="166981" wikidata="Q7250371" url="?curid=166981" title="Proposal for the Province of Toronto">
<text>The Province of Toronto is an urban secession proposal to split the city of Toronto and some or all of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) from the province of Ontario into a new Canadian province. Secession of Toronto, the surrounding region, or any other portion of the province from Ontario to create a new province would require an amendment to the Constitution of Canada.

The proposal for a new province of Toronto has been made by politicians and urban affairs commentators, in 2010 by MPP Bill Murdoch, and most recently by 2018 Toronto mayoral candidate and former Toronto Chief Planner Jennifer Keesmaat. The concept has also been supported by Jane Jacobs and others.

Variations of the proposal have appeared intermittently for decades.
==Causes==
Arguments posited for Toronto or GTA provincehood include those stating that the area&#x27;s residents are politically and economically exploited by the rest of the province. Another argument presented is the urban issues faced by Toronto not present in other cities or rural areas of Ontario, including the delivery of public services to large numbers of immigrants and visible minorities, gun control, and differences in the delivery of education and health care to its residents. A federal political issue is the Greater Toronto Area&#x27;s under-representation in the House of Commons.

Murdoch&#x27;s proposal was motivated by a contrary sentiment, that the rural areas of Ontario have little clout in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario compared to Toronto. Andrew Steele, in an editorial in The Globe and Mail, stated that Murdoch was instead speaking to the rural base of voters in his constituency and calling for the separation of rural Ontario from Toronto. Another argument sometimes presented to support a split of Toronto from the province is that politicians from other cities in the province are concerned about their influence on provincial politics.

Glen Murray has stated that Canadian cities must rely on property taxes, as they have no ability to enact other taxes or collect income or consumption taxes.

==History==
The Province of Toronto was first proposed as the name of the province of Ontario during the debates leading to Canadian Confederation in 1867. British imperial officials considered the name after noting that Quebec City was the capital of Quebec, and hence Toronto should be the capital of a similarly named province. The idea had little traction and was dismissed in favour of using the same name for the province as the lake adjacent to its capital city, Lake Ontario.

The provincehood movement idea has been supported by the urban activist Jane Jacobs and urban planner Joe Berridge. Jacobs viewed Toronto as a region, which was split into multiple jurisdictions as an artefact of historical politics.
In the 1970s, Paul Godfrey presented to the Royal Commission on Metropolitan Toronto, as chairman of Metropolitan Toronto, arguments that the region should have the capability to set policy as does a provincial government.
 In 1991 academic and future member of parliament Ted McWhinney argued before a parliamentary committee that if Quebec were to separate Ontario would need to be broken up to rebalance confederation. According to McWhinney, splitting off Toronto would be the most sensible option, pointing to Germany where Hamburg and Berlin have their own states as an example.

Mel Lastman proposed Toronto provincehood in 1999 while attending the &quot;Mayors Summit of the Americas&quot; in Miami, Florida; he later retracted his comments, but by then, they had already spurred discussion of the idea in the media. Lastman was panned in an editorial by The Hamilton Spectator for not having considered all the consequences of provincehood. Debate flourished, as various proposals were presented, including one for the creation of the Province of Southern Ontario and another for the creation of a city-state status in Canada, which could also include Vancouver and Montreal. The Committee for the Province of Toronto was formed to seek a constitutional amendment enabling the formation of a new province. On 9 February 1999, councillor Michael Walker presented a notice of motion to Toronto City Council on behalf of the committee. Lastman also considered issuing a plebiscite to the residents of Toronto about Toronto provincehood.
These debates faded, but did result in negotiation between the City of Toronto government and the provincial government about greater autonomy for Toronto, which eventually resulted in new legislation &quot;The Stronger City of Toronto for a Stronger Ontario Act&quot;, as well as the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot; which granted the city more policy-setting powers; it has used these, for example, to define new taxes, and to ban corporate and union donations for municipal election campaigns. It also indirectly influenced federal policy, as the &quot;New Deal for Cities&quot; in 2003 was one of the platforms for Paul Martin after he succeeded Jean Chrétien as Prime Minister of Canada.

Tooker Gomberg who placed second to Lastman in the 2000 mayoral election, also favoured the idea. In November 2000, just before the election, he stated that &quot;the province of Toronto idea, though it&#x27;s a long shot and a long-term solution, is something I favour. It&#x27;s a compelling idea whose time has not quite come.&quot;

At a meeting of the Bruce County Federation of Agriculture in 2010, a Member of Provincial Parliament from central Ontario, Bill Murdoch, suggested that the city of Toronto become its own province, but the other parts of the GTA (also known as &quot;the 905&quot;) would remain in Ontario, proposing its new capital to be London. David Miller, mayor of Toronto, responded by issuing a message via Twitter, stating &quot;Province of Toronto... an idea whose time has come?&quot;, and his spokesman Stuart Green indicated that Miller would consider a public debate about the possible secession of Toronto from Ontario, and Murdoch stated that he received an email from Miller also indicating he was agreeable to a discussion about it. Murdoch had considered presenting a private member&#x27;s bill to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario about this proposal. Thunder Bay mayor Lynn Peterson opposed Murdoch&#x27;s proposal, stating that one of the perceived issues was inconsequential, specifically that policies defined in the Ontario legislature are not Toronto-centric. Michael Gravelle, the Minister of Northern Development and Mines, said &quot;I look at it from the perspective of would this be good for Northern Ontario . . . and I don&#x27;t think it would be&quot;.

In 2018, some activists revived the proposal again, after Ontario premier Doug Ford introduced legislation to reduce Toronto City Council from 47 to 25 seats, months after the 2018 municipal election was already underway.

==Constitutional amendment==
For any part of Toronto and the surrounding region to secede from Ontario to create a new province would require an amendment to the Constitution of Canada. The constitutional amendment would require resolutions from the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of Canada, and resolutions from the legislative bodies of 7 of the provinces representing at least 50% of the population.

However, it has also been suggested that such an amendment may not be necessary if the federal and provincial government agree to split the province.

==By the numbers==
With 2.6 million residents as of 2016, the city of Toronto is more populous than six provinces: namely, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan. With a population of over 6 million, the Greater Toronto Area is more populous than those six, as well as Alberta and British Columbia.

The Province of Toronto would become the second smallest in Canada by area, larger only than Prince Edward Island, whose area is 5,660 km2, but would become the third most populous province in Canada only after Quebec and the resized Ontario.

If the boundaries were redefined to also include the adjacent city of Hamilton to turn the contiguous Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area into the new province of Toronto, it would supersede the resized province of Ontario as the 2nd largest province by population.

==Political party==
Registration for the &quot;Province of Toronto Party&quot; was accepted by Elections Ontario on 18 June 2001, and became effective on 1 July that year. One of its founding members was David Vallance. Members of the party contested for the mayorship of Toronto in the 2003 and 2006 municipal elections.

Paul Lewin&#x27;s campaign in the 2003 mayoral election used the slogan &quot;Free 416&quot;, referring to the regional use of the city&#x27;s area code as a nickname, while advocating a Province of Toronto. He fared poorly in the municipal election.

David Vallance was the 2006 candidate for the mayoral election in Toronto. He has written several Letters to the Editor over the years on various matters, including the state of Toronto&#x27;s provincial tax burden. He was a vocal opponent of the amalgamation of the old City of Toronto with neighbouring municipalities in 1997, and led the group Taxpayers Against Megacity. He had previously campaigned for city council in the 1997 municipal election as an extension of his anti-megacity campaign, and also advocated property tax reforms. In 2006, he argued that Torontonians should &quot;take control of our own taxes and control our own destiny&quot;.

<text>Athenaeus of [[Naucratis]] (, or Nαυκράτιος, &quot;Athēnaios Naukratitēs&quot; or &quot;Naukratios&quot;; ) was an ancient Greek rhetorician and grammarian, flourishing about the end of the 2nd and beginning of the 3rd century AD. The &quot;Suda&quot; says only that he lived in the times of Marcus Aurelius, but the contempt with which he speaks of Commodus, who died in 192, implies that he survived that emperor. He was a contemporary of Adrantus.

Athenaeus himself states that he was the author of a treatise on the &quot;thratta&quot;, a type of fish mentioned by Archippus and other comic poets, and of a history of the Syrian kings. Both works are lost. Of his works, only the fifteen-volume &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; mostly survives.

==The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;==

The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, which means &#x27;dinner-table philosophers&#x27;, survives in fifteen books. The first two books, and parts of the third, eleventh and fifteenth, are extant only in epitome, but otherwise the work seems to be complete. It is an immense store-house of information, chiefly on matters connected with famous cooks, dining, but also containing remarks on music, songs, dances, philosophy, games, courtesans, and luxury. Nearly 800 writers and 2,500 separate works are referred to by Athenaeus; one of his characters (not necessarily to be identified with the historical author himself) boasts of having read 800 plays of Athenian Middle Comedy alone. Were it not for Athenaeus, much valuable information about the ancient world would be missing, and many ancient Greek authors such as Archestratus would be almost entirely unknown. Book XIII, for example, is an important source for the study of sexuality in classical and Hellenistic Greece, and a rare fragment of Theognetus&#x27; work survives in 3.63. 

The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; professes to be an account given by an individual named Athenaeus to his friend Timocrates of a banquet held at the house of Larensius (Λαρήνσιος; in Latin: Larensis), a wealthy book-collector and patron of the arts. It is thus a dialogue within a dialogue, after the manner of Plato, but the conversation extends to enormous length. The topics for discussion generally arise from the course of the dinner itself, but extend to literary and historical matters of every description, including abstruse points of grammar. The guests supposedly quote from memory. The actual sources of the material preserved in the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; remain obscure, but much of it probably comes at second hand from early scholars.

The twenty-four named guests include individuals called Galen and Ulpian, but they are all probably fictitious personages, and the majority take no part in the conversation. If the character Ulpian is identical with the famous jurist, the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; may have been written after his death in 223; but the jurist was murdered by the Praetorian Guard, whereas Ulpian in Athenaeus dies a natural death. 

The complete version of the text, with the gaps noted above, is preserved in only one manuscript, conventionally referred to as A. The epitomized version of the text is preserved in two manuscripts, conventionally known as C and E. The standard edition of the text is Olson&#x27;s Teubner. The standard numbering is drawn largely from Casaubon.

The encyclopaedist and author Sir Thomas Browne wrote a short essay upon Athenaeus which reflects a revived interest in the &quot;Banquet of the Learned&quot; amongst scholars during the 17th century following its publication in 1612 by the Classical scholar Isaac Casaubon.

<text>Korçë District (), was one of the 36 districts of Albania, which were dissolved in July 2000 and replaced by 12 counties. It had a population of 143,499 in 2001, and an area of . Its capital was the city of Korçë. Its territory is now part of Korçë County: the municipalities of Korçë, Maliq and Pustec.

Korçë District was considered one of two main minority regions of the country&#x27;s south.
During World War I the French created the Republic of Korça in the area.

==Geography==
It had an area of , making it the largest district in Albania. It was situated in the southeastern part of Albania, from lat. 40°27&#x27;N to lat. 40°57&#x27;N and from long. 21°4&#x27;E to 20°19&#x27;E.

It was bordered by Pogradec District to the north, by Greece with the Florina regional unit (Greek Macedonia) to the east, Devoll District to the southeast, by Kolonjë District and Përmet District to the southwest, and by Gramsh District and Skrapar District on the west.

==History==
=== 19th century === 
Yuriy Venelin (1802–1839) a Russian scholar who specialised in Bulgarian studies noted that the Korçë District in 1833 (at which point its boundaries were quite different from the modern district, including all of Devoll and various other differences) had 50 villages with two thirds being Muslim and a third being Christian. Settlements of significance during that time were Moscopole, Vithkuq, Kamenicë, Floq, Boboshticë, Drenovë, Borje, Voskop and so on. Houses of the area numbered a total of 2400 containing some 22,000 people according to the Ottoman census. The Muslims and Christians of the region were noted as being &quot;Albanians by nationality — speaking the same language, having the same customs&quot; involved in agricultural employment, many unskilled and illiterate apart from those in Korçë and Moscopole that conduct trade. The villagers of Moscopole were mainly Aromanians in addition to Greeks and Albanians, while some Bulgarians living nearby.

=== 20th century === 
In the 1908 statistics of Amadore Virgili as presented by Nicholas Cassavetes for the Pan-Epirotic Union of Northern Epirus showed the entire kaza of Korçë, which also included surrounding rural areas as well as the modern Devoll District as having a Muslim majority which was not differentiated by nationality alongside a Christian minority of which there were 43,800 Albanian speakers and 1,214 Aromanians (Vlachs), with no Greek speakers found, while Bulgarians were not counted for. For the same area, the 1913 statistics of Destani, which did not differentiate subjects by faith but only language, found 89829 Albanian speakers, 3190 Aromanian speakers, 3985 Bulgarian speakers, no Greek speakers and 527 &quot;others&quot;. With regard to the Aromanian population, Lambros Psomas argues the study of Virgili likely undercounted the Aromanian speakers while the study of Destani is more reliable with regard to the Aromanians but he also argues the study of Destani was pro-Albanian in motive and drastically undercounted the number of Greek speakers in the Himara and Leskovik kazas, while Psomas also excludes Korçë from the collection of regions with notable Greek-speaking presence. British historian Tom Winnifrith states that during the delineation of the Greek-Albanian border a part of the local pro-Greek element included communities whose native speech was Greek.

In 1919, US diplomat Joseph Emerson Haven on special detail in Albania wrote a detailed report regarding the political circumstances in the country. Haven wrote that the province of Korçë numbered some 60,000 people of whom 18% had a preference for union with Greece and within that group half were doing so from fear or from being promised financial gain through attainment of Muslim properties and land. Haven also noted that in 1919 there was a degree of antipathy shown by both Muslims and Christians in the district toward Greece, and an ethnic affinity among Albanians that, at the time, came before religious affinity. At the Peace Conference in Paris, the Greek delegation argued that all Christians in North Epirus, including those that spoke Albanian, should be classified as Greeks because, they argued, their sentiments were Greek, and they had a common religion with Greeks; Lambros Psomas, however, argued that this did not apply in Korçë kaza, where there were many Orthodox Albanian nationalists.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity=== 
According to the 2011 Albanian census most of the population of the district of Korçë are ethnic Albanians, while a significant number of ethnic minorities such as Aromanians and Greeks also inhabit the district. Nowadays, Aromanians are found mainly residing in rural communities surrounding Korçë and according to the Albanian government census number some 5,000 people.

In 2002 it was reported that Greek-speakers were also present in the city of Korçë and in the area surrounding it. A Slavic minority most concentrated in the municipality of Pustec also exists, as does a scattered presence of Romani people.

===Religion=== 
The largest religions in the district of Korçë are Orthodox Christianity and Islam. The Muslims are mainly ethnic Albanians and are divided between Sunni, Bektashi and Halveti groups. The Orthodox Christians are mainly Greeks, Orthodox Albanians, and Aromanians. Additionally, among the Christians, there is a presence of Protestants, dating back to the actions of Gjerasim Qiriazi. Finally, a presence of Catholics was detected in the 2011 census.

==Economy==
During the 20th century, Korçë gained a substantial industrial capacity in addition to its historic role as a commercial and agricultural centre. The plateau on which the city stands is highly fertile and is one of Albania&#x27;s main wheat-growing areas. Local industries include the manufacture of knitwear, rugs, textiles, flour-milling, brewing, and sugar-refining. Deposits of lignite coal are mined in the mountains nearby such as Mborje-Drenovë. The city is home to the nationally famous Birra Korça.

<text>Georgi Ivanov Markov ( ; 1 March 1929 – 11 September 1978) was a Bulgarian dissident writer. He originally worked as a novelist, screenwriter and playwright in his native country, the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, until his defection in 1969. After relocating to London, he worked as a broadcaster and journalist for the BBC World Service, the US-funded Radio Free Europe and West Germany&#x27;s Deutsche Welle. Markov used such forums to conduct a campaign of sarcastic criticism against the incumbent Bulgarian-Soviet regime, which, according to his wife at the time he died, eventually became &quot;vitriolic&quot; and included &quot;really smearing mud on the people in the inner circles.&quot; 

Markov was assassinated on a London street via a micro-engineered pellet that might have contained ricin. Contemporary newspaper accounts reported that he had been stabbed in the leg with an umbrella delivering a poisoned pellet, wielded by someone associated with the Bulgarian Secret Service. Annabel Markov recalled her husband&#x27;s view about the umbrella, telling the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, in April 1979, &quot;He felt a jab in his thigh. He looked around and there was a man behind him who&#x27;d apologized and dropped an umbrella. I got the impression as he told the story that the jab hadn&#x27;t been inflicted by the umbrella but that the man had dropped the umbrella as cover to hide his face.&quot; It was reported after the fall of the Soviet Union that the Soviet KGB had assisted the Bulgarian Secret Service.

== Life in Bulgaria ==
Georgi Markov was born on 1 March 1929, in Knyazhevo, a Sofia neighbourhood. In 1946, he graduated from the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (high school) and began university studies in industrial chemistry. Initially, Markov worked as a chemical engineer and a teacher in a technical school. At the age of 19, he became ill with tuberculosis which forced him to attend various hospitals. His first literary attempts occurred during that time. In 1957, a novel, &quot;The Night of Caesium&quot;, appeared. Soon another novel, &quot;The Ajax Winners&quot; (1959) and two collections of short stories (1961) were published. In 1962, Markov published the novel &quot;Men&quot; which won the annual award of the Union of Bulgarian Writers and he was subsequently accepted as a member of the Union, a prerequisite for a professional career in literature. Georgi Markov started working at the Narodna Mladezh Publishing House. The story collections &quot;A Portrait of My Double&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Women of Warsaw&quot; (1968) secured his place as one of the most talented young writers in Bulgaria. Markov also wrote a number of plays but most of them were never staged or were removed from theatre repertoire by the Communist censors: &quot;To Crawl Under the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;The Elevator&quot;, &quot;Assassination in the Cul-de-Sac&quot;, &quot;Stalinists&quot; and &quot;I Was Him&quot;. The novel &quot;The Roof&quot; was halted in mid-printing since it described as a fact and in allegorical terms the collapse of the roof of the Lenin steel mill. Markov was one of the authors of the popular TV series &quot;Every Kilometer&quot; (&quot;Всеки километър&quot; or &quot;At Every Milestone&quot;) which created the character of the Second World War detective Velinsky and his nemesis the Resistance fighter Deyanov.

Although some of his works were banned, Georgi Markov had become a successful author. He was among the writers and poets that Todor Zhivkov tried to co-opt and coerce into serving the regime with their works. During this period Markov had a bohemian lifestyle, which was unknown to most Bulgarians.

== Writer and dissident ==

Although not yet confirmed, Markov&#x27;s first published work was considered to be &quot;The Whiskey Record Holder&quot;, which was issued in the newspaper &quot;Narodna kultura.&quot; There are at least three versions as to when he debuted as an author:
* Slav Karaslavov&#x27;s version (1972) claims that Markov debuts in the newspaper &quot;Stershel&quot; in 1952. In the same year, signed by B. Aprilov and G. Markov, the feuilleton &quot;The Forest of Horrors&quot; was published in the newspaper.
* Yordan Vasilev&#x27;s version (1990) – according to him, Markov debuts in the newspaper &quot;Narodna armia&quot; in 1951. Signed as &quot;Georgi Markov&quot;, &quot;The Whiskey Record Holder&quot; (7 July 1951) and &quot;Bolshevik&quot; (12 December 1951) were published.

* Aleksander Kostov&#x27;s version (1996) says that Markov debuts in the newspaper &quot;Zemedelsko zname&quot; in 1947. Signed as &quot;G. Markov&quot;, many of his works, some of which are &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot; (19 February 1947) and &quot;Heinrich Heine&quot; (21 February 1947), were published.
In 1969, Markov left for Bologna, Italy, where his brother lived. His initial idea was to wait until his status with the Bulgarian authorities improved, but he gradually changed his mind and decided to stay in the West, especially after September 1971 when the Bulgarian government refused to extend his passport. Markov moved to London, where he learned English and started working for the Bulgarian section of the BBC World Service (1972). He tried to work for the film industry, hoping for help from Peter Uvaliev, but was unsuccessful. Later he also worked with Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe. In 1972, Markov&#x27;s membership in the Union of Bulgarian Writers was suspended and he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to six years and six months in prison for his defection.

His works were withdrawn from libraries and bookshops and his name was not mentioned by the official Bulgarian media until 1989. The Bulgarian Secret Service opened a file on Markov under the code name &quot;Wanderer.&quot; In 1974, his play &quot;To Crawl Under the Rainbow&quot; was staged in London, while in Edinburgh the play &quot;Archangel Michael&quot;, written in English, won first prize. The novel &quot;The Right Honourable Chimpanzee&quot;, co-written with David Phillips, was published after his death. In 1975, Markov married Annabel Dilke. The couple had a daughter, Alexandra-Raina, born a year later.

Between 1975 and 1978, Markov worked on his &quot;In Absentia Reports&quot;, an analysis of life in Communist Bulgaria. They were broadcast weekly on Radio Free Europe. Their criticism of the Communist government and of the Party leader Todor Zhivkov made Markov, even more, an enemy of the regime.
In 1978, Markov was killed in London (see below), allegedly by an operative connected to the KGB and the Bulgarian secret police under Zhivkov. His &quot;In Absentia Reports&quot; were published in Bulgaria in 1990, after the end of the Communist government.

In 2000, Markov was posthumously awarded the Order of Stara Planina, Bulgaria&#x27;s most prestigious honour, for his &quot;significant contribution to the Bulgarian literature, drama and non-fiction and for his exceptional civic position and confrontation to the Communist regime.&quot;

== Assassination ==
On 7 September 1978, Markov walked across Waterloo Bridge spanning the River Thames and waited to take a bus to his job at the BBC. While at the bus stop, he reported feeling a slight sharp pain, as if from an insect bite or sting, on the back of his right thigh. He reportedly saw a man picking up an umbrella off the ground behind him.

When he arrived at work at the BBC World Service offices, he noticed a small red pimple had formed at the site of the sting he had felt earlier and the pain had not lessened or stopped. He told at least one of his colleagues at the BBC, Theo Lirkov, about this incident. That evening, he developed a fever and was admitted to St James&#x27; Hospital in Balham, where he died four days later, on 11 September 1978, at the age of 49. His grave is in a small churchyard at the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross in Whitchurch Canonicorum, Dorset.

=== Later investigation and aftermath ===

Bernard Riley, the physician treating Markov, considered many possible causes of his illness, including that he had been bitten by a venomous tropical snake. Riley had the inflamed area at the back of his leg x-rayed, but no foreign object was detected at this time. Due to the circumstances and statements Markov made to doctors expressing the suspicion that he had been poisoned, the Metropolitan Police ordered a thorough post-mortem of his body. Rufus Crompton performed it, noting a red mark on the back of Markov&#x27;s leg. He cut a tissue sample from the area, with a matching sample from the other leg. These samples were sent for further analysis at the Porton Down chemical and biological weapons laboratory. There, David Gall, the Research Medical Officer, found a tiny pellet in the tissue sample.

The pellet measured in diameter and was composed of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. It had two holes with diameters of drilled through it, producing an X-shaped cavity. Further examination by experts from Porton Down could not detect any remnant of poison. Considering possible poisons, scientists hypothesised that the pellet might have contained ricin.

Porton Down scientists also thought that a sugary substance had been used to coat the tiny holes, creating a bubble that trapped the poison inside the cavities, with a specially crafted coating designed to melt at : human body temperature. After the pellet was inside Markov, the coating might have melted and the poison released to be absorbed into the bloodstream and killed him.

Regardless of whether the doctors treating Markov had known that the poison might have been ricin, the result would have been the same, as no antidote exists for ricin.

Ten days before the assassination, an attempt was made to kill another Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov, in the same manner as Markov, in a Paris Métro station.

KGB defector Oleg Kalugin alleged that the Bulgarian Secret Service arranged the murder with help from the Soviet KGB. Nobody has been charged with Markov&#x27;s murder, largely because most documents relating to it are unavailable, probably destroyed. Kalugin said that Markov had been killed using an umbrella gun.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the prime suspect was an Italian, Francesco Gullino or Giullino, who was last known to be living in Denmark. A British documentary, &quot;The Umbrella Assassin&quot; (2006), interviewed people associated with the case in Bulgaria, Britain, Denmark and America, and revealed that Gullino was alive and well, and still travelling freely throughout Europe. There were reports in June 2008 that Scotland Yard had renewed its interest in the case. Detectives were sent to Bulgaria and requests were made to interview relevant individuals. Gullino died in Austria in August 2021.

=== In culture ===
Markov&#x27;s assassination is mentioned in John D. MacDonald&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Green Ripper&quot; when a character is murdered.

The incident is the subject of the song &quot;Wet Job&quot; by Fingerprintz from their 1979 album &quot;The Very Dab&quot;.

The French comedy &quot;The Umbrella Coup&quot; (O.T. &quot;Le coup du parapluie&quot;), a 1980s film by Gérard Oury, uses the idea of a poison-injecting umbrella.

Markov&#x27;s assassination is mentioned in season two, episode seven of &quot;&quot;, by a character as he describes people poisoned with ricin to Gil Grissom.

The Markov assassination is the subject of a test in the first season of the show Mythbusters. Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman test if the assassination could be feasible using an umbrella gun. After testing the duo confirm that an umbrella gun could be used in an assassination in this way.

Markov&#x27;s assassination is also mentioned in the neo-Western crime drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, season two, episode one, &quot;Seven Thirty-Seven&quot; as Walter and Jesse think of plans to kill Tuco Salamanca. 

In August 2018 the case was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;The Reunion&quot;.

Markov&#x27;s assassination is used as the basis for an assassination story in the US drama series &quot;NCIS&quot;, season seven, episode twenty-one, &quot;Obsession&quot;. The character, Lt Hutton, is working on a classified program at the Naval Info-Ops Centre (NIOC) and is discovered to have been murdered using the same method as Markov, leading to a Soviet KGB plotline.

The assassination served as inspiration for a similar poisoning by KGB agents utilising an umbrella, in the period spy drama The Americans, in the second episode of the first season, The Clock. 

Markov&#x27;s assassination is also mentioned in season two, episode one from &quot;Slow Horses&quot;, where River Cartwright and Shirley Dander point to the possibility of the same technique being used to murder a former MI6 agent, who was following a former KGB agent, possibly &quot;Cicada&quot;. Then River finds out that some poison was inserted into the arm, through a similar but different method.

A replica of the umbrella used to assassinate Markov is on display at the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC., US

&quot;Time Shelter&quot;, the International Booker Prize 2023 by Georgi Gospodinov, (translated by Angela Rodel), mentions Markov&#x27;s assassination.

=== Similar attacks ===
On 11 May 2012, a German man died almost a year after having been stabbed with an umbrella in the city of Hanover. German police – who noted a resemblance to the Markov case – analyzed the syringe which the victim had managed to take from the perpetrator, and found dimethylmercury; the reported cause of death was mercury poisoning.

In 2016, police in Chennai, India solved three separate murders when the four killers confessed to having used an umbrella tipped with a potassium cyanide-filled syringe. They had ridden past the victims on a bike and jabbed them in the thigh.

<text>Lizzie Douglas (June 3, 1897 – August 6, 1973), better known as Memphis Minnie, was a blues guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter whose recording career lasted for over three decades. She recorded around 200 songs, some of the best known being &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, &quot;Me and My Chauffeur Blues&quot;, &quot;Bumble Bee&quot; and &quot;Nothing in Rambling&quot;.

== Childhood ==
Douglas was born on June 3, 1897, probably in Tunica County, Mississippi, although she claimed to have been born in New Orleans, Louisiana and raised in the Algiers neighborhood. She was the eldest of 13 siblings. Her parents, Abe and Gertrude Douglas, nicknamed her Kid when she was young, and her family called her that throughout her childhood. It is reported that she disliked the name Lizzie. When she first began performing, she played under the name Kid Douglas.

When she was seven years old, she and her family moved to Walls, Mississippi, south of Memphis, Tennessee. The following year, she received her first guitar, as a Christmas present. She learned to play the banjo by the age of 10 and the guitar by the age of 11, when she started playing at parties. The family later moved to Brunswick, Tennessee. After Minnie&#x27;s mother died, in 1922, Abe Douglas moved back to Walls, where he died in 1935.

==Career==
In 1910, at the age of 13, she ran away from home to live on Beale Street, in Memphis. She played on street corners for most of her teenage years, occasionally returning to her family&#x27;s farm when she ran out of money. Her sidewalk performances led to a tour of the South with the Ringling Brothers Circus from 1916 to 1920. She then went back to Beale Street, with its thriving blues scene, and made her living by playing guitar and singing, supplementing her income with sex work (at that time, it was not uncommon for female performers to turn to sex work out of financial need).

She began performing with Kansas Joe McCoy, her second husband, in 1929. They were discovered by a talent scout for Columbia Records, in front of a barber shop, where they were playing for dimes. She and McCoy went to record in New York City and were given the names Kansas Joe and Memphis Minnie by a Columbia A&amp;R man. Over the next few years she and McCoy released a series of records, performing as a duet. In February 1930 they recorded the song &quot;Bumble Bee&quot; for the Vocalion label, which they had already recorded for Columbia but which had not yet been released. It became one of Minnie&#x27;s most popular songs; she eventually recorded five versions of it. Minnie and McCoy continued to record for Vocalion until August 1934, when they recorded a few sessions for Decca Records. Their last session together was for Decca, in September. They divorced in 1935.

An anecdote from Big Bill Broonzy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Big Bill Blues&quot;, recounts a cutting contest between Minnie and Broonzy in a Chicago nightclub on June 26, 1933, for the prize of a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of gin. Each singer was to sing two songs; after Broonzy sang &quot;Just a Dream&quot; and &quot;Make My Getaway,&quot; Minnie won the prize with &quot;Me and My Chauffeur Blues&quot; and &quot;Looking the World Over&quot;. Paul and Beth Garon, in their biography &quot;Woman with Guitar: Memphis Minnie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, suggested that Broonzy&#x27;s account may have combined various contests at different dates, as these songs of Minnie&#x27;s date from the 1940s rather than the 1930s.

By 1935, Minnie was established in Chicago and had become one of a group of musicians who worked regularly for the record producer and talent scout Lester Melrose. Back on her own after her divorce from McCoy, Minnie began to experiment with different styles and sounds. She recorded four sides for Bluebird Records in July 1935, returned to the Vocalion label in August, and then recorded another session for Bluebird in October, this time accompanied by Casey Bill Weldon, her first husband. By the end of the 1930s, in addition to her output for Vocalion, she had recorded nearly 20 sides for Decca and eight sides for Bluebird. She also toured extensively in the 1930s, mainly in the South.

In 1938, Minnie returned to recording for the Vocalion label, this time accompanied by Charlie McCoy, Kansas Joe McCoy&#x27;s brother, on mandolin. Around this time she married the guitarist and singer Ernest Lawlars, known as Little Son Joe. They began recording together in 1939, with Son adding a more rhythmic backing to Minnie&#x27;s guitar. They recorded for Okeh Records in the 1940s and continued to record together through the decade. By 1941 Minnie had started playing electric guitar, and in May of that year she recorded her biggest hit, &quot;Me and My Chauffeur Blues&quot;. A follow-up date produced two more blues standards, &quot;Looking the World Over&quot; and Lawlars&#x27;s &quot;Black Rat Swing&quot; (issued under the name &quot;Mr. Memphis Minnie&quot;). In the 1940s Minnie and Lawlars continued to work at their &quot;home club,&quot; Chicago&#x27;s popular 708 Club, where they were often joined by Broonzy, Sunnyland Slim, or Snooky Pryor, and also played at many of the other better-known Chicago nightclubs. During the 1940s Minnie and Lawlars performed together and separately in the Chicago and Indiana areas. Minnie often played at &quot;Blue Monday&quot; parties at Ruby Lee Gatewood&#x27;s, on Lake Street. The poet Langston Hughes, who saw her perform at the 230 Club on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1942, wrote of her &quot;hard and strong voice&quot; being made harder and stronger by amplification and described the sound of her electric guitar as &quot;a musical version of electric welders plus a rolling mill.&quot;

Later in the 1940s, Minnie lived in Indianapolis and Detroit. She returned to Chicago in the early 1950s. By the late 1940s, clubs had begun hiring younger and cheaper artists, and Columbia had begun dropping blues artists, including Memphis Minnie. Unable to adapt to changing tastes, she moved to smaller labels, such as Regal, Checker, and J.O.B.

==Later life and death==

Minnie continued to record into the 1950s, but her health began to decline. With public interest in her music waning, she retired from her musical career, and in 1957 she and Lawlars returned to Memphis. Periodically, she appeared on Memphis radio stations to encourage young blues musicians. In 1958 she played at a memorial concert for Big Bill Broonzy. As the Garons wrote in &quot;Woman with Guitar&quot;, &quot;She never laid her guitar down, until she could literally no longer pick it up.&quot; She suffered a stroke in 1960, which left her confined to a wheelchair. Lawlars died the following year, and Minnie had another stroke a short while after. She could no longer survive on her Social Security income. Magazines wrote about her plight, and readers sent her money for assistance. She spent her last years in the Jell Nursing Home, in Memphis, where she died of a stroke in 1973. She is buried at the New Hope Baptist Church Cemetery, in Walls, Mississippi. A headstone paid for by Bonnie Raitt was erected by the Mount Zion Memorial Fund on October 13, 1996, with 34 family members in attendance, including her sister Bob. The ceremony was taped for broadcast by the BBC.
Her headstone is inscribed:

The inscription on the back of her gravestone reads:

The hundreds of sides Minnie recorded are the perfect material to teach us about the blues. For the blues are at once general, and particular, speaking for millions, but in a highly singular, individual voice. Listening to Minnie&#x27;s songs we hear her fantasies, her dreams, her desires, but we will hear them as if they were our own.

==Character and personal life==
Minnie was known as a polished professional and an independent woman who knew how to take care of herself. She presented herself to the public as being feminine and ladylike, wearing expensive dresses and jewelry, but she was aggressive when she needed to be and was not shy when it came to fighting. According to the blues musician Johnny Shines, &quot;Any men fool with her she&#x27;d go for them right away. She didn&#x27;t take no foolishness off them. Guitar, pocket knife, pistol, anything she get her hand on she&#x27;d use it&quot;. According to Homesick James, she chewed tobacco all the time, even while singing or playing the guitar, and always had a cup at hand in case she wanted to spit. Most of the music she made was autobiographical; Minnie expressed a lot of her personal life in music.

Minnie was married three times, although no marriage certificates have been found. It is believed that her first husband was Casey Bill Weldon, whom she married in the early 1920s. Her second husband was the guitarist and mandolin player Kansas Joe McCoy, whom she married in 1929. They filed for divorce in 1934. McCoy&#x27;s jealousy of Minnie&#x27;s professional success has been given as one reason for the breakup of their marriage. Minnie was also reported to have lived with a man known as &quot;Squirrel&quot; in the mid- to late 1930s. Around 1938 she met the guitarist Ernest Lawlars (Little Son Joe), who became her new musical partner, and they married shortly thereafter; Minnie&#x27;s union records, covering 1939 onwards, give her name as Minnie Lawlars. He dedicated songs to her, including &quot;Key to the World&quot;, in which he addresses her as &quot;the woman I got now&quot; and calls her &quot;the key to the world.&quot; 

Minnie was not religious and rarely went to church. The only time she was reported to have gone to church was to see a gospel group perform. She was baptized shortly before she died, probably to please her sister Daisy Johnson. A house in Memphis where she once lived, at 1355 Adelaide Street, still exists.

==Legacy==
Memphis Minnie has been described as &quot;the most popular female country blues singer of all time&quot;. Big Bill Broonzy said that she could &quot;pick a guitar and sing as good as any man I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; Minnie lived to see a renewed appreciation of her recorded work during the revival of interest in blues music in the 1960s. She was an influence on later singers, such as Big Mama Thornton, Jo Ann Kelly and Erin Harpe. She was inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1980.

&quot;Me and My Chauffeur Blues&quot; was recorded by Jefferson Airplane on their debut album, &quot;Jefferson Airplane Takes Off&quot;, with Signe Anderson as lead vocalist. &quot;Can I Do It for You&quot; was recorded by Donovan in 1965, under the title &quot;Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)&quot;. A 1929 Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy song, &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, was adapted (with altered lyrics and a different melody) by Led Zeppelin and released in 1971 on their fourth album. &quot;I&#x27;m Sailin&#x27;&quot; was covered by Mazzy Star on their 1990 debut album, &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot;.
Her family is currently suing record companies and some artists for royalties and for using her music without permission.
In 2007, Minnie was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Walls, Mississippi.

<text>The Chantays, sometimes billed as Chantay&#x27;s, is an American surf rock band formed in Orange County, California. They are known for their 1963 hit instrumental &quot;Pipeline&quot;. Their sound combines electronic keyboards with surf guitar, creating a unique ghostly sound.

==History==
The Chantays were formed in 1961 by five high-school friends. Bob Spickard, Brian Carman (co-writers of &quot;Pipeline&quot;), Bob Welch, Warren Waters and Rob Marshall were all students at Santa Ana High School in California. In December 1962, the group recorded and released &quot;Pipeline&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1963. The track also peaked in the UK Singles Chart in 1963 at No. 16. The Chantays recorded their first album in 1963, also titled &quot;Pipeline&quot;, which included &quot;Blunderbus&quot; and &quot;El Conquistador&quot;. Their follow-up album was &quot;Two Sides of the Chantays&quot; in 1964.

The Chantays toured Japan and the United States, joining the Righteous Brothers and Roy Orbison on a few occasions, and they were the only rock and roll band to perform on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

&quot;Pipeline&quot; (published as sheet music in 1962 by Downey Music Publishing) has become one of several surf rock hits. The tune has since been covered by Bruce Johnston, Welk (on the Dot album &quot;Scarlet O&#x27;Hara&quot;), Al Caiola (on the United Artists album &quot;Greasy Kid Stuff&quot;), the Ventures, Takeshi Terauchi &amp; Blue Jeans, Agent Orange, Hank Marvin (with Duane Eddy), Lively Ones, Pat Metheny, Dick Dale with the help of Stevie Ray Vaughan (Grammy Nominated), by the thrash metal band Anthrax, Bad Manners and Johnny Thunders. &quot;Pipeline&quot; has been used in many films, television programs and commercials, and appears on numerous compilation albums.

The Chantays have been honored for their contributions to music. Highlights include being honored on April 12, 1996, by Hollywood&#x27;s Rock Walk, that was founded to honor individuals and bands that have made lasting and important contributions to music. &quot;Pipeline&quot; is listed as one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Along with Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers and Diane Keaton, the Chantays were honored by the City of Santa Ana, California, and Santa Ana High School when they named a street after them, Chantays Way. &quot;OC Weekly&quot; magazine also named the Chantays as one of the Best Orange County Bands.

The Chantays are still playing. Original members Bob Spickard and Bob Welch are joined by longtime members Ricky Lewis and Brian Nussle. More recent albums include &quot;The Next Set&quot; (live recording) and &quot;Waiting for the Tide&quot;. Some of the tracks are the new songs &quot;Crystal T&quot; and &quot;Killer Dana&quot;, along with remakes of &quot;Pipeline&quot;, &quot;El Conquistador&quot; and &quot;Blunderbus&quot;.

Brian Carman died at his home in Santa Ana, California, from complications of Crohn&#x27;s disease on March 1, 2015. He was 69. Another longtime member Gil Orr died on September 19, 2017. He was 79.

<text>The Crystals are an American vocal group that originated in New York City. Considered one of the defining acts of the girl group era in the first half of the 1960s, their 1961–1964 chart hits – including &quot;There&#x27;s No Other (Like My Baby)&quot;, &quot;Uptown&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;, &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot;– featured three different female lead singers and were all produced by Phil Spector. The latter three songs were originally ranked number 263, number 114, and number 493, respectively, on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. However, two songs were omitted from the magazine&#x27;s 2010 update, leaving only &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; at number 267. In the 2021 update, &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; was added back to the list at number 366.

==History==
===Formation and signing to Philles===
In 1961, Barbara Alston (December 29, 1943, Baltimore, Maryland – February 16, 2018, Charlotte, North Carolina), Mary Thomas, Dolores &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Kenniebrew (born 1945), Myrna Giraud and Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Wright formed the Crystals with the help of Benny Wells, Alston&#x27;s uncle. Soon, the quintet signed with Phil Spector&#x27;s label Philles Records.

Their first hit, the gospel-influenced &quot;There&#x27;s No Other (Like My Baby)&quot;, debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1961. Originally the B-side to &quot;Oh Yeah, Maybe Baby&quot; (featuring Wright on lead), the stirring pop ballad was co-written by Spector and Leroy Bates and featured Barbara Alston on vocals. The recording was made late on the evening of the high school prom at the William H. Maxwell Career and Technical High School, the school attended by Alston, Thomas, and Giraud; they were still wearing their prom dresses, as they had come to the studio straight from the event. The single reached number 20 in January 1962, marking an auspicious debut for Spector&#x27;s Philles label.

Brill Building songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil&#x27;s &quot;Uptown&quot; gave the girls their second radio hit. Having an ethnic flavor with flamenco guitar and castanets, the more uptempo &quot;Uptown&quot; featured Alston once again emoting convincingly over a boy, though this time with class issues woven into the story. After the success of &quot;Uptown&quot;, a pregnant Giraud was replaced by Dolores &quot;LaLa&quot; Brooks.

The controversial subject matter of the next single, 1962&#x27;s &quot;He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)&quot; (written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and sung by Alston), resulted in limited airplay with the track only &quot;bubbling under&quot; the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 123. Alston later disowned the track, stating it was &quot;absolutely, positively, the one record that none of us liked&quot;.

===&quot;Replacement&quot; Crystals===
Soon after &quot;He Hit Me&quot; flopped, Phil Spector began recording singer Darlene Love and her group the Blossoms. The Crystals were not able to travel from New York to Los Angeles fast enough to suit the LA-based Spector, who wanted to quickly record writer Gene Pitney&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; before Vikki Carr could release her version on Liberty Records. As Love and the Blossoms were also based in Los Angeles, Spector recorded and released their version under the Crystals&#x27; banner. It was not the first time Spector promised the Blossoms a single and release it under the Crystals name.

The song had originally been offered to the Shirelles, who turned it down because of the anti-establishment lyrics. It marked a shift in girl group thematic material, where the singer loves a &quot;bad boy&quot;, a theme that would be amplified by later groups (especially the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;).

The ghost release of this single came as a total surprise to the Crystals who were an experienced and much traveled girl harmony group in their own right, but they were nevertheless required to perform and promote the new single on television and on tour as if it were their own. The single reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1962.

&quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; was the Crystals&#x27; only US number one hit and also made the UK top 20. Their follow-up single, &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love&quot;, was also recorded by Love and the Blossoms. It reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and features a spoken intro by Love. &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; kept Pitney&#x27;s own &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart&quot; off the top spot on 3 November 1962. Pitney never reached the Hot 100&#x27;s summit.

===&quot;Real&quot; Crystals return===
Though it is unclear as to the level of their participation in &quot;(Let&#x27;s Dance) The Screw&quot;, the &#x27;real&#x27; Crystals definitely began recording again under their own name in 1963. However, Thomas had departed to get married, only to join another mildly successful group, the Butterflys, along with another original Crystal, Myrna Giraud. This reduced the group to a quartet. Alston, known for her shyness and stage fright, was never comfortable with being out front, stepped down from the lead spot giving it to Dolores &quot;LaLa&quot; Brooks. According to Brooks, she had been doing Alston&#x27;s leads in their live shows for a while.

After &quot;(Let&#x27;s Dance) The Screw&quot;, the group&#x27;s next release was &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;. The song was a top 10 hit in both the US and the UK, as was the follow-up single &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot;, with lead vocals also sung by Brooks. Both these songs were actually recorded by Brooks, the Blossoms and other session singers (including a young Cher). Brooks also flew out to Los Angeles to record tracks for the seasonal album, &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records&quot;. 

At the start of 1964, the Crystals flew to the UK for their first European live shows. &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; soared to number 2 in the UK, and the Crystals also headlined the TV programs &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, and &quot;Tonight at the London Palladium&quot;.

===Mounting tension and break-up===
Despite the steady flow of hit singles, tensions between Spector and the Crystals mounted. Already unhappy with having been replaced by Love and the Blossoms on two singles recordings, the Crystals were even more upset when Spector began focusing much of his time on his other girl group the Ronettes. Not only did the Ronettes become Philles Records&#x27; priority act, the Ronettes actually replaced the Crystals on four album tracks on the 1963 compilation LP, &quot;The Crystals Sing the Greatest Hits&quot;. As well, there were disputes about royalties, with the Crystals feeling that Spector was withholding royalty money that was owed to them.

Two failed Crystals singles followed before the band left Spector&#x27;s Philles Records for United Artists Records in 1964. &quot;Little Boy&quot;, which reached number 92, was a Wall of Sound production that was layered multiple times, which meant that the vocals were hard to distinguish from the music. &quot;All Grown Up&quot;, their final Philles single (of which two versions exist), only reached number 98.

1964 also saw the departure of Wright. She was replaced by Frances Collins (aka Fatima Johnson), a dancer whom they had met while touring and mother of the rapper Prodigy. Toward the end of that year Alston also departed and was not replaced, leaving the group a trio. As a trio, they recorded two singles for United Artists, &quot;My Place&quot;/&quot;You Can&#x27;t Tie a Good Girl Down&quot; (Sep 1965) and &quot;Are You Trying To Get Rid Of Me Baby&quot;/&quot;I Got A Man&quot; (Feb 1966). One more single was released by Alston, Brooks and Thomas on the tiny Michelle Records in 1967 (&quot;Ring-A-Ting-A-Ling&quot;/&quot;Should I Keep On Waiting&quot;) and they disbanded later that year.

They reunited in 1971 and performed until at least 2018. Kenniebrew is the only Crystal who remained active throughout their touring from the 1970s to then, performing with Patricia Pritchett-Lewis, a member since 2005, and Melissa &quot;MelSoulTree&quot; Grant, a member since 2002. That trio of Crystals self-released a CD in 2010 entitled &quot;Live in Asia&quot;, recorded in Singapore. 

After living in Europe for two decades, Brooks returned to the US in 2001 and, as of 2022, performs under her own name across the world, and as the Crystals in the UK and Canada, where she holds the trademark rights to the name. 

Barbara Alston died at a hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina, on February 16, 2018, at age 74.

==Contemporary usage==
&quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; was the opening song to which Elisabeth Shue danced around her bedroom in &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987); it was the song in which Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco enter the Copacabana on their first real date in the movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990); it was featured during the episode &#x27;Homer and Marge Turn a Couple Play&#x27; on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (2006); it was also featured in the episode &#x27;Stand By Meg&#x27; on &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2018). It was also covered by Asobi Seksu and used on their live album &quot;Live at the Echo 10/6/06&quot;. &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; was played during a scene in a dance club in the 1979 film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, and by Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) to train ESL students in the 1981 comedy &quot;Stripes&quot;. &quot;He Hit Me (and It Felt like a Kiss)&quot; was used in the episode &#x27;Mystery Date&#x27; on &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2012).

Crystal was the name of one of the girl group-inspired street urchin characters in the musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, along with Chiffon and Ronnette. Amy Winehouse cited &quot;He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)&quot; as an influence when writing her album &quot;Back to Black&quot;. The American singer Lana Del Rey used the same phrase in the song &quot;Ultraviolence&quot; in the album of the same name.

<text>Ferney-Voltaire () is a commune in the Ain department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of eastern France. It lies between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss border; it forms part of the metropolitan area of Geneva. It is named for Voltaire, who lived there from 1758.

==History==
Ferney was first noted in 14th-century Burgundian registers as &quot;Fernex&quot; and changed several times until the 19th century to Fernay, Fernaj, Fernai or Fernex before adopting its current name as &#x27;Ferney-Voltaire&#x27; in 1791, after the French Revolution which saw a number of city names unchristened and then given more republican names.

During Voltaire&#x27;s residence in Ferney in the second part of the 18th century, the town saw rapid expansion. Today Ferney is a peaceful town with a Saturday market and a large international community, due to the proximity of CERN and the United Nations Office at Geneva. Ferney is growing very quickly. It is also home to the &quot;Lycée International&quot;. Voltaire still presides over Ferney with his statue in the centre of town.

==Voltaire==

From 1758 to 1778 Ferney was home to French writer and philosopher Voltaire, sometimes referred to as &quot;the patriarch of Ferney.&quot; His influence on the town was profound. He built the local church and founded cottage industries that produced some of the finest potters and watchmakers of modern France. The town was eventually renamed &quot;Ferney-Voltaire&quot; in his honour.

In 1758, after having lived in Geneva for less than two years, Voltaire purchased the estate of Ferney in France, near the Swiss border. A prime reason for his leaving Geneva was that theatre was forbidden in that Calvinist city, so he had decided to become the enlightened &quot;patriarch&quot; of the little village of Ferney, setting up potteries, a watchmaking industry and, of course, theatres, attracting rich people from Geneva to watch his plays.

During Voltaire&#x27;s residence, the population of Ferney increased to more than 1,000. Voltaire lived there for the last 20 years of his life before returning to Paris, where he died in 1778.

==Population==
==Schools==

The community has two public preschools/primary schools: École Jean-Calas and École Florian. A nearby intercommunal school, École Intercommunale Jean de la Fontaine in Prévessin-Moëns, also serves the community. the three schools had a combined total of 952 students, with Jean-Calas, Florian, and Jean de la Fontaine respectively having 278, 307, and 367 students. Around 1940 a primary school, the École de Ferney-Voltaire, was established. About 1970 it was renamed &quot;École Florian&quot;, after the French poet and fabulist Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, whose uncle and guardian, the Marquis de Florian, had married a niece of Voltaire, . The school is notable for having had a large number of pupils who were children of physicists at CERN, which is located in the vicinity. Ferney-Voltaire also has a private preschool/primary school, École Saint-Vincent.

Collège Le Joran (junior high school), in Prévessin-Moëns, serves Ferney-Voltaire. Lycée international de Ferney-Voltaire, including a junior high school/middle school (&quot;collège&quot;) and a senior high school/sixth form college (&quot;lycée&quot;) was created in 1961 in Ferney-Voltaire. As of 2016, the Lycée includes a branch campus in Saint-Genis-Pouilly.

==Sights==

Ferney&#x27;s main attraction is Voltaire&#x27;s house (&quot;château&quot;), built 1758–66, now owned and administered by the &quot;Centre des monuments nationaux&quot; (an arm of the French Ministry of Culture). The chateau includes the main building, with a reconstruction of Voltaire&#x27;s room (moved from its original location by later private owners), a garden with a fine view of the Alps, and a church dedicated, contrary to custom, directly to God. In the church&#x27;s inscription, &quot;Deo erexit VOLTAIRE&quot; (&quot;Erected to God by VOLTAIRE&quot;), Voltaire&#x27;s name is written in the largest characters.

A few dozen metres from the chateau is another impressive house, built in 1900 by &quot;Monsieur&quot; Lambert (the sculptor of the statue of Voltaire; his family owned the chateau before it was purchased by the French government). The house, now privately owned, had been used to store provisions and wine for the chateau, and to accommodate the household staff.

The village features 18th-century houses and artisans&#x27; workshops; a life-size statue of Voltaire; a smaller bust of him, surmounting a fountain; many restaurants, French and foreign; and proximity to the nearby cosmopolitan city of Geneva, Switzerland.

Every Saturday, a market is held in the main street of Ferney.

The old road at the centre of the village is a remnant of the time when Voltaire resided at the chateau in Ferney-Voltaire.

The pedestal of the Voltaire statue, erected in 1890, dedicates that memorial to the town&#x27;s &quot;benefactor&quot;, noting that he built over a hundred houses for the inhabitants, as well as a school and church, gave the town interest-free loans, and fed its inhabitants in time of need.

On 31 May 2018, Président Emmanuel Macron officially visited the Château for the re-opening after renovation.

<doc id="167001" wikidata="Q1575634" url="?curid=167001" title="Concrete category">
<text>In mathematics, a concrete category is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to the category of sets (or sometimes to another category). This functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of its morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of topological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets.

A concrete category, when defined without reference to the notion of a category, consists of a class of &quot;objects&quot;, each equipped with an &quot;underlying set&quot;; and for any two objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; a set of functions, called &quot;homomorphisms&quot;, from the underlying set of &quot;A&quot; to the underlying set of &quot;B&quot;. Furthermore, for every object &quot;A&quot;, the identity function on the underlying set of &quot;A&quot; must be a homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, and the composition of a homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; followed by a homomorphism from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot; must be a homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;.

== Definition ==

A concrete category is a pair (&quot;C&quot;,&quot;U&quot;) such that

*&quot;C&quot; is a category, and 
*&quot;U&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → Set (the category of sets and functions) is a faithful functor.

The functor &quot;U&quot; is to be thought of as a forgetful functor, which assigns to every object of &quot;C&quot; its &quot;underlying set&quot;, and to every morphism in &quot;C&quot; its &quot;underlying function&quot;.

It is customary to call the morphisms in a concrete category &quot;homomorphisms&quot; (e.g., group homomorphisms, ring homomorphisms, etc.) Because of the faithfulness of the functor &quot;U&quot;, the homomorphisms of a concrete category may be formally identified with their underlying functions (i.e., their images under &quot;U&quot;); the homomorphisms then regain the usual interpretation as &quot;structure-preserving&quot; functions.

A category &quot;C&quot; is concretizable if there exists a concrete category (&quot;C&quot;,&quot;U&quot;);
i.e., if there exists a faithful functor &quot;U&quot;: &quot;C&quot; → Set. All small categories are concretizable: define &quot;U&quot; so that its object part maps each object &quot;b&quot; of &quot;C&quot; to the set of all morphisms of &quot;C&quot; whose codomain is &quot;b&quot; (i.e. all morphisms of the form &quot;f&quot;: &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; for any object &quot;a&quot; of &quot;C&quot;), and its morphism part maps each morphism &quot;g&quot;: &quot;b&quot; → &quot;c&quot; of &quot;C&quot; to the function &quot;U&quot;(&quot;g&quot;): &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) → &quot;U&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) which maps each member &quot;f&quot;: &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) to the composition &quot;gf&quot;: &quot;a&quot; → &quot;c&quot;, a member of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;c&quot;). (Item 6 under Further examples expresses the same &quot;U&quot; in less elementary language via presheaves.) The Counter-examples section exhibits two large categories that are not concretizable.

== Remarks ==
Contrary to intuition, concreteness is not a property that a category may or may not satisfy, but rather a structure with which a category may or may not be equipped. In particular, a category &quot;C&quot; may admit several faithful functors into Set. Hence there may be several concrete categories (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) all corresponding to the same category &quot;C&quot;.

In practice, however, the choice of faithful functor is often clear and in this case we simply speak of the &quot;concrete category &quot;C&quot;&quot;. For example, &quot;the concrete category Set&quot; means the pair (Set, &quot;I&quot;) where &quot;I&quot; denotes the identity functor Set → Set.

The requirement that &quot;U&quot; be faithful means that it maps different morphisms between the same objects to different functions. However, &quot;U&quot; may map different objects to the same set and, if this occurs, it will also map different morphisms to the same function.

For example, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are two different topologies on the same set &quot;X&quot;, then 
(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) and (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) are distinct objects in the category Top of topological spaces and continuous maps, but mapped to the same set &quot;X&quot; by the forgetful functor Top → Set. Moreover, the identity morphism (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) and the identity morphism (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) are considered distinct morphisms in Top, but they have the same underlying function, namely the identity function on &quot;X&quot;.

Similarly, any set with four elements can be given two non-isomorphic group structures: one isomorphic to formula_1, and the other isomorphic to formula_2.

== Further examples ==

# Any group &quot;G&quot; may be regarded as an &quot;abstract&quot; category with one arbitrary object, formula_3, and one morphism for each element of the group. This would not be counted as concrete according to the intuitive notion described at the top of this article. But every faithful &quot;G&quot;-set (equivalently, every representation of &quot;G&quot; as a group of permutations) determines a faithful functor &quot;G&quot; → Set. Since every group acts faithfully on itself, &quot;G&quot; can be made into a concrete category in at least one way.
# Similarly, any poset &quot;P&quot; may be regarded as an abstract category with a unique arrow &quot;x&quot; → &quot;y&quot; whenever &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. This can be made concrete by defining a functor &quot;D&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → Set which maps each object &quot;x&quot; to formula_4 and each arrow &quot;x&quot; → &quot;y&quot; to the inclusion map formula_5.
# The category Rel whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are relations can be made concrete by taking &quot;U&quot; to map each set &quot;X&quot; to its power set formula_6 and each relation formula_7 to the function formula_8 defined by formula_9. Noting that power sets are complete lattices under inclusion, those functions between them arising from some relation &quot;R&quot; in this way are exactly the supremum-preserving maps. Hence Rel is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category Sup of complete lattices and their sup-preserving maps. Conversely, starting from this equivalence we can recover &quot;U&quot; as the composite Rel → Sup → Set of the forgetful functor for Sup with this embedding of Rel in Sup.
# The category Setop can be embedded into Rel by representing each set as itself and each function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; as the relation from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;X&quot; formed as the set of pairs (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;; hence Setop is concretizable. The forgetful functor which arises in this way is the contravariant powerset functor Setop → Set.
# It follows from the previous example that the opposite of any concretizable category &quot;C&quot; is again concretizable, since if &quot;U&quot; is a faithful functor &quot;C&quot; → Set then &quot;C&quot;op may be equipped with the composite &quot;C&quot;op → Setop → Set.
# If &quot;C&quot; is any small category, then there exists a faithful functor &quot;P&quot; : Set&quot;C&quot;op → Set which maps a presheaf &quot;X&quot; to the coproduct formula_10. By composing this with the Yoneda embedding &quot;Y&quot;:&quot;C&quot; → Set&quot;C&quot;op one obtains a faithful functor &quot;C&quot; → Set.
# For technical reasons, the category Ban1 of Banach spaces and linear contractions is often equipped not with the &quot;obvious&quot; forgetful functor but the functor &quot;U&quot;1 : Ban1 → Set which maps a Banach space to its (closed) unit ball.
#The category Cat whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors can be made concrete by sending each category C to the set containing its objects and morphisms. Functors can be simply viewed as functions acting on the objects and morphisms.

== Counter-examples ==

The category hTop, where the objects are topological spaces and the morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous functions, is an example of a category that is not concretizable. 
While the objects are sets (with additional structure), the morphisms are not actual functions between them, but rather classes of functions. 
The fact that there does not exist &quot;any&quot; faithful functor from hTop to Set was first proven by Peter Freyd.
In the same article, Freyd cites an earlier result that the category of &quot;small categories and natural equivalence-classes of functors&quot; also fails to be concretizable.

== Implicit structure of concrete categories ==

Given a concrete category (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) and a cardinal number &quot;N&quot;, let &quot;UN&quot; be the functor &quot;C&quot; → Set determined by &quot;UN(c) = (U(c))N&quot;.
Then a subfunctor of &quot;UN&quot; is called an &quot;N-ary predicate&quot; and a 
natural transformation &quot;UN&quot; → &quot;U&quot; an &quot;N-ary operation&quot;.

The class of all &quot;N&quot;-ary predicates and &quot;N&quot;-ary operations of a concrete category (&quot;C&quot;,&quot;U&quot;), with &quot;N&quot; ranging over the class of all cardinal numbers, forms a large signature. The category of models for this signature then contains a full subcategory which is equivalent to &quot;C&quot;.

== Relative concreteness ==

In some parts of category theory, most notably topos theory, it is common to replace the category Set with a different category &quot;X&quot;, often called a &quot;base category&quot;. 
For this reason, it makes sense to call a pair (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) where &quot;C&quot; is a category and &quot;U&quot; a faithful functor &quot;C&quot; → &quot;X&quot; a concrete category over &quot;X&quot;.
For example, it may be useful to think of the models of a theory with &quot;N&quot; sorts as forming a concrete category over Set&quot;N&quot;.

In this context, a concrete category over Set is sometimes called a &quot;construct&quot;.

<text>Parthenia was a Roman–Berber town in the former Roman province of Mauretania Sitifensis, the easternmost part of ancient Mauretania. It was located in what is now northern Algeria.

== History ==

Parthenia is one of the Maghreb cities of the Roman period whose toponym recalls the cognomen of a prominent family; usually of the patrician class, in this case the family of the Parthenii.

The &quot;Notitia Provinciarum et Civitatum Africae&quot;, part of Victor Vitensis&#x27;s &quot;Historia persecutionis Africanae Provinciae, temporibus Geiserici et Hunirici regum Wandalorum&quot;, mentions Parthenia among the bishoprics of Mauretania Sitifensis. It says that the bishop Rogatus was one of those exiled by the Vandal king Huneric when he took action against the Catholic bishops in his dominions. Morcelli remarks that he could find no other mention of Parthenia in the works of the ancient geographers or other writers.

A writer on the website &quot;Partenia&quot; places the site of the ancient town and bishopric that it calls Partenia in modern Sétif Province, directly south of the city of Sétif, but says the town&#x27;s exact location is unknown, since it has disappeared beneath the sand. No other map of Roman North Africa attempts to indicate where it stood. The detailed map of ancient Africa and Mauretania made available on the Internet by the &quot;Associazione Storico-Culturale S. Agostino&quot; shows no town of similar name. The name that comes closest (in that it includes four of the nine letters of the word &quot;Parthenia&quot; but obviously has no relation to the Parthenii family) is &quot;Ad Partum&quot; in an 1842 map of ancient Africa, Numidia, and part of Mauretania by the father and son Lapie. Ad Partum lay to the east of ancient Setifis, southeast of Cuiculum and southwest of Cirta.

== Bishopric ==
Parthenia is also a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. It was titular see of former bishop of Évreux, Jacques Gaillot after being removed from the office due to his controversial views.

In February 484, Rogatus, Bishop of Parthenia, was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal Huneric summoned to a meeting at Carthage and then exiled.

No longer a residential bishopric, Parthenia is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

===Past bishops===
* Victor fl
* Ragatus fl. 484
* Giovanni Fallani (1964–1985)
* José Luis Lacunza Maestrojuán (1985–1994)
* Jacques Gaillot (1995–2023)

== Virtual see of Partenia ==

The titular see of Parthenia was assigned to Bishop Jacques Gaillot when he was transferred on 13 January 1995 from the residential diocese of Évreux in France. Gaillot had been noted for his public expression of support for controversial church critic Eugen Drewermann, married priests and the use of condoms and for taking a lenient view with regard to homosexual activity and procurement of abortion.

The other French bishops complained to him for breaching the confidentiality of the meetings of the episcopal conference and for voicing positions contrary to the Church&#x27;s magisterium. The president of the conference appealed to him, &quot;if not to retract, then at least to cease making declarations opposed to the teachings and doctrine of the Catholic Church&quot;.

On his removal from the see of Évreux, Gaillot established an Internet site, called &quot;Partenia&quot;, the Italian version of the name of his titular see, in which to express his ideas, but ceased to write on it in 2010.

<doc id="167005" wikidata="Q1498881" url="?curid=167005" title="Norrmalmstorg robbery">
<text>The Norrmalmstorg robbery was a bank robbery and hostage crisis that occurred at the Norrmalmstorg Square in Stockholm, Sweden, in August 1973 and was the first crime in Sweden to be covered by live television. It is best known as the origin of the term &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;.

Jan-Erik Olsson was a convicted criminal who had disappeared while on furlough from prison and then held up the Kreditbanken bank, taking four hostages in the process. During the negotiations that followed, Swedish Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer allowed Olsson&#x27;s former cellmate and friend Clark Olofsson to be brought from prison to the bank. Although Olofsson was a long-time career criminal, it was deemed unlikely that he was in league with Olsson. In the popular account, the hostages then bonded with their captors and refused to cooperate with police. However, it has also been argued that the hostages were simply distrustful of the police given the latter&#x27;s willingness to risk the hostages&#x27; safety. Police finally mounted a tear-gas attack five days into the crisis, and the robbers surrendered.

Olsson was sentenced to 10 years for the robbery, and Olofsson was ultimately acquitted. The counter-intuitive actions of the hostages led to a great deal of academic and public interest in the case, including a 2003 Swedish television film titled &quot;Norrmalmstorg&quot;, a 2018 Canadian film titled &quot;Stockholm&quot; and a 2022 Swedish Netflix television series &quot;Clark&quot;.

== Events ==
Jan-Erik Olsson was on leave from prison on August 23, 1973, when he went into Kreditbanken on Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm and attempted to rob it. Swedish police were notified shortly after and arrived on the scene. One officer, Ingemar Warpefeldt, suffered injuries to his hand after Olsson opened fire, while another was ordered to sit in a chair and sing a song. Olsson then took four bank employees hostage: Birgitta Lundblad, Elisabeth Oldgren, Kristin Enmark, and Sven Säfström. He demanded his friend Clark Olofsson be brought there, along with three million Swedish kronor, two guns, bulletproof vests, helmets and a Ford Mustang.

Olsson was initially misidentified as Kaj Hansson, another escaped prisoner, and someone who specialized in bank robberies. Olsson was a repeat offender who had committed several armed robberies and acts of violence, the first when he was 16.

The government gave permission for Olofsson to be brought as a communication link with the police negotiators. The hostage Kristin Enmark said that she felt safe with Olsson and Olofsson but feared that the police might escalate the situation by using violent methods. Olsson and Olofsson barricaded the inner main vault in which they kept the hostages. Negotiators agreed that they could have a car to escape but would not allow them to take hostages with them if they tried to leave.

Olsson called Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and said that he would kill the hostages and backed up his threat by grabbing one of them in a stranglehold. She was heard screaming as he hung up. The next day, the hostage Kristin Enmark called Palme and said that she was very displeased with his attitude and asked him to let the robbers and the hostages leave.

Olofsson walked around the vault and sang Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;. On August 26, the police drilled a hole into the main vault from the apartment above and took a widely circulated photograph of the hostages with Olofsson. Olsson fired his weapon into the hole on two occasions and wounded a police officer in the hand and face.

Olsson had fired his weapon and threatened to kill the hostages if any gas attack was attempted. Nonetheless, on August 28 police used tear gas, and Olsson and Olofsson surrendered after an hour. None of the hostages sustained permanent injuries.

==Aftermath==
Both Olsson and Olofsson were convicted, and Olofsson was sentenced to an extended prison term for the robbery. He claimed, however, that he had not helped Olsson but had only tried to save the hostages by keeping the situation calm. He was later acquitted in the Svea Court of Appeal and served only the remainder of his prior sentence. He went on to meet the hostage Kristin Enmark several times, and their families became friends. He also committed several more crimes.

Olsson was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He received many admiring letters from women who found him attractive. He later got engaged to a woman who was not, despite what some state, one of the former hostages. After his release, he is alleged to have committed further crimes. After having been on the run from Swedish authorities for ten years for alleged financial crimes, he turned himself in to police in 2006, only to be told that the charges were no longer being actively pursued.

The hostages sympathised with their captors, which has led to academic interest in the matter. The Swedish term (lit. &quot;the Norrmalmstorg syndrome&quot;), later known as Stockholm syndrome, was coined by the criminologist Nils Bejerot. The hostages, although they were threatened by Olsson, never became violent toward the police or toward each other.

In 1996, Jan-Erik Olsson moved to northeastern Thailand with his wife and son, and moved back to Sweden in 2013. Olsson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Stockholms-syndromet&quot; was published in Sweden in 2009.

==In popular culture==
The 2003 television film &quot;&quot;, directed by Håkan Lindhé, is loosely based on the events. A fictionalized version of the robbery is told in &quot;Stockholm&quot;, a 2018 Canadian film directed by Robert Budreau.

The podcast &quot;Criminal&quot; spoke with Olofsson about the Norrmalmstorg robbery in the episode &quot;Hostage&quot;.

In 2022, Netflix produced a six-episode series named &quot;Clark&quot;, directed by Jonas Åkerlund and starring Bill Skarsgård as Clark Olofsson.

In 1979 Collins was sent by Televisa as their first correspondent in California where she began as a general assignment journalist also covering baseball in the Major Leagues with the San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers, job she did until 1986. Later that year, Collins was transferred to Spanish International Network (SIN) the network later named Univision. In eighteen years in Univision Network, Collins was well known for her job as a Mexico Correspondent, Texas Correspondent, and International Correspondent.

After Univision, Collins went to Telemundo where she hosted the morning show &quot;&quot;Cada Dia&quot;.&quot;

In 1993, she was appointed as the successor of María Celeste Arrarás as the weekend anchor of Noticiero Univision, covering Jorge Ramos and María Elena Salinas while they were out.

In 1999, Collins convinced her friend Juanita Castro, the younger sister of Fidel and Raúl Castro, to co-write and publish Juanita&#x27;s autobiography in Spanish edition: &quot;My brothers Fidel and Raúl, the secret story&quot;. The book was finally published in October 2009.

In 2000, was named Senior Correspondent for the news magazine &quot;Aqui y Ahora&quot; position that with Noticiero Univision fin de semana hold it until she left the network in August 2005.

Her 2003 book, &quot;Cuando el monstruo despierta&quot;, spoke about domestic violence. Writing this book was an emotional experience for Collins, as she revealed that her own daughter, Antonietta Collins, had been a victim of domestic violence by a former boyfriend.

In an article in People en Español (March 2008), Collins announced that she would be leaving Telemundo when her contract expired in August 2008 and that she wished to return to anchoring news.

She also writes a weekly editorial column for &quot;El Sol de Mexico&quot; network and its sixty newspapers in Mexico.

<text>In epidemiology, incidence reflects the number of new cases of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time. 

==Incidence proportion==
Incidence proportion (IP), also known as cumulative incidence, is defined as the probability that a particular event, such as occurrence of a particular disease, has occurred in a specified period:

formula_1

For example, if a population contains 1,000 persons and 28 develop a condition from the time the disease first occurred until two years later, the cumulative incidence is 28 cases per 1,000 persons, i.e. 2.8%.

==Incidence rate==
The incidence rate can be calculated by dividing the number of subjects developing a disease by the total time at risk from all patients:

formula_2

One of the important advantages of incidence rate is that it doesn&#x27;t require all subjects to be present for the whole study because it&#x27;s only interested in the time at risk. 

==Incidence vs. prevalence==
Incidence should not be confused with prevalence, which is the proportion of cases in the population at a given time rather than rate of occurrence of new cases. Thus, incidence conveys information about the risk of contracting the disease, whereas prevalence indicates how widespread the disease is. Prevalence is the proportion of the total number of cases to the total population and is more a measure of the burden of the disease on society with no regard to time at risk or when subjects may have been exposed to a possible risk factor. Prevalence can also be measured with respect to a specific subgroup of a population. Incidence is usually more useful than prevalence in understanding the disease etiology: for example, if the incidence rate of a disease in a population increases, then there is a risk factor that promotes the incidence.

For example, consider a disease that takes a long time to cure and was widespread in 2002 but dissipated in 2003. This disease will have both high incidence and high prevalence in 2002, but in 2003 it will have a low incidence yet will continue to have a high prevalence (because it takes a long time to cure, so the fraction of individuals that are affected remains high). In contrast, a disease that has a short duration may have a low prevalence and a high incidence. When the incidence is approximately constant for the duration of the disease, prevalence is approximately the product of disease incidence and average disease duration, so &quot;prevalence = incidence × duration&quot;. The importance of this equation is in the relation between prevalence and incidence; for example, when the incidence increases, then the prevalence must also increase. Note that this relation does not hold for age-specific prevalence and incidence, where the relation becomes more complicated.

===Example===
Consider the following example. Say you are looking at a sample population of 225 people, and want to determine the incidence rate of developing HIV over a 10-year period:
* At the beginning of the study (t=0) you find 25 cases of existing HIV. These people are not counted as they cannot develop HIV a second time.
* A follow-up at 5 years (t=5 years) finds 20 new cases of HIV.
* A second follow-up at the end of the study (t=10 years) finds 30 new cases.
If you were to measure prevalence you would simply take the total number of cases (25 + 20 + 30 = 75) and divide by your sample population (225). So prevalence would be 75/225 = 0.33 or 33% (by the end of the study). This tells you how widespread HIV is in your sample population, but little about the actual risk of developing HIV for any person over a coming year.

To measure incidence rate you must take into account how many years each person contributed to the study, and when they developed HIV because when a subject develops HIV he stops being at risk. When it is not known exactly when a person develops the disease in question, epidemiologists frequently use the actuarial method, and assume it was developed at a half-way point between follow-ups. In this calculation:
* At 5 yrs you found 20 new cases, so you assume they developed HIV at 2.5 years, thus contributing (20 * 2.5) = 50 person-years of disease-free life.
* At 10 years you found 30 new cases. These people did not have HIV at 5 years, but did at 10, so you assume they were infected at 7.5 years, thus contributing (30 * 7.5) = 225 person-years of disease-free life. That is a total of (225 + 50) = 275 person years so far.
* You also want to account for the 150 people who never had or developed HIV over the 10-year period, (150 * 10) contributing 1500 person-years of disease-free life.

That is a total of (1500 + 275) = 1775 person-years of life. Now take the 50 new cases of HIV, and divide by 1775 to get 0.028, or 28 cases of HIV per 1000 population, per year. In other words, if you were to follow 1000 people for one year, you would see 28 new cases of HIV. This is a much more accurate measure of risk than prevalence.

<text>This is an incomplete list of [[festival]]s in the [[United States]] with articles on Wikipedia, as well as lists of other festival lists, by geographic location. This list includes festivals of diverse types, among them regional festivals, commerce festivals, fairs, food festivals, arts festivals, religious festivals, folk festivals, and recurring festivals on holidays.

Festivals unique to the United States (and Canada and Mexico in some cases) include pow wows, Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, blues festivals, county fairs, state fairs, ribfests, and strawberry festivals. The first U.S. state fair was that of New York, held in 1841 in Syracuse, and has been held annually to the present year. The second state fair was in Detroit, Michigan, which started in 1849.

<text>Islamic art is a part of Islamic culture and encompasses the visual arts produced since the 7th century CE by people who lived within territories inhabited or ruled by Muslim populations. Referring to characteristic traditions across a wide range of lands, periods, and genres, Islamic art is a concept used first by Western art historians in the late 19th century. Public Islamic art is traditionally non-representational, except for the widespread use of plant forms, usually in varieties of the spiralling arabesque. These are often combined with Islamic calligraphy, geometric patterns in styles that are typically found in a wide variety of media, from small objects in ceramic or metalwork to large decorative schemes in tiling on the outside and inside of large buildings, including mosques. Other forms of Islamic art include Islamic miniature painting, artefacts like Islamic glass or pottery, and textile arts, such as carpets and embroidery.

The early developments of Islamic art were influenced by Roman art, Early Christian art (particularly Byzantine art), and Sassanian art, with later influences from Central Asian nomadic traditions. Chinese art had a significant influence on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles. From its beginnings, Islamic art has been based on the written version of the Quran and other seminal religious works, which is reflected by the important role of calligraphy, representing the word as the medium of divine revelation.

Religious Islamic art has been typically characterized by the absence of figures and extensive use of calligraphic, geometric and abstract floral patterns. Nevertheless, representations of human and animal forms historically flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures, although, partly because of opposing religious sentiments, living beings in paintings were often stylized, giving rise to a variety of decorative figural designs.

Both religious and secular art objects often exhibit the same references, styles and forms. These include calligraphy, architecture, textiles and furnishings, such as carpets and woodwork. Secular arts and crafts include the production of textiles, such as clothing, carpets or tents, as well as household objects, made from metal, wood or other materials. Further, figurative miniature paintings have a rich tradition, especially in Persian, Mughal and Ottoman painting. These pictures were often meant to illustrate well-known historical or poetic stories. Some interpretations of Islam, however, include a ban of depiction of animate beings, also known as aniconism. Islamic aniconism stems in part from the prohibition of idolatry and in part from the belief that creation of living forms is God&#x27;s prerogative.

== Terminology ==
Although the concept of &quot;Islamic art&quot; has been put into question by some modern art historians as a construct of Western cultural views, the similarities between art produced at widely different times and places in the Muslim world, especially in the Islamic Golden Age, have been sufficient to keep the term in wide use as a useful classification since the late 19th century. Scholars such as Jacelyn K. Kerner have drawn attention to its wide-ranging scope referring to more than 40 nations and to the growing public interest both in Western as well as, more recently, in Muslim societies. Further, the List of Islamic museums bears witness to this art historical term having found wide acceptance.

The Encyclopædia Britannica defines &quot;Islamic arts&quot; as including visual arts, literature, performing arts and music that &quot;virtually defies any comprehensive definition&quot;. In a strict sense, the term might only refer to artistic manifestations that are closely related to religious practice. Most often, however, it is meant to include &quot;all of the arts produced by Muslim peoples, whether connected with their religion or not.&quot;

== Calligraphy ==

Calligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in Europe in the Middle Ages, religious exhortations, including Qur&#x27;anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of Chinese calligraphy of Arabic verses from the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; in the Great Mosque of Xi&#x27;an. Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic &quot;kufic&quot; and &quot;naskh&quot; scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of minbars, and metalwork. Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures is sometimes referred to as &quot;Quranic art&quot;.

The various forms of traditional Arabic calligraphy and decoration of the manuscripts used for written versions of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; represent a central tradition of Islamic visual art. The arabesque is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God. Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory has also been disputed.

East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries, decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions and called &quot;epigraphic ware&quot;, has been described as &quot;probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery&quot;. Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in relief, or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings. Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production. The tughra or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones. Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur&#x27;anic verses, or other texts.

The main languages, all using Arabic script, are Arabic, always used for Qur&#x27;anic verses, Persian in the Persianate world, especially for poetry, and Turkish, with Urdu appearing in later centuries. Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.

== Painting ==

For a long time, Islam was considered aniconic. Existing pictures among the Muslim royalty have been described as an &quot;aberration&quot; by Thomas Walker Arnold and ascribed to only a later Persinate and Turkic cultural period. However, figurative arts existed since the formative stage of Islam. Such arts have been boasted by Arabic speaking caliphats of Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordova, inspired by Sasanid and Byzantine models. Figurative arts enjoyed prestige among both orthodox Sunni circles as well as Shia Muslims. The disappearance of royal-sponsored figurative arts in Arabic-speaking lands at a later period is best explained by the overthrow of their ruling dynasties and reduction of most their territories to Ottoman provincial dependencies, not by religious prohibition. Another drawback for Arnold&#x27;s argument against the religious value of figurative arts in Islamic culture is, that a sizable number of rulers ordering figurative arts in the 14th-17th century, were religious zealots proclaiming to spread and enforce the laws of the sharia.
Although not many early examples survived, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands, notably several of the Umayyad Desert Castles (c. 660–750), and during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749–1258). Prior to the early 14th century, a halo was a common symbol to designate rulers. Under Asian influence, the halo as a symbol of sacredness was replaced by a flame. Reminiscent of the Islamic prophet Solomon, rulers were often depicted as sitting on a throne endowed with religious symbols. An ivory casket carved in early eleventh century Cordova shows a Spanish Muslim ruler holding a cup seated upon a lion throne, similar to that of Solomon. A late 12th–13th century bowl depicts an enthroned Seljuk ruler with messengers to either side and headed winged jinn. Other usage of early figurative arts are illustrations of animal fables. Many of them are of Sanskrit origin and translated into Middle Persian in the sixth century for delight, ethical discussion, and political edification. In the 8th century, they were translated into Arabic.

Although there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the Persianate world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the miniature in illuminated manuscripts, or later as a single page for inclusion in a &quot;muraqqa&quot; or bound album of miniatures and calligraphy. The tradition of the Persian miniature has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the Ottoman miniature of Turkey and the Mughal miniature in India. The term &quot;Persian miniature&quot; refers whereby to the language used to decorate the images, and should not obscure its ties to Arabic imagery.

Siyah Qalam (Black Pen), frequently depicts anecdotes charged with Islamic imagery about the animal souls (&quot;nafs&quot;) and the &quot;ruling soul&quot; (&quot;rūḥ&quot;). Most human characters are clothed like dervishes and bearded like ascetics in Islamic tradition. Animals often feature as symbol of the lower and untaimed self. The abstract forces to tame the physical body are depicted in the forms of demons (&quot;dīv&quot;) and angels.

Chinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky. The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size. The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear. The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.

Since the mid-20th century following the departure of the Dutch colonialists, several Indonesian painters combined Abstract Expressionism with geometric forms, Indonesian symbols and Islamic calligraphy, creating religiously influenced Abstract Art. The spiritual centre of this movement is the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), with leading teachers such as A.D. Pirous, Ahmad Sadali, Mochtar Apin and Umi Dachlan as their main representatives.

In the 21st century, iconophobic followers of various Islamist groups, such as the Taliban, aim to destroy forms of Islamic figurative depictions. Motivated by Saudi mentors (Wahhabism), the Taliban launched an attack on arts in March 2001 in Afghanistan. The religious justification derives from a hadith mentioned by Sahih Bukhari. Others see the rejection of iconography as rooting in a strict aversion to depiction of God throughout Islamic tradition.

== Rugs and carpets ==


No Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the &quot;Oriental carpet&quot; (oriental rug). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a prayer rug, which would provide a clean place to pray). They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the Netherlands. Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments. In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.
Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and oriental carpets in Renaissance painting from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately. The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way. Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.

There are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the Pitti Palace in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer. Production of this style of carpet began under the Mamluks but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt. The other sophisticated tradition was the Persian carpet which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the Ardabil Carpet and Coronation Carpet; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition. These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central &quot;gul&quot; motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders. The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today. The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre. Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.

As well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans. Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include coats of arms, enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the Papal Palace, Avignon, and the industry continued after the Reconquista. Armenian carpet-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought. The Berber carpets of North Africa have a distinct design tradition. Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs. As well as pile carpets, kelims and other types of flat-weave or embroidered textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls. Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.

== Ceramics ==

Islamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in pottery and tiles for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures. Early pottery is often unglazed, but tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stonepaste ceramics, originating from 9th century Iraq. The first industrial complex for glass and pottery production was built in Raqqa, Syria, in the 8th century. Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550). Lusterwares with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.

Islamic pottery was often influenced by Chinese ceramics, whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated. This was especially the case in the periods after the Mongol invasions and those of the Timurids. Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected. Until the Early Modern period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied. An example of this is the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries&#x27; ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Hispano-Moresque examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.

The Hispano-Moresque style emerged in Al-Andalus - Muslim Spain - in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: glazing with an opaque white tin-glaze, and painting in metallic lusters. Ottoman İznik pottery produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics. These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.

The medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in Persia and Egypt.

===Tiling===

The earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, had interior walls decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine style, but without human figures. From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured tiling for interior and exterior walls and domes developed. Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns. Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme – a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.

Some elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional relief, and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures. These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours, but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals. The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs. The geometric patterns, such as modern North African zellij work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as &quot;mosaic&quot;, which is not strictly correct.

The Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) &quot;parchin kari&quot;, a type of pietra dura decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases. This can be seen at the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and other imperial commissions. The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.

== Glass ==

For most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in Eurasia, exported to both Europe and China. Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of Sassanian and Ancient Roman glass, and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in Egypt. For this reason, it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties. From various documentary references glassmaking and glass trading seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.

Between the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass was on effects achieved by &quot;manipulating the surface&quot; of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief. The very massive Hedwig glasses, only found in Europe but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in Norman Sicily), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date. These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved rock crystal (clear quartz), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels. and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and hardstone carving were regarded as the same craft. From the 12th century the industry in Persia and Mesopotamia appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass. Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as Hebron glass in Palestine.

Lustre painting, by techniques similar to lustreware in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt and became widespread in the 12th century. Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects. Gilded, painted, and enameled glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork. Some of the finest work was in mosaic lamps donated by a ruler or wealthy man. As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it &quot;often has a brownish-yellow tinge and is rarely free from bubbles.&quot;. Aleppo seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the Mongol invasion of 1260, and Timur appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to Samarkand. By about 1500 the Venetians were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.

== Metalwork ==
Medieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in enamel, some pieces entirely in precious metals. In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in brass, bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black niello. The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down. The abundant local sources of zinc, compared to tin, explains the rarity of bronze. Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass, soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.

The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, as was the wearing of gold rings. Islamic metalworkers shared with their European counterparts a relatively high social status, compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.

Islamic metalwork includes some three-dimensional animal figures, such as fountainheads or aquamaniles, but only one significant enamelled object of Byzantine cloisonné technique is known. The Pisa Griffin is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andalus. More common objects with elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath), and ewers, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, and so are often lavishly treated display pieces. A typical 13th century ewer from Khorasan is decorated with foliage, animals and the Signs of the Zodiac in silver and copper, and carries a blessing. Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of high interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as astrolabes, as well as jewellery. Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.

== Other applied arts ==

High levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including hardstone carvings and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone. Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur&#x27;an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters. Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and lacquer over paint.

=== Precious stones ===
Egyptian carving of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040 C.E. There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the Cairo palace of the Fatimid Caliph was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries. From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels. Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.

=== House and furniture ===
Older wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes. An important exception are the complex muqarnas and mocárabe designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a stalactite-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood, but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the Alhambra in Granada, Spain are among the best known. Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with marquetry inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop. The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used. There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods. A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman Cappella Palatina in Palermo, which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art. Other famous wooden roofs are in the Alhambra in Granada.

=== Ivory ===
Ivory carving centred on the Mediterranean, spreading from Egypt, where a thriving Coptic industry had been inherited; Persian ivory is rare. The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted. Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes. They were produced mainly in the approximate period of 930–1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, Cordoba had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality. In the 12th and 13th century workshops in Norman Sicily produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution. Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture – most are now detached from their settings. Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.
=== Silk ===
Despite &quot;Hadith&quot; sayings prohibiting the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Muslim rule. Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle. These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions. The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe reliquaries, where the relics were often wrapped in silk. European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of Toul in France was wrapped in a silk from the Bukhara area in modern Uzbekistan, probably when the body was reburied in 820. The Shroud of St Josse is a famous samite cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of camels and an inscription in Kufic script, from which the date appears to be before 961. Other silks were used for clothes, hangings, altarcloths, and church vestments, which have nearly all been lost, except for some vestments.
Ottoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal kaftans have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized &quot;tiger-stripes&quot; below three balls or circles. Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence. By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97 cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of Suleiman the Magnificent in his invasion of Persia in 1543–45, before being taken by a Polish general at the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic &quot;portraits&quot; of plants, as found in other media.

===Indonesian batik===
The development and refinement of Indonesian &quot;batik&quot; cloth was closely linked to Islam. The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged &quot;batik&quot; design to become more abstract and intricate. Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional &quot;batik&quot;. However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the Garuda of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.

Although its existence pre-dates Islam, &quot;batik&quot; reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as Mataram and Yogyakarta, whose sultans encouraged and patronised &quot;batik&quot; production. Today, &quot;batik&quot; is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.

== Architecture ==
Unlike some mediums in Islamic art, Islamic architecture was consistently prominent across the Islamic world. In general, patrons invested more resources into building monuments than they did in the production of art objects and our knowledge of Islamic architecture is more complete thanks to the many buildings that have survived across regions and periods. Early Islamic architecture drew on existing regional traditions of architecture in late antiquity and later developed into various regional traditions. Innovations from one region often spread to others.

Applied decoration played a particularly important role in Islamic architecture, and this decoration made use of the same motifs predominant in other forms of Islamic art: arabesques, epigraphy, geometric patterns, and other vegetal forms. Methods of decoration included carving, inlay, and painting in materials such as brick, stone, tile, plaster, and wood.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
==== Pre-dynastic ====
The period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day Syria. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or Sasanian and Byzantine art, and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial spread of Islam. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the Louvre, whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.

Influences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. Bedouin tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories. For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.

==== Umayyad ====
Religious and civic architecture were developed under the Umayyad Caliphates (661–750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.

The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence (mosaic against a gold ground, and a central plan that recalls that of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic frieze. The desert palaces in Jordan and Syria (for example, Mshatta, Qusayr &#x27;Amra, and Hisham&#x27;s Palace) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.

Work in ceramics was still somewhat primitive and unglazed during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.

&#x27;Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock&#x27;s construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.

In this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian late antiquity, which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus are based on Byzantine models but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated Qurans.

Some Umayyads commissioned erotic art for private settings. The Umayyad caliph Al-Walid II built the Qusayr Amra, as his country retreat, whose decoration includes naked females and love scenes.

==== Abbasid ====

The Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258) witnessed the movement of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad, and then from Baghdad to Samarra. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. Art historian Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an &quot;Islamic Rome&quot;, because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the &quot;navel of the world&quot;, as 9th-century historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi wrote.

The ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, Abbasid Samarra, which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of stucco reliefs, in which the prehistory of the arabesque can be traced. Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.

Samarra witnessed the &quot;coming of age&quot; of Islamic art. Polychrome painted stucco allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of faience, and of metallic lusterware. Hadithic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic lusterware in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine Chinese porcelain led to the development of this technique.
Though the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as &quot;tiraz&quot; produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the Silk Road.

Islamic calligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated qur&#x27;ans gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.

===Medieval period (9th–15th centuries)===
Beginning in the ninth century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of an Ismaʻili Shiʻi dynasty, that of the North African Fatimid Caliphate, followed by the Caliphate of Córdoba in the Iberian Peninsula, gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran.

====Spain and the Maghreb====

The first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Iberia, known in Arabic as al-Andalus, was the Umayyads, descended from the great Umayyad Caliphate of Syria. After their fall, they were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the taifas (1031–91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the Almoravids and the Almohads, captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of Granada, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.

Al-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of Averroes), the territory was an equally vital center for art.

Many techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The pyxis of al-Mughira is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints&#x27; reliquaries. From the periods of Maghrebi rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.

The art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.

====Arab Mashriq====
The Fatimid Caliphate, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171, introduced crafts and knowledge from politically troubled Baghdad to their capital of Cairo.

By 1070, the Seljuq Empire emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at Manzikert. During the rule of Malik-Shah I, the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the atabegs (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish crusaders. In 1171, Saladin seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory Ayyubid dynasty on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enamelled glass became another important craft.

In 1250, Mamluks seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids as the Mamluk Sultanate, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was Baibars. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects; many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period. Patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enamelled glass and metalwork and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt. The Baptistère de Saint Louis in the Louvre is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.

====Iran and Central Asia====
Iran and the north of India, the Tahirids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as Nishapur and Ghazni, and the construction of the Great Mosque of Isfahan (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.

The Seljuqs, nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of &quot;Seljuq&quot; works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from Damascus and Baghdad to Merv, Nishapur, Rayy, and Isfahan, all in Iran.

Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth. Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece. For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques. Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals. Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated. In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous. It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a silicon paste (&quot;fritware&quot;), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals. Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen. These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.

During the 13th century, the Mongols under the leadership of Genghis Khan swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the Yuan in China, the Ilkhanids in Iran and the Golden Horde in northern Iran and southern Russia.

=====Ilkhanids=====
A rich civilization developed under these &quot;little khans&quot;, who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north–south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of &quot;iranisation&quot; took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the &quot;Iranian plan&quot; mosques, was resumed. The art of the Persian book was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh&quot; by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.

=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====
The early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the Hermitage.

The beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the Timurids, was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of Timur. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.

====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====

The Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the Byzantine Empire in the Battle of Manzikert (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.

Caravanserais dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day&#x27;s travel. The construction of these caravanserai inns improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.

The Turkmen were nomads who settled in the area of Lake Van. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the Blue Mosque in Tabriz, and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the Ottomans, who, after 1450, are referred to as the &quot;first Ottomans&quot;. Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the &quot;Milet&quot; ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.

Islamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century book frontispieces.

Earlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic epigraphs, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature astrological, figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers&#x27; busts), and animal images.

Hillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called &quot;Maqamat&quot;, copied and illustrated by Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti were some of the earliest &quot;coffee table books&quot;. They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.

====Indian subcontinent====

The Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the Delhi Sultanate. Later other competing sultanates were founded in Bengal, Kashmir, Gujarat, Jaunpur, Malwa, and in the north Deccan (the Bahmanids). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with Hindu art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the Mughals, who progressively seized their territories.

=== The Three Empires ===


==== Ottomans ====
The Ottoman Empire, whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after World War I. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably Iznik ware, important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling Ebru, Turkish carpets as well as tapestries and exceptional Ottoman miniatures and decorative Ottoman illumination.

Masterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two &quot;books of festivals&quot; (Surname-I Hümayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan Murad III. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong Safavid influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.

The Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, &quot;Iznik red&quot;, in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models. From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of Rococo which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration. European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with Osman Hamdi Bey (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent Orientalism from the inside, as it were.

==== Mughals ====
The Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the British Raj, who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later Sikh rulers as well. The Mughal miniature began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by Humayun when in exile in Safavid Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style. Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas. The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western graphical perspective, and a wider range of poses in the human figure. Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from. As the courts of local Nawabs developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional Indian painting developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.

The arts of jewelry and hardstone carving of gemstones, such as jasper, jade, adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler Abu&#x27;l Fazl, and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses&#x27; heads is particularly impressive.

The Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced Damascus steel and refined the locally produced Wootz steel, the Mughals also introduced the &quot;bidri&quot; technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like Ali Kashmiri and Muhammed Salih Thatawi created the celestial globes.

==== Safavids and Qajars ====
The Iranian Safavids, a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi&#x27;a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia. Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in blue and white. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of Shah Abbas in Isfahan, which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as Ali Qapu), an immense bazaar, and a large imperial mosque.

The art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh, an immense copy of Ferdowsi&#x27;s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album (muraqqa). The albums were the creations of connoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of Reza Abbasi figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the grisaille techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.

After the fall of the Safavids, the Qajars, a Turkmen tribe established from centuries on the banks of the Caspian Sea, assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.

=== Modern period ===

From the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court. From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. Many industries with very long histories, such as pottery in Iran, largely closed, while others, like metalwork in brass, became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.

The carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world. Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the zelligj mosaic tiles of the Maghreb, have often survived better. Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art scenes, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as &quot;Islamic art&quot; is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy. Further, much modern architecture and interior decoration in the Islamic world makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.

<text>Christian art is sacred art which uses subjects, themes, and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, including early Christian art and architecture and Christian media.

Images of Jesus and narrative scenes from the Life of Christ are the most common subjects, and scenes from the Old Testament play a part in the art of most denominations. Images of the Virgin Mary and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as Islam and Judaism. However, there are some that have promoted aniconism in Christianity, and there have been periods of iconoclasm within Christianity.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
Early Christian art survives from dates near the origins of Christianity, although many early Christians associated figurative art with pagan religion, and were suspicious or hostile towards it. Over time, this lessened. But large free-standing sculpture, the medium for the most prominent pagan images, continued to be distrusted and largely shunned for some centuries, and virtually up to the present day in the Orthodox world. The oldest Christian sculptures are small reliefs from Roman sarcophagi, dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the Catacombs of Rome, and show the evolution of the depiction of Jesus, a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.

Until the adoption of Christianity by Constantine Christian art derived its style and much of its iconography from popular Roman art, but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which mosaics in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples. Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style from the classical tradition inherited from Ancient Greek art to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of gothic art.

===Middle Ages===
Much of the art surviving from Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire is Christian art, although this is in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works. While the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of Rome, its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day Roman Catholic Church commissioned and funded production of religious art imagery.

While the Byzantine Empire continued to focus on the creation of Christian art, in Denmark and Norway, the Vikings would see a surge of Christianity. Christianity spread to the Vikings through pillaging, missionaries, political pressure, and trading with other peoples of Europe. Rune stones with Christian imagery were used as grave markings, promotion, or a demonstration of faith. King Harold Bluetooth&#x27;s rune stone, also known as The Great Jelling Rune Stone, is credited with marking the shift to Christianity in the Viking Era. Gravestones would also display prominent Christian imagery. The Rathdown Stones are the most well-known of these Viking gravestones: granite stones with tablet or cross-like designs mixed with traditional Viking styling. Driftwood crosses have been found around other churches and graveyards.

Named for their strong foundational pillars, Stave Churches were another popular display of Christian Viking art. These churches displayed engravings of Christian and Nordic beliefs, with animal-like depictions appearing on walls and entrances. The cross is also a prominent image in Christian Viking imagery. Vikings would be marked with a cross as a sign that they had been baptized abroad or during a venture. Viking Nordic myths and symbolism can be seen engraved into stone and wooden crosses. German and English influence can be found in some distinct examples of these crosses, with choices to use Doric capital ends, believed to have spread throughout Scandinavia in the 12th and 13th century.

The Orthodox Church of Constantinople, which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving Eastern Empire was key in producing imagery there and glorifying Christianity. They commissioned many shrines to be built in Constantinople’s honor and also lots of well-decorated churches. These tended to have extravagant stained glass and paintings covering the walls and ceilings. Also, relief sculptures were made which were etched into the sides of buildings and churches. Hagia Sophia, the world&#x27;s largest cathedral during the 15th century, was decorated almost entirely using mosaics as a way to honor God. Following the fall of Constantinople, it was converted into a mosque, but it&#x27;s wonderous art remained. As a stable Western European society emerged during the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission paintings and sculptures.

During the development of Christian art in the Byzantine Empire (see Byzantine art), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in Hellenistic art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of &quot;graven images&quot;, the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of Byzantine Iconoclasm led to a standardization of religious imagery within the Eastern Orthodoxy.

Similar to the Vikings, wood and carvings are also used in Germanic Christian art in depictions of crosses and relations to the Crucifixion utilized in different areas such as churches and cathedrals. The Cologne Cathedral is a notable church located in Cologne, Germany, resting upon ruins of buildings from the Romantic and Frankish periods. Although the structure would begin construction in 1248 under archbishop Conrad von Hostaden, the monument would not be completed until the 1880s.

In the late Medieval period, the East made steps in Christian art. In the Mediterranean area, there was a shift from Islamic to Christian art. With 86 examples of muqarnaṣ displayed around the Mediterranean, with the majority (78) being displayed in Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula. This is explained through the increased political power associated with muqarnas, being placed in important buildings such as chapels. Recently discovered in Syria and Egypt, other examples of medieval Christian art have been explored, such as the Mar Musa Monastery with different examples of medieval Christian art, like wall paintings. Because of the nature of traveling painters and artists, these paintings often had Greek lettering and script

===Renaissance and early modern period===
The fall of Constantinople in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as icons regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.

In the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, although Christian art continued to be commissioned in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy. The Reformation had a huge impact on Christian art; Martin Luther in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a more limited range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the &quot;ancient, apostolic church&quot;. Lutheran altarpieces like the 1565 &quot;Last Supper&quot; by the younger Cranach were produced in Germany, especially by Luther&#x27;s friend Lucas Cranach, to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional depiction of Jesus. As such, &quot;Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.&quot; Lutherans proudly employed the use of the crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross. Thus, for Lutherans, &quot;the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.&quot; On the other hand, Christians from a Reformed background were generally iconoclastic, destroying existing religious imagery and usually only creating more in the form of book illustrations.

Artists were commissioned to produce more secular genres like portraits, landscape paintings and because of the revival of Neoplatonism, subjects from classical mythology. In Catholic countries, production of religious art continued, and increased during the Counter-Reformation, but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before. From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.

===Modern period===
As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal. Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes (Bouguereau, Manet) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as Rouault or Stanley Spencer). However many modern artists such as Eric Gill, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Jacob Epstein, Elisabeth Frink and Graham Sutherland have produced well-known works of art for churches. Salvador Dalí is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes. Contemporary artists such as Makoto Fujimura have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include Larry D. Alexander and John August Swanson. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.

===Popular devotional art===
Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as Mihály Munkácsy. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of holy cards. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as Thomas Blackshear and Thomas Kinkade, although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch, have been very successful.

==Subjects==

Subjects often seen in Christian art include the following. See Life of Christ and Life of the Virgin for fuller lists of narrative scenes included in cycles:

===Motifs===
The Virgin Mary is shown spinning and weaving, appearing in artworks with a loom or knitting needles, weaving cloth over her womb, or knitting for her son. The imagery, much of it German, places the sacred narratives in the domestic realm. She is shown weaving in paintings of The Annunciation, or spinning. Although spinning was less common an example is found in some convents where nuns would spin silk, presumably to create a link between the convent community of women and the image of the Mary.

<doc id="167027" wikidata="Q1649321" url="?curid=167027" title="Stick McGhee">
<text>Granville Henry &quot;Stick&quot; McGhee (March 23, 1918 – August 15, 1961) was an American jump blues guitarist, singer and songwriter, best known for his blues song &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;, which he wrote with J. Mayo Williams.

==Early life==
McGhee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee. He received his nickname when he was a child. He used a stick to push a wagon carrying his older brother Brownie McGhee, who had contracted polio. Granville began playing the guitar when he was thirteen years old. After his freshman year he dropped out of high school and worked with his father at the Eastman Kodak subsidiary, Tennessee Eastman Company in Kingsport. In 1940, Granville quit his job and moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, and then to New York City. He entered the military in 1942 and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. After being discharged in 1946, he settled in New York.

==Entertainment career==
In the military, McGhee often played his guitar. One of the songs he performed was &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;. The original lyrics of the song were as follows:

Drinkin&#x27; that mess is our delight,&lt;br&gt;
And when we get drunk, start fightin&#x27; all night.&lt;br&gt;
Knockin&#x27; out windows and tearin&#x27; down doors,&lt;br&gt;
Drinkin&#x27; half-gallons and callin&#x27; for more.&lt;br&gt;
Drinkin&#x27; wine motherfucker, drinkin&#x27; wine!&lt;br&gt;
Goddam!&lt;br&gt;
Drinkin&#x27; wine motherfucker, drinkin&#x27; wine!&lt;br&gt;
Goddam!&lt;br&gt;
Drinkin&#x27; wine motherfucker, drinkin&#x27; wine!&lt;br&gt;
Goddam!&lt;br&gt;
Pass that bottle to me!&quot;
It was one of the earliest prototypical rock-and-roll songs. Cover versions were recorded by Wynonie Harris, Lionel Hampton, Big John Greer, Johnny Burnette, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Mike Bloomfield&#x27;s Electric Flag (as &quot;Wine&quot;). The song lent its name to the alcoholic fruit drink spodi. In 1946 Granville and Brownie McGhee wrote a version of the song that didn&#x27;t use profanity. Harlem Records released the new version in January 1947. It sold for 49 cents. It did not get much airplay until two years later, when Stick re-created the song for Atlantic Records. It was on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for almost half a year, rising to number 2, where it stayed for four weeks.

Numerous cover versions of his songs were recorded over the years. The first cover was by Lionel Hampton, featuring Sonny Parker; next was a cover by Wynonie Harris, followed by a hillbilly-bop version by Loy Gordon &amp; His Pleasant Valley Boys. &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot; continued to be popular throughout the 1950s in cover versions by various artists, including Malcolm Yelvington in 1954, Johnny Burnette in 1957, and Jerry Lee Lewis in 1959.

McGhee continued to make records for Atlantic and created popular songs such as &quot;Tennessee Waltz Blues&quot;, &quot;Drank Up All the Wine Last Night&quot;, &quot;Venus Blues&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;, and &quot;One Monkey Don&#x27;t Stop No Show&quot;, but his music career overall was not successful. McGhee moved from Atlantic to Essex Records, for which he recorded &quot;My Little Rose&quot;. The record was not commercially successful, so he moved to King Records in 1953. There he recorded a number of rock-and-roll songs, such a &quot;Whiskey, Women and Loaded Dice&quot;, &quot;Head Happy with Wine&quot;, &quot;Jungle Juice&quot;, &quot;Six to Eight&quot;, &quot;Double Crossin&#x27; Liquor&quot;, &quot;Dealin&#x27; from the Bottom&quot;, and &quot;Get Your Mind Out of the Gutter&quot;. However, he was unable to make money from his records, so he left King for Savoy Records in 1955. He retired from the music industry in 1960. In the late &#x27;50s McGhee recorded LP album tracks with Sonny Terry for the Folkways and Prestige-Bluesville labels. In 1960 he cut the songs &quot;Sleep in Job&quot; and &quot;Money Fever&quot; in New York with Sonny Terry. The tracks were released on Herald Records. This was McGhee&#x27;s last recording session. He became ill shortly afterward and died in August 1961.

==Death==
McGhee died of lung cancer in The Bronx, New York, on August 15, 1961, at the age of forty-three. He left his old guitar to Brownie&#x27;s son before he died.

<doc id="167029" wikidata="Q3247240" url="?curid=167029" title="John Mitchel">
<text>John Mitchel (; 3 November 1815 – 20 March 1875) was an Irish nationalist writer and journalist chiefly renowned for his indictment of British policy in Ireland during the years of the Great Famine. Concluding that, in Ireland, legal and constitutional agitation was a &quot;delusion&quot;, Mitchel broke first with Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Repeal Association and then with his Young Ireland colleagues at the paper &quot;The Nation&quot;. In 1848, as editor of his own journal, &quot;United Irishman&quot;, he was convicted of seditious libel and sentenced to 14-years penal transportation for advocating James Fintan Lalor&#x27;s programme of co-ordinated resistance to landlords and to the continued shipment of harvests to England. 

Controversially for a republican tradition that has viewed Mitchel, in the words of Pádraic Pearse, as a &quot;fierce&quot; and &quot;sublime&quot; apostle of Irish republicanism, in American exile into which he escaped in 1853 Mitchel was an uncompromising pro-slavery partisan of the Southern secessionist cause. Embracing the illiberal and racial views of Thomas Carlyle, he was also opposed in Europe to Jewish emancipation. 

In his last year, 1875, and while still resident in the United States, Mitchel was elected twice to the British Parliament from Tipperary on a platform of Irish Home Rule, tenant rights and free education. Exposing, as he saw it, the &quot;fraudulent&quot; nature of Irish representation at Westminster, on both occasions the results were set aside on the grounds of his previous felony.

==Early life==

John Mitchel was born at Camnish near Dungiven in County Londonderry, in the province of Ulster. His father, Rev. John Mitchel, was a Non-subscribing Presbyterian minister of Unitarian sympathies, and his mother was Mary (née Haslett) from Maghera. From 1823 until his death in 1840, John Sr. was minister in Newry, County Down. In Newry, Mitchel attended a school kept by a Dr Henderson whose encouragement and support laid the foundation for classical scholarship that at age 15 gained him entry to Trinity College, Dublin. After taking his degree at age 19 he worked briefly as a bank clerk in Derry, before entering legal practice in the office of a Newry solicitor, a friend of his father.

In early 1836 Mitchel met Jane &quot;Jenny&quot; Verner, the only daughter of Captain James Verner. Despite family opposition, they became engaged later in the year and were married in February 1837.

The couple&#x27;s first child, John, was born in January the following year. Their second, James, (who was to be the father of the New York Mayor John Purroy Mitchel) was born in February 1840. Two further children were born, Henrietta in October 1842, and William in May 1844, in Banbridge, County Down, where as a qualified attorney Mitchel opened a new office for the Newry legal practice.

==Early politics==
One of Mitchel&#x27;s first steps into Irish politics was to face down threats of Orange Order retaliation by helping arrange, in September 1839, a public dinner in Newry for Daniel O&#x27;Connell. O&#x27;Connell was the leader of the campaign to repeal the 1800 Acts of Union and restore an Irish Parliament.

Until his marriage, John Mitchel had by and large taken his politics from his father who, according to Mitchel&#x27;s early biographer William Dillon, had &quot;begun to comprehend the degradation of his countrymen&quot;. Soon after the granting of Catholic emancipation in 1829, the O&#x27;Connellites challenged the Protestant Ascendancy in Newry by running a Catholic parliamentary candidate. Many members of the Rev. Mitchel&#x27;s congregation took an active part in the elections on the side of the Ascendancy, and pressed the Rev. Mitchel to do the same. His refusal to do earned him the nickname &quot;Papist Mitchel.&quot;

In Banbridge, Mitchel was often employed by the Catholics in the legal proceedings arising from provocative, sometimes violent, Orange incursions into their districts. Seeing how cases were handled by magistrates, who were themselves often Orangemen, enraged Mitchel&#x27;s sense of justice and spurred his interest in national politics and reform.

In October 1842, his friend John Martin sent Mitchel the first copy of &quot;The Nation&quot; produced in Dublin by Charles Gavan Duffy, who had previously been editor of the O&#x27;Connellite journal, &quot;The Vindicator&quot;, in Belfast, and by Thomas Osborne Davis, and John Blake Dillon. Martin and Davis were both, like Mitchell himself, Protestants and graduates of Trinity College. &quot;I think &quot;The Nation&quot; will do very well&quot;, he wrote Martin, while adding that he knew how the country &quot;ought to take&quot; news that an additional 20,000 troops were to be deployed to Ireland but would not put it on paper for fear of being arrested.

==&quot;The Nation&quot;==
===Succeeds Thomas Davis===
Mitchel began to write for the &quot;Nation&quot; in February 1843. He co-authored an editorial with Thomas Davis, &quot;the Anti-Irish Catholics&quot;, in which he embraced Davis&#x27;s promotion of the Irish language and of Gaelic tradition as a non-sectarian basis for a common Irish nationality. Mitchel, however, did not share Davis&#x27;s anti-clericalism, declining to support Davis as he sought to reverse O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s opposition to the government&#x27;s secular, or as O&#x27;Connell proposed &quot;Godless&quot;, Colleges Bill.

Mitchel insisted that the government, aware that it would cause dissension, had introduced their bill for non-religious higher education to divide the national movement. But he also argued that religion is integral to education; that &quot;all subjects of human knowledge and speculation (except abstract science)--and history most of all--are necessarily regarded from &quot;either&quot; a Catholic or a Protestant point of view, and cannot be understood or conceived at all if looked at from either, or from both&quot;. For Mitchel a cultural nationalism based on Ireland&#x27;s Gaelic heritage was intended not to displace the two religious traditions but rather serve as common ground between them.

When in September 1845, Davis unexpectedly died of scarlet fever, Duffy asked Mitchel to join the &quot;Nation&quot; as chief editorial writer. He left his legal practice in Newry, and brought his wife and children to live in Dublin, eventually settling in Rathmines. For the next two years Mitchel wrote both political and historical articles and reviews for &quot;The Nation&quot;. He reviewed the &quot;Speeches&quot; of John Philpot Curran, a pamphlet by Isaac Butt on &quot;The Protection of Home Industry&quot;, &quot;The Age of Pitt and Fox&quot;, and later on &quot;The Poets and Dramatists of Ireland&quot;, edited by Denis Florence MacCarthy (4 April 1846); &quot;The Industrial History of Free Nations&quot;, by Torrens McCullagh, and Father Meehan&#x27;s &quot;The Confederation of Kilkenny&quot; (8 August 1846).

===Responds to the Famine===
Mitchel blamed the English for the famine. He wrote: &quot;The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine...and a million and a half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English government&quot;.

On 25 October 1845, in article &quot;The People&#x27;s Food&quot;, Mitchel pointed to the failure of the potato crop, and warned landlords that pursuing their tenants for rents would force them to sell their other crops and starve. On 8 November, in &quot;The Detectives&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The people are beginning to fear that the Irish Government is merely a machinery for their destruction; ... that it is unable, or unwilling, to take a single step for the prevention of famine, for the encouragement of manufactures, or providing fields of industry, and is only active in promoting, by high premiums and bounties, the horrible manufacture of crimes!&quot;.

On 14 February 1846 Mitchel wrote again of the consequences of the previous autumn&#x27;s potato crop losses, condemning the Government&#x27;s inadequate response, and questioning whether it recognised that millions of people in Ireland who would soon have nothing to eat. On 28 February, he observed that the Coercion Bill, then going through the House of Lords, was &quot;the only kind of legislation for Ireland that is sure to meet with no obstruction in that House&quot;. However they may differ about feeding the Irish people, the one thing all English parties were agreed upon was &quot;the policy of taxing, prosecuting and ruining them.&quot;

In an article on &quot;English Rule&quot; on 7 March 1846, Mitchel wrote: The Irish People are expecting famine day by day... and they ascribe it unanimously, not so much to the rule of heaven as to the greedy and cruel policy of England. ... They behold their own wretched food melting in rottenness off the face of the earth, and they see heavy-laden ships, freighted with the yellow corn their own hands have sown and reaped, spreading all sail for England; they see it and with every grain of that corn goes a heavy curse.

===Lalor and the break with O&#x27;Connell===

In June 1846 the Whigs, with whom O&#x27;Connell had worked against the Conservative ministry of Robert Peel, returned to office under Lord John Russell. Invoking new laissez-faire doctrines &quot;political economy&quot;, they immediately set about dismantling Peel&#x27;s limited, but practical, efforts to provide Ireland with food relief. O&#x27;Connell was left to plead for his country from the floor of the House of Commons: &quot;She is in your hands—in your power. If you do not save her, she cannot save herself. One-fourth of her population will perish unless Parliament comes to their relief&quot;. A broken man, on the advice of his doctors O&#x27;Connell took himself to the continent where, on route to Rome, he died in May 1847.

In the months before O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s death, Duffy circulated letters received from James Fintan Lalor in which he argued that independence could be pursued only in a popular struggle for the land. While Lalor proposed that this should begin with a campaign to withhold rent, he suggested more might be required. Parts of the country were already in a state of semi-insurrection. Tenants conspirators, in the tradition of the Whiteboys and Ribbonmen, were attacking process servers, intimidating land agents, and resisting evictions. Lalor advised only against a general uprising, as he believed the Irish people could not militarily defeat the British garrison in Ireland.

Having abandoned the hopes he had entertained with Duffy that landlords might rally to Repeal, and notwithstanding that his own ideas of agrarian reform extended little further than Tenant Right, Mitchel embraced Lalor&#x27;s vision of agrarian agitation as the cutting edge of a national struggle. When the London journal the &quot;Standard&quot; observed that the new Irish railways could be used to transport government troops to quickly curb agrarian unrest, Mitchel responded that the tracks could be turned into pikes and trains ambushed. O’Connell publicly distanced himself from &quot;The Nation, &quot;appearing to some to set Duffy, as the editor, up for prosecution. In the case that followed, Mitchel successfully defended Duffy in court. O&#x27;Connell and his son John were determined to press the issue. On the threat of their own resignations, they carried a resolution in the Repeal Association declaring that under no circumstances was a nation justified in asserting its liberties by force of arms.

The grouping around the &quot;Nation&quot; that O&#x27;Connell had taken to calling &quot;Young Ireland&quot;, a reference to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s anti-clerical and insurrectionist Young Italy, withdrew from the Repeal Association. In January 1847, they formed themselves anew as the Irish Confederation with, in Michael Doheny words, the &quot;independence of the Irish nation&quot; the objective and &quot;no means to attain that end abjured, save such as were inconsistent with honour, morality and reason&quot;. But unable to secure a pronouncement in favour of Lalor&#x27;s policy of building a campaign of resistance around tenant grievances, Mitchel soon broke with his confederates.

==Admiration for Carlyle, and opposition to black and Jewish emancipation==
Duffy suggests that Mitchel had already been on a path that would see him break not only with O&#x27;Connell but also with Duffy himself and other Young Irelanders. Mitchel had fallen under the influence of Scottish essayist, historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle, a High Tory notorious for his antipathy toward liberal notions of enlightenment and progress.

In the &quot;Nation&quot; of 10 January 1846, Mitchel reviewed &quot;Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Letters and Speeches&quot; (1845), a book by Carlyle that had been publicly condemned by O&#x27;Connell only two weeks prior. Despite Mitchel himself waxing indignant at Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s conduct in Ireland, Carlyle was pleased: he believed Mitchel had conceded Cromwell&#x27;s essential greatness. Mitchel had just published his own hagiography of the Ulster rebel chieftain Hugh O&#x27;Neill, which both Duffy and Davis had found excessively &quot;Carlylean&quot;. Mitchel&#x27;s book was a success: &quot;an early incursion of Carlylean thought into the romantic construction of the Irish nation that was to dominate militant Irish politics for a century.&quot; It embraced views which Carlyle had espoused in &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot; (1841) and denounced British rule in Ireland, perceiving it to be suppressing Irish culture &quot;in the name of Civilisation&quot;.

When in May 1846 Mitchel first met Carlyle in a delegation with Duffy in London, he wrote to John Martin describing the historian&#x27;s presence as &quot;royal, almost Godlike&quot;, and did so even while acknowledging Carlyle&#x27;s unbending unionism. Hosted by Mitchel in September 1846 in Dublin, Carlyle recalled &quot;a fine elastic-spirited young fellow&quot; but upon whom Carlyle&#x27;s own arguments &quot;were thrown away&quot;. This might have been true with regard to the value of the union. But when Carlyle drew derogatory comparisons (as other commentators had done) between Irish cottiers and the allegedly-indolent descendants of enslaved Afro-Caribbeans, Mitchel&#x27;s response was not to join O&#x27;Connell in proclaiming himself &quot;the friend of liberty in every clime, class and colour&quot; Rather, it was to insist on a racial distinction between the Irish and the &quot;negro&quot;. This Duffy had discovered in 1847 when he conceded temporary editorship of the &quot;Nation&quot; to Mitchel.

Duffy found that he had lent a journal, &quot;recognised throughout the world as the mouthpiece of Irish rights&quot;, to &quot;the monstrous task of applauding negro slavery and of denouncing the emancipation of the Jews,&quot; another of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s liberal causes against which Mitchel stood with Carlyle. It was not only that Mitchel claimed (as others had done) that Irish cottiers were treated worse than black slaves. Nor was it that Mitchel decried as inopportune O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s harping upon &quot;the vile union&quot; in the United States &quot;of republicanism and slavery&quot;. Duffy himself was fearful of the impact of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s vocal abolitionism upon American support and funding. It was that Mitchel argued (with Carlyle) that slavery was &quot;the best state of existence for the negro&quot;.

According to Duffy, when he confronted Carlyle with Mitchel&#x27;s overt racism, Carlyle responded that Mitchel &quot;would be found to be right in the end; the black man could not be emancipated from the laws of nature, which had pronounced a very decided decree on the question, and neither could the Jew.&quot;

==The &quot;United Irishman&quot;==

At the end of 1847 Mitchel resigned his position as leader writer on &quot;The Nation&quot;. He later explained that he had come to regard as &quot;absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the English Government than that which William Smith O&#x27;Brien, Charles Gavan Duffy and other Young Ireland leaders were willing to pursue&quot;. He &quot;had watched the progress of the famine policy of the Government, and could see nothing in it but a machinery, deliberately devised, and skilfully worked, for the entire subjugation of the island—the slaughter of portion of the people, and the pauperization of the rest,&quot; and he had therefore &quot;come to the conclusion that the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point.&quot;

He was convinced too, that rendered acute by the famine, the agrarian question had the potential to surmount the north-south sectarian division, and to realise the unity that had been sought in &#x27;98. As &quot;An Ulsterman for Ireland&quot;, he ridiculed the Orangeism of the landed Ascendancy, reminding &quot;the farmers, labourers and artisans of the north of Ireland&quot; that:My Lord Enniskillen . . . is apprehensive not lest you be evicted by landlords, and sent to the poorhouse, but lest purgatory and the Seven Sacraments be down your throats.. . . The Seven Sacraments are, to be sure, very dangerous, but the quarter-acre-clause [conditioning access to poor relief] touches you more nearly . . . [B]end all your energies to resisting the &quot;encroachments of Popery&quot; you thereby perpetuate British dominion in Ireland and keep the &quot;Empire&quot; going yet a little while. Irish landlordism has made a covenant with British government in these terms—&quot;Keep down for me my tenantry, my peasantry, my &#x27;masses&#x27; in due submission with your troops and laws, and I will garrison the island for you and hold it as your liege-man and vassal for ever.&quot;While decrying the &quot;fatal cant of moral force&quot;, and admitting no principle that distinguished his position from the &quot;conspirators of Ninety-Eight&quot; (the original United Irishmen), Mitchel emphasised that he was not recommending &quot;an immediate insurrection&quot;: in the &quot;present broken and divided condition&quot; of the country &quot;the people would be butchered&quot;. With Fintan Lalor he urged &quot;passive resistance&quot;. The people should &quot;obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of Irish provisions&quot; and, by intimidation, suppress bidding for grain or cattle if brought &quot;to auction under distress&quot;—a method that had demonstrated its effectiveness in the Tithe War. Such actions would be illegal, but such was his opposition to British rule that in Mitchel&#x27;s view, no opinion in Ireland was &quot;worth a farthing which is not illegal&quot;.

The first number of Mitchel&#x27;s own paper, &quot;United Irishman&quot;, appeared on 12 February 1848. The Prospectus announced that as editor Mitchel would be &quot;aided by Thomas Devin Reilly, John Martin of Loughorne and other competent contributors&quot; who were likewise convinced that &quot;Ireland really and truly wants to be freed from English dominion.&quot; No other object defined their purpose: if he was a republican now, Mitchel privately confessed that it was &quot;only because this spirit democratic spirit is the most formidable enemy to British dominion in Ireland&quot;. He was &quot;no bigot as to forms of government&quot;.

Under a masthead that included Wolfe Tone caution that &quot;if the men of property&quot; failed in their allegiance to the national cause, it could yet triumph with &quot;the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property,&quot; &quot;The United Irishman&quot; declared: That the Irish people had a distinct and indefeasible right to their country, and to all the moral and material wealth and resources thereof, ... as a distinct Sovereign State ...;

 That the property of the farmers and labourers of Ireland is as sacred as the property of all the noblemen and gentlemen in Ireland, and also immeasurably more valuable;

 That the custom called ‘Tenant Right,’ which prevails partially in the North of Ireland, is a just and salutary custom both for North and South ...;

 That every man in Ireland who shall hereafter pay taxes for the support of the State, shall have a just right to an equal voice with every other man in the government ...

 That all ‘legal and constitutional agitation’ in Ireland is a delusion;

 That every freeman, and every man who desired to become free, ought to have arms, and to practise the use of them.

 That no combination of classes in Ireland is desirable, just, or possible, save on the terms of the rights of the industrious classes being acknowledged and secured; [and]

That no good thing can come from the English Parliament, or the English Government.In the first editorial, addressed to &quot;The Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon, Englishman, calling himself Her Majesty&#x27;s Lord Lieutenant – General and General Governor of Ireland,&quot; Mitchel stated that the purpose of the journal was to resume the struggle which had been waged by Tone and Emmet, the Holy War to sweep this Island clear of the English name and nation.&quot; Lord Clarendon was also addressed as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Executioner-General and General Butcher of Ireland&quot;.

Commenting on this first edition of &quot;The United Irishman&quot;, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, maintained that the paper pursued &quot;the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty&#x27;s subjects in Ireland..., and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland&quot;. He allowed that the publishers were &quot;honest&quot; men: &quot;they are not the kind of men who make their patriotism the means of barter for place or pension. They are not to be bought off by the Government of the day for a colonial place, or by a snug situation in the customs or excise. No; they honestly repudiate this course; they are rebels at heart, and they are rebels avowed, who are in earnest in what they say and propose to do&quot;.

Only 16 editions of &quot;The United Irishman&quot; had been produced when Mitchel was arrested, and the paper suppressed. Mitchel concluded his last article in &quot;The United Irishman&quot;, from Newgate prison, entitled &quot;A Letter to Farmers&quot;,[My] gallant Confederates ... have marched past my prison windows to let me know that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— &#x27;felons&#x27; in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last. The liberty of Ireland may come sooner or come later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody conflict— but it is sure; and wherever between the poles I may chance to be, I will hear the crash of the down fall of the thrice-accursed British Empire.&quot;

==Arrest and deportation==
On 15 April 1848, a grand jury was called on to indict not only Mitchel, but also his former associates on the &quot;Nation&quot; O&#x27;Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher for &quot;seditious libels&quot;. When the cases against O&#x27;Brien and Meagher fell through, thanks in part to Isaac Butt&#x27;s able defence, under new legislation the government replaced the charges against Mitchel with Treason Felony punishable by transportation for life. To justify the severity of the new measures, under which Mitchel was arrested in May, the Home Secretary thought it sufficient to read extracts from Mitchel&#x27;s articles and speeches.

Convicted in June by a jury he dismissed as &quot;packed&quot; (as &quot;not empanelled even according to the law of England&quot;), Mitchel was sentenced to be &quot;transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years.&quot; From the dock he declared that he was satisfied that he had &quot;shown what the law is made of in Ireland&quot;, and that he regretted nothing: &quot;the course which I have opened is only commenced&quot;. Others would follow.

Accommodated as a gentleman rather than as a common criminal, Mitchel was carried aboard the steamer HMS Scourge to Ireland Island in the &quot;Imperial fortress&quot; of Bermuda. After a year of acute ill health aboard the prison hulk HMS &quot;Dromedary&quot;, he was re-embarked for the Cape Colony on the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Once the &quot;Nautilus&quot; reached the Cape it was refused docking or supply during the convict crisis of 1849 and remained anchored off the coast for 5 months before sailing on to the penal colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern-day Tasmania, Australia) to which O&#x27;Brien, Martin, Meagher, and other Young Irelanders, had been transported in the wake of their abortive July 1848 rising. 

Aboard ship, he began writing his &quot;Jail Journal&quot;, in which he reiterated his call for national unity and resistance. Accepting a ticket of leave in Tasmania, he and Martin lived together at Bothwell, in a house still known as Mitchel&#x27;s Cottage. His wife and children joined him in Bothwell in June 1851. In August, they move onto a two hundred-acre farm which they worked with convict labour. While he admitted to &quot;living as peacefully as they ever did in Banbridge&quot;, after Meagher broke his parole in January 1852 and reached New York, Mitchel determined to join him.
==United States==
Assisted by Patrick James (&quot;Nicaragua&quot;) Smyth, an agent of the New York Irish Directory, in June 1853 Mitchel escaped from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and made his way (via Tahiti, San Francisco, Nicaragua and Cuba) to New York City. He soon outlived the hero&#x27;s welcome he received. Among his contributions to the &quot;Irish Citizen&quot; (a joint venture with Meagher) was a defence of slavery in the southern states that occasioned &quot;much surprise and general rebuke&quot;.

===Pro-slavery Confederate===
Once in the United States, Mitchel did not hesitate to repeat the claim that negroes were &quot;an innately inferior people&quot;. In what was only the second edition the &quot;Irish Citizen&quot;, he declared that it was not a crime &quot;or even a peccadillo to hold slaves, to buy slaves, to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction&quot;, and that he himself, might wish for &quot;a good plantation well-stocked with healthy negroes in Alabama&quot;. Subject to widely-circulated broadsides from the abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher and the French republican exile Alexandre Holinski, the remarks triggered a public furore. In Dublin, the Irish Confederation convened an emergency meeting to protest reports in American and British press outlets which &quot;erroneously attributed&quot; Mitchel&#x27;s proslavery thought &quot;to the Young Ireland party&quot;.

Provoked by the nativist hostility they encountered in the United States, Mitchel was to further distance his countrymen from the African American by elevating them within the white race. In 1858 he told an audience in New York that &quot;nearly all the great men which Europe has produced have been Celts&quot;.

In correspondence with his friend, the Roman Catholic priest John Kenyon, Mitchel revealed his wish to make the people of the US &quot;proud and fond of [slavery] as a national institution, and [to] advocate its extension by re-opening the trade in Negroes&quot;. Slavery he promoted for &quot;its own sake&quot;. It was &quot;good in itself&quot; for &quot;to enslave [Africans] is impossible or to set them free either. They are born and bred slaves&quot;. The Catholic Church might condemn the &quot;enslavement of men&quot;, but this censure could not apply to &quot;negro slaves&quot;.

The value and virtue of slavery, &quot;both for negroes and white men&quot;, Mitchel maintained from 1857 in the pages of the &quot;Southern Citizen&quot;, a paper he moved in 1859 from Knoxville, Tennessee to Washington D.C. The paper circulated widely through Hibernian societies of the south. Among these it was commonplace to propose that the American slave had nothing to envy in the freedom of the Irish tenant-at-will, the cottier family in Ireland that the landlord might set out in the roadside ditch. In 1854, in a widely reported address to the graduating class of University of Virginia, he had linked Britain&#x27;s abolitionism to her laissez-faire indifference to the Irish famine. He had also credited slavery with the contrast between southern gentility and Yankee brusqueness.

Mitchel&#x27;s wife, Jenny, had her reservations. Nothing, she said, would induce her &quot;to become the mistress of a slave household&quot;. Her objection to slavery was &quot;the injury it does to the white masters&quot;. There is no record or suggestion of Mitchel, himself, holding any person in bondage. When he briefly farmed in eastern Tennessee it was from a log cabin and, reportedly, with a &quot;colored man&quot; employed only &quot;if he could not get a white man to work&quot;.

While championing the South, in the summer of 1859 Mitchel detected the possibility of a breach between France and England, from which Ireland might benefit. He travelled to Paris as an American correspondent, but found the talk of war had been much exaggerated. After the secession from the American Union of several Southern states in February 1861 and the bombardment of Fort Sumter (during which his son John commanded a South Carolina battery), Mitchel was anxious to return. He reached New York in September and made his way to the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia. There he edited the &quot;Daily Enquirer&quot;, the semi-official organ of secessionists&#x27; president, Jefferson Davis.

Mitchel drew a parallel between the American South and Ireland: both were agricultural economies tied to an unjust union. The Union States and England were &quot;..the commercial, manufacturing and money-broking power ... greedy, grabbing, griping and grovelling&quot;. Abraham Lincoln he described as &quot;... an ignoramus and a boor; not an apostle at all; no grand reformer, not so much as an abolitionist, except by accident – a man of very small account in every way.&quot;

The Mitchels lost both their youngest son Willie in the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and their son John, who returned to Fort Sumter, in July the following year.

After the reverse at Gettysburg, Mitchel became increasingly disillusioned with Davis&#x27;s leadership. In December 1863 he resigned from the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and became the leader writer for the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot;, regularly attacking Davis for what he saw as misplaced chivalry, especially his failure to retaliate in kind for Federal attacks on civilians.

On slavery, Mitchel remained uncompromising. As the South&#x27;s manpower reserves depleted, Generals Robert E. Lee and Patrick Cleburne (a native of County Cork) proposed that slaves should be offered their freedom in return for military service. Although he had been among the first to claim that slavery had not been the cause of the conflict but simply the pretext for northern aggression, Mitchel objected: to allow blacks their freedom was to concede that the South had been in the wrong from the start. His biographer Anthony Russell notes that it was &quot;with no trace of irony at all&quot;, that Mitchel wrote:

...if freedom be a reward for negroes – that is, if freedom be a good thing for negroes – why, then it is, and always was, a grievous wrong and crime to hold them in slavery at all. If it be true that the state of slavery keeps these people depressed below the condition to which they could develop their nature, their intelligence, and their capacity for enjoyment, and what we call &quot;progress&quot; then every hour of their bondage for generations is a black stain upon the white race.

This might have suggested that Mitchel was open to revising his view of slavery. But he remained defiant to the end, going so far as to &quot;raise the blasphemous doubt&quot; as to whether General Robert E. Lee was &quot;a &#x27;good Southerner&#x27;; that is whether he is thoroughly satisfied of the justice and beneficence of negro slavery&quot;.

Mitchel would make no allowances. After the war a Union officer who claimed to have &quot;loved John Mitchel, the Irish patriot, with a purer devotion&quot; than any in Ireland, reported to a Boston paper that, as prisoners in Richmond, he and a fellow Irishman contacted his former idol. Not only did Mitchel refuse to have anything to do with &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s hirelings,&quot; but in the next issue of the &quot;Examiner&quot; he &quot;directed the citizens to treat this human fungi not as prisoners of war, but as &#x27;robbers, murderers and assassins!&#x27;&quot;

Frederick Douglass, who in visiting Ireland believed her dispossessed were bound in sorrow at their circumstances with the enslaved in America, accounted Mitchel a “vulgar traitor to liberty.”

===At odds with Irish America===

At war&#x27;s end in 1865 Mitchel moved to New York and edited the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. That same year, his continued defence of southern secession caused him to be arrested in the offices of the paper and interned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, where Jefferson Davis and Senator Clement Claiborne Clay (accused of conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln) were the only other prisoners. A new Irish republican organisation, the Fenian Brotherhood, lobbied for his release which was secured on condition that he left America. Mitchel returned to Paris where he acted as Fenians&#x27; financial agent.

Following their raids into Ontario and New Brunswick in June 1866, opposing Fenian factions proposed to unite under Mitchel&#x27;s leadership. But Mitchel objected to asking people for large contributions under the delusion that, with England at peace, further military operations could be mounted whether in Canada or in Ireland. He resigned from the Brotherhood, and returned to New York where, after writing for the &quot;Daily News,&quot; he resumed publication of the &quot;Irish Citizen&quot;.

Mitchel&#x27;s anti-Reconstruction, pro-Democratic editorial line was opposed in New York by another Ulster Protestant, the IRB exile David Bell. Bell&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Liberty, Literature, and Social Progress&quot;, &quot;Irish Republic,&quot; cautioned readers &quot;interested in the labor question&quot; from associating themselves with John Mitchel. Mitchel, a &quot;miserable man&quot;, was the proponent of a &quot;diabolical&quot; Democratic Party plan to impose upon blacks in the South, &quot;as a substitute for chattel slavery, a system of serfdom scarcely less hateful than the institution it is intended to practically prolong&quot;. The policy was nothing less than &quot;an attempt to attach to the laborer in America those medieval conditions which even Russia Emancipation of the Serfs, 1861 ] has rejected&quot;.

The revived &quot;Citizen&quot; failed to attract readers and folded in July 1872; Bell&#x27;s &quot;Irish Republic&quot; followed a year later. Neither paper was in sympathy with the ethnic-minority Catholicism powerfully represented by the city&#x27;s Tammany Hall Democratic-Party political machine and, until his death in 1864, by the authority of a third Ulsterman, Archbishop John Hughes. Mitchel dedicated his paper to &quot;aspirants to the privileges of American citizenship&quot;, arguing that the more integrated (or &quot;more lost&quot;) among American citizens the Irish in America were &quot;the better&quot;.

Already In 1854, for comments critical of the Pope&#x27;s temporal powers, Mitchel had earned &quot;wrath&quot; of the Archbishop. But, like Mitchel, Hughes had suggested that the conditions of &quot;starving laborers&quot; in the North were often worse than that of slaves in the South, and in 1842 he had urged his flock not to sign O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s abolitionist petition (&quot;An Address of the People of Ireland to their Countrymen and Countrywomen in America&quot;) which he regarded as unnecessarily provocative. Nonetheless, Hughes used Mitchel&#x27;s stance on slavery to discredit him: as Mitchel saw it, &quot;copying the abolition press to cast an Alabama plantation&quot; in his &quot;teeth&quot;.

==Final campaign: Tipperary elections==

In July 1874 Mitchel received an enthusiastic reception in Ireland (a procession of ten thousand people escorted him to his hotel in Cork). The &quot;Freeman’s Journal&quot; opined that: &quot;After the lapse of a quarter of a century – after the loss of two of his sons … John Mitchel again treads his native land, a prematurely aged, enfeebled man. Whatever the opinions as to the wisdom of his course … none can deny the respect due to honest of purpose and fearlessness of heart&quot;.

Back in New York City on 8 December 1874, Mitchel lectured on &quot;Ireland Revisited&quot; at the Cooper Institute, an event organised by the Clan-na-Gael and attended by among other prominent nationalists Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa. While his visit to Ireland was ostensibly private, Mitchel revealed that he had been pressed to stand for British Parliament and that it was his intention, if any vacancy should occur, to offer himself as a candidate so that he might &quot;get the Irish members to put in operation the plan suggested by O’Connell at one time, of declining to attend in Parliament altogether, that is, to try to discredit and explode the fraudulent pretence of representation in the Parliament of Britain&quot;. In the same speech, Mitchel dismissed the Irish Home Rule movement: &quot;the fact that this Home Rule League [his friend John Martin among them] goes to Parliament and sets it hope therein, puts me in indignation against the Home Rule League … they are not Home Rulers but Foreign Rulers. Now it is painful for me to say even so much in disparagement of so excellent a body of men as they are … after a little while they will be bought&quot;.
The call from Ireland came sooner than expected. In January 1875 a bye-election was called for a parliamentary seat in Tipperary. Stung by his remarks in New York, the Irish Parliamentary Party was reluctant to endorse Mitchel&#x27;s nomination. although they may have been confused as to his position. Before re-embarking for Ireland, Mitchel issued an election address in which he declared for &quot;Home Rule&quot;—but, straddling positions, defining this as &quot;sovereign independence for Ireland&quot;—together with free education, universal tenant rights, and the freeing of Fenian prisoners. As it was, on 17 February, while still approaching the Irish shore, Mitchel was elected unopposed. As had been the case for O&#x27;Donovan Rossa who had been returned for very same constituency in 1869, his election was unavailing. On the motion of Benjamin Disraeli, the House of Commons by a large majority declared Mitchel, as a felon, ineligible. Mitchel ran again as an Independent Nationalist in the resulting March by-election, and in a contest took 80 percent of the vote.

== Death and commemoration ==
Mitchel died at Drumalane, his parents&#x27; house in Newry, on 20 March 1875. His last letter, published on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1875, expressed his gratitude to the voters of Tipperary for supporting him in exposing the &#x27;fraudulent&#x27; system of Irish representation in Parliament. An election petition had been lodged. Observing that voters in Tipperary had known that Mitchel was ineligible, the courts awarded the seat to Mitchel&#x27;s Conservative opponent.

Mitchel was survived, in the United States, by his wife and his son James (father of John Purroy Mitchel who was to be a reform-minded mayor of New York City). At Mitchel&#x27;s funeral in Newry, his friend John Martin collapsed, and died a week later (he was succeeded as MP for County Meath by Charles Stewart Parnell).

On the day Mitchel died, the Tipperary paper The Nenagh Guardian offered &quot;An American View of John Mitchel&quot;: a syndicated piece from the Chicago Tribune that declared Mitchel a &quot;recreant to liberty&quot;, a defender of slavery and secession with whom &quot;the Union masses of the American people&quot; could have &quot;little sympathy&quot;. Obituaries for Mitchel looked elsewhere to qualify their acknowledgement of his patriotic devotion.

The Home-Rule &quot;Freeman’s Journal&quot; wrote of Mitchel: &quot;we may lament his persistence in certain lines of action which his intelligence must have suggested to him could have but been futile issue … his love for Ireland may have been imprudent. But he loved her with a devotion unexcelled&quot;. The &quot;Standard&quot;, with which Mitchel had contended in 1847, concluded: &quot;His powers through life, however, were marred by want of judgment, obstinate opinionativeness [sic], and a factiousness which disabled him from ever acting long enough with any set of men&quot;.

Pádraic Pearse placed Mitchel in succession to Theobald Wolfe Tone, Thomas Davis, and James Fintan Lalor and hailed Mitchel&#x27;s &quot;gospel of Irish nationalism&quot; as the &quot;fiercest and most sublime&quot;. Sinn Féin leader Arthur Griffith was adamant that it detracted nothing from Mitchel&#x27;s greatness that he severed &quot;the case for Irish independence from theories of humanitarianism and universalism&quot;. No excuse was needed &quot;for an Irish Nationalist declining to hold the negro his peer in right&quot;.

Comparing him to Thomas Davis, W. B. Yeats concluded that a &quot;harsh Ulster character, made hasher still by the tragedy of the famine, and the rhetoric of Carlyle&quot; had a political influence that was &quot;almost wholly mischievous&quot;. Mitchel &quot;played upon international suspicion and exalted hatred of England above the love of Ireland that Davis would have taught us&quot;.

In the decades following his death, branches of the Irish National Land League were named in Mitchel&#x27;s honour. There are at least ten Gaelic Athletic Association clubs named after Mitchel, including one based in his home town, Newry and two in County Londonderry, his county of birth – one in Claudy and another in Glenullin. Mitchel Park is named after him in Dungiven, near his birthplace, as is Mitchell County, Iowa, in the United States. Fort Mitchel on Spike Island, Cork from which he was transported in 1848 is named in his honour.

During the movement to remove statues following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a petition receiving over 1,200 signatures called for the statue in John Mitchel Place, Newry, to be removed and the site renamed &quot;Black Lives Matter Plaza&quot;. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council agreed only to &quot;proceed to clarify responsibility for the John Mitchel statue, develop options for an education programme, identify the origins of John Mitchel Place and give consideration as to other potential issues in relation to slavery within the council area&quot;.
Mitchel&#x27;s recent biographer, Anthony Russell argues that Mitchel&#x27;s stand on slavery was not an aberration. His rejection of philanthropic liberalism was equal to his disdain for &quot;free labour&quot; political economy. In his &quot;Jail Journal&quot; Mitchel urged capital punishment for crimes such as burglary, forgery and robbery. The &quot;reformation of offenders&quot; was not, he argued, &quot;the reasonable object of criminal punishment&quot;: &quot;Why hang them, hang them….you have no right to make the honest people support the rogues….and for &#x27;ventilation&#x27;… I would ventilate the rascals in front of the county jails at the end of a rope&quot;.

As for slavery in the American South, in his biography William Dillon proposes that for Mitchel it was a &quot;practical issue&quot;. Faced with the alternative of a social system of the North in which the relation of master to servant was regulated by competition, &quot;He took his stand in favour of the system that seemed to him the better of the two; and as was his habit, he took it decisively&quot;.

Mitchel is remembered for his involvement in radical nationalism, and in particular for writings such as &quot;Jail Journal&quot;, &quot;The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)&quot;, &quot;The History of Ireland&quot;, &quot;An Apology for the British Government in Ireland&quot;, and the less well known &quot;The Life and times of Hugh O&#x27;Neill&quot;. He was described by Charles Gavan Duffy as &quot;a trumpet to awake the slothful to the call of duty; and the Irish people&quot;.

<doc id="167031" wikidata="Q2414732" url="?curid=167031" title="The Treniers">
<text>The Treniers (pronounced /trəˈniərz/) were an American R&amp;B and jump blues musical group led by identical twins Cliff and Claude Trenier. They were originally billed as the Trenier Twins, who performed alongside the Gene Gilbeaux Quartet, but shortened their name to the Treniers when Gilbeaux and other musicians became integral members of the group. Besides the Trenier brothers, group members included Don Hill on saxophone, Shifty Henry and later James (Jimmy) Johnson on bass, Henry (Tucker) Green on drums and Gene Gilbeaux on piano. Later, additional Trenier brothers Milt and Buddy, and nephew Skip, joined the group on vocals, and there were many other musician and line-up changes over the years including Herman Washington and Mickey Baker on guitar.

==Career==
The band was based around twins Clifton L. &quot;Cliff&quot; Trenier (July 14, 1919 – March 2, 1983) and Claude Oliver Trenier (July 14, 1919 – November 17, 2003). They were born in Mobile, Alabama, and formed the Alabama State Collegians when in college together in 1939. In 1943, Claude Trenier left to join Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s band as lead singer, and Cliff joined him the following year. The twins left the Lunceford band in 1947 and began performing together as the Trenier Twins, backed by the Gene Gilbeaux Quartet which included Gene Gilbeaux on piano and Don Hill on alto sax. They made their first recordings for Mercury Records in 1947, and developed a strong reputation for their live performances. In 1949, they were joined by older brother Buddy Trenier (December 11, 1913 – March 15, 1999), and started to be billed as &quot;The Rockin&#x27; Rollin&#x27; Treniers&quot;.

They played a form of music intermediate between swing and early rock and roll. Though their sound is more swing influenced, the Treniers incorporated a thumping backbeat and several songs that included the words &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;roll&quot; - &quot;Rocking on Sunday Night&quot; and &quot;It Rocks! It Rolls! It Swings!&quot;, for example, and in the 1940s were already playing &quot;Rockin&#x27; Is Our Bizness,&quot; which was inspired by Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Is Our Business&quot; from the 1930s. They were also known for the humorous content of many of their songs, and their on stage acrobatics were seen as precursors to the wild antics of many later rock and roll groups. Their lively stage presentation influenced Bill Haley and Comets, The Shadows in the UK in 1959, Paul Revere and Raiders, and beyond.

They had their only national chart hit in 1951, when &quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; reached #10 on the R&amp;B chart, but several of their other records including &quot;It Rocks! It Rolls! It Swings!&quot; (1952) and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Is Our Bizness&quot; (1953) &quot;anticipated some crucial elements of rock n roll with their solid, thumping beats, their squealing sax solos.&quot; In the 1950s, they moved closer towards an R&amp;B influenced sound, but were unable to weather the influx of rock and roll. Nonetheless, the group was considered a strong influence on bands such as their contemporaries Bill Haley and His Comets, and they were one of the first to record Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock-a-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;. Claude Trenier would later claim in an interview in &quot;Blue Suede News&quot; magazine that his group was responsible for Haley deciding to record rock and roll; this account is disputed.

One of the first times rock and roll appeared on national television was in May 1954 when the Treniers appeared on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, hosted by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. During the playing of their songs, Martin and Lewis participated in the antics, and when the drummer got up and stepped aside, Jerry Lewis sat down and played drums for one song.

The group appeared in several films in the 1950s including &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; (which also featured Haley), and continued to perform as recently as 2003.

In 1955, the group released the song &quot;Say Hey (The Willie Mays Song)&quot; about Giants center fielder, Willie Mays, which included some dialogue by the Hall-of-Famer himself. The song is included on the soundtrack to Ken Burns 1994 documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;.

In 2013, surviving member Milt Trenier performed semi-weekly at Chicago area restaurants. Milt retired from performing in 2017, after 70 years (1947-2017).

Saxophonist Don Hill died on June 18, 2021, aged 99.

<doc id="167032" wikidata="Q229513" url="?curid=167032" title="Sarah Vaughan">
<text>Sarah Lois Vaughan (, March 27, 1924 – April 3, 1990) was an American jazz singer and pianist. Nicknamed &quot;Sassy&quot; and &quot;The Divine One&quot;, she won two Grammy Awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award, and was nominated for a total of nine Grammy Awards. She was given an NEA Jazz Masters Award in 1989. Critic Scott Yanow wrote that she had &quot;one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century&quot;.

==Early life==
Vaughan was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Asbury &quot;Jake&quot; Vaughan, a carpenter by trade who played guitar and piano, and Ada Vaughan, a laundress who sang in the church choir, migrants from Virginia. The Vaughans lived in a house on Brunswick Street in Newark for Vaughan&#x27;s entire childhood. Jake was deeply religious. The family was active in New Mount Zion Baptist Church at 186 Thomas Street. Vaughan began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir, and played piano for rehearsals and services. Sarah and her family were all registered Democrats.

She developed an early love for popular music. In the 1930s, she frequently saw local and touring bands at the Montgomery Street Skating Rink. By her mid-teens, she ventured illegally into Newark&#x27;s night clubs and performed as a pianist and singer at the Piccadilly Club and at Newark Airport.

Vaughan attended East Side High School, then transferred to Newark Arts High School, which opened in 1931. As her nocturnal adventures as a performer overtook her academic pursuits, she dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on her music.

==Career==

===1942–1943: Early career===
Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. In the fall of 1942, by which time she was 18 years old, Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Theater Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later decided to go back and compete as a singer herself. She sang &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and won—although the date of this victorious performance is uncertain. The prize, as Vaughan recalled to Marian McPartland, was $10 and the promise of a week&#x27;s engagement at the Apollo. On November 20, 1942, she returned to the Apollo to open for Ella Fitzgerald.

During her week of performances at the Apollo, Vaughan was introduced to bandleader and pianist Earl Hines, although the details of that introduction are disputed. Billy Eckstine, Hines&#x27; singer at the time, has been credited by Vaughan and others with hearing her at the Apollo and recommending her to Hines. Hines claimed later to have discovered her himself and offered her a job on the spot. After a brief tryout at the Apollo, Hines replaced his female singer with Vaughan on April 4, 1943.

===1943–1944: Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine===
Vaughan spent the remainder of 1943 and part of 1944 touring the country with the Earl Hines big band, which featured Billy Eckstine. She was hired as a pianist so Hines could hire her under the jurisdiction of the musicians&#x27; union (American Federation of Musicians) rather than the singers union (American Guild of Variety Artists). But after Cliff Smalls joined the band as a trombonist and pianist, her duties were limited to singing. The Earl Hines band in this period is remembered as an incubator of bebop, as it included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, saxophonist Charlie Parker (playing tenor saxophone rather than alto), and trombonist Bennie Green. Gillespie arranged for the band, although the contemporary recording ban by the musicians&#x27; union meant that no commercial recordings exist.

Eckstine quit the Hines band in late 1943 and formed a big band with Gillespie, leaving Hines to become the band&#x27;s musical director. Parker joined Eckstine, and over the next few years the band included Gene Ammons, Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Kenny Dorham, Dexter Gordon, and Lucky Thompson. Vaughan accepted Eckstine&#x27;s invitation to join his band in 1944, giving her the opportunity to record for the first time on December 5, 1944, on the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait and Pray&quot; for De Luxe. Critic and producer Leonard Feather asked her to record later that month for Continental with a septet that included Dizzy Gillespie and Georgie Auld. She left the Eckstine band in late 1944 to pursue a solo career, although she remained close to Eckstine and recorded with him frequently.

Pianist John Malachi is credited with giving Vaughan the moniker &quot;Sassy&quot;, a nickname that matched her personality. She liked it, and the name and its shortened variant &quot;Sass&quot; stuck with colleagues and the press. In written communications, Vaughan often spelled it &quot;Sassie&quot;.

===1945–1948: Early solo career ===

Vaughan began her solo career in 1945 by freelancing on 52nd Street in New York City at the Three Deuces, the Famous Door, the Downbeat, and the Onyx Club. She spent time at Braddock Grill next to the Apollo Theater in Harlem. On May 11, 1945, she recorded &quot;Lover Man&quot; for Guild with a quintet featuring Gillespie and Parker with Al Haig on piano, Curly Russell on double bass, and Sid Catlett on drums. Later that month, she went into the studio with a slightly different and larger Gillespie/Parker aggregation and recorded three more sides.

After being invited by violinist Stuff Smith to record the song &quot;Time and Again&quot; in October 1945, Vaughan was offered a contract to record for Musicraft by owner Albert Marx, although she would not begin recording as a leader for Musicraft until May 7, 1946. In the intervening time, she recorded for Crown and Gotham and began performing regularly at Café Society Downtown, an integrated club in New York&#x27;s Sheridan Square.

While at Café Society, Vaughan became friends with trumpeter George Treadwell, who became her manager. She delegated to him most of the musical director responsibilities for her recording sessions, allowing her to concentrate on singing. Over the next few years, Treadwell made changes in Vaughan&#x27;s stage appearance. Aside from a new wardrobe and hair style, she had her teeth capped, eliminating a gap between her two front teeth.

Her recordings for Musicraft included &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot; (written and arranged by Tadd Dameron), &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot;, &quot;Everything I Have Is Yours&quot; and &quot;Body and Soul&quot;. With Vaughan and Treadwell&#x27;s professional relationship on solid footing, the couple married on September 16, 1946.

In 1947, Vaughan performed at the third Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles that was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on September 7, 1947. The Valdez Orchestra, The Blenders, T-Bone Walker, Slim Gaillard, The Honeydrippers, Johnny Otis and his Orchestra, Woody Herman, and the Three Blazers also performed that same day.

Vaughan&#x27;s recording success for Musicraft continued through 1947 and 1948. Her recording of &quot;Tenderly&quot;—she was proud to be the first to have recorded that jazz standard—became an unexpected pop hit in late 1947. Her December 27, 1947, recording of &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; (from the Doris Day film &quot;Romance on the High Seas&quot;) found chart success in early 1948. Her recording of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; from April 8, 1948, became a hit around the time the popular Nat King Cole version was released. Because of a second recording ban by the musicians&#x27; union, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; was recorded with an a cappella choir.

===1948–1953: Stardom and the Columbia years===
The musicians&#x27; union ban pushed Musicraft to the brink of bankruptcy. Vaughan used the missed royalty payments as an opportunity to sign with the larger Columbia record label. After the settling of legal issues, her chart successes continued with &quot;Black Coffee&quot; in the summer of 1949. While at Columbia through 1953, she was steered almost exclusively to commercial pop ballads, several with success on the charts: &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, &quot;Make Believe (You Are Glad When You&#x27;re Sorry)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy to Love You&quot;, &quot;Our Very Own&quot;, &quot;I Love the Guy&quot;, &quot;Thinking of You&quot; (with pianist Bud Powell), &quot;I Cried for You&quot;, &quot;These Things I Offer You&quot;, &quot;Vanity&quot;, &quot;I Ran All the Way Home&quot;, &quot;Saint or Sinner&quot;, &quot;My Tormented Heart&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;.

She won &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s New Star Award for 1947, awards from &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine from 1947 to 1952, and from &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine from 1948 to 1953. Recording and critical success led to performing opportunities, with Vaughan singing to large crowds in clubs around the country during the late 1940s and early 1950s. In the summer of 1949, she made her first appearance with a symphony orchestra in a benefit for the Philadelphia Orchestra entitled &quot;100 Men and a Girl.&quot; Around this time, Chicago disk jockey Dave Garroway coined a second nickname for her, &quot;The Divine One&quot;, that would follow her throughout her career. One of her early television appearances was on DuMont&#x27;s variety show &quot;Stars on Parade&quot; (1953–54) in which she sang &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;Linger Awhile&quot;.

In 1949, with their finances improving, Vaughan and Treadwell bought a three-story house on 21 Avon Avenue in Newark, occupying the top floor during their increasingly rare off-hours at home and moving Vaughan&#x27;s parents to the lower two floors. However, business pressures and personality conflicts led to a cooling in Treadwell and Vaughan&#x27;s relationship. Treadwell hired a road manager to handle her touring needs and opened a management office in Manhattan so he could work with other clients.

Vaughan&#x27;s relationship with Columbia soured as she became dissatisfied with the commercial material and its lackluster financial success. She made some small-group recordings in 1950 with Miles Davis and Bennie Green, but they were atypical of what she recorded for Columbia.

====Radio====
In 1949, Vaughan had a radio program, &quot;Songs by Sarah Vaughan&quot;, on WMGM in New York City. The 15-minute shows were broadcast in the evenings on Wednesday through Sunday from The Clique Club, described as &quot;rendezvous of the bebop crowd.&quot; She was accompanied by George Shearing on piano, Oscar Pettiford on double bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums.

===1954–1959: Mercury years===

In 1953, Treadwell negotiated a contract for Vaughan with Mercury in which she would record commercial material for Mercury and jazz-oriented material for its subsidiary, EmArcy. She was paired with producer Bob Shad, and their working relationship yielded commercial and artistic success. Her debut recording session at Mercury took place in February 1954. She remained with Mercury through 1959. After recording for Roulette from 1960 to 1963, she returned to Mercury from 1964 to 1967.

Her commercial success at Mercury began with the 1954 hit &quot;Make Yourself Comfortable&quot;, recorded in the fall of 1954, and continued with &quot;How Important Can It Be&quot; (with Count Basie), &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;, &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot;, &quot;You Ought to Have a Wife&quot;, and &quot;Misty&quot;. Her commercial success peaked in 1959 with &quot;Broken Hearted Melody&quot;, a song she considered &quot;corny&quot; which nevertheless became her first gold record, and a regular part of her concert repertoire for years to come. Vaughan was reunited with Billy Eckstine for a series of duet recordings in 1957 that yielded the hit &quot;Passing Strangers&quot;. Her commercial recordings were handled by a number of arrangers and conductors, primarily Hugo Peretti and Hal Mooney.

The jazz &quot;track&quot; of her recording career proceeded apace, backed either by her working trio or combinations of jazz musicians. One of her favorite albums was a 1954 sextet date that included Clifford Brown.

In the latter half of the 1950s, she followed a schedule of almost non-stop touring. She was featured at the first Newport Jazz Festival in the summer of 1954 and starred in subsequent editions of that festival at Newport and in New York City for the remainder of her life. In the fall of 1954, she performed at Carnegie Hall with the Count Basie Orchestra on a bill that also included Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Lester Young and the Modern Jazz Quartet. That fall, she again toured Europe before embarking on a &quot;Big Show&quot; U.S. tour, a succession of performances that included Count Basie, George Shearing, Erroll Garner and Jimmy Rushing. At the 1955 New York Jazz Festival on Randalls Island, Vaughan shared the bill with the Dave Brubeck quartet, Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, and the Johnny Richards Orchestra.

Although the professional relationship between Vaughan and Treadwell was quite successful through the 1950s, their personal relationship finally reached a breaking point and she filed for a divorce in 1958. Vaughan had entirely delegated financial matters to Treadwell, and despite significant income figures reported through the 1950s, at the settlement Treadwell said that only $16,000 remained. The couple evenly divided the amount and their personal assets, terminating their business relationship.

She made her UK debut in 1958 on Sunday Night at the London Palladium with several songs including &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Last Laugh Now&quot;.

===1959–1969: Atkins and Roulette ===
The exit of Treadwell from Vaughan&#x27;s life was precipitated by the entry of Clyde &quot;C.B.&quot; Atkins, a man of uncertain background whom she had met in Chicago and married on September 4, 1958. Although Atkins had no experience in artist management or music, Vaughan wished to have a mixed professional and personal relationship like the one she had with Treadwell. She made Atkins her manager, although she was still feeling the sting of the problems she had with Treadwell and initially kept a closer eye on Atkins. Vaughan and Atkins moved into a house in Englewood, New Jersey.

When Vaughan&#x27;s contract with Mercury ended in late 1959, she signed on with Roulette, a small label owned by Morris Levy, who was one of the backers of Birdland, where she frequently appeared. She began recording for Roulette in April 1960, making a string of large ensemble albums arranged or conducted by Billy May, Jimmy Jones, Joe Reisman, Quincy Jones, Benny Carter, Lalo Schifrin, and Gerald Wilson. She had pop chart success in 1960 with &quot;Serenata&quot; on Roulette and &quot;Eternally&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Baby&quot;, a couple of residual tracks from her Mercury contract. She recorded &quot;After Hours&quot; (1961) with guitarist Mundell Lowe and double bassist George Duvivier and &quot;Sarah + 2&quot; (1962) with guitarist Barney Kessel and double bassist Joe Comfort.

In 1961, Vaughan and Atkins adopted a daughter, Deborah Lois Atkins, known professionally as Paris Vaughan. However, the relationship with Atkins proved difficult and violent. After several incidents, she filed for divorce in November 1963. She turned to two friends to help sort out the financial affairs of the marriage. Club owner John &quot;Preacher&quot; Wells, a childhood acquaintance, and Clyde &quot;Pumpkin&quot; Golden Jr. discovered that Atkins&#x27; gambling and spending had put Vaughan around $150,000 in debt. The Englewood house was seized by the IRS for nonpayment of taxes. Vaughan retained custody of their child and Golden took Atkins&#x27; place as Vaughan&#x27;s manager and lover for the remainder of the decade.

When her contract with Roulette ended in 1963, Vaughan returned to the more familiar confines of Mercury. In the summer of 1963, she went to Denmark with producer Quincy Jones to record &quot;Sassy Swings the Tivoli&quot;, an album of live performances with her trio. During the next year, she made her first appearance at the White House for President Lyndon Johnson and danced with the president afterwards. The Tivoli recording would be the brightest moment of her second stint with Mercury. Changing demographics and tastes in the 1960s left jazz musicians with shrinking audiences and inappropriate material. Although she retained a following large and loyal enough to maintain her career, the quality and quantity of her recorded output dwindled as her voice darkened and her skill remained undiminished. At the conclusion of her Mercury deal in 1967, she lacked a recording contract for the remainder of the decade.

===1970–1982: Fisher and Mainstream===
In 1971, at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, Marshall Fisher was a concession stand employee and fan when he was introduced to Sarah Vaughan. They were attracted to each other immediately. Fisher moved in with her in Los Angeles. Although he was white and seven years older, he got along with her friends and family. Although he had no experience in the music business, he became her road manager, then personal manager. But unlike other men and managers, Fisher was devoted to her and meticulously managed her career and treated her well. He wrote love poems to her.

In 1971, Bob Shad, who had worked with her as a producer at Mercury, asked her to record for his label, Mainstream, which he had founded after leaving Mercury. Breaking a four-year hiatus, Vaughan signed a contract with Mainstream and returned to the studio for &quot;A Time in My Life&quot;, a step away from jazz into pop music with songs by Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Marvin Gaye arranged by Ernie Wilkins. She didn&#x27;t complain about this eclectic change in direction, but she chose the material for her next album after admiring the work of Michel Legrand. He conducted an orchestra of over one hundred musicians for &quot;Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand&quot;, an album of compositions by Legrand with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. The songs brought some of the musicians to tears during the sessions. But Shad wanted a hit, and the album yielded none. She sang a version of the pop hit &quot;Rainy Days and Mondays&quot; by the Carpenters for &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, her first live album since 1963. &quot;Sarah Vaughan and the Jimmy Rowles Quintet&quot; (1974) was more experimental, containing free improvisation and some unconventional scatting.

&quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; was another attempt to increase sales by breaking into the pop music market. Vaughan disliked the songs and hated the album cover depicting a clown with an afro. She filed a lawsuit against Shad in 1975 on the belief that the cover was inconsistent with the formal, sophisticated image she projected on stage. She also contended that the album &quot;Sarah Vaughan: Live at the Holiday Inn Lesotho&quot; had an incorrect title and that Shad had been harming her career. Although she disliked the album, she liked the song &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; written by Stephen Sondheim for the musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. She learned it on piano, made many changes with the help of pianist Carl Schroeder, and it became her signature song.

In 1974, she performed music by George Gershwin at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The orchestra was conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, who was a fan of Vaughan and invited her to perform. Thomas and Vaughan repeated the performance with Thomas&#x27; home orchestra in Buffalo, New York, followed by appearances in 1975 and 1976 with other symphony orchestras in the United States.

After leaving Mainstream, she signed with Atlantic and worked on an album of songs by John Lennon and Paul McCartney that were arranged by Marty Paich and his son, David Paich of the rock band Toto. She was enthusiastic to be more involved in the making of an album, but Atlantic rejected it on the claim that it contained no hits. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how they can recognize hits in advance&quot;, she said. Atlantic canceled her contract. She said, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a damn about record companies any more.&quot;

===Rio and Norman Granz===
In 1977, filmmaker Thomas Guy followed Vaughan on tour to film the documentary &quot;Listen to the Sun&quot;. She traveled throughout South America: Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru. She was enamored of Brazil, as this was her third tour of Brazil in six years. In the documentary, she called the city of Rio &quot;the greatest place I think I&#x27;ve ever been on earth&quot;. Audiences were so enthusiastic that she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe they like me that much.&quot; After rejection by Atlantic, she wanted to try producing her own album of Brazilian music. She asked Aloísio de Oliveira to run the sessions and recorded &quot;I Love Brazil!&quot; with Milton Nascimento, Jose Roberto Bertrami, Dorival Caymmi, and Antonio Carlos Jobim.

She had an album but no label to release it, so she signed to Pablo run by Norman Granz. She had known Granz since 1948 when she performed on one of his Jazz at the Philharmonic tours. He was the record producer and manager for Ella Fitzgerald and the owner of Verve. After selling Verve, he started Pablo. He was dedicated to acoustic, mainstream jazz and had recorded Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Clark Terry. In 1978 he recorded Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;How Long Has This Been Going On?&quot;, a set of jazz standards with veteran jazz musicians Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Ray Brown, and Louis Bellson. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. Pablo released &quot;I Love Brazil!&quot; and it, too, was nominated for a Grammy.

===1982–1989: Late career===
In the summer of 1980, she received a plaque on 52nd Street outside the CBS Building (Black Rock) commemorating the jazz clubs she had once frequented on &quot;Swing Street&quot; and which had long since been replaced with office buildings. A performance of her symphonic Gershwin program with the New Jersey Symphony in 1980 was broadcast on PBS and won her an Emmy Award the next year for Individual Achievement, Special Class. She was reunited in 1982 with Tilson Thomas for a modified version of the Gershwin program, played again by the Los Angeles Philharmonic but this time in its home hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; the CBS recording of the concert &quot;Gershwin Live!&quot; won a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female.

After the end of her contract with Pablo in 1982, she committed to a limited number of studio recordings. She made a guest appearance in 1984 on Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;2:00 AM Paradise Cafe&quot;, an album of pastiche compositions with established jazz musicians. In 1984, she participated in &quot;The Planet is Alive, Let It Live&quot; a symphonic piece composed by Tito Fontana and Sante Palumbo on Italian translations of Polish poems by Karol Wojtyla, better known as Pope John Paul II. The recording was made in Germany with an English translation by writer Gene Lees and was released by Lees on his private label after the recording was rejected by the major labels.

In 1985 Vaughan reconnected with her longstanding, continually growing European audience during a celebratory concert at the Chatelet Theater in Paris. Released posthumously on the Justin Time label, &quot;In the City of Lights&quot; is a two-disc recording of the concert, which covers the highlights of Vaughan&#x27;s career while capturing a beloved singer at the height of her powers. Thanks in part to the hard-swinging telepathic support of pianist Frank Collett (who answers each of her challenges then coaxes the same from her), Sarah reprises Tad Dameron&#x27;s &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot; with uncommon power, her breathstream effecting a seamless connection between chorus and bridge. For the Gershwin Medley, drummer Harold Jones swaps his brushes for sticks to match energy and forcefulness that does not let up until the last of many encores. On June 16, 1985, Vaughan appeared at the Playboy Jazz Festival.

In 1986, Vaughan sang &quot;Happy Talk&quot; and &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; in the role of Bloody Mary on a studio recording by Kiri Te Kanawa and José Carreras of the score of the Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;, while sitting on the studio floor. Vaughan&#x27;s final album was &quot;Brazilian Romance&quot;, produced by Sérgio Mendes with songs by Milton Nascimento and Dori Caymmi. It was recorded primarily in the early part of 1987 in New York and Detroit. In 1988, she contributed vocals to an album of Christmas carols recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with the Utah Symphony Orchestra and sold in Hallmark Cards stores. In 1989, Quincy Jones&#x27; album &quot;Back on the Block&quot; included Vaughan in a brief scatting duet with Ella Fitzgerald. This was her final studio recording. It was her only studio recording with Fitzgerald in a career that had begun 46 years earlier opening for Fitzgerald at the Apollo.

The video &quot;Sarah Vaughan Live from Monterey&quot; was taped in 1983 or 1984 with her trio and guest soloists. &quot;Sass and Brass&quot; was taped in 1986 in New Orleans with guests Dizzy Gillespie and Maynard Ferguson. &quot;Sarah Vaughan: The Divine One&quot; was part of the &quot;American Masters&quot; series on PBS. Also in 1986, on Independence Day in a program nationally televised on PBS she performed with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, in a medley of songs composed by George Gershwin.

==Death==
In 1989, Vaughan&#x27;s health began to decline, although she rarely revealed any hints of this in her performances. She canceled a series of engagements in Europe in 1989, citing the need to seek treatment for arthritis of the hand, although she was able to complete a series of performances in Japan. During a run at New York&#x27;s Blue Note Jazz Club in 1989, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and was too ill to finish the last day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances.

Vaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. She grew weary of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where at the age of 66 she died on the evening of April 3, 1990, while watching &quot;Laker Girls&quot;, a television movie featuring her daughter.

Her funeral was held at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. Following the ceremony, a horse-drawn carriage transported her body to Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield.

==Vocal commentary==
Parallels have been drawn between Vaughan&#x27;s voice and those of opera singers. Jazz singer Betty Carter said that with training Vaughan could have &quot;gone as far as Leontyne Price.&quot; Bob James, Vaughan&#x27;s musical director in the 1960s said that &quot;the instrument was there. But the knowledge, the legitimacy of that whole world were not for her ... But if the aria were in Sarah&#x27;s range she could bring something to it that a classically trained singer could not.&quot;

In a chapter devoted to Vaughan in his book &quot;Visions of Jazz&quot; (2000), critic Gary Giddins described her as the &quot;ageless voice of modern jazz – of giddy postwar virtuosity, biting wit and fearless caprice&quot;. He concluded by saying that &quot;No matter how closely we dissect the particulars of her talent ... we must inevitably end up contemplating in silent awe the most phenomenal of her attributes, the one she was handed at birth, the voice that happens once in a lifetime, perhaps once in several lifetimes.&quot;

Her obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as a &quot;singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz.&quot; Jazz singer Mel Tormé said that she had &quot;the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field.&quot; Her ability was envied by Frank Sinatra who said, &quot;Sassy is so good now that when I listen to her I want to cut my wrists with a dull razor.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John S. Wilson said in 1957 that she possessed &quot;what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.&quot; It was close to its peak until shortly before her death at the age of 66. Late in life, she retained a &quot;youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre&quot; and was capable of the projection of coloratura passages described as &quot;delicate and ringingly high&quot;.

Vaughan had a large vocal range of soprano through a female baritone, exceptional body, volume, a variety of vocal textures, and superb and highly personal vocal control. Her ear and sense of pitch were almost perfect, and there were no difficult intervals.

In her later years, her voice was described as a &quot;burnished contralto&quot; and as her voice deepened with age her lower register was described as having &quot;shades from a gruff baritone into a rich, juicy contralto&quot;. Her use of her contralto register was likened to &quot;dipping into a deep, mysterious well to scoop up a trove of buried riches.&quot; Musicologist Henry Pleasants noted, &quot;Vaughan who sings easily down to a contralto low D, ascends to a pure and accurate [soprano] high C.&quot;

Vaughan&#x27;s vibrato was described as &quot;an ornament of uniquely flexible size, shape and duration,&quot; as well as &quot;voluptuous&quot; and &quot;heavy.&quot; Vaughan was accomplished in her ability to &quot;fray&quot; or &quot;bend&quot; notes at the extremities of her vocal range. It was noted in a 1972 performance of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Where Is Love?&quot; that &quot;In mid-tune she began twisting the song, swinging from the incredible cello tones of her bottom register, skyrocketing to the wispy pianissimos of her top.&quot;

She held a microphone in live performance, using its placement as part of her performance. Her placings of the microphone allowed her to complement her volume and vocal texture, often holding the microphone at arm&#x27;s length and moving it to alter her volume.

She frequently used the song &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; to demonstrate her vocal abilities in live performance. The performance was called a &quot;three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Singers influenced by Vaughan include Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade, and Rickie Lee Jones. Singers Carmen McRae and Dianne Reeves both recorded tribute albums to Vaughan following her death; &quot;&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan&quot; (2001) respectively.

Though usually considered a jazz singer, Vaughan avoided classifying herself as one. She discussed the term in a 1982 interview for &quot;Down Beat&quot;:
I don&#x27;t know why people call me a jazz singer, though I guess people associate me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I&#x27;m not putting jazz down, but I&#x27;m not a jazz singer ... I&#x27;ve recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I&#x27;m either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can&#x27;t sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing &#x27;Send In the Clowns&#x27; and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.
Vaughan mentioned Judy Garland as major vocal influence in a 1969 interview for the Los Angeles Times:

&quot;Judy Garland was the singer I most wanted to sound like then, not to copy, but to get some of her soul and purity. A wonderful young voice.&quot;

==Personal life==
Vaughan was married three times: to George Treadwell (1946–1958), to Clyde Atkins (1958–1961), and to Waymon Reed (1978–1981). Unable to bear children of her own, Vaughan adopted a baby girl (Debra Lois) in 1961. Debra worked in the 1980s and 1990s as an actress under the name Paris Vaughan. As a result of her daughter&#x27;s marriage, Vaughan was the mother-in-law of former NHL star Russ Courtnall.

In 1977, Vaughan ended her personal and professional relationship with Marshall Fisher. Although Fisher is occasionally referenced as Vaughan&#x27;s third husband, they were never legally married. Vaughan began a relationship with Waymon Reed, a trumpet player 16 years her junior who was playing with the Count Basie band. Reed joined her working trio as a musical director and trumpet player and became her third husband in 1978.

She was a member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

==Awards and honors==
The album &quot;Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown&quot; and the single &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot; were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and have &quot;qualitative or historical significance.&quot; In 1985 she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 1988 she was inducted into the American Jazz Hall of Fame.

In 1978, she was given an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Berklee College of Music. Howard University presented Vaughan with an Honorary Doctorate of Music in 1982. Sarah Lois Vaughan | Howard University Office of the Secretary

In 2012, she was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In 2004–2006, New Jersey Transit paid tribute to Vaughan in the design of its Newark Light Rail stations. Passengers stopping at any station on this line can read the lyrics to &quot;Body and Soul&quot; along the edge of the station platform.

She was given the George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at the UCLA Spring Sing.

In 2003, San Francisco and Berkeley, California, made by proclamations March 27 Sarah Lois Vaughan Day.

===Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition===
The James Moody Jazz Festival hosts an annual jazz vocalist competition named for Vaughan. The Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition is also known as the SASSY Awards for Vaughan&#x27;s nickname.

==In popular culture==
Sarah Vaughan was portrayed by Pamela McPherson-Cornelius in season two, episode six of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Deuce&quot;.

<text>Venezolana Internacional de Aviación Sociedad Anónima (), or VIASA for short, was the Venezuelan flag carrier airline between 1960 and 1997. It was headquartered in the Torre Viasa in Caracas. Launched in , it was nationalised in 1975 due to financial problems, and re-privatised in 1991, with the major stake going to Iberia. The company ceased operations in , and went into liquidation.

==History==

===Early years===
Viasa was envisioned by the government of Venezuela in 1959 to create a new company that could serve as the country&#x27;s flag carrier and run without government intervention. It was set up in 1960 when the international routes operated by Línea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) and Avensa were merged and taken over by the newly created carrier. The government contributed with 55% of the capital, while private investors – among which were LAV and Avensa, the latter owned by Grupo Boulton and Pan American World Airways—contributed with the remainder. The board of directors came entirely from the private sector. The first president of the airline was Mr. R. van den Branden; the first chairman of the board was Mr. Oscar Augusto Machado Zuloaga, a very competent and well liked gentleman, who was instrumental in Viasa&#x27;s commercial success and immediate acceptance by the market.

In early 1961, the airline signed an agreement with KLM to operate a Douglas DC-8 on Viasa&#x27;s behalf, aimed at starting operations to Europe in April that year; KLM maintained a nurturing relationship with Viasa for another 24 years. In the same year, Avensa transferred two Douglas DC-6Bs to the company, as well as an order for a Convair 880-22M. Viasa boosted their Convair 880 order by purchasing another one. The airline flew the type mostly on routes to North America. Also in 1961, the airline joined the International Air Transport Association, becoming its 89th member. In 1963, Viasa started a commercial agreement with Iberia and KLM for operations through the mid-Atlantic. The same year, a third Convair 880 was ordered. Until the first DC-8-50 the company had ordered in early 1965 was delivered, long-haul services using the type were provided with wet-leased aircraft from KLM. The type was also chartered from KLM for deployment on the Caribbean routes. By , the first DC-8-50 was already forming part of the company&#x27;s fleet along with the three Convair 880s, while an additional DC-8-50 was on order. To complement these two DC-8-50s, the carrier ordered two Douglas DC-8-63s in early 1967. Two Convair 880s were sold to Cathay Pacific in mid-1967. Also in 1967, Viasa started up a Panamanian airline named &quot;Panameña Internacional de Aviación SA&quot; (PAISA), with KLM support; This company began operations on 3 May 1967 with two DC-9-10s leased to VIASA from Avensa, which were in turn sub-leased to PAISA. In 1968, VIASA set up a wholly owned, non-IATA member, national cargo airline named &quot;Transportes Aereos de Carga SA&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Transcarga&quot;, which in its beginnings served Caracas, Curaçao, Maracaibo, Miami and New York.
In March 1970, the Government of Venezuela had a majority stake (55%) in the carrier, while the balance was held by private investors. Viasa&#x27;s fleet strength at this time was eight: two DC-8-63s, two DC-8-50s, a DC-8-50F, a Convair 880, and two DC-9-10s. In Viasa renewed the pool agreement with KLM and Iberia on their Caribbean–Europe services; to this purpose the company signed another agreement with the Dutch company in 1972, this time for the lease of a Boeing 747-200B that was put on service on a weekly round-trip Caracas–Madrid–Paris flight in . This event was a milestone for Viasa, as it became the first South American carrier to operate wide-body aircraft across the Atlantic. Through KLM, the company also placed an order for two McDonnell Douglas DC-10s the same year, and bought two Douglas DC-8-33s from the Dutch carrier as well. Also in 1972, the route network saw the incorporation of Washington and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

With the lease of a Douglas DC-8-50 from KLM in 1974, and the sale of two aircraft of the same type to Aeroperú the same year, by the Viasa&#x27;s fleet consisted of two DC-8-63s, one DC-8-50, two DC-8-30s, and one DC-10-30, while another DC-10-30 was yet to be delivered. At a cost of , another DC-10-30 was ordered in 1976, followed by an order for three more of these aircraft in .

In 1983, Viasa took delivery of two McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Super 80s. The early 1980s marked an overturn in the carrier&#x27;s finances, as both the worldwide collapse of oil prices in the decade and the subsequent devaluation of the bolivar since 1983 affected the airline, which suffered a 41% drop in year-on-year traffic in 1983 and had accumulated a debt of VEB210 million in 1984, a year in which the carrier had a negative net value. That year, the crisis forced the company&#x27;s work force to be cut by 30%, the fleet to be reduced (partly because of noise restrictions within the United States), and some Caribbean destinations to be dropped. Likewise, competition increased on some routes, most notably Miami and New York, where Viasa was the erstwhile sole operator or it had a single competitor at most. Nevertheless, Viasa made an operating profit of VEB125 million (US$4 million) and a net profit of VEB97 million in 1986. In early 1988, the fleet consisted of only five DC-10s, and two Airbus A300s acquired from Lufthansa through a leasing agreement, that were deployed mostly on domestic and regional routes. A Caracas–Havana service was launched in 1989, along with a stopover in São Paulo on the Caracas–Rio de Janeiro route. In March 1990, Viasa&#x27;s fleet consisted of two Airbus A300B4s, one DC-8-61HF, and five DC-10-30s, and was wholly owned by the Venezuelan government. At this time, it served a network radiating from Barcelona, Caracas, Maracaibo and Porlamar to Amsterdam, Aruba, Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Curaçao, Frankfurt, Houston, Lima, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Miami, Milan, New York, Oporto, Paris, Quito, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, Santo Domingo, San Juan and Zürich. Toronto and Vancouver were served on a seasonal basis.

===Nationalisation===

Viasa had been a model of good management and it had returned a profit every year since its creation. Viasa posted its first ever loss for the October 1975 – September 1976 fiscal year, plagued by rising fuel costs and union problems. The government nationalised the airline and began its downturn. This was not noticeable at first, since Venezuela&#x27;s strong economy was backed by high oil revenue and the government did not mind pumping in money to cover mounting losses.

By 1979, Viasa had built a fleet of 6 DC-10-30s, 2 DC-8-63s, 2 DC-8-53s and 1 DC-8-63F.

In the summer of 1982, Viasa leased a couple of MD-82s from KLM for Caribbean routes and for new flights from Barquisimeto, Barcelona and Porlamar to Miami. These were returned to KLM in 1984.

In 1985, Viasa got rid of all its DC-8s plus one DC-10-30 and kept just five DC-10-30s. It revamped its livery almost completely in 1986, adopting a whiter body with three-tone blue cheatlines under the windows. The orange tail retained the white Viasa letters adopted in 1978 with the arrival of DC-10-30 YV-135C.

Two former Lufthansa Airbus A300-B4 jets were leased from GPA in 1987 for United States and South American services. In the same year, for the first time ever, VIASA began domestic services and made use of empty seats on the Caracas-Maracaibo and Caracas-Porlamar routes.

===Privatisation===

The red ink continued to flow and, with the new government policies adopted in 1989, Viasa became a target for privatisation. The initial plans of the government were to allocate 60% of the company to private investors, keep 20% of the shares, and transfer the balance to the airline workers. In , Iberia and KLM were approved as bidders in the privatisation process, the former teaming up with Venezuela&#x27;s Banco Provincial, and the latter partnering with Northwest Airlines and other four local entities. Iberia was the only bidder left with a  million offer, after KLM stepped aside citing that a price of  million for 60% of the shares was too high.

Iberia apparently milked the airline (some Venezuelans point at this as one of Viasa&#x27;s causes of bankruptcy). While it could be argued that it was not wise to sell a government owned leasing company to another government owned leasing company, changing the old ways of Viasa was an uphill battle. 
All its aircraft were placed under Iberia&#x27;s ownership, the Airbuses were sent back to GPA, former Iberia 727s were used by Viasa (competing on the US routes versus American&#x27;s 757s or A300-600s and United&#x27;s 757s) and all supplies were purchased centrally through Madrid.

Short of liquidity, Viasa ceased operations on . Operations came to a halt following the pilots and cabin crew staff rejecting a restructuring plan raised by Iberia and the state-run holding company that had a 40% interest in Viasa at that time, with both consortiums refusing to inject more cash into the airline. Shareholders, with Iberia being the major one having 45% of the stakes at the time, later decided to liquidate the carrier. Viasa&#x27;s routes were divided between Aeropostal, Avensa and Aserca.

==Destinations==

Following is a list of destinations Viasa flew to as part of its scheduled destinations.

===Livery===
The airline&#x27;s livery consisted of silver on the belly, white on the top part of the fuselage color, with orange and blue cheatlines that went all the way to the start of the tail. The fuselage featured the name &quot;Viasa&quot; written in orange on top of the cheatlines. The tail was all orange, with the name Viasa in white. After Iberia took over, all the fuselage went white, and so did the tail. The cheatlines were made thicker around the plane&#x27;s cockpit, to resemble Iberia&#x27;s planes.

==Accidents and incidents==
According to Aviation Safety Network, Viasa experienced five accidents/incidents events throughout its history, with two of them being deadly ones, yielding a combined death toll of 216 fatalities, plus a hijacking episode. The two deadly accidents occurred with leased aircraft. Following is a list of the events that carried with the hull-loss of the aircraft involved. The worst accident experienced by the company, and also the worst aviation disaster at the time it took place, occurred in , and killed all 84 occupants of the aircraft plus 71 people on the ground.

<doc id="167039" wikidata="Q887772" url="?curid=167039" title="Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans">
<text>Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans was an early 1960s vocal group produced by Phil Spector, and was initially conceived as a vehicle for the lead vocals of Bobby Sheen, who took the stage name Bob B. Soxx. The Blue Jeans were backing vocalists Darlene Love and Fanita James, both of whom were also members of the girl group the Blossoms.

==Career==
Despite Sheen&#x27;s status as group leader, by the time the trio entered the recording studio, Spector was often using Love as the group&#x27;s primary vocalist. Sheen sang lead on the group&#x27;s first hit, 1962&#x27;s &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; (originally from the 1946 Disney movie &quot;Song of the South&quot;). Love, meanwhile, handled the lead vocals on the follow-up single, 1963&#x27;s &quot;Why Do Lovers Break Each Other&#x27;s Heart&quot;. Sheen and Love shared lead vocal duties on the final single, &quot;Not Too Young to Get Married&quot;.

Sheen and Love shared vocal duties on the only album the group ever recorded, &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; (1963).

Sheen can be heard as lead vocalist on the group&#x27;s final recordings, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot;, two tracks on the Spector-produced album, &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector&quot; (1963), on which Love also appears as a solo artist. On the cover of this album, a group portrait shows Sheen with two Blue Jeans vocalists (actually two more Spector session singers, Lillian Washington and future Honey Cone member Carolyn Willis, who toured with Sheen as the Blue Jeans, although both Love and James continued as the Blue Jeans in the recording studio).

After 1963, the group was dropped by Philles Records and effectively ceased to exist. Sheen went back to using his real name, recorded some tracks for Capitol Records in the mid-1960s, and later joined a touring version of the Coasters, which featured original bass singer Bobby Nunn. Sheen had previously been a member of the Robins, joining in 1957. Love recorded a few solo hits, but, more memorably, was the lead vocalist on at least two hit records by the Crystals. It is also established that Sheen, Love, and James (with the rest of the Blossoms) were the voices on the Crystals&#x27; hits &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love&quot;.

<text>A bitstream format is the format of the data found in a stream of bits used in a digital communication or data storage application. The term typically refers to the data format of the output of an encoder, or the data format of the input to a decoder when using data compression.

== Processing ==
Standardized interoperability specifications such as the video coding standards produced by the MPEG and the ITU-T, and the audio coding standards produced by the MPEG, often specify only the bitstream format and the decoding process. This allows encoder implementations to use any methods whatsoever that produce bitstreams which conform to the specified bitstream format.

Normally, decoding of a bitstream can be initiated without having to start from the beginning of a file, or the beginning of the data transmission. Some bitstreams are designed for this to occur, for example by using indexes or key frames.

Uses of &quot;bit stream decoders&quot; (BSD):
* Graphics processing unit (GPU)
* H.264/MPEG-4 AVC
* Unified Video Decoder (UVD) the video decoding bit-stream technology from ATI Technologies/AMD
* PureVideo the video decoding bit-stream technology from Nvidia
* Quick Sync Video the video decoding and encoding bit-stream technology from Intel

<text>Bruce &amp; Terry was an American rock music duo from Los Angeles that was active from 1963 to 1965. Consisting of Columbia Records staff producers Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher, the pair recorded under a variety of names, and most notably with the band the Rip Chords. After 1965, Johnston and Melcher reduced their collaborations together, but both producers continued to occasionally contribute to tracks by the Beach Boys, including on the albums &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), &quot;Still Cruisin&#x27;&quot; (1989), and &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; (1992).

==History==
Johnston was a session musician and Melcher had a minor solo career as &quot;Terry Day&quot; before becoming the youngest staff record producer in Columbia Records&#x27; history. In 1963, they began recording together and helped produce the album &quot;Surfin&#x27; Round the World&quot;.

While producing a &quot;surf-frat&quot; band called the Rip Chords, whose &quot;Here I Stand&quot; had reached No. 51 in early 1963, they ended up vocal arranging and singing all of the vocal parts on the band&#x27;s hit &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot; in 1964. The song was the first in a series of hit singles (most of which were released under the name &quot;Bruce &amp; Terry&quot;), reaching No. 4 on the U.S. pop charts.

The duo virtually disbanded when Johnston joined The Beach Boys, singing on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and performing with them well into the 21st century, while Melcher became a full-time producer. The two occasionally worked on projects together until Melcher died at 62, after a long battle with melanoma, on November 19, 2004.

<doc id="167046" wikidata="Q309063" url="?curid=167046" title="The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air">
<text>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is an American television sitcom created by Andy and Susan Borowitz that aired on NBC from September 10, 1990, to May 20, 1996. The series stars Will Smith as a fictionalized version of himself, a street-smart teenager born and raised in West Philadelphia who is sent to live with his wealthy uncle and aunt in Bel-Air, Los Angeles, where his lifestyle often clashes with that of his upper-class relatives.

The series was considered Will Smith&#x27;s star vehicle into television, and later his film career. &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; was a top hit for NBC, running for 148 episodes over six seasons. A reunion special/retrospective reuniting the surviving cast debuted on HBO Max in November 2020. A more dramatic reimagining of the series, titled &quot;Bel-Air&quot; and based on the fan film of the same name, was given a two-season order for Peacock, and released on February 13, 2022.

Will Smith and James Avery were the only actors to have appeared in all 148 episodes of the television sitcom.

== Summary ==

The theme song and opening sequence set the premise of the show. Will Smith is a street-smart African-American teenager, &quot;born and raised&quot; in West Philadelphia. While playing street basketball, Will accidentally hits a group of young people with the ball, causing a confrontation that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his wealthy aunt and uncle in the opulent neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles.

Will&#x27;s working class background ends up clashing in various humorous ways with the upper class world of the Banks family – Will&#x27;s stern uncle Phil and tough but fair aunt Vivian and their children, Will&#x27;s cousins: spoiled Hilary, pompous Carlton, impressionable Ashley and baby Nicky (introduced in season 3), as well as their sarcastic butler Geoffrey.

== Cast and characters ==

The show is notable for having a heavy celebrity guest presence, with more than forty celebrities guest starring throughout the series. Seasons 1 and 6 had the highest celebrity participation, with over 10 celebrity guest stars each.


== Episodes ==

== Development ==

In 1989, music manager Benny Medina, along with his business partner, real estate mogul Jeff Pollack, decided to market a TV story based on Medina&#x27;s life. Medina had grown up poor in East Los Angeles but his life changed when he befriended a rich white teenager, whose family lived in Beverly Hills and allowed Medina to live with them. Medina decided to use this part of his life as the main focus of the show. However, given that by then a black character living with a white family was a concept that had been done multiple times on TV, Medina decided to change the rich white family to a rich black family. &quot;That way we could explore black-on-black prejudice as well as black class differences&quot;, Medina said in an interview for &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine.

Medina pitched the idea to Quincy Jones, who had just signed a development deal with Warner Bros. Television. Jones was impressed by the idea and arranged a meeting with NBC chief Brandon Tartikoff. Will Smith was well known at the time as one-half of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, which had put him on the mainstream radar, but he had come into debt after failing to pay taxes. At the suggestion of his then-girlfriend, Smith went to a taping of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; where he met Medina by chance. Medina pitched the idea to Smith, but Smith was reluctant, having never acted before. Medina invited Smith to meet Jones at a party that Jones was throwing at his house in December 1989. There, Jones handed Smith a script for a failed Morris Day pilot that he had produced and challenged Smith to audition for Tartikoff on the spot. Smith did so, and the first contract for the show was drawn up that night in a limo outside.

Andy Borowitz and his wife, Susan, are credited as the series&#x27; creators. Andy Borowitz, who was on a contract with NBC, was selected by Tartikoff to write the pilot. He based Will&#x27;s cousins on Quincy Jones&#x27;s daughters, and named Carlton after his friend Carlton Cuse. In 2015, he remarked that &quot;it was written and taped in about three weeks, start to finish, and somehow it worked. It was just an explosion of really good luck.&quot;

The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990. Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May 1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996, and aired on Monday, May 20, 1996.

The theme song &quot;Yo Home to Bel Air&quot; was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, The Fresh Prince. The music was composed by Quincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.

In seasons 1, 5 and 6, the credits would be played over still frames from the episode that aired and was accompanied by an instrumental version of the main theme that played in the background. In seasons 2–4, the music and stills were dropped, and the credits were now played over bloopers from the episode.

== Crossovers and other appearances ==
During the fall 1991–1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (&quot;Blossom&quot; aired immediately after &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in the &quot;Blossom&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band&quot; as himself under his rap stage name, The Fresh Prince. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in the &quot;Blossom&quot; episode &quot;Wake Up Little Suzy&quot; as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcom &quot;Out All Night&quot; as Hilary.

James Avery had a short cameo as &quot;the father from Fresh Prince&quot; on &quot;Family Matters&quot;, at the end of the episode &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot;. He appears during the credits in a blooper scene where he surprises Reginald VelJohnson on set.

&quot;In the House&quot; and &quot;Fresh Prince&quot; were both executive-produced by Winifred Hervey (who served as the latter series&#x27; showrunner for its second and third seasons), David Salzman and Quincy Jones. During the second season&#x27;s first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as their &quot;Fresh Prince&quot; characters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode &quot;Dog Catchers&quot;. Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode &quot;Love on a One-Way Street&quot;.

Following &quot;Fresh Prince&quot;″s conclusion, Ribeiro joined the principal cast of &quot;In the House&quot; for its third season as Dr. Maxwell Stanton, who had personality traits similar to those of Carlton. In the season 4 episode &quot;My Pest Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (the second Vivian Banks) guest starred as Stanton&#x27;s parents. Joseph Marcell, Geoffrey Butler on &quot;Fresh Prince&quot;, appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.

== Syndication ==
The series was produced by the Stuffed Dog Company and Quincy Jones Entertainment (later Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment in 1993) in association with NBC Productions.

In 1994, the series&#x27; distribution rights were picked up by Warner Bros., which continues to hold those rights to this day.

== Home media ==
Warner Home Video has released the complete series, seasons 1 to 6, on DVD in Region 1. Seasons 1 to 4 have been released in Regions 2 and 4. Seasons 5 to 6 have been released in Region 2 in Germany, and in the complete series boxset in the United Kingdom.

== Awards and nominations ==

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
&quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;&#x27;s success is considered to be a watershed moment for hip-hop and black television, with many publications referring to it as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Professor Andrew Horton stated: &quot;Smith&#x27;s genre of comedy, popularized on the sitcom &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, translated well into commercial box-office appeal. &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; watered down and capitalized upon the then growing popularity of hip-hop and almost anticipated its dominance on the American scene&quot;.

Author Willie Tolliver noted: &quot;What &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; did accomplish was to put Smith and his character Will into an environment of affluence and possibility, thus changing the terms of his own Black identity. This social and cultural mobility is central to Smith&#x27;s racial significance, and this will become evident again and again; he moves the image of the Black male into unaccustomed spaces just as Smith himself was in the process of conquering Hollywood.&quot;

== Reboot series ==
On August 13, 2015, it was reported that a reboot of the show was in development by Overbrook Entertainment, with Will Smith serving as a producer. In August 2016, during a promotional interview with the E! television network for his then upcoming film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, Smith denied that a reboot was in development, saying that it would happen &quot;...pretty close to when Hell freezes over.”

In 2019, a mock trailer titled &quot;Bel-Air&quot; was uploaded on YouTube, written and directed by Morgan Cooper, for a darker, more dramatic re-imagining of the sitcom. Will Smith subsequently heavily praised the fan film, commenting that &quot;Morgan did a ridiculous trailer for &quot;Bel-Air&quot;. Brilliant idea, the dramatic version of &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; for the next generation&quot;, expressing interest in expanding the idea beyond the short film into a full &quot;Bel-Air&quot; reboot series.

In August 2020, it was announced that Will Smith and Morgan Cooper would be developing a reboot of the series based on Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Bel-Air&quot;. The series had reportedly been in the works for over a year since Cooper posted his &quot;Bel-Air&quot; trailer on YouTube, with Netflix, Peacock and HBO Max all currently bidding for the series. On September 8, 2020, Peacock gave &quot;Bel-Air&quot; a two-season order, with the series produced by and copyrighted to Universal Television. In September 2021, the full cast was announced with newcomer Jabari Banks cast as Will Smith, Adrian Holmes as Philip Banks, Cassandra Freeman as Vivian Banks, Olly Sholotan as Carlton Banks, Coco Jones as Hilary Banks, Akira Akbar as Ashley Banks, Jimmy Akingbola as Geoffrey, Jordan L. Jones as Jazz and Simone Joy Jones as Lisa. The series premiered in February 2022.

== Reunion ==
Much of the cast virtually reunited over a video call in an episode of Smith&#x27;s Snapchat reality series &quot;Will From Home&quot; that premiered in April 2020. A reunion of the surviving original cast, &quot;The Fresh Prince Reunion&quot;, aired on HBO Max in November 2020. Among other reminisces, Janet Hubert appeared, also appearing around this time in a joint radio interview with Smith where the two reconcile. More information and context were offered regarding the situation between Smith and Hubert and her exit when the two met for their conversation. Hubert discussed the turmoil in her personal life, her abusive marriage and that she had not actually been fired by the show. She was offered what she described as a &quot;bad deal&quot; to return for the fourth season and she turned it down. Smith talked about how grappling with his rapidly increasing fame at such a young age led him to make decisions during that time that he now regrets and wishes he had made differently. The reunion show also features a tribute to James Avery, who died in 2013, that was shown to the surviving cast. The tribute brought the entire cast to tears.

<text>Henry II (13 January 1334 – 29 May 1379), called Henry of Trastámara or the Fratricidal (&quot;el Fratricida&quot;), was the first King of Castile and León from the House of Trastámara. He became king in 1369 by defeating his half-brother Peter the Cruel, after numerous rebellions and battles. As king he was involved in the Fernandine Wars and the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

== Biography ==
Henry was the fourth of ten illegitimate children of King Alfonso XI of Castile and Eleanor de Guzmán, a great-granddaughter of Alfonso IX of León. He was born a twin to Fadrique Alfonso, Lord of Haro, and was the first boy born to the couple that survived to adulthood.

At birth, he was adopted by Rodrigo Álvarez de las Asturias. Rodrigo died the following year and Henry inherited his lordship of Noreña. His father later made him Count of Trastámara and lord over Lemos and Sarria in Galicia, and the towns of Cabrera and Ribera, which constituted a large and important heritage in the northwest of the peninsula. It made him the head of the new Trastámara dynasty, arising from the main branch of Burgundy-Ivrea.

While Alfonso XI lived, his lover Eleanor gave a great many titles and privileges to their sons. This caused discontent among many of the noblemen and in particular the queen, Maria of Portugal, and her son, Peter.

They had a chance for revenge when Alfonso XI died unexpectedly from a fever in the siege of Gibraltar in March, 1350. They pushed Eleanor, her sons and their supporters aside, and Henry and his brothers fled and scattered. They were fearful of what their brother, King Peter, could do to them. The late king had not even been buried.

Although Eleanor and her sons reached an agreement with Peter to live peacefully in his court, the situation remained unstable. Henry and his brothers Fadrique, Tello and Sancho staged numerous rebellions against the new king. Also, to strengthen his position and gain allies, Henry married Juana Manuel, the daughter of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, adelantado mayor of Murcia and Lord of Villena, the most prosperous nobleman of the realm. In 1351, the King took counsel from Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, María of Portugal&#x27;s right-hand man. He became convinced that his father&#x27;s lover was the instigator of the uprisings, so he ordered Eleanor to be incarcerated and finally executed in Talavera de la Reina.

After that, Henry fled to Portugal. He was pardoned by Pedro and returned to Castile, then revolted in Asturias in 1352. He reconciled with his brother, only to rebel against him again in a long, intermittent war, which ended with Henry&#x27;s flight to France, where he entered the service of John II of France.

Shortly after, Henry and his men spent time in Peter IV of Aragon&#x27;s army in their war against Castile (1358). During that conflict, he was defeated and held prisoner in Nájera (1360). He was liberated (with the help of Juan Ramírez de Arellano, among others) and exiled himself to France once more.

Then Peter IV of Aragon attacked Castile again. Henry agreed to help him on condition that he would lend his support to destroying his half-brother. This became the Castilian Civil War. The attack combined Henry&#x27;s Castillian allies, the Aragonese and the French (a company of Bertrand du Guesclin&#x27;s mercenaries, expelled by Peter of Castile, who had taken refuge in Guyenne). Henry was proclaimed king in Calahorra (1366). In return, he had to reward his allies with titles and riches for the help they had provided. This earned him the nickname &quot;el de las mercedes&quot; (&quot;mercedes&quot; being Spanish for &quot;mercies&quot;).

Peter of Castile fled north to Bordeaux, the capital of the English dominions in France, where Edward, the Black Prince held court. Edward agreed to help Peter recover his throne. Despite the fact that the army suffered so badly from dysentery that it is said that one out of every five Englishmen would not return home, on 3 April 1367 an Anglo-Gascon army, led by Edward and his younger brother, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, met the Castilian forces (supported by French mercenaries under Bertrand du Guesclin). Peter then defeated Henry in the Battle of Nájera, but Henry escaped and returned to France under the protection of Charles V of France. King Peter and Prince Edward parted ways over the funding of the expedition, and the Black Prince returned to Bordeaux, having contracted an illness on this expedition that would ail him until his death in 1376.

They reorganised their army at Peyrepertuse Castle. Then, with the help of many Castilian rebels and Bertrand du Guesclin&#x27;s Frenchmen, they defeated Peter at the Battle of Montiel on 14 March 1369. Henry killed &quot;the Cruel King&quot;, now a prisoner, with his own hand. This definitively won him the Castilian throne and the name of Henry II.

Before being consolidated in his throne and being able to hand on power to his son John, Henry had to defeat Ferdinand I of Portugal. He embarked on the three Ferdinand Wars. Ferdinand&#x27;s main ally in these wars was John of Gaunt, the husband of Peter&#x27;s daughter Constance. Henry was allied with Charles V of France. He put the Castilian navy at Charles&#x27; disposal and they played a key part in the siege of La Rochelle, and the Battle of La Rochelle where the admiral Ambrosio Boccanegra completely defeated the English side.

Henry recompensed his allies, but he still had to defend his interests in the kingdom of Castile and León. Consequently, he denied the King of Aragon the territories that he had promised him in the difficult times.

Henry then went to war against Portugal and England in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. For most of his reign he had to fight off the attempts of John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III of England, to claim the Castilian throne in right of Constance. In his domestic policy he started to rebuild the kingdom, sped up the transformation of the royal administration; and held numerous courts. He also permanently set up the Lordship of Biscay after the death of his brother Tello. In foreign policy, he favoured France over England.

He died on 29 May 1379 in Santo Domingo de la Calzada. His son John I of Castile succeeded him on the throne.

== Policy regarding Jews ==
Henry was as hostile to the Jews as Peter had been friendly. In order to pay Bertrand du Guesclin&#x27;s mercenaries, he imposed a war contribution of twenty thousand gold doubloons on the already heavily oppressed community of Toledo, and issued an order to take all the Jews of Toledo as prisoners, to give them neither food nor drink, and if they still refused to raise this enormous sum, to sell their property, both movable and immovable, at auction. Nonetheless, he was compelled, owing to his financial straits, to have recourse to Jewish financiers. He made Don Joseph Pichon his chief tax-collector (&quot;contador major&quot;), and appointed several Jews farmers of the taxes.

The demands of the Cortes in Toro (1369) and in Burgos (1374 and 1377) against the Jews harmonized perfectly with Henry&#x27;s inclinations. He ordered the Jews to wear the humiliating badge, and forbade them to use Christian names. He further ordered that for short loans Christian debtors should repay only two-thirds of the principal. Shortly before his death Henry declared that Jews should no longer be permitted to hold public office.

Henry was potentially the first ruler since the Visigothic King Ergica to implement anti-Jewish policies in the Iberian Peninsula.

== Burial ==

After Henry&#x27;s death, his body was transported to Burgos, then to Valladolid, then finally to Toledo where he was buried in Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos de Toledo His remains are still there today. His grave is in the choir stalls at one side of the church and it is in the Plateresque style. The box is adorned with the shields of Castille and León, and the lower interior part has three panels decorated with trophies. There are two cherubs over the panels, holding the cartouche on which the king&#x27;s epitaph is displayed. The inscription translates to:

There is a recumbent statue of Henry II on top of the tomb. It is made from polychromed alabaster. It depicts the king wearing his royal robes, with his sword in his left hand and his girdle decorated with the lions of Castile. His right hand holds the sceptre, the upper end of which rests on three pillows that support the monarch&#x27;s head. The king wears slippers and his feet rest on a recumbent lion.

The king&#x27;s entrails are buried in the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.

== Partners and children ==

<doc id="167051" wikidata="Q216341" url="?curid=167051" title="Connie Francis">
<text>Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero ( ; born December 12, 1937), known as Connie Francis, is an American pop singer, actress, and top-charting female vocalist of the late 1950s and early 1960s. She is estimated to have sold more than 200 million records worldwide.

In 1960, Francis was recognized as the most successful female artist in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia, and in every other country where records were purchased. She was the first woman in history to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 when &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Somebody&#x27;s Fool&quot; topped the chart in 1960, she was also the first woman to have 3 No. 1 hits on the chart, just three of her 53 career hits.

==Biography==
===1937–1955: early life and first appearances===
Francis was born to an Italian-American family (one of her grandfathers having immigrated from Reggio Calabria in 1905) in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, the first child of George Franconero (1911–1996) and Ida (; 1911–2000), spending her first years in the Crown Heights, Brooklyn area (Utica Avenue/St. Marks Place) before the family moved to New Jersey. Growing up in a mixed Italian-Jewish neighborhood, Francis became fluent in Yiddish, which led her later to record songs in Yiddish and Hebrew.

In her autobiography &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; published in 1984, Francis recalls that she was encouraged by her father to appear regularly at talent contests, pageants, and other neighborhood festivities from the age of four as a singer and accordion player.

Francis attended Newark Arts High School in 1951 and 1952. She and her family moved to Belleville, New Jersey, where Francis graduated as salutatorian from Belleville High School Class of 1955.

Francis continued to perform at neighborhood festivities and talent shows (some of them broadcast on television), appearing alternately as Concetta Franconero and Connie Franconero. Under the latter name, she appeared on NBC&#x27;s variety show &quot;Startime Kids&quot; between 1953 and 1955.

During rehearsals for her appearance on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; in December 1950, Francis was advised by Godfrey to change her stage name to Connie Francis for easier pronunciation. Godfrey also told her to drop the accordion—advice she gladly followed, as she had begun to hate the large and heavy instrument. Around the same time, Francis took a job as a singer on demonstration records, to bring unreleased songs to the attention of established singers and/or their management who might choose to record them for a professional commercial record.

===1955–1957: recording contract but commercial failure===
In 1955, &quot;Startime Kids&quot; went off the air. In May that same year, George Franconero Sr. and Francis&#x27;s manager George Scheck raised money for a recording session of four songs which they hoped to sell to a major record company under Francis&#x27;s own name. Even when MGM Records decided to sign a contract with her, it was because one track she had recorded, &quot;Freddy&quot;, happened to be the name of the son of a company executive, Harry A. Meyerson, who thought of the song as a nice birthday gift. Hence, &quot;Freddy&quot; was released as Francis&#x27;s first single, which turned out to be a commercial failure, just like her next eight solo singles.

Despite these failures, Francis was hired to record the vocals for Tuesday Weld&#x27;s &quot;singing&quot; scenes in the 1956 movie &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;, and for Freda Holloway in the 1957 Warner Brothers rock and roll movie &quot;Jamboree&quot;.

In the fall of 1957, Francis enjoyed her first modest success with a duet single she had recorded with Marvin Rainwater: &quot;The Majesty of Love&quot;, with &quot;You, My Darlin&#x27; You&quot; as the B-side, peaked at number 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Eventually, the single sold over one million copies.

===1957–1959: last chance and breakthrough===
However, her minor chart success came too late for her record label—Francis&#x27;s recording contract consisted of ten solo singles and one duet single. Though success had finally seemed to come with &quot;The Majesty of Love&quot;, Francis was informed by MGM Records that her contract would not be renewed after her last solo single.

Francis considered a career in medicine and was about to accept a four-year scholarship offered at New York University. At what was to have been her final recording session for MGM on October 2, 1957, with Joe Lipman and his orchestra, she recorded a cover version of the 1923 song &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. Francis has said that she recorded it at the insistence of her father, who was convinced it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it had a contemporary arrangement.

Francis did not like the song and argued about it with her father heatedly, delaying the recording of the two other songs during the session so much that she thought no time was left on the continuously running recording tape. Her father insisted, though, and when the recording &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; was finished, only a few seconds remained on the tape.

The single seemed to go unnoticed like all previous releases, just as Francis had predicted, but on January 1, 1958, it debuted on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Francis watched the show and wrote in her diary:

&quot;I heard Dick Clark mention something about a new girl singer. So, what else is new? Another girl singer. There are ninety-five million females in the country, and I&#x27;ll bet ninety-five percent of them sing. &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt about it&quot;, predicted Mr. Clark. &quot;She&#x27;s is headed straight for the number one spot&quot;. I began feeling sorry for myself and a bit envious, too. Good luck to her, I thought. And then Mr. Clark just happened to play a song called &quot;Who&#x27;s sorry now&quot; - MY &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot;! Well, the feeling was cosmic - just cosmic! Right there in my living-room, it became Mardi Gras-time and New Year&#x27;s Eve at the turn of the century!&quot;

And on February 15 of that same year, Francis performed it on the first episode of &quot;The Saturday Night Beechnut Show&quot;, also hosted by Clark. By mid-year, over a million copies had been sold, and Francis was suddenly launched into worldwide stardom. In April 1958, &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 in the US. That year, by a wide margin, Connie was voted &quot;Best Female Vocalist&quot; by &quot;American Bandstand&quot; viewers. She went on to collect similar &quot;Bandstand&quot; awards for the next four years.
As Connie Francis explains at each of her concerts, she began searching for a new hit immediately after the success of &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; since MGM Records had renewed her contract. After the relative failure of the follow-up singles &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Made You Cry,&quot; which stalled at No. 36) and &quot;Heartaches&quot;, failing to chart at all, Francis met Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, who sang a number of ballads they had written for her. After a few hours, Francis began writing in her diary while the songwriters played the last of their ballads. This, and her refusal to let Sedaka and Greenfield see the diary to mine it for material, inspired the duo to write Sedaka&#x27;s own breakthrough hit &quot;The Diary.&quot;) Afterwards, Francis told them that she considered their ballads too intellectual and sophisticated for the young generation and requested a more lively song. Greenfield urged Sedaka to sing a song they had written that morning with the Shepherd Sisters in mind. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted, but Greenfield said that since she hated all the other songs they had performed, they had nothing to lose. Sedaka then played &quot;Stupid Cupid.&quot; When he finished, Francis announced that he had just played her new hit song. It went on to reach number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was her second number 1 in the UK.

The success of &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; restored momentum to Francis&#x27; chart career, and she reached the U.S. top 40 an additional eight times during the remainder of the 1950s. She managed to churn out more hits by covering several older songs, such as &quot;My Happiness&quot; (number 2 on the Hot 100) and &quot;Among My Souvenirs&quot; (number 7), as well as performing her own original songs. In 1959, she gained two gold records for a double-sided hit: on the A-side, &quot;Lipstick on Your Collar&quot; (number 5), and on the B-side, &quot;Frankie&quot; (number 9).

===1959–1973: international recording star===
Following another idea from her father, Francis traveled to London in August 1959 to record an Italian album at EMI&#x27;s famous Abbey Road Studios. Titled &quot;Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites&quot;, the album was released in November 1959. It soon entered the album charts where it remained for 81 weeks, peaking at number 4 and becoming Francis&#x27;s most successful album. &quot;Mama,&quot; the single taken from the album, reached number 8 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom.

Following this success, Francis recorded seven more albums of &quot;favorites&quot; between 1960 and 1964, including Jewish, German, and Irish, among others. These albums marked Francis&#x27;s transition from the youth-oriented rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music to adult contemporary music, which George Franconero, Sr. had realized would be necessary if his daughter was to have a successful longterm music career.

Nevertheless, Francis continued to record singles aimed at the youth-oriented market. Among her top-ten hits on the Hot 100 were &quot;Breakin&#x27; in a Brand New Broken Heart&quot; (1961, number 7), &quot;When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy in Your Heart)&quot; (1961, number 10), &quot;Second Hand Love&quot; (1962, number 7), and &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; (1961, number 4). The last one became her signature tune and became the theme song of Francis&#x27;s first motion picture. The movie introduced the concept of spring break, as the once sleepy town of Fort Lauderdale became the hotspot for college students on their spring vacation in the wake of the movie&#x27;s success.

The success of &quot;Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites&quot; in late 1959/early 1960 led Francis to become one of the first American artists to record regularly in other languages. She was followed by other major British and American recording stars including Wanda Jackson, Cliff Richard, Petula Clark, Brenda Lee, the Supremes, Peggy March, Pat Boone, Lesley Gore, the Beatles and Johnny Cash, among many others. In her autobiography, Francis mentioned that in the early years of her career, the language barrier in some European countries, especially in Germany, made it difficult for her songs to get airplay.

Francis used these reflections as the basis for her April 1960 recording, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Somebody&#x27;s Fool&quot; which would go on to become the first single by a female artist to top the Hot 100. Veteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named &quot;Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel&quot;, which, after some friction between Francis and her MGM executives, was recorded and released. The song peaked at number 1 in West Germany. She had two more number one hits there, &quot;Paradiso&quot; in September 1962 and &quot;Barcarole in der Nacht&quot; in July 1963.

It was not until her number 7 on the US charts, &quot;Many Tears Ago&quot;, later in 1960 when Francis began to record cover versions of her songs in foreign languages other than German. Over the years she expanded her recording portfolio to 15 languages. She also sang in Romanian during a live performance at the 1970 edition of the Cerbul de Aur in Brașov, Romania. Francis was not fluent in all of these languages and she had to learn her foreign language songs phonetically. Francis explained in a 1961 television interview that she was fluent in Spanish and Italian, but always had a translator nearby to make sure her translated lyrics and especially her pronunciation were as correct as possible.
In the wake of &quot;Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel&quot;, Francis enjoyed her greatest successes outside the United States. During the 1960s, her songs not only topped the charts in numerous countries around the world, but she was also voted the number 1 singer in over 10 countries. In 1960, she was named the most popular artist in Europe, the first time a non-European received this honor. From mid-1961 to mid-1963, Radio Luxembourg closed each day&#x27;s broadcasts with &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Say Goodnight&quot;, a song Francis had recorded especially for them and was not officially released until 1996.

Francis&#x27;s enduring popularity overseas led to television specials in countries around the world such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. Even at the height of the Cold War, Francis&#x27;s music was well received in Iron Curtain countries, and some of her recordings were made available on state-owned record labels such as Melodiya in the former Soviet Union and on Jugoton in former Yugoslavia, although it was common knowledge that rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was highly disparaged in Eastern bloc countries.

In the US, Connie Francis had a third number-one hit in 1962: &quot;Don&#x27;t Break the Heart That Loves You&quot;, and her success led MGM to allow her complete freedom to choose whichever songs she wanted to record.

Francis&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;For Every Young Heart&quot;, was published in 1963. On July 3 that same year, she played a Royal Command Performance for Queen Elizabeth II at the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland. During the height of the Vietnam War in 1967, Connie Francis performed for US troops. Francis recalls this story frequently during the introduction to &quot;God Bless America&quot; at her live concerts.

Due to music trends in the early and mid-1960s, especially the British Invasion, Francis&#x27;s chart success on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100 began to wane after 1963. She had her final top-ten hit, &quot;Vacation&quot;, in 1962. A number of Francis&#x27;s singles reached the top 40 in the US Hot 100 in the mid-1960s, with her last top-40 entry in 1964 being her cover version of &quot;Be Anything (but Be Mine)&quot;, a 1952 song made famous by singer/bandleader Eddy Howard. Despite her declining success on the Hot 100, Francis remained a top concert draw, and her singles – with a more mature style – were charting on the top quarter of&quot; Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Adult Contemporary (AC) Charts and sometimes even reached &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Country Charts. Francis enjoyed lasting chart success in the US until her contract with MGM Records expired in 1969.

In 1965, Connie Francis participated in that year&#x27;s edition of the annual San Remo Festival, where her team partner Gigliola Cinquetti and she presented &quot;&quot;Ho bisogno di vederti&quot;, which finished on number 5 of the final ranking.
Francis returned to San Remo in 1967 to present &quot;Canta Ragazzina&quot;&quot; with her team partner Bobby Solo. In the US, however, &quot;Time Alone Will Tell&quot;, Francis&#x27;s cover version of San Remo&#x27;s 1967 winning entry &quot;Non pensare a me&quot; which had been presented by Iva Zanicchi and Claudio Villa, peaked at number 94 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 and at number 14 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; AC charts.

In 1973, Francis returned to the recording studio, cutting &quot;(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?&quot;, b/w &quot;Paint the Rain&quot; on GSF Records. This answer song to &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree&quot; by Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn bubbled under the charts. The recording of a German version, though, remained unfinished.

===1974–1981: tragedy and return===
After her modest success with &quot;(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?&quot; Francis began performing regularly again. While appearing at the Westbury Music Fair in New York, on November 8, 1974, Francis was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson&#x27;s Lodge in Jericho, New York, and nearly suffocated under the weight of a heavy mattress the culprit had thrown upon her. She subsequently sued the motel chain for failing to provide adequate security and reportedly won a $2.5 million judgment, one of the largest such judgments in history, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found. In the years after the incident, Francis went into depression, taking as many as 50 Darvon pills a day and rarely leaving her home in Essex Fells, New Jersey.

In 1977, Francis underwent nasal surgery and completely lost her voice. She went through three more operations and was unable to sing for four years.

In 1978, Francis returned to the recording studio to cut an album titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Happy Now?&quot; The lead recording on this album was a disco version of &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;. That and other songs from the &quot;Who&#x27;s Happy Now?&quot; sessions were subsequently recorded in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and German. The Spanish and German recordings became albums of their own in as &quot;Connie Francis en Español&quot; in Spain and as &quot;Was ich bin&quot; (What I Am) in Germany. All three albums and the singles culled from them were released on United Artists Records.

Francis returned again to the studio in 1981 to cut &quot;Comme ci, comme ça&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Me Again&quot;, the latter of which became the title track of an album which featured the new songs. &quot;I&#x27;m Me Again&quot; became Francis&#x27; last single to chart on the AC charts.

===1981–1988: more tragedy===
In 1981, further tragedy struck Francis when her brother, George Franconero, Jr., with whom she was very close, was murdered by Mafia hitmen.

Despite that, she took up live performing again, even gracing the &quot;American Bandstand&quot; 30th Anniversary Special and appearing in the town where she had been raped. Francis&#x27; new-found success was short-lived, though. She was diagnosed with manic depression, which again brought her career to a halt. She was committed to multiple psychiatric hospitals. Francis attempted suicide in 1984.

Nevertheless, in 1984, Francis was able to write and publish her autobiography, &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

===1989–2018: later career===
In 1989, Francis resumed her recording and performing career once again. For Malaco Records, Francis recorded a double album entitled &quot;Where the Hits Are&quot;, containing re-recordings of 18 of her biggest hits, as well as six classics of yesteryear Francis had always wanted to record such as &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot; and &quot;Torn Between Two Lovers&quot;.

In 1992, a medley of remixed versions of her biggest German hits charted in Germany. A single, entitled &quot;Jive, Connie&quot;, ended up among the top-ten best-selling singles of the year, which brought Francis the prestigious R.SH-Gold award for the &quot;Best Comeback of the Year&quot; from R.SH (short for &quot;Radio Schleswig-Holstein&quot;), then one of Germany&#x27;s most important private radio stations. A subsequent compilation album of her biggest German hits in their original versions was also released successfully. In the wake of this, Francis recorded two duets for the German Herzklang label (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment) with Peter Kraus, with whom she had already worked several times in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A German-language solo album was supposed to follow on Herzklang, but despite all songs being recorded and mixed, the album remains unreleased.

In 1996, Francis released the live album &quot;The Return Concert: Live at Trump&#x27;s Castle&quot;. That same year, she also released &quot;With Love to Buddy&quot;, a tribute album of songs made famous by the late Buddy Holly.

In late December 2004, Francis headlined in Las Vegas for the first time since 1989. In March and October 2007, Francis performed to sold-out crowds at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. She appeared in concert in Manila, Philippines, on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2008.

In 2010, she appeared at the Las Vegas Hilton with Dionne Warwick, a show billed as &quot;Eric Floyd&#x27;s Grand Divas of Stage&quot;.

In December 2017, Francis released her most recent autobiography, &quot;Among My Souvenirs&quot;.

===Musical genres===
While her singles were mostly kept in the then-current sounds of the day such as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, novelty songs, the twist, torch ballads, or the girl group sound created by Brill Building alumni Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, Francis&#x27; albums represented her in a variety of styles, ranging from R&amp;B, vocal jazz, and country to Broadway standards, children&#x27;s music, waltzes, spiritual music, schlager music, traditionals from various ethnic groups represented in the US, and select songs from popular songwriters of the day, such as Burt Bacharach and Hal David, or Les Reed.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Francis was married four times. In 1964, she was briefly married to Dick Kanellis, a press agent and entertainment director for the Aladdin Hotel. In January 1971, she married Izzy Marion, a hair-salon owner, divorcing 10 months later. In 1973, Francis married for the third timeher only marriage to last more than a few months to Joseph Garzilli, a restaurateur and travel-agency owner; they divorced in 1977. It was during the third marriage that Francis adopted a baby boy, Joey. Francis married TV producer Bob Parkinson on June 27, 1985, divorcing later that year.

===Relationship with Bobby Darin===
Early in her career, Francis was introduced to Bobby Darin, then an up-and-coming singer and songwriter. Darin&#x27;s manager arranged for him to help write several songs for her. Despite some disagreement about material, after several weeks Darin and Francis developed a romantic relationship. Francis&#x27; strict Italian father would separate the couple whenever possible. When her father learned that Darin had suggested the two elope after one of her shows, he ran Darin out of the building at gunpoint.

Francis saw Darin only two more times: once when the two were scheduled to sing together for a television show, and again when she was spotlighted on the TV series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. By the time of the latter&#x27;s taping, Darin had married actress Sandra Dee. In her autobiography, Francis stated she and her father were driving into the Lincoln Tunnel when the radio DJ announced Dee and Darin&#x27;s marriage. Her father made a negative comment about Darin finally being out of their lives. Angered, Francis wrote she hoped the Hudson River would fill the Lincoln Tunnel, killing both her and her father; she later wrote that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.

===Relationship with Tony Ferretti===
In a Facebook post dated January 22, 2022, Francis reported the passing of Tony Ferretti, &quot;my sole companion of the past 18 years.&quot; On February 13, a video uploaded to her official YouTube channel featured Francis and Ferretti performing a duet of the song &quot;You Made Me Love You.&quot;

===Biopic===
Francis and singer Gloria Estefan completed a screenplay for a movie based on Francis&#x27; life titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; Estefan announced that she would produce and play the lead. She said, &quot;[Connie Francis] isn&#x27;t even in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and yet she was the first female pop star worldwide, and has recorded in nine languages. She has done a lot of things for victims&#x27; rights since her rape in the &#x27;70s... There&#x27;s a major story there.&quot; In December 2009 the film project was dropped. According to Francis:
In the same article, Francis said that Dolly Parton had been contacting her for years trying to produce her life story, but owing to her previous commitment to Estefan&#x27;s organization, she was not able to accept Parton&#x27;s offer. She noted in the article that both she and Parton had considered, independently of each other, actress Valerie Bertinelli to play Francis.

===Politics and activism===
Francis supported Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 bid for the presidency when she recorded a campaign song for him.

In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan appointed her as head of his task force on violent crime. She has also been the spokeswoman for Mental Health America&#x27;s trauma campaign, as well as an involved worker for the USO and UNICEF.

In a 2011 interview, Francis described herself as &quot;a die-hard liberal&quot;.

===Lawsuits===
Francis brought a suit alleging that Universal Music Group (UMG) took advantage of her condition and stopped paying royalties. The lawsuit was dismissed.

On November 27, 2002, she filed a second suit against UMG alleging the label had inflicted severe emotional distress on her and violated her moral rights when, without her permission, it synchronized several of her songs into &quot;sexually themed&quot; movies: the 1994 film &quot;Post Cards from America&quot;, the 1996 film &quot;The Craft&quot;, and the 1999 film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;. This suit was also dismissed.

Francis also sued the producers of &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; for using her song &quot;Lollipop Lips,&quot; which is heard during a sex scene.

==Recognition==
In 2001, &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; was named one of the Songs of the Century.

A &quot;Connie Francis Way&quot; street sign is displayed at the corner of Greylock Parkway and Forest Street in Belleville, New Jersey, near the house in which she grew up.

<text>ISO 639 is a standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) concerned with representation of languages and language groups.
It currently consists of four sets (1-3, 5) of code, named after each part which formerly described respective set (part 4 was guidelines without its own coding system); a part 6 was published but withdrawn.
It was first approved in 1967 as a single-part ISO Recommendation, ISO/R 639, superseded in 2002 by part 1 of the new series, ISO 639-1, followed by additional parts. All existing parts of the series were consolidated into a single standard in 2023, largely based on the text of ISO 639-4.

==Use of ISO 639 codes==
The language codes defined in the several sections of ISO 639 are used for bibliographic purposes and, in computing and internet environments, as a key element of locale data. The codes also find use in various applications, such as Wikipedia URLs for its different language editions.

==History==
The early form of ISO&#x27;s language coding system was manifested by ISO/R 639:1967 titled &quot;Symbols for Languages, Countries and Authorities&quot;, which aimed chiefly to regulate vocabularies signifying languages, countries, and standardization agencies of ISO member bodies. Its &quot;language symbols&quot; consisted of one- or two-letter variable-length identifiers in capitalized Latin alphabets, e.g. codice_1 or codice_2 for English; codice_3, codice_4, or codice_5 for Spanish; and codice_6 for Indonesian. It was also allowed to use (the pre-1993 version of) UDC numeral auxiliaries to indicate languages.

After decoupling the country code into ISO 3166 in 1974, the first edition of the standard ISO 639:1988 &quot;Code for the representation of names of languages&quot; was published with a framework of uniformly two-letter identifiers in lowercase Latin alphabets, mostly identical in format and vocabulary to that of the current ISO 639 Set 1.

Since then, the standard has been adopted as a fundamental technology of the rapidly expanding computer industry (RFC 1766), leading to development of more expressive three-letter framework, published as ISO 639-2:1998, largely based on MARC codes for languages. The original two-letter system was redefined as ISO 639-1 in 2001.

Seeking for more extensive support of languages for widening applications, separate supersets of the ISO 639-2 namespace that cover individual languages and groups were established as ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-5, respectively. There was also an attempt to code more precise language variants using four-letter identifiers as ISO 639-6, which was later withdrawn and to be reorganized under another framework, ISO 21636.

Relatively constant updates in parts of ISO 639 had been handled by each own authority in charge until the publication of ISO 639:2023, which harmonized and reunified the body text of former standards and brought about organizational change with a joint maintenance agency supervising all sets and issuing newsletters. The maintenance agency is located in Ontario, Canada.

==Current sets and historical parts of the standard==
Each set of the standard is maintained by a language coding agency, which adds codes and changes the status of codes when needed. ISO 639-6 was withdrawn in 2014, and not included in ISO 639:2023.

==Characteristics of individual codes==
Scopes:
* Individual languages
* Macrolanguages (Set 3)
* Collections of languages (Sets 1, 2, 5). Some collections were already in Set 2, and others were added only in Set 5:
** Remainder groups: 36 collections in both Set 2 and 5 are of this kind — for compatibility with Set 2 when Set 5 was still not published, the remainder groups do not contain any language and collection that was already coded in Set 2 (however new applications compatible with Set 5 may treat these groups inclusively, as long they respect the containment hierarchy published in Set 5 and they use the most specific collection when grouping languages);
*** The only collection which previously assigned with two-alphabet code is Bihari (bh) during the Part 1 era, which deprecated in June 2021.
** Regular groups: 29 collections in both Sets 2 and 5 are of this kind — for compatibility with Set 2, they can not contain other groups;
** Families: 50 new collections coded only in Set 5 (including one containing a regular group already coded in Set 2) — for compatibility with Set 2, they may contain other collections except remainder groups.
* Dialects: they were intended to be covered by former ISO 639-6 (proposed but now withdrawn).
* Special situations (Sets 2, 3).
* Reserved for local use (Sets 2, 3). Also used sometimes in applications needing a two-letter code like standard codes in Sets 1 and 2 (where the special code codice_7 is not suitable), or a three-letter code for collections like standard codes in Set 5.

Types (for individual languages):
* Living languages (Sets 2, 3) (except Sanskrit, all other macrolanguages are living languages)
* Extinct languages (Sets 2, 3) (599, 5 of them are in Set 2: codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12; none are in Set 1)
* Ancient languages (Sets 1, 2, 3) (124, 19 of them are in Set 2; and 5 of them, namely codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16 and codice_17, also have a code in Set 1: codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22)
* Historical languages (Sets 2, 3) (89, 16 of them are in Set 2; none are in Set 1)
* Constructed languages (Sets 1, 2, 3) (23, 9 of them in Set 2: codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26, codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, codice_30, codice_31; 5 of them in Set 1: codice_32, codice_33, codice_34, codice_35, codice_36)

Individual languages and macrolanguages with two distinct three-letter codes in Set 2:
* Bibliographic (some of them were deprecated, none were defined in Set 3): these are legacy codes (based on language names in English).
* Terminologic (also defined in Set 3): these are the preferred codes (based on native language names, romanized if needed).
* All others (including collections of languages and special/reserved codes) only have a single three-letter code for both uses.

==Relations between the sets==
The different sets of ISO 639 are designed to work together, in such a way that no code means one thing in one set and something else in another. However, not all languages are in all sets, and there is a variety of different ways that specific languages and other elements are treated in the different sets. This depends, for example, whether a language is listed in Sets 1 or 2, whether it has separate B/T codes in Set 2, or is classified as a macrolanguage in Set 3, and so forth.

These various treatments are detailed in the following chart. In each group of rows (one for each scope of Set 3), the last four columns contain codes for a representative language that exemplifies a specific type of relation between the sets of ISO 639, the second column provides an explanation of the relationship, and the first column indicates the number of elements that have that type of relationship. For example, there are four elements that have a code in Set 1, have a B/T code, and are classified as macrolanguages in Set 3. One representative of these four elements is &quot;Persian&quot; codice_37/codice_38/codice_39.

These differences are due to the following factors.

In ISO 639 Set 2, two distinct codes were assigned to 22 individual languages, namely a bibliographic and a terminology code (B/T codes). B codes were included for historical reasons because previous widely used bibliographic systems used language codes based on the English name for the language. In contrast, the Set 1 codes were based on the native name for the language, and there was also a strong desire to have Set 2 codes (T codes) for these languages which were similar to the corresponding 2-character code in Set 1.
* For instance, the German language (Set 1: codice_40) has two codes in Set 2: codice_41 (B code) and codice_42 (T code), whereas there is only one code in Set 2, codice_43, for the English language.
* 2 former B codes were withdrawn, leaving today only 20 pairs of B/T codes.

Individual languages in Set 2 always have a code in Set 3 (only the Set 2 terminology code is reused there) but may or may not have a code in Set 1, as illustrated by the following examples:
* Set 3 codice_43 corresponds to Set 2 codice_43 and Set 1 codice_46
* Set 3 codice_47 corresponds to Set 2 codice_47 but lacks a code in Set 1.

Some codes (62) in Set 3 are macrolanguages. These are groups containing multiple individual languages that have a good mutual understanding and are commonly mixed or confused. Some macrolanguages developed a default standard form on one of their individual languages (e.g. Mandarin is implied by default for the Chinese macrolanguage, other individual languages may be still distinguished if needed but the specific code codice_49 for Mandarin is rarely used).
* 1 macrolanguage has a Set 2 code and a Set 1 code, while its member individual languages also have codes in Set 1 and Set 2: codice_50/codice_51 contains codice_52/codice_53, codice_54/codice_55; or
* 4 macrolanguages have two Set 2 codes (B/T) and a Set 1 code: codice_38/codice_39/codice_37, codice_59/codice_60/codice_61, codice_62/codice_63/codice_64, and codice_65/codice_66/codice_67;
* 28 macrolanguages have a Set 2 code but no Set 1 code;
* 29 other macrolanguages only have codes in Set 3.

Collective codes in Set 2 have a code in Set 5: e.g. codice_68 in Sets 2 and 5, which stands for Australian languages.
* Some codes were added in Set 5 but had no code in Set 2: e.g. codice_69

Sets 2 and 3 also have a reserved range and four special codes:
* Codes codice_70 through codice_71 are reserved for local use.
* There are four special codes: codice_7 for languages that have no code yet assigned, codice_73 for &quot;multiple languages&quot;, codice_74 for &quot;undefined&quot;, and codice_75 for &quot;no linguistic content, not applicable&quot;.

==Code space==

===Two-letter code space===
Two-letter (formerly &quot;Alpha-2&quot;) identifiers (for codes composed of 2 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet) are used in Set 1. When codes for a wider range of languages were desired, more than 2 letter combinations could cover (a maximum of 262 = 676), Set 2 was developed using three-letter codes. (However, the latter was formally published first.)

===Three-letter code space===
Three-letter (formerly &quot;Alpha-3&quot;) identifiers (for codes composed of 3 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet) are used in Set 2, Set 3, and Set 5. The number of languages and language groups that can be so represented is 263 = 17,576.

The common use of three-letter codes by three sets of ISO 639 requires some coordination within a larger system.

Set 2 defines four special codes codice_7, codice_73, codice_74, codice_75, a reserved range codice_80 (20 × 26 = 520 codes) and has 20 double entries (the B/T codes), plus 2 entries with deprecated B-codes. This sums up to 520 + 22 + 4 = 546 codes that cannot be used in Set 3 to represent languages or in Set 5 to represent language families or groups. The remainder is 17,576 – 546 = 17,030.
There are somewhere around six to seven thousand languages on Earth today. So those 17,030 codes are adequate to assign a unique code to each language, although some languages may end up with arbitrary codes that sound nothing like the traditional name(s) of that language.

===Alpha-4 code space (withdrawn)===
&quot;Alpha-4&quot; codes (for codes composed of 4 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet) were proposed to be used in ISO 639-6, which has been withdrawn. The upper limit for the number of languages and dialects that can be represented is 264 = 456,976.

<doc id="167053" wikidata="Q36255" url="?curid=167053" title="Unit vector">
<text>In mathematics, a unit vector in a normed vector space is a vector (often a spatial vector) of length 1. A unit vector is often denoted by a lowercase letter with a circumflex, or &quot;hat&quot;, as in formula_1 (pronounced &quot;v-hat&quot;). The term &quot;normalized vector&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;unit vector&quot;.

The normalized vector û of a non-zero vector u is the unit vector in the direction of u, i.e.,
:formula_2
where ‖u‖ is the norm (or length) of u and formula_3. 

The proof is the following: formula_4

A unit vector is often used to represent directions, such as normal directions.
Unit vectors are often chosen to form the basis of a vector space, and every vector in the space may be written as a linear combination form of unit vectors.

==Orthogonal coordinates==

===Cartesian coordinates===
Unit vectors may be used to represent the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. For instance, the standard &quot;unit vectors&quot; in the direction of the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; axes of a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system are

:formula_5

They form a set of mutually orthogonal &quot;unit vectors&quot;, typically referred to as a standard basis in linear algebra.

They are often denoted using common vector notation (e.g., x or formula_6) rather than standard unit vector notation (e.g., x̂). In most contexts it can be assumed that x, y, and z, (or formula_7 formula_8 and formula_9) are versors of a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system. The notations (î, ĵ, k̂), (x̂1, x̂2, x̂3), (êx, êy, êz), or (ê1, ê2, ê3), with or without hat, are also used, particularly in contexts where i, j, k might lead to confusion with another quantity (for instance with index symbols such as &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, which are used to identify an element of a set or array or sequence of variables).

When a unit vector in space is expressed in Cartesian notation as a linear combination of x, y, z, its three scalar components can be referred to as direction cosines. The value of each component is equal to the cosine of the angle formed by the unit vector with the respective basis vector. This is one of the methods used to describe the orientation (angular position) of a straight line, segment of straight line, oriented axis, or segment of oriented axis (vector).

===Cylindrical coordinates===

The three orthogonal unit vectors appropriate to cylindrical symmetry are: 
* formula_10 (also designated formula_11 or formula_12), representing the direction along which the distance of the point from the axis of symmetry is measured; 
* formula_13, representing the direction of the motion that would be observed if the point were rotating counterclockwise about the symmetry axis;
* formula_14, representing the direction of the symmetry axis; 
They are related to the Cartesian basis formula_15, formula_16, formula_17 by:

:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20

The vectors formula_10 and formula_13 are functions of formula_23 and are &quot;not&quot; constant in direction. When differentiating or integrating in cylindrical coordinates, these unit vectors themselves must also be operated on. The derivatives with respect to formula_24 are:

:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

===Spherical coordinates===

The unit vectors appropriate to spherical symmetry are: formula_28, the direction in which the radial distance from the origin increases; formula_29, the direction in which the angle in the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane counterclockwise from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis is increasing; and formula_30, the direction in which the angle from the positive &quot;z&quot; axis is increasing. To minimize redundancy of representations, the polar angle formula_31 is usually taken to lie between zero and 180 degrees. It is especially important to note the context of any ordered triplet written in spherical coordinates, as the roles of formula_13 and formula_30 are often reversed. Here, the American &quot;physics&quot; convention is used. This leaves the azimuthal angle formula_34 defined the same as in cylindrical coordinates. The Cartesian relations are:

:formula_35

:formula_36

:formula_37

The spherical unit vectors depend on both formula_34 and formula_31, and hence there are 5 possible non-zero derivatives. For a more complete description, see Jacobian matrix and determinant. The non-zero derivatives are:

:formula_40

:formula_41

:formula_42

:formula_43

:formula_44

===General unit vectors===

Common themes of unit vectors occur throughout physics and geometry:

==Curvilinear coordinates==
In general, a coordinate system may be uniquely specified using a number of linearly independent unit vectors formula_45 (the actual number being equal to the degrees of freedom of the space). For ordinary 3-space, these vectors may be denoted formula_46. It is nearly always convenient to define the system to be orthonormal and right-handed:

:formula_47
:formula_48

where formula_49 is the Kronecker delta (which is 1 for &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot;, and 0 otherwise) and formula_50 is the Levi-Civita symbol (which is 1 for permutations ordered as &quot;ijk&quot;, and −1 for permutations ordered as &quot;kji&quot;).

==Right versor==
A unit vector in formula_51 was called a right versor by W. R. Hamilton, as he developed his quaternions formula_52. In fact, he was the originator of the term &quot;vector&quot;, as every quaternion formula_53 has a scalar part &quot;s&quot; and a vector part &quot;v&quot;. If &quot;v&quot; is a unit vector in formula_51, then the square of &quot;v&quot; in quaternions is –1. Thus by Euler&#x27;s formula, formula_55 is a versor in the 3-sphere. When &quot;θ&quot; is a right angle, the versor is a right versor: its scalar part is zero and its vector part &quot;v&quot; is a unit vector in formula_51.

Thus the right versors extend the notion of imaginary units found in the complex plane, where the right versors now range over the 2-sphere formula_57 rather than the pair {i, –i} in the complex plane.

By extension, a right quaternion is a real multiple of a right versor.
