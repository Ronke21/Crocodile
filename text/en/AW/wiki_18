<text>Jorge Adolfo Páez (born October 27, 1965) is a Mexican actor, circus performer and former professional boxer. In boxing he held the WBO and IBF featherweight titles. Paez&#x27;s nickname of &quot;El Maromero&quot; is in honor of the somersault (referred to in Spanish as &quot;maroma&quot;) acts he performs at the circus. It was in the circus that he learned acrobatic moves he would later use in the boxing ring. Páez is also the father of Azriel Páez, Jorge Páez Jr., and Airam Páez.

==Personal life==
Paez has been a circus performer in his northwest Mexico hometown since he was very young. Jorge started boxing in San Luis Río Colorado. He is also the father of welterweight prospect Azriel Páez and WBC Youth Intercontinental welterweight champion Jorge Páez Jr.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Paez began boxing professionally on November 16, 1984, knocking out Efren Treno in three rounds.

===Featherweight champion===
From there on, he built a string of wins that led him to challenge IBF featherweight champion Calvin Grove in boxing&#x27;s last 15 round world title fight. Paez was trailing on all three scorecards, but dropped the champion three times in the last round. The knockdowns provided an edge on the scorecards, making Paez IBF featherweight champion by a unanimous decision. He defended the title eight times, including a knockout in 11 against Grove in a rematch, a unanimous decision win former world champion Stevie Cruz and a split decision against future world champion Troy Dorsey.

He then won the WBO featherweight title in a unification bout against Louie Espinoza (in a rematch of their 1989 fight that ended in a draw) by split decision.

Paez then vacated his titles and moved up in weight, only to lose to IBF super featherweight champion Tony Lopez. Paez continued to fight, but he had mixed results versus former world champion Lupe Suarez and against Tracy Spann; he and Suarez drew in 10 rounds, and he beat Spann by a 10-round decision.

===Lightweight===

On October 10, 1991, Paez moved up to lightweight and fought against Pernell Whitaker for the WBC, WBA and IBF lightweight titles but lost by unanimous decision.

On November 6, 1992, Paez fought against future world champion Rafael Ruelas for the NABF lightweight title, losing by TKO in the 10 round. On July 17, 1993, he lost to Freddie Pendleton by a decision in twelve for the IBF lightweight title

On July 29, 1994, he was given a shot at the vacant WBO lightweight title against rising superstar Oscar De La Hoya. Paez lost by a knockout in round two.

===Later years===
Paez then went up against WBA super featherweight champion Genaro Hernandez in a non-title bout, losing by TKO in the 8th round due to cuts. On August 17, 1996, he won the WBC Continental Americas super featherweight regional title by knocking out Narciso Valenzuela in 3 rounds. Paez would then lose that title in his next match against Julian Wheeler but regained it by beating Wheeler in the rematch.

On August 7, 1997, he lost by a knockout in eight rounds to Angel Manfredy. After three victories, Paez lost via a devastating one-punch knockout in seven rounds to Augie Sanchez in May 1999. In his next bout in October 1999, Paez boxed future lightweight champion Jose Luis Castillo, losing by KO in the fifth round.

Paez continued to box on over the next few years, winning a long string of bouts against a lower level of opposition.

===Injuries and Retirement===
Paez was supposed to fight Jesús Chávez on March 29, 2003. However, it was discovered that Paez suffered from brain swelling, putting the fight with Jesús Chávez and his career in serious jeopardy. Despite these findings, Paez fought on, and on December 5, 2003, in Phoenix, Arizona, he defeated Scott McCraken by a ten-round split decision in what would be Paez&#x27;s final match.

His overall record was 79-14-5 (51 KOs).

==Professional boxing record==

==Outside the Ring==
In 1993 he made the movie &quot;Zapatos Viejos&quot;, where he starred alongside Gloria Trevi, playing &quot;Ernesto&quot;. In 1995, he made his Hollywood acting debut in the low-budget movie &quot;Dirty Money&quot;.

Paez&#x27;s name surfaced in the 2004 FBI investigation against promoter Bob Arum. The FBI was investigating whether Paez&#x27;s win over Verdell Smith was a fixed fight or not.

Paez had a brief supporting role with World Wrestling Entertainment as an associate of Rey Mysterio, and accompanied him to the ring at the &quot;No Way Out&quot; pay-per-view event on February 15, 2004. Paez also appeared in Mysterio&#x27;s music video for his song from the &quot;WWE Originals&quot; album, &quot;Crossing Borders.&quot;

<doc id="168175" wikidata="Q30718" url="?curid=168175" title="Scourge">
<text>A scourge is a whip or lash, especially a multi-thong type, used to inflict severe corporal punishment or self-mortification. It is usually made of leather.

==Etymology==
The word is most commonly considered to be derived from Old French &quot;escorgier&quot; - &quot;to whip&quot;, going further back to the Vulgar Latin &quot;excorrigiare&quot;: the Latin prefix &quot;ex&quot;- &quot;out, off&quot; with its additional English meaning of &quot;thoroughly&quot;, plus &quot;corrigia&quot; - &quot;thong&quot;, or in this case &quot;whip&quot;. Some connect it to , &quot;to flay&quot;, built of two Latin parts, &quot;ex&quot;- (&quot;off&quot;) and , &quot;skin&quot;.

==Description==

A scourge (; diminutive: ) consists of a rope with metal balls, bones, and metal spikes. 

The scourge, or flail, and the crook are the two symbols of power and domination depicted in the hands of Osiris in Egyptian monuments. The shape of the flail or scourge is unchanged throughout history. However, when a scourge is described as a &#x27;flail&#x27; as depicted in Egyptian mythology, it may be referring to use as an agricultural instrument. A flail&#x27;s intended use was to thresh wheat, not to implement corporal punishment.

The priests of Cybele scourged themselves and others. Such stripes were considered sacred.

Hard material can be affixed to multiple thongs to give a flesh-tearing &quot;bite&quot;. A scourge with these additions is called a scorpion. is Latin for a Roman and is referred to in the Bible: 1 Kings 12:11: &quot;...My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions&quot; said Rehoboam, referring to increased conscription and taxation beyond Solomon&#x27;s. The name testifies to the pain caused by the arachnid. Testifying to its frequent Roman application is the existence of the Latin words &#x27;carrying a whip&#x27; and &#x27;often-lashed slave&#x27;. According to the Gospel of John, Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, ordered Jesus to be scourged.
Scourging was soon adopted as a sanction in the monastic discipline of the fifth and following centuries. Early in the fifth century it is mentioned by Palladius of Galatia in the , and Socrates Scholasticus tells us that, instead of being excommunicated, offending young monks were scourged. (See the sixth-century rules of St. Cæsarius of Arles for nuns, and of St. Aurelian of Arles.) Thenceforth scourging is frequently mentioned in monastic rules and councils as an enforcer of discipline. Its use as a punishment was general in the seventh century in all monasteries of the severe Columban rule.

Canon law (Decree of Gratian, Decretals of Gregory IX) recognized it as a punishment for ecclesiastics; even as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it appears in ecclesiastical legislation as a punishment for blasphemy, concubinage and simony. Scourging as a means of penance and mortification is publicly exemplified in the tenth and eleventh centuries by the lives of St. Dominic Loricatus and St. Peter Damian (died 1072). The latter wrote a special treatise in praise of self-flagellation; though blamed by some contemporaries for excess of zeal, his example and the high esteem in which he was held did much to popularize the voluntary use of a small scourge known as a discipline, as a means of mortification and penance.

From then on the practice appeared in most medieval religious orders and associations. The fourteenth-century Flagellants were named for their self-flagellation; King Louis IX of France and Elisabeth of Hungary also made private use of the &quot;discipline&quot;.

==Metaphoric use==
Semi-literal uses such as &quot;the scourge of God&quot; for Attila the Hun (i.e. &quot;God&#x27;s whip with which to punish the nations&quot;) led to metaphoric uses to mean a severe affliction, e.g. &quot;the scourge of drug abuse&quot;.

<doc id="168176" wikidata="Q105397" url="?curid=168176" title="Hookah">
<text>A hookah (also see other names), shisha, or waterpipe is a single- or multi-stemmed instrument for heating or vaporizing and then smoking either tobacco, flavored tobacco (often &quot;muʽassel&quot;), or sometimes cannabis, hashish and opium. The smoke is passed through a water basin—often glass-based—before inhalation.

The major health risks of smoking tobacco, cannabis, opium and other drugs through a hookah include exposure to toxic chemicals, carcinogens and heavy metals that are not filtered out by the water, alongside those related to the transmission of infectious diseases when hookahs are shared or not properly cleaned. Hookah and waterpipe use is a global public health concern, with high rates of use in the populations of the Middle East and North Africa as well as in young people in the United States, Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia.

The hookah or waterpipe was invented by Abul-Fath Gilani, a Persian physician of Akbar, in the Indian city of Fatehpur Sikri during Mughal India; the hookah spread from the Indian subcontinent to Persia first where the mechanism was modified to its current shape and then to the Ottoman empire. Alternatively, it could have originated in the Safavid dynasty of Persia, from where it eventually spread to the Indian subcontinent.

Despite tobacco and drug use being considered a taboo when the hookah was first conceived, its use became increasingly popular among nobility and subsequently widely accepted. Burned tobacco is increasingly being replaced by vaporizing flavored tobacco. Still the original hookah is often used in rural South Asia, which continues to use &quot;tumbak&quot; (a pure and coarse form of unflavored tobacco leaves) and smoked by burning it directly with charcoal. While this method delivers a much higher content of tobacco and nicotine, it also incurs more adverse health effects compared to vaporizing hookahs.

The word hookah is a derivative of &quot;huqqa&quot;, a Hindustani word, of Arabic origin (derived from &quot;ḥuqqa&quot;, &quot;casket, bottle, water pipe&quot;). Outside its native region, hookah smoking has gained popularity throughout the world, especially among younger people.

==Names and etymology==

In the Indian subcontinent, the Hindustani word &quot;huqqa&quot; (Devanagari: हुक़्क़ा, Nastaleeq: ) is used and is the origin of the English word &quot;hookah&quot;. The widespread use of the Indian word &quot;hookah&quot; in the English language is a result of the colonization in British India (1858–1947), when large numbers of expatriate Britons first sampled the water pipe. William Hickey, shortly after arriving in Calcutta, India, in 1775, wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;:

::The most highly-dressed and splendid hookah was prepared for me. I tried it, but did not like it. As after several trials I still found it disagreeable, I with much gravity requested to know whether it was indispensably necessary that I should become a smoker, which was answered with equal gravity, &quot;Undoubtedly it is, for you might as well be out of the world as out of the fashion. Here everybody uses a hookah, and it is impossible to get on without ...[I] have frequently heard men declare they would much rather be deprived of their dinner than their hookah.&quot;

Arabic أرجيلة (&#x27;arjīlah) is the name most commonly used in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Uzbekistan, Kuwait and Iraq, while &quot;nargilah&quot; (, ) is the name most commonly used in Israel. It derives from &quot;nārgil&quot; (), which in turn comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;nārikela&quot; (), meaning coconut, suggesting that early hookahs were hewn from coconut shells.

In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, (на[р]гиле) or (на[р]гила) is used to refer to the pipe, while &quot;šiša&quot; (шиша) refers to شیشه (šiše) meaning glass bottle in Persian. The pipes there often have one or two mouth pieces. The flavored tobacco, created by marinating cuts of tobacco in a multitude of flavored molasses, is placed above the water and covered by pierced foil with hot coals placed on top, and the smoke is drawn through cold water to cool and filter it. In Albania, the hookah is called &quot;lula&quot; or &quot;lulava&quot;. In Romania, it is called &quot;narghilea&quot;.

&quot;Narguile&quot; is the common word in Spain used to refer to the pipe, although &quot;cachimba&quot; is also used, along with &quot;shisha&quot; by Moroccan immigrants in Spain. The word &quot;narguilé&quot; is used in Portuguese. &quot;Narguilé&quot; is also used in French, along with &quot;chicha&quot;.

Arabic شيشة (šīšah), through Ottoman Turkish word شیشه (şîşe), itself a direct loanword from Persian شیشه (šīše) meaning &quot;glass container&quot;, is the common term for the hookah in Egypt, Sudan and also other Arab world regions such as Arab Peninsula (including Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Yemen and Saudi Arabia), Algeria, Tunisia. It is used also in Morocco, Somalia and Cyprus. In Yemen, the Arabic term مداعة (&quot;madā`ah&quot;) is also used, but for pipes using pure tobacco.

In Persia, hookah is called &quot;qalyān&quot; (). Persian qalyan is included in the earliest European compendium on tobacco, the &quot;tobacologia&quot; written by Johan Neander and published in Dutch in 1622. It seems that over time water pipes acquired a Persian connotation as in eighteenth-century Egypt the most fashionable pipes were called &quot;Karim Khan&quot; after the Persian ruler of the day. This is also the name used in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania and Belarus.

In Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, a hookah is called .

In Kashmiri, hookah is called &quot;Jajeer&quot;.

In Maldives, hookah is called &quot;Guduguda&quot;.

In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, hookah is called &quot;Shisha&quot;.

In the Philippines, hookah is called &quot;hitboo&quot; and normally used in smoking flavored marijuana.

In Sindhi, another language of South Asia, it is called &quot;huqqo&quot; ( / ).

In Vietnam, hookah is called &quot;hookah shisha (&quot;bình shisha) and shisha is called &quot;shisha tobacco&quot; (thuốc shisha).

==History==
In the Indian city of Fatehpur Sikri, Roman Catholic missionaries of the Society of Jesus arriving from the southern part of the country introduced tobacco to the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605 AD). Louis Rousselet writes that the physician of Akbar, Hakim Aboul Futteh Ghilani , then invented the hookah in India.
However, a quatrain of Ahlī Shirazi (d. 1535), a Persian poet, refers to the use of the ḡalyān (Falsafī, II, p. 277; Semsār, 1963, p. 15), thus dating its use at least as early as the time of the Shah Ṭahmāsp I. It seems, therefore, that Abu’l-Fath Gilani should be credited with the introduction of the ḡalyān, already in use in Persia, into India. There is, however, no evidence of the existence of the water pipe until the 1560s. Moreover, tobacco is believed to have arrived in India in the 17th century, until then cannabis was smoked in India, so that suggests another substance was probably smoked in Ahlī Shirazi&#x27;s quatrain, perhaps through some other method.

Following the European introduction of tobacco to Persia and India, Hakim Abu’l-Fath Gilani, who came from Gilan, a province in the north of Persia, migrated to Hamarastan. He later became a physician in the Mughal court and raised health concerns after smoking tobacco became popular among Indian noblemen. He subsequently envisaged a system that allowed smoke to be passed through water in order to be &#x27;purified&#x27;. Gilani introduced the &quot;ḡalyān&quot; after Asad Beg, the ambassador of Bijapur, encouraged Akbar I to take up smoking. Following popularity among noblemen, this new device for smoking soon became a status symbol for the Indian aristocracy and gentry.

==Modern development==
Instead of copper, brass and low-quality alloys, manufacturers increasingly use stainless steel and aluminium. Silicone rubber compounds are used for hookah hoses instead of leather and wire. New materials make modern hookahs more durable, eliminate odors while smoking and allow washing without risks of corrosion or bacterial decay. New technologies and modern design trends are changing the appearance of hookahs. Despite the obvious benefits of modern hookahs, because of high production cost and lack of modern equipment in traditional hookah manufacturing regions, most hookahs are still produced with older technologies.

==Culture==
===South Asia===

====India====

The concept of hookah is thought to have originated in medieval India. Once the province of the wealthy, it was tremendously popular especially during Mughal rule. The hookah has since become less popular; however, it is once again garnering the attention of the masses, and cafés and restaurants that offer it as a consumable are popular. The use of hookahs from ancient times in India was not only a custom, but a matter of prestige. Rich and landed classes would smoke hookahs.

Tobacco is smoked in hookahs in many villages as per traditional customs. Smoking tobacco-molasses is now becoming popular among the youth in India. There are several chain clubs, bars and coffee shops in India offering a wider variety of , including non-tobacco versions. In 2011, hookah was banned in Bangalore. However, it can be bought or rented for personal usage or organized parties.

Koyilandy, a small fishing town on the west coast of India, once made and exported hookahs extensively. These are known as Malabar Hookhas or Koyilandy Hookahs. Today these intricate hookahs are difficult to find outside Koyilandy and are becoming difficult even to find in Koyilandy itself.

As hookah resurges in India, there have been numerous raids and bans recently on hookah smoking, especially in Gujarat.

====Pakistan====
Although it has been traditionally prevalent in rural areas for generations, smoking hookahs has become very popular in the cosmopolitan cities of Pakistan. One can see many cafés in Pakistan offering hookah smoking to its guests. Many households even have hookahs for smoking or decoration purposes.

In Punjab, Pakhtunkhwa, and in northern Balochistan, the topmost part on which coals are placed is called &quot;chillum&quot;.

In big cities like Karachi and Lahore, cafes and restaurants offered Hookah and charged per hour. In 2013, it was banned by the Pakistan Supreme court. The cafe owners started offering shisha to minors, which was the major reason for the ban.

====Bangladesh====
The hookah () has been a traditional smoking instrument in Bangladesh, particularly among the old Bengali Muslim zamindar gentry. However, flavoured shisha was introduced in the early 2000s. Hookah lounges spread quite quickly between 2008 and 2011 in urban areas and became popular among young people as well as middle-aged people as a relaxation method. There have been allegations of a government crack-down on hookah bars to prevent illicit drug usage. The hookah is also an electoral symbol for a candidate used first in the 1973 Bangladeshi general election. In the biography of Mountstuart Elphinstone, it is mentioned that James Achilles Kirkpatrick had a &quot;hookah-bardar&quot; (hookah servant/preparer) during his time in the Indian subcontinent. Kirkpatrick&#x27;s hookah servant is said to have robbed and cheated Kirkpatrick, making his way to England and stylising himself as the &quot;Prince of Sylhet&quot;. The man was waited upon by the Prime Minister of Great Britain William Pitt the Younger, and then dined with the Duke of York before presenting himself in front of George III.

====Nepal====

&quot;Hookahs&quot; (हुक़्क़ा), especially wooden ones, are popular in Nepal. Use of hookahs has been usually considered to symbolize an elite family status in Nepali history. 

Nowadays, the cities of Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dharan have special hookah bars. Although hookahs have started becoming popular among younger people and tourists, the overall number of hookah smokers is likely dwindling owing to the widespread availability of cheaper cigarettes.

===Middle East===

In the Arab world and the Middle East, people smoke waterpipes as part of their culture and traditions. Local names of waterpipe in the Middle East are, argila, čelam/čelīm, ḡalyān or ghalyan, ḥoqqa, nafas, nargile, and shisha.

Social smoking is done with a single or double hose hookah, and sometimes even triple or quadruple hose hookahs are used at parties or small get-togethers. When the smoker is finished, they either place the hose back on the table, signifying that it is available, or hand it from one user to the next, folded back on itself so that the mouthpiece is not pointing at the recipient.

Most cafés in the Middle East offer shishas. Cafés are widespread and are among the chief social gathering places in the Arab world (akin to public houses in Britain).

====Gaza====

In 2010 the Hamas-led Islamist government of Gaza imposed a ban on women smoking hookahs in public. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry explained that &quot;It is inappropriate for a woman to sit cross-legged and smoke in public. It harms the image of our people.&quot; The ban was soon lifted later that year and women returned to smoking in popular venues like the cafe of Gaza&#x27;s Crazy Water Park.

====Iran====
The exact date of the first use of ḡalyān in Iran is not known. However, the earliest known literary evidence of the hookah, anywhere, comes in a quatrain by Ahlī Shirazi (d. 1535), a Persian poet, referring to the use of the ḡalyān, thus dating its use at least as early as the time of the Shah Ṭahmāsp I. This suggests, the hookah was already in use in ancient Persia, and it made its way into India soon afterward.

Although the Safavid Shah ʿAbbās I strongly condemned tobacco use, towards the end of his reign smoking ḡalyān and čopoq had become common on every level of the society, women included. In schools, both teachers and students had ḡalyāns while lessons continued. Shah Safi of Persia (r. 1629–42) declared a complete ban on tobacco, but the income received from its use persuaded him to soon revoke the ban. The use of ḡalyāns became so widespread that a group of poor people became professional tinkers of crystal water pipes. During the time of Abbas II of Persia (r. 1642–1666), use of the water pipe had become a national addiction. The shah (king) had his own private ḡalyān servants. Evidently the position of water pipe tender (ḡalyāndār) dates from this time. Also at this time, reservoirs were made of glass, pottery, or a type of gourd. Because of the unsatisfactory quality of indigenous glass, glass reservoirs were sometimes imported from Venice. In the time of Suleiman I of Persia (r. 1694–1722), ḡalyāns became more elaborately embellished as their use increased. The wealthy owned gold and silver pipes. The masses spent more on ḡalyāns than they did on the necessities of life.

An emissary of Sultan Husayn (r. 1722–32) to the court of Louis XV of France, on his way to the royal audience at Versailles, had in his retinue an officer holding his ḡalyān, which he used while his carriage was in motion. We have no record indicating the use of ḡalyān at the court of Nader Shah, although its use seems to have continued uninterrupted. There are portraits of Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty of Iran and Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar that depict them smoking the ḡalyān.
Iranians have a special tobacco called &quot;Khansar&quot; (خانسار, presumably name of the origin city, Khvansar). The charcoals would be put on the Khansar without foil.

The Iranian Shia marja&#x27; Mirza Shirazi issued his historical fatwa: &quot;In the name of God, the Merciful, the Beneficent. Today the use of both varieties of tobacco, in whatever fashion is reckoned war against the Imam of the Age – may God hasten his advent.&quot; The fatwa sparked a huge movement to the extent that even in the private quarters of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–1896), hookahs were broken.

====Saudi Arabia====
In 2014, Saudi Arabia was in the process of implementing general smoking bans in public places. This included shishas. Currently, hookah remains legal in the country, with some restaurants charging customers extra fees.

====Syria====
Although perceived to be an important cultural feature of Syria (see Smoking in Syria), narghile had declined in popularity during most of the twentieth century and was used mostly by older men. Similar to other Middle Eastern countries, its use increased dramatically during the 1990s, particularly among youth and young adults. As of 2004, prior to the Syrian civil war, 17% of 18- to 29-year-olds, 10% of 30- to 45-year-olds, and 6% of 46- to 65-year-olds reported using narghile, and use was higher in men than women. More recent data is not available.

====Turkey and the Balkans====
&quot;Nargile&quot; became part of Turkish and Balkan culture from the 17th century. Back then, it became prominent in society and was used as a status symbol. &quot;Nargile&quot; was such an important Turkish custom that it even sparked a diplomatic crisis between France and the Ottoman Empire. Western Turkey is noted for its traditional pottery production where potters make earthenware objects, including &quot;nargile&quot; bowls.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, the hookah, where it is predominantly called shisha, was particularly used within the Arab and Indian communities.

Hookah was virtually unknown in Southeast Asia before the latter 20th century, yet the popularity among contemporary younger people is now vastly growing. Southeast Asia&#x27;s most cosmopolitan cities, Makati, Bangkok, Singapore (now banned), Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, now have various bars and clubs that offer hookahs to patrons.

Although hookah use has been common for hundreds of years and enjoyed by people of all ages, it has recently started to become a youth pastime in Asia. Hookahs are most popular with college students, and young adults, who may be underage and thus unable to purchase cigarettes.

===Kenya===
The hookah is called shisha in Kenya. They are officially banned in the country. Despite this, many clubs still continue to defy the law and hookah smoking goes on in urban areas.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, hookah, colloquially known as a &quot;hubbly bubbly&quot; or an &quot;okka pipe&quot;, is popular among the Cape Malay and Indian populations, wherein it is smoked as a social pastime. However, hookah is seeing increasing popularity with South Africans, especially the youth. Bars that additionally provide hookahs are becoming more prominent, although smoking is normally done at home or in public spaces such as beaches and picnic sites.

In South Africa, the terminology of the various hookah components also differ from other countries. The clay &quot;head/bowl&quot; is known as a &quot;clay pot&quot;. The hoses are called &quot;pipes&quot; and the air release valve is known as a &quot;clutch&quot;.

The windcover (which is considered optional for outside use) is known as an &quot;As-jas&quot;, which directly translates from Afrikaans to English as an &quot;ash-jacket&quot;. Also, making/preparing the &quot;clay pot&quot; is commonly referred to as &quot;racking the hubbly&quot;.

Some scientists point to the marijuana pipe as an African origin of hookah.

===United States and Canada===


During the 1960s and 1970s, hookahs were a popular tool for the consumption of various derivations of tobacco, among other things. At parties or small gatherings the hookah hose was passed around with users partaking as they saw fit. Typically, though, open flames were used instead of burning coals.

Today, hookahs are readily available for sale at smoke shops and some gas stations across the United States, along with a variety of tobacco brands and accessories. In addition to private hookah smoking, hookah lounges or bars have opened in cities across the country.

Recently, certain cities, counties, and states have implemented indoor smoking bans. In some jurisdictions, hookah businesses can be exempted from the policies through special permits. Some permits, however, have requirements such as the business earning a certain minimum percentage of their revenue from alcohol or tobacco.

In cities with indoor smoking bans, hookah bars have been forced to close or switch to tobacco-free mixtures. In many cities, though, hookah lounges have been growing in popularity. From the year 2000 to 2004, over 200 new hookah cafés opened for business, most of them targeted at young adults and located near college campuses or cities with large Middle-Eastern communities. This activity continues to gain popularity within the post-secondary student demographic. Hookah use among high school students declined from 9.4% to 3.4% from 2014 to 2019 while cigarette smoking decreased from 9.2% to 5.8% during this same time period, according to the US CDC. According to a 2018 study, 1.1% of students with some college but no degree, an associate degree or an undergraduate degree reported waterpipe or pipe tobacco product use either every day or some days. As of November 2017, at least 2,082 college or university campuses in the U.S. have adopted 100% smokefree campus policies that attempt to eliminate smoking in indoor and outdoor areas across the entire campus, including residences.

In the United States, the prevalence of hookah use has been noted in a 2019 article to be increasing, particularly among certain states with larger populations of Arab Americans. The use of hookah is more common in urban areas compared to rural areas, and this trend is influenced by factors like availability in public spaces such as cafés and restaurants, as well as cultural and social influences.

==Operation==
The jar at the bottom of the hookah is filled with water sufficient to submerge a few centimeters (an inch or two) of the body tube, which is sealed tightly to it. Deeper water will only increase the inhalation force needed to use it. Tobacco or tobacco-free molasses are placed inside the bowl at the top of the hookah. Often the bowl is covered with perforated tin foil or a metal screen and coal placed on top. The foil or screen separates the coal and the tobacco, with the foil and the tobacco reaching maximum temperatures of 450 and 130 degrees Celsius (850 °F and 270 °F) respectively. These temperatures are too low to sustain combustion and considerably lower than the 900 degrees Celsius (1700 °F) found in cigarettes. A larger fraction of the smoke condensates of the hookah are produced by simple distillation rather than by pyrolysis and combustion, and as a result, would tend to carry considerably less of the pyrosynthesized compounds found in cigarette smoke.

As a result of suction through the hose, a vacuum is created in the headspace of the water bowl sufficient to overcome the small static head of the water above the inlet pipe, causing the smoke to bubble into the bowl. At the same time, air is drawn over and heated by the coals. It then passes through the tobacco mixture where due to hot air convection and thermal conduction from the coal, the mainstream aerosol is produced. The vapor is passed down through the body tube that extends into the water in the jar. It bubbles up through the water, losing heat, and fills the top part of the jar, to which the hose is attached. When a user inhales from the hose, smoke passes into the lungs, and the change in pressure in the jar pulls more air through the charcoal, continuing the process.
Vapour that has collected in the bowl above the waterline may be exhausted through a purge valve, if present. This one-way valve is opened by the positive pressure created from gently blowing into the hose.

==Health effects==
=== Exposure to toxic chemicals ===
Tobacco smoke contains toxic chemicals, including carcinogens (chemicals that cause cancer). Water does not filter out many of these chemicals. The toxic chemicals come from the burning of the charcoal, tobacco, and flavorings. These chemicals can lead to cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and other health problems. 
The toxic chemicals include tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo[a]pyrene and anthracene), volatile aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein), benzene, nitric oxide, heavy metals (arsenic, chromium, lead), and carbon monoxide (CO). Hookah smoking also increases the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) in a person&#x27;s body to eight times their normal level. Compared to smoking one cigarette, a single hookah session exposes users to more carbon monoxide and PAHs, similar levels of nicotine, and lower levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines. By inhaling these chemicals, hookah smokers are at increased risk of many of the same health problems as cigarette smokers. An average hookah smoking session smokers inhale 100–200 times more smoke inhaled smoking a single cigarette.

=== Exposure to pathogens that cause infectious diseases ===
When people share a hookah, there is a risk of spreading infectious diseases such as oral herpes, tuberculosis, hepatitis, influenza, and &quot;H. pylori&quot;. Using personal disposable mouthpieces may reduce this risk, but does not eliminate it.

=== Addiction to and dependence on hookah ===
Hookah smokers inhale nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. A typical hookah smoking session delivers 1.7 times the nicotine dose of one cigarette and the nicotine absorption rate in daily waterpipe users is equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes per day. Many hookah smokers, especially frequent users, have urges to smoke and show other withdrawal symptoms after not smoking for some time, and it can be difficult to quit. People who become addicted to hookah may be more likely to smoke alone. Hookah smokers who are addicted may find it easier to quit if they have help from a quit-smoking counseling program.

=== Short-term health effects ===
Carbon monoxide (CO) in hookah smoke binds to hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported to organs including the brain. There are several case reports in the medical literature of hookah smokers needing treatment in hospital emergency rooms for symptoms of CO poisoning including headache, nausea, lethargy, and fainting. This is sometimes called &quot;hookah sickness&quot;. Hookah smoking can damage the cardiovascular system in several ways. Its use elevates heart rate and blood pressure. It also impairs baroreflex control (which helps to control blood pressure) and cardiac autonomic functioning (which has many purposes, including control of heart rate) Hookah use also acutely harms vascular functioning, increases inflammation, and harms lung function and reduces the ability to exercise.

=== Long-term health effects ===
Current evidence indicates hookah causes numerous health problems. Hookah smoking is associated with increased risk of several cancers (lung, esophageal, and gastric), pulmonary diseases (impaired pulmonary function, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema), coronary artery disease, periodontal disease, obstetrical and perinatal problems (low birth weight and pulmonary problems at birth), larynx and voice changes, and osteoporosis. Many of the studies to date have methodological limitations, such as not measuring hookah use in a standardized way. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to learn more about the long-term health effects of hookah use and of exposure to hookah smoke. Oral health is also affected, notably dental and periodontal status.

=== Effects of secondhand exposure to hookah smoke ===
Secondhand smoke from hookahs contains significant amounts of carbon monoxide, aldehydes, PAHs, ultrafine particles, and respirable particulate matter (particles small enough to enter the lungs). Studies have found that concentrations of particulate matter in the air of hookah bars were in the unhealthy to hazardous range according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. The air in hookah bars also contains significant amounts of toxic chemicals, including aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nicotine, and trace metals. The concentrations in the air of all these toxic substances are greater than for cigarettes (for the same number of smokers per hour). During a typical one-hour hookah session, a user expels into the air 2-10 times the amount of cancer-causing chemicals and other harmful chemicals compared to a cigarette smoker. No studies have examined the long-term health effects of exposure to secondhand hookah smoke, but short term effects may include experience respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, nasal congestion, and chronic cough.

<text>Roger Lea MacBride (August 6, 1929 – March 5, 1995) was an American lawyer, political figure, and writer. After working as a lawyer early in his career, he inherited the estate of Laura Ingalls Wilder. He wrote several books in her &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; series and initiated the development of its television adaptation.

In politics, MacBride served a single term as a Republican member of the Vermont House of Representatives in the 1960s. When serving as a Republican presidential elector in Virginia in 1972, he defected from his pledged vote and became a faithless elector, casting a vote for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s inaugural ticket of John Hospers for president and Tonie Nathan for vice president. Four years later, the party nominated him as their presidential candidate.

==Background==
MacBride was born in 1929 in New Rochelle, New York, the son of Elise Fairfax (Lea) and William Burt MacBride, an editor. He called himself &quot;the adopted grandson&quot; of a family friend, writer and libertarian political theorist Rose Wilder Lane, whom he met when he was 14 years of age. Lane, daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder, noted author of the &quot;Little House&quot; series of books, designated MacBride as her &quot;political disciple,&quot; executor, and sole heir.

MacBride was a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School.

==Law career==
MacBride worked for White &amp; Case, a law firm on Wall Street, for several years before opening a small practice in Vermont. By the mid-1970s, MacBride had relocated to Virginia and was no longer practicing law full time.

==Writing and television producing career==
MacBride was designated by Rose Wilder Lane as her heir. He gained control of her literary estate on her death in 1968. In 1971 he published &quot;The First Four Years&quot;. In 1974 he edited and published Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s letters to her husband Almanzo as &quot;West From Home&quot;. He approved the creation of the television series in the 1970s. He was the credited author of a fictionalized series on the life of Rose Wilder Lane. He was author of record for three additional &quot;Little House&quot; books and launched the &quot;Rocky Ridge Years&quot; series of children&#x27;s novels, describing Lane&#x27;s Ozark childhood. He published two books on constitutional law, &quot;The American Electoral College&quot; and &quot;Treaties versus the Constitution&quot;, and authored a Libertarian Party manifesto: &quot;A New Dawn for America: The Libertarian Challenge&quot;.

In the 1970s, MacBride co-created the television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and served as a co-producer for the show.

==Political career==

===Vermont politics===
MacBride was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1962 and served one term. While in the state legislature, he proposed the abolition of the state college system.

Running as a Goldwater Republican, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican Party nomination for Governor of Vermont in 1964.

===1972 electoral vote===
MacBride was the treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia in 1972 and one of the party&#x27;s electors when Richard Nixon won the popular vote for his second term as president of the United States. MacBride, however, as a &quot;faithless elector,&quot; voted for the nominees of the Libertarian Party: presidential candidate John Hospers and vice-presidential candidate Tonie Nathan. In doing so, MacBride made Nathan the first woman in U.S. history to receive an Electoral College vote. Political pundit David Boaz later commented in &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine that MacBride was &quot;faithless to Nixon and Agnew, anyway, but faithful to the constitutional principles Rose Wilder Lane had instilled in him.&quot;

===1976 presidential campaign===

After casting his electoral vote in 1972, MacBride gained favor within the fledgling Libertarian Party, which had been founded the previous year. As the Libertarian presidential nominee in 1976, he achieved ballot access in 32 states, campaigning on a platform of support for a free market system, a return to the gold standard, the abolition of the Federal Reserve, an end to corporate welfare, the abolition of the FCC, a foreign policy of non-interventionism, and the abolition of victimless crimes. MacBride and his running mate David Bergland received 172,553 (0.2%) popular votes but no electoral votes. His best performance was in Alaska, where he received 6,785 votes, or nearly 5.5%.

===Republican Liberty Caucus===
MacBride rejoined the Republican Party in the 1980s and helped establish the Republican Liberty Caucus, a group promoting libertarian principles within the Republican Party.
He chaired this group from 1992 until his death in 1995.

==Personal life and death==
MacBride married Susan Ford. They then adopted a baby whom they named Abigail MacBride.

MacBride died of heart failure at his home in Miami Beach, Florida, on March 5, 1995, at the age of 65. He willed his estate, including the rights to the &quot;Little House&quot; franchise, to his daughter. In 1999, this was challenged by the public library system of Wright County, Missouri, containing the Laura Ingalls Wilder Library in Wilder&#x27;s hometown of Mansfield; they contended that her will gave her daughter ownership of the literary estate for her lifetime only, and that all rights should have reverted to the library after Rose Wilder Lane&#x27;s death in 1968. The estate was estimated to be worth around $100 million at the time. In 2001, a settlement was reached in which the Wright County library system was paid $875,000, but control of the estate remained with the MacBride family.

In an obituary for MacBride, David Boaz wrote: &quot;In some ways he was the last living link to the best of the Old Right, the rugged-individualist, anti-New Deal, anti-interventionist spirit of Rep. Howard Buffett, Albert Jay Nock, H. L. Mencken, Isabel Paterson, and Lane.&quot;

<doc id="168183" wikidata="Q3849662" url="?curid=168183" title="Transhuman">
<text>Transhuman, or trans-human, is the concept of an intermediary form between human and posthuman. In other words, a transhuman is a being that resembles a human in most respects but who has powers and abilities beyond those of standard humans. These abilities might include improved intelligence, awareness, strength, and/or durability. Transhumans appear in science-fiction, sometimes as cyborgs or genetically-enhanced humans.

== History of hypotheses ==
In his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante Alighieri coined the word &quot;trasumanar&quot; meaning &quot;to transcend human nature, to pass beyond human nature&quot; in the first canto of Paradiso.

The use of the term &quot;transhuman&quot; goes back to French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who wrote in his 1949 book &quot;The Future of Mankind&quot;.

And in a 1951 unpublished revision of the same book:

In 1957 book &quot;New Bottles for New Wine&quot;, English evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley wrote:

One of the first professors of futurology, FM-2030, who taught &quot;new concepts of the Human&quot; at The New School of New York City in the 1960s, used &quot;transhuman&quot; as shorthand for &quot;transitional human&quot;. Calling transhumans the &quot;earliest manifestation of new evolutionary beings&quot;, FM argued that signs of transhumans included physical and mental augmentations including prostheses, reconstructive surgery, intensive use of telecommunications, a cosmopolitan outlook and a globetrotting lifestyle, androgyny, mediated reproduction (such as in vitro fertilisation), absence of religious beliefs, and a rejection of traditional family values.

FM-2030 used the concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition, outside the confines of academia, in his contributing final chapter to the 1972 anthology &quot;Woman, Year 2000&quot;. In the same year, American cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger contributed to conceptualization of &quot;transhumanity&quot; in his book &quot;Man into Superman&quot;. In 1982, American Natasha Vita-More authored a statement titled &quot;Transhumanist Arts Statement&quot; and outlined what she perceived as an emerging transhuman culture.

Jacques Attali, writing in 2006, envisaged transhumans as an altruistic vanguard of the later 21st century:
Vanguard players (I shall call them &quot;transhumans&quot;) will run (they are already running) &quot;relational enterprises&quot; in which profit will be no more than a hindrance, not a final goal. Each of these transhumans will be altruistic, a citizen of the planet, at once nomadic and sedentary, his neighbor&#x27;s equal in rights and obligations, hospitable and respectful of the world. Together, transhumans will give birth to planetary institutions and change the course of industrial enterprises.
In March 2007, American physicist Gregory Cochran and paleoanthropologist John Hawks published a study, alongside other recent research on which it builds, which amounts to a radical reappraisal of traditional views, which tended to assume that humans have reached an evolutionary endpoint. Physical anthropologist Jeffrey McKee argued the new findings of accelerated evolution bear out predictions he made in a 2000 book &quot;The Riddled Chain&quot;. Based on computer models, he argued that evolution should speed up as a population grows because population growth creates more opportunities for new mutations; and the expanded population occupies new environmental niches, which would drive evolution in new directions. Whatever the implications of the recent findings, McKee concludes that they highlight a ubiquitous point about evolution: &quot;every species is a transitional species&quot;.

== Transhumans in fiction ==
Examples of transhuman entities in fiction exist within many popular video games. For example, the &quot;Bioshock&quot; media franchise depicts individuals receiving doses of a substance called ADAM, harvested from a fictional type of sea slugs, able to give the user fantastical powers through genetic engineering. Thus, previously standard humans can gain the ability to summon ice, wield lightning, turn invisible, and commit other seeming miracles due to their enhancement.

A 2014 article from &quot;Ars Technica&quot; speculated that mutating clumps of mobile genetic elements known as &quot;transposons&quot; could possibly be used as a semi-parasitic tool to raise people to a higher status in terms of their abilities, making at least part of the game&#x27;s scenario theoretically plausible. Similar commentary later occurred from gamers with the advent of CRISPR gene editing.

Transhumans also have played a major role in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. For example, in &quot;Space Seed&quot;, the twenty-second episode of the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; that initially aired on February 16, 1967, a charismatic and physically intimidating genius called Khan Noonien Singh attempts to take control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; operated by the show&#x27;s protagonists. The selectively bred individual had advanced beyond simple human status and nearly succeeds. The starship&#x27;s crew opt to exile the leader and his league of similar beings to a habitable but isolated alien planet instead of assigning a true punishment per se, a ruling which he accepts without protest. Played by Ricardo Montalbán, Khan returns in the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, which broadly serves as a sequel to the episode. References to &quot;Space Seed&quot; appear in episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, and the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; as well.

<doc id="168185" wikidata="Q684995" url="?curid=168185" title="Sleeper ship">
<text>A sleeper ship is a hypothetical type of crewed spacecraft, or starship in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of hibernation or suspended animation. The only known technology that allows long-term suspended animation of humans is the freezing of early-stage human embryos through embryo cryopreservation, which is behind the concept of embryo space colonization.

==Description==
The most common role of sleeper ships in fiction is for interstellar or intergalactic travel, usually at sub-light speed. Travel times for such journeys could reach into the hundreds or thousands of years, making some form of life extension, such as suspended animation, necessary for the original crew to live to see their destination. Suspended animation is also required on ships that cannot be used as generation ships.

Freezing the astronauts would probably involve whole-body vitrification and would, most likely, be frozen at 145 kelvins to reduce the risk of fracturing.

Suspended animation can also be useful to reduce the consumption of life support system resources by crew members who are not needed during the trip, or by an author as a plot device, and for this reason, sleeper ships sometimes also appear in contexts involving travel within the solar system or any other system of planets orbiting one star.

== Examples in fiction ==
There are numerous examples of sleeper ships in science fiction literature and films. Some of the best-known examples are:

* &quot;Far Centaurus&quot;, published in &quot;&quot; by AE van Vogt
* The interplanetary sleeper ship USSC &quot;Discovery One&quot; is one of the main subjects of the whole &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; franchise. As it is told in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, six crew members are on the spacecraft: Commander &quot;Dave&quot; Bowman and Frank Poole were de-hibernated before the others; Victor Kaminsky, Jack Kimball and Charles Hunter were killed by the sixth member: the psychopathic artificial intelligence HAL 9000.
* &quot;Pandorum&quot;
* The TV series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; used a sleeper ship, the &quot;Jupiter II&quot;, intended to hold the crew for the five-and-a-half-year journey to Alpha Centauri. Dr. Smith, a saboteur and accidental stowaway, is forced to revive the crew to save the ship from meteors. 
* The film &quot;Lost in Space&quot; in which the suspended animation system fails, bringing the crew of &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; out of sleep prematurely.
* &quot;Nostromo&quot; – The sleeper/cargo ship in the film &quot;Alien&quot;.
* &quot;Sulaco&quot; – The sleeper/war ship in the film &quot;Aliens&quot;.
* The &quot;Hunter-Gratzner&quot; in the film &quot;Pitch Black&quot; transports a number of its passengers in cryostasis.
* &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;
* &quot;Avatar&quot;
* &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; – A ship is found with its crew in cryostasis.
* &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; – The crew of the &quot;Destiny&quot; enter stasis in order to sleep during a potentially millennia-long trip.
* &quot;Prometheus&quot;
* SS &quot;Botany Bay&quot;, a sleeper ship from the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Space Seed&quot; (it is also mentioned in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;), transporting a crew including Khan Noonien Singh. One (Star Trek: Voyager) illustrates a similar technique.
* Called a &quot;sail-ship&quot; by Cordwainer Smith in &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot;
* &quot;Cargo&quot;
* &quot;New Mayflower&quot; and &quot;Ark&quot; from Frederik Pohl&#x27;s novel &quot;The World at the End of Time&quot;
* &quot;After Earth&quot;
* &quot;Homeworld&quot;
* &quot;Freelancer&quot; – Five sleeper ships built by the Alliance: the Bretonia, the Rheinland, the Hispania, the Kusari and the Liberty. Of these five, all but the Hispania go on to found different star systems, each named after them: the Hispania can be found in the game as an abandoned derelict, the descendants of its passengers having become the &quot;Outcast&quot; and &quot;Corsair&quot; pirate factions.
* The space station-starship hybrid &quot;Endurance&quot; from &quot;Interstellar&quot; is used by NASA astronauts to travel through a wormhole to another galaxy in order to find a new planet for humanity or bomb the planet with human embryos.
* &quot;Event Horizon&quot; – The vessel &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; is dispatched to find what happened to the ship &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. The Crew is put in hibernation. 
* In the official trailer of the video game &quot;&quot;, a sleeper ship was seen sending humans from Earth to an alien planet.
* &quot;Mass Effect Andromeda&quot; – Representatives of the human race, in addition to that of other Milky Way Galaxy races, travel to the Andromeda Galaxy aboard a series of arks, with the aim of colonizing a series of new homeworlds. The travel time is only 600 years due to the discovery of a form of faster-than-light travel that cuts down the time to traverse the 2.5 million light years between galaxies (by comparison, it is mentioned in the game that a cargo vessel, also sent in the direction of Andromeda, will not arrive for more than two million years.)
* &quot;Halo&quot;
* &quot;Hyperion&quot;, a novel by Dan Simmons. The Seed Ships are a type of slower than light travel that put the passengers into a fugue-like state for the length of the trip.
* &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Vault&quot;
* &quot;Passengers&quot; – It features the sleeper ship &quot;Avalon&quot;. The suspended animation system, which keeps 5,000 passengers in hibernation on board the &quot;Avalon&quot; during its 120-year trip to the planet Homestead II, fails as a result of asteroid collisions causing a mechanical engineer to be awoken prematurely.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; – The US president and some of her inner circle escape an extinction event where a large comet hits the Earth.

<doc id="168187" wikidata="Q2488994" url="?curid=168187" title="Sentience">
<text>Sentience is the ability to experience feelings and sensations. It may not necessarily imply higher cognitive functions such as awareness, reasoning, or complex thought processes. Sentience is an important concept in ethics, as the ability to experience happiness or suffering often forms a basis for determining which entities deserve moral consideration, particularly in utilitarianism.

Some writers define sentience exclusively as the capacity for &quot;valenced&quot; (positive or negative) mental experiences, such as pain or pleasure. Others differentiate between the mere ability to perceive sensations, such as light or pain, and the ability to perceive emotions, such as fear or grief.

In Asian religions, the word &quot;sentience&quot; has been used to translate a variety of concepts. In science fiction, &quot;sentience&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;sapience&quot;, &quot;self-awareness&quot;, or &quot;consciousness&quot;.

== Sentience in philosophy ==
&quot;Sentience&quot; was first coined by philosophers in the 1630s for the concept of an ability to feel, derived from Latin &quot;sentiens&quot; (feeling). In philosophy, different authors draw different distinctions between consciousness and sentience. According to Antonio Damasio, sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness, such as creativity, intelligence, sapience, self-awareness, and intentionality (the ability to have thoughts about something). These further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience, which is the capacity to feel sensations and emotions.

===Consciousness===
According to Thomas Nagel in his paper &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot;, consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them, &quot;qualia&quot;—in other words, the ability to have states that it &quot;feels like something&quot; to be in. Some philosophers, notably Colin McGinn, believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood, a position known as &quot;new mysterianism&quot;. They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that qualia will never be explained. Other philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, argue that qualia is not a meaningful concept.

Regarding animal consciousness, the Cambridge Declaration of Consciousness, publicly proclaimed on 7 July 2012 at Cambridge University, states that many non-human animals possess the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states, and can exhibit intentional behaviors. The declaration notes that all vertebrates (including fish and reptiles) have this neurological substrate for consciousness, and that there is strong evidence that many invertebrates also have it.

==== Phenomenal vs. affective consciousness====

David Chalmers argues that sentience is sometimes used as shorthand for &quot;phenomenal consciousness&quot;, the capacity to have any subjective experience at all, but sometimes refers to the narrower concept of &quot;affective consciousness&quot;, the capacity to experience subjective states that have affective valence (i.e., a positive or negative character), such as pain and pleasure.

===Sentience quotient===
The sentience quotient concept was introduced by Robert A. Freitas Jr. in the late 1970s. It defines sentience as the relationship between the information processing rate of each individual processing unit (neuron), the weight/size of a single unit, and the total number of processing units (expressed as mass). It was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe. On a logarithmic scale it runs from −70 up to +50.

==Eastern religions==

Eastern religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism recognise non-humans as sentient beings. The term &quot;sentient beings&quot; is translated from various Sanskrit terms (&quot;jantu, bahu jana, jagat, sattva&quot;) and &quot;conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra)&quot;. It is related to the concept of ahimsa, non-violence toward other beings. In some forms of Buddhism, plants, stones and other inanimate objects are considered to be &#x27;sentient&#x27;. In Jainism many things are endowed with a soul, &quot;jīva&quot;, which is sometimes translated as &#x27;sentience&#x27;. Some things are without a soul, &quot;ajīva&quot;, such as a chair or spoon. There are different rankings of &quot;jīva&quot; based on the number of senses it has. Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch.

Sentience in Buddhism is the state of having senses. In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of Skandha. Thus, an animal qualifies as a sentient being. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In Mahayana Buddhism, which includes Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, the concept is related to the Bodhisattva, an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first vow of a Bodhisattva states, &quot;Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them.&quot;

==Animal welfare, rights, and sentience==
Sentience has been a central concept in the animal rights movement, tracing back to the well-known writing of Jeremy Bentham in &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;: &quot;The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?&quot;

Richard D. Ryder defines sentientism broadly as the position according to which an entity has moral status if and only if it is sentient. In David Chalmer&#x27;s more specific terminology, Bentham is a &quot;narrow sentientist&quot;, since his criterion for moral status is not only the ability to experience any phenomenal consciousness at all, but specifically the ability to experience conscious states with negative affective valence (i.e. suffering). Animal welfare and rights advocates often invoke similar capacities. For example, the documentary &quot;Earthlings&quot; argues that while animals do not have all the desires and ability to comprehend as do humans, they do share the desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain.

Animal-welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled, at a minimum, to protection from unnecessary suffering, though animal-rights advocates may differ on what rights (e.g., the right to life) may be entailed by simple sentience.

Gary Francione also bases his abolitionist theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer&#x27;s, on sentience. He asserts that, &quot;All sentient beings, humans or nonhuman, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others.&quot;

Andrew Linzey, a British theologian, considers that Christianity should regard sentient animals according to their intrinsic worth, rather than their utility to humans.

In 1997 the concept of animal sentience was written into the basic law of the European Union. The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are &quot;sentient beings&quot;, and requires the EU and its member states to &quot;pay full regards to the welfare requirements of animals&quot;.

=== Indicators of sentience ===

Nociception is the process by which the nervous system detects and responds to potentially harmful stimuli, leading to the sensation of pain. It involves specialized receptors called nociceptors that sense damage or threat and send signals to the brain. Nociception is widespread among animals, even among insects.

The presence of nociception indicates an organism&#x27;s ability to detect harmful stimuli. A further question is whether the way these noxious stimuli are processed within the brain leads to a subjective experience of pain. To address that, researchers often look for behavioral cues. For example, &quot;if a dog with an injured paw whimpers, licks the wound, limps, lowers pressure on the paw while walking, learns to avoid the place where the injury happened and seeks out analgesics when offered, we have reasonable grounds to assume that the dog is indeed experiencing something unpleasant.&quot; Avoiding painful stimuli unless the reward is significant can also provide evidence that pain avoidance is not merely an unconscious reflex (similarly to how humans &quot;can choose to press a hot door handle to escape a burning building&quot;).

=== Sentient animals ===
Animals such as pigs, chickens, and fish are typically recognized as sentient. There is more uncertainty regarding insects, and findings on certain insect species may not be applicable to others.

Historically, fish were not considered sentient, and their behaviors were often viewed as &quot;reflexes or complex, unconscious species-typical responses&quot; to their environment. Their dissimilarity with humans, including the absence of a direct equivalent of the neocortex in their brain, was used as an argument against sentience. Jennifer Jacquet suggests that the belief that fish do not feel pain originated in response to a 1980s policy aimed at banning catch and release. The range of animals regarded by scientists as sentient or conscious has progressively widened, now including animals such as fish, lobsters and octopus.

== Digital sentience ==
Digital sentience (or artificial sentience) means the sentience of artificial intelligences. The question of whether artificial intelligences can be sentient is controversial. 

The AI research community does not consider sentience (that is, the &quot;ability to feel sensations&quot;) as an important research goal, unless it can be shown that consciously &quot;feeling&quot; a sensation can make a machine more intelligent than just receiving input from sensors and processing it as information. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig wrote in 2021: &quot;We are interested in programs that behave intelligently. Individual aspects of consciousness—awareness, self-awareness, attention—can be programmed and can be part of an intelligent machine. The additional project making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.&quot; 
Indeed, leading AI textbooks do not mention &quot;sentience&quot; at all.

Digital sentience is of considerable interest to the philosophy of mind. Functionalist philosophers consider that sentience is about &quot;causal roles&quot; played by mental states, which involve information processing. In this view, the physical substrate of this information processing does not need to be biological, so there is no theoretical barrier to the possibility of sentient machines. According to type physicalism however, the physical constitution is important; and depending on the types of physical systems required for sentience, it may or may not be possible for certain types of machines (such as electronic computing devices) to be sentient.

The discussion on the topic of alleged sentience of artificial intelligence has been reignited in 2022 by the claims made about Google&#x27;s LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) artificial intelligence system that it is &quot;sentient&quot; and had a &quot;soul&quot;. LaMDA is an artificial intelligence system that creates chatbots—AI robots designed to communicate with humans—by gathering vast amounts of text from the internet and using algorithms to respond to queries in the most fluid and natural way possible. The transcripts of conversations between scientists and LaMDA reveal that the AI system excels at this, providing answers to challenging topics about the nature of emotions, generating Aesop-style fables on cue, and even describing its alleged fears.

Nick Bostrom considers that while LaMDA is probably not sentient, being very sure of it would require understanding how consciousness works, having access to unpublished information about LaMDA&#x27;s architecture, and finding how to apply the philosophical theory to the machine. He also said about LLMs that &quot;it&#x27;s not doing them justice to say they&#x27;re simply regurgitating text&quot;, noting that they &quot;exhibit glimpses of creativity, insight and understanding that are quite impressive and may show the rudiments of reasoning&quot;. He thinks that &quot;sentience is a matter of degree&quot;.

In 2022, philosopher David Chalmers made a speech on whether large language models (LLMs) can be conscious, encouraging more research on the subject. He suggested that current LLMs were probably not conscious, but that the limitations are temporary and that future systems could be serious candidates for consciousness.

According to Jonathan Birch, &quot;measures to regulate the development of sentient AI should run ahead of what would be proportionate to the risks posed by current technology, considering also the risks posed by credible future trajectories.&quot; He is concerned that AI sentience would be particularly easy to deny, and that if achieved, humans might nevertheless continue to treat AI systems as mere tools. He notes that the linguistic behaviour of LLMs is not a reliable way to assess whether they are sentient. He suggests to apply theories of consciousness, such as the global workspace theory, to the algorithms implicitly learned by LLMs, but noted that this technique requires advances in AI interpretability to understand what happens inside. He also mentions some other pathways that may lead to AI sentience, such as the brain emulation of sentient animals.

==Notes==

a. Quote: &quot;The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&quot;

b. Quote: &quot;Granted, these animals do not have all the desires we humans have; granted, they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend; nevertheless, we and they do have some of the same desires and do comprehend some of the same things. The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain.&quot;

<text>Frank Schmalleger (born 1947) is an American criminologist, academic, and author. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.

==Early life and education==
Schmalleger was born in 1947. He received his master&#x27;s degree in 1970 and a doctorate in sociology with a specialization in criminology in 1974, from the Ohio State University. While pursuing graduate studies at the Ohio State University, Schmalleger joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officer Training Program (ROTC) and was recognized as a Distinguished Military Cadet upon graduation. He also holds a BBA degree from the University of Notre Dame.

Schmalleger is married to Ellen &quot;Willow&quot; Szirandi Schmalleger.

==Career==
Schmalleger served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War and continued his service in the U.S. Army Reserves until his discharge in 1979, attaining the rank of Captain.

Schmalleger&#x27;s academic career began in 1970 when he worked as a teaching associate in the Department of Sociology at the Ohio State University from 1970 until 1973.

From 1973 to 1975, Schmalleger worked as an assistant professor of sociology in the Department of Sociology and Social Welfare at Ohio Dominican College in Columbus, Ohio.

In 1975, Schmalleger joined the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) as an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology, Social Work, and Criminal Justice, specializing in criminal justice. He became an associate professor in 1978 and professor in 1987, after receiving tenure in 1981. Schmalleger chaired the department from 1978 to 1994.

Schmalleger also taught courses as an adjunct professor at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he contributed to the development of the university&#x27;s graduate program in security administration and loss prevention, and taught courses for over a decade. Later, he also taught in the New School for Social Research&#x27;s online graduate program, contributing to the establishment of early electronic classrooms for distance learning through computer telecommunications.

Schmalleger was the founding editor and executive editor of the journal &quot;Criminal Justice Studies&quot; from 1985 to 1990. He also reviewed books for &quot;The Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Law&quot;.

Schmalleger retired from teaching in 1994. After his retirement, he founded the Justice Research Association, where he serves as director.

Schmalleger has authored dozens of books on criminology and criminal justice, including &quot;Criminal Justice Today&quot; (Pearson); &quot;Criminal Justice: A Brief Introduction&quot; (Pearson); &quot;Criminology Today&quot; (Pearson); &quot;Constitutional Law Today&quot; (Cognella); and &quot;Corrections in the 21st Century&quot; (McGraw-Hill). An early book, &quot;The Social Basis of Criminal Justice&quot;, was reviewed in 2006 in the &quot;Justice Quarterly&quot;. His introductory texts have been dubbed &quot;The Gold Standard&quot; among criminal justice texts by his publisher, Pearson Publishing.

Schmalleger is also an active &quot;ham&quot; radio operator, holding the call sign K3UND.

<text>Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. Using their intelligence, humans are able to learn, form concepts, understand, and apply logic and reason. Human intelligence is also thought to encompass their capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate.

There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence should be conceptualized and measured. In psychometrics, human intelligence is commonly assessed by intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, although the validity of these tests is disputed. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence and social intelligence, have been proposed, and there remains significant debate as to whether these represent distinct forms of intelligence. 

There is also ongoing debate regarding how an individual&#x27;s level of intelligence is formed, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed at birth to the idea that it is malleable and can change depending on a person&#x27;s mindset and efforts.

== History ==


== Correlates ==

As a construct and as measured by intelligence tests, intelligence is one of the most useful concepts in psychology, because it correlates with many relevant variables, for instance the probability of suffering an accident, or the amount of one&#x27;s salary. Other examples include:

; Education: According to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence, education appears to be the &quot;most consistent, robust, and durable method&quot; known for raising intelligence.

; Personality: A landmark set of meta-analyses synthesizing thousands of studies including millions of people from over 50 countries found that many personality traits are intricately related to cognitive abilities. Neuroticism-related traits display the most negative relations, whereas traits like activity, industriousness, compassion, and openness are positively related to various abilities.

; Myopia: A number of studies have shown a correlation between IQ and myopia. Some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental: either people with a higher IQ are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading, or people who read more are more likely to attain a higher IQ; others contend that a genetic link exists.

; Aging: There is evidence that aging causes a decline in cognitive functions. In one cross-sectional study, various cognitive functions measured declines by about 0.8 in z-score from age 20 to age 50; the cognitive functions included speed of processing, working memory, and long-term memory.

; Genes: A number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA are correlated with higher IQ scores.

; Motivation: Motivation is a factor that influences the results of the IQ test. People with higher motivation tend to obtain higher IQ scores.

== Theories ==

=== Relevance of IQ tests ===

In psychology, human intelligence is commonly assessed by IQ scores that are determined by IQ tests. In general, higher IQ scores are associated with better outcomes in life. However, while IQ test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability, and predict certain forms of achievement effectively, their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious. While IQ tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence, they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence. According to psychologist Wayne Weiten, &quot;IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work. But if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense, the validity of IQ tests is questionable.&quot;

=== Theory of multiple intelligences ===
Howard Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies of normal children and adults, of gifted individuals (including so-called &quot;savants&quot;), of persons who have suffered brain damage, of experts and virtuosos, and of individuals from diverse cultures. Gardner breaks intelligence down into components. In the first edition of his book &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; (1983), he described seven distinct types of intelligence: logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. In a second edition, he added two more types of intelligence: naturalist and existential intelligences. He argues that psychometric (IQ) tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence. A criticism of Gardner&#x27;s theory is that it has never been tested, or subjected to peer review, by Gardner or anyone else, and indeed that it is unfalsifiable. Others (e.g. Locke, 2005) suggest that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence (specific aptitude theory) implies a political—rather than scientific—agenda, intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals, rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities. Schmidt and Hunter suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability, or &quot;g&quot;, has not received empirical support. On the other hand, Jerome Bruner agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were &quot;useful fictions&quot;, and went on to state that &quot;his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered.&quot;

=== Triarchic theory of intelligence ===
Robert Sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability. The triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence:

# Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed. 
# Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly, but not entirely, novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task. 
# Practical intelligence is bound to a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to, selection of, and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context.

The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor; instead, the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence, and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be understood.

Sternberg updated the triarchic theory and renamed it to the Theory of Successful Intelligence. He now defines intelligence as an individual&#x27;s assessment of success in life by the individual&#x27;s own (idiographic) standards and within the individual&#x27;s sociocultural context. Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills. The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence: adapting to, shaping of, and selecting of one&#x27;s environments. The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one&#x27;s strengths and compensating or correcting for one&#x27;s weaknesses.

Sternberg&#x27;s theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community.

=== PASS theory of intelligence ===
Based on A. R. Luria&#x27;s (1966) seminal work on the modularization of brain function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the PASS Theory of Intelligence (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and the following four processes: 
# Planning involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance.
# Attention is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli.
# Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle, or the difference between &quot;he had a shower before breakfast&quot; and &quot;he had breakfast before a shower.&quot;
# Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented.
These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS theory is heavily indebted both to Luria and to studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence.

=== Piaget&#x27;s theory and Neo-Piagetian theories ===
In Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a child&#x27;s mental models of the world. As a child develops, the child creates increasingly more accurate models of the world which enable the child to interact with the world more effectively. One example is object permanence with which the child develops a model in which objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched.

Piaget&#x27;s theory described four main stages and many sub-stages in the development. These four main stages are:
# sensorimotor stage (birth–2 years)
# pre-operational stage (2–7 years)
# concrete operational stage (7–11 years)
# formal operations stage (11–16 years)
Progress through these stages is correlated with, but not identical to psychometric IQ. Piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than as a capacity.

One of Piaget&#x27;s most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, &quot;Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have &#x27;more&#x27;; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly&quot;. Initially younger children were not studied, because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or because of the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.

This experiment demonstrated several results. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than previously acknowledged. Also, young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age five and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans&#x27; native inheritance.

Piaget&#x27;s theory has been criticized on the grounds that the age of appearance of a new model of the world, such as object permanence, is dependent on how the testing is done (see the article on object permanence). More generally, the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing.

Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development expand Piaget&#x27;s theory in various ways such as also considering psychometric-like factors such as processing speed and working memory, &quot;hypercognitive&quot; factors like self-monitoring, more stages, and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social.

=== Parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence ===
Based on a review of 37 neuroimaging studies, Jung and Haier proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain communicate and exchange information with each other. Subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory. A review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parieto-frontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences.

=== Investment theory ===
Based on the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory, the tests of intelligence most often used in the studies include measures of fluid ability (&quot;gf&quot;) and crystallized ability (&quot;gc&quot;); that differ in their trajectory of development in people. The &quot;investment theory&quot; by Cattell states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge (&quot;gc&quot;) are partially attributed to the &quot;investment&quot; of &quot;gf&quot;, thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process. The investment theory suggests that personality traits affect &quot;actual&quot; ability, and not scores on an IQ test.

Hebb&#x27;s theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well, Intelligence A (physiological), that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and Intelligence B (experiential), similar to crystallized intelligence.

=== Intelligence compensation theory (ICT) ===
The intelligence compensation theory states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder and more methodically, and become more resolute and thorough (more conscientious) in order to achieve goals, to compensate for their &quot;lack of intelligence&quot; whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits/behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort. The theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness, such that the development of the personality trait of conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence. This assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur; implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence (&quot;gf&quot;) and conscientiousness. This is justified by the timeline of development of &quot;gf&quot;, &quot;gc&quot;, and personality, as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop. Subsequently, during school-going ages, more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence (knowledge) through education, as they would be more efficient, thorough, hard-working, and dutiful.

This theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies &quot;compensatory sample selection&quot; which attributes the findings to the bias that comes from selecting samples containing people above a certain threshold of achievement.

=== Bandura&#x27;s theory of self-efficacy and cognition ===
The view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years, and , comprising not only cognitive, but motivational, social, and behavioural aspects as well. These facets work together to perform numerous tasks. An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise one&#x27;s quality of thought and activity. Bandura bridges the link between intelligence and success by crediting individual differences in self-efficacy. Bandura&#x27;s theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations. The theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly, averagely, or excellently based on differences in self-efficacy.

A key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively. These skills are dependent on processing of unclear and ambiguous stimuli. People must be able to rely on their reserve of knowledge to identify, develop, and execute options. They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences. Thus, a stable sense of self-efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations.

Bandura&#x27;s theory of self-efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self-efficacy in any field will avoid challenges. This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as &quot;personal threats&quot;. When failure occurs, they recover from it more slowly than others, and credit the failure to an insufficient aptitude. On the other hand, persons with high levels of self-efficacy hold that leads to effective performance.

=== Process, personality, intelligence and knowledge theory (PPIK) ===
Developed by Ackerman, the PPIK (process, personality, intelligence, and knowledge) theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell, the Investment theory, and Hebb, suggesting a distinction between &quot;intelligence as knowledge&quot; and &quot;intelligence as process&quot; (two concepts that are comparable and related to &quot;gc&quot; and &quot;gf&quot; respectively, but broader and closer to Hebb&#x27;s notions of &quot;Intelligence A&quot; and &quot;Intelligence B&quot;) and integrating these factors with elements such as personality, motivation, and interests.

Ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge, as content cannot be eliminated from any ability test.

Personality traits are not significantly correlated with the &quot;intelligence as process&quot; aspect except in the context of psychopathology. One exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities, specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form.

On the other hand, the &quot;intelligence as knowledge&quot; factor has been associated with personality traits of Openness and Typical Intellectual Engagement, which also strongly correlate with verbal abilities (associated with crystallized intelligence).

=== Latent inhibition ===
It appears that Latent inhibition, the phenomenon of familiar stimuli having a postponed reaction time when compared with unfamiliar stimuli, has a positive correlation with creativity.

== Improving ==
=== Genetic engineering ===

Because intelligence appears to be at least partly dependent on brain structure and the genes shaping brain development, it has been proposed that genetic engineering could be used to enhance intelligence, a process sometimes called biological uplift in science fiction. Genetic enhancement experiments on mice have demonstrated superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioral tasks.

=== Education ===
Higher IQ leads to greater success in education, but independently, education raises IQ scores. A 2017 meta-analysis suggests education increases IQ by 1–5 points per year of education, or at least increases IQ test-taking ability.

===Nutrition and chemicals===

Substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics. A meta analysis shows omega-3 fatty acids improve cognitive performance among those with cognitive deficits, but not among healthy subjects. A meta-regression shows omega-3 fatty acids improve the moods of patients with major depression (major depression is associated with cognitive nutrient deficits).

===Activities and adult neural development===
* Exercise enhances cognition for healthy and non healthy subjects
* Which (e.g. &quot;intellectually demanding work&quot;) and how one does work
* Quality of sleep

===Digital tools===

====Digital media====
===Brain training===
Attempts to raise IQ with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks – for instance working memory – but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se.

A 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence (&quot;gf&quot;), as measured in several different standard tests. This finding received some attention from popular media, including an article in &quot;Wired&quot;. However, a subsequent criticism of the paper&#x27;s methodology questioned the experiment&#x27;s validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups. For example, the progressive nature of Raven&#x27;s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions (i.e., 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45-minute test).

===Philosophy===
Efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues. Neuroethics considers the ethical, legal, and social implications of neuroscience, and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain, and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology. Neuroethical issues interact with the ethics of human genetic engineering.

Transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes.

Eugenics is a social philosophy that advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention. Eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history, falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.

== Measuring ==


The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing. It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings. Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests include the Stanford-Binet, Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude. In the United States examples include the SSAT, the SAT, the ACT, the GRE, the MCAT, the LSAT, and the GMAT. Regardless of the method used, almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population.

Intelligence tests are widely used in educational, business, and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior. IQ and &quot;g&quot; (discussed in the next section) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced, have a child out of marriage, be incarcerated, and need long-term welfare support, while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education, higher status jobs and higher income. Intelligence as measured by Psychometric tests has been found to be highly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes (e.g., adaptive performance), and IQ/&quot;g&quot; is the single best predictor of successful job performance; however, some researchers although largely concurring with this finding have advised caution in citing the strength of the claim due to a number of factors, these include: statistical assumptions imposed underlying some of these studies, studies done prior to 1970 which appear inconsistent with more recent studies, and ongoing debates within the Psychology literature as to the validity of current IQ measurement tools.

=== General intelligence factor or &quot;g&quot; ===
There are many different kinds of IQ tests using a wide variety of test tasks. Some tests consist of a single type of task, others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents (visual-spatial, verbal, numerical) and asking for different cognitive processes (e.g., reasoning, memory, rapid decisions, visual comparisons, spatial imagery, reading, and retrieval of general knowledge). The psychologist Charles Spearman early in the 20th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks. He found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other, which is called a &quot;positive manifold&quot;. Spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests. Spearman named it &quot;g&quot; for &quot;general intelligence factor&quot;. He interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that, to a larger or smaller degree, influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold. This interpretation of &quot;g&quot; as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics. (Although, an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der Maas and colleagues. Their &quot;mutualism model&quot; assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms, none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests. These mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely, thereby creating the positive manifold.)

IQ tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the &quot;g&quot; factor. Tests with high &quot;g&quot;-loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests. One comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks has found that the Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks. The &quot;Raven&#x27;s&quot; is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material. It consists of a series of problems, sorted approximately by increasing difficulty. Each problem presents a 3 x 3 matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell; the matrix is constructed according to a rule, and the person must find out the rule to determine which of 8 alternatives fits into the empty cell. Because of its high correlation with other tests, the Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence. This is problematic, however, because there are substantial gender differences on the &quot;Raven&#x27;s&quot;, which are not found when &quot;g&quot; is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests.

Several critics, such as Stephen Jay Gould, have been critical of &quot;g&quot;, seeing it as a statistical artifact, and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities. The 1995 American Psychological Association&#x27;s report &quot;&quot; stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that &quot;g&quot; is a statistical artifact was a minority one.

=== General collective intelligence factor or &quot;c&quot; ===
A recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence, defined as a group&#x27;s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks, expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups. Definition, operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual&#x27;s performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the general intelligence factor &quot;g&quot; extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein, collective intelligence research aims to discover a &quot;c&quot; factor&#x27; explaining between-group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it.

=== Historical psychometric theories ===
Several different theories of intelligence have historically been important for psychometrics. Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in &quot;g factor&quot;.

=== Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory ===
Many of the broad, recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory. It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research. A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used. &quot;g&quot; is at the top. Under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:
*Fluid intelligence (Gf): includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.
*Crystallized intelligence (Gc): includes the breadth and depth of a person&#x27;s acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one&#x27;s knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.
*Quantitative reasoning (Gq): the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.
*Reading &amp; writing ability (Grw): includes basic reading and writing skills.
*Short-term memory (Gsm): is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds.
*Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr): is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.
*Visual processing (Gv): is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.
*Auditory processing (Ga): is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.
*Processing speed (Gs): is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.
*Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt): reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2–3 minutes). See Mental chronometry.
Modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ. Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment.

&quot;g&quot; was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.

=== Insufficiency of measurement via IQ ===

A study suggested that intelligence is composed of distinct cognitive systems, each of which having its own capacity and being (to some degree) independent of other components, with the cognitive profile being emergent from anatomically distinct cognitive systems (such as brain regions or neural networks). For example, IQ and reading-/language-related traits/skills appear to be influenced &quot;at least partly [by] distinct genetic factors&quot;.

Various types of potential measures related to some definitions of intelligence but not part of IQ measurement include:
* Cognitive flexibility – abilities in switching between different concepts, or to adapt behaviour in novel or changing environments
* Moral intelligence
* Prioritization and goal-selection
* Direct measures of brain activity and other neuroimaging intelligence testing – partly investigated in the neuroscience of intelligence

== Non-human intelligence ==

Human intelligence could be distinguished from potential other types of intelligences which may include those of (some may belong to multiple or be impossible):
* Extraterrestrials
* Non-human animals (such as that of bonobos and chimpanzees)
* Artificial intelligences (including novel types of learning machines such as semi-synthetic wetware computers or digitized minds)
* Chimerics (or hybrids) created with the use of biotechnologies (including humanzees, humanized mice or rats with human brain cells/organoids)
* Future posthumans (e.g. cyborgs including cyborgs with biological augmentations)
* Archaic humans (including Neanderthals – see also: genetic factors of recent brain evolution)
Such intelligences, if they exist and are considered &quot;intelligent&quot;, could be very different from human intelligences. Research may e.g. investigate differences between different types or profiles or aspects of intelligences, such as between modern humans and archaic humans.

== Intelligence across cultures ==
Psychologists have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying. Robert Sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one&#x27;s culture affects the person&#x27;s interpretation of intelligence, and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world. To negate this, psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence:
# Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life, according to one&#x27;s own definition of success, within one&#x27;s sociocultural context.
# Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence&#x27;s components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems.
# Creative intelligence is the result of intelligence&#x27;s components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations.
# Practical intelligence is the result of intelligence&#x27;s components applied to experience for purposes of adaption, shaping and selection.

Although typically identified by its western definition, multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world. In many Eastern cultures, intelligence is mainly related with one&#x27;s social roles and responsibilities. A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others — although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in China.
In several African communities, intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens. However, rather than through social roles, as in many Eastern cultures, it is exemplified through social responsibilities. For example, in the language of Chi-Chewa, which is spoken by some ten million people across central Africa, the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility. Furthermore, within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well. One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills, deductive reasoning skills, and Intelligence quotient (IQ), while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience, accept others for who they are, and be able to give advice or wisdom.

== Motivational intelligence ==

Motivational intelligence refers to an individual&#x27;s capacity to comprehend and utilize various motivations, such as the need for achievement, affiliation, or power. It involves understanding tacit knowledge related to these motivations. This concept encompasses the ability to recognize and appreciate the diverse values, behaviors, and cultural differences of others, driven by intrinsic interest rather than solely to enhance interaction effectiveness.

Research suggests a relationship between motivational intelligence, international experiences, and leadership. Individuals with higher levels of motivational intelligence tend to exhibit greater enthusiasm for learning about other cultures, thereby contributing to their effectiveness in cross-cultural settings. However, studies have also revealed variations in motivational intelligence across ethnicities, with Asian students demonstrating higher cognitive cultural intelligence but lower motivational intelligence compared to other groups.

Investigations have explored the impact of motivational intelligence on job motivation. A study conducted on employees of Isfahan Gas Company indicated a positive and significant relationship between motivational intelligence and two of its indicators, namely adaptability and social relationship, with job motivation. These findings highlight the potential influence of motivational intelligence on individuals&#x27; motivation levels within work contexts.

Motivational intelligence has been identified as a strong predictor, superseding knowledge intelligence, behavioral intelligence, and strategic intelligence. It holds a crucial role in promoting cooperation, which is considered the ideal and essential element of motivational intelligence.
Therapeutic approaches grounded in motivational intelligence emphasize a collaborative partnership between the therapist and client. The therapist creates an environment conducive to change without imposing their views or attempting to force awareness or acceptance of reality onto the client.

Motivational intelligence encompasses the understanding of motivations, such as achievement, affiliation, and power, as well as the appreciation of cultural differences and values. It has been found to impact areas such as international experiences, leadership, job motivation, and cooperative therapeutic interventions.

<text>The Houston Comets were a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Houston. Formed in 1997, the team was one of the original eight WNBA teams and won the first four championships of the league&#x27;s existence. They are one of two teams in the WNBA that are undefeated in the WNBA Finals; the Seattle Storm are the other. The Comets were the first dynasty of the WNBA and are tied with the Minnesota Lynx and Seattle Storm for the most championships of any WNBA franchise, and despite all of their success, the team was folded and disbanded by the league in 2008 during the height of the Great Recession because new ownership could not be found.

The Comets were known for courting great women&#x27;s basketball stars. The team had among its members Cynthia Cooper (the WNBA&#x27;s first MVP); college and national team standout Sheryl Swoopes; Kim Perrot, who succumbed to cancer in 1999; and college stars Michelle Snow and Tina Thompson.

==History==

===Building the first dynasty of the WNBA (1997–2000)===
The Comets were one of the founding teams in the WNBA. Their first four seasons were marked by dominant success in the league, as they became the WNBA&#x27;s first dynasty. They capped off the league&#x27;s inaugural season in 1997 with a win over the New York Liberty in the WNBA championship game to win the WNBA&#x27;s first championship.

When the league expanded the next season, the Comets were moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference. In 1998, they finished 27–3 – a .900 winning percentage, a WNBA record that still stands. They went on to repeat as champions, defeating the Phoenix Mercury in the first-ever WNBA Finals, which had become a three-game championship series.

In 1999, led by what was already known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;, (Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson), the Comets survived a stunning last-second, half-court, buzzer beater by the Liberty&#x27;s Teresa Weatherspoon in Game 2 -- as it appeared the Comets were set to win the title -- to beat the Liberty in three games and win their third straight title, this one after the death of teammate Kim Perrot, who died of cancer.

In 2000, behind league MVP Sheryl Swoopes and eventual WNBA Finals MVP Cynthia Cooper, the Comets beat the Liberty again, this time in two games, to win their fourth straight title cementing themselves as the greatest WNBA team ever assembled. This was the Comets&#x27; last championship and last Finals appearance in franchise history.

===The years of change and rebuilding (2001–2006)===
The Comets suffered two blows before the 2001 season--Cooper retired and Swoopes tore her ACL. Despite playing without the two biggest stars from their title runs, Houston made the playoffs with a 19–13 record before falling in the first round to the eventual champion Los Angeles Sparks. In 2002, Swoopes won her second MVP and the Comets finished 24–8, but lost to the Utah Starzz in 3 games. 

In 2003, they qualified to the playoffs for the 7th straight year, but they lost in the first round to the Sacramento Monarchs in 3 games. They missed the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 13–21 in 2004, but returned in 2005 with a 19–15 record, finishing 3rd. In the first round, the Comets knocked out the 2004 defending champion Seattle Storm in 3 games, but lost in the conference finals to the Sacramento Monarchs in a sweep, which Sacramento later became WNBA Champions in 2005. Houston would return to the playoffs with an 18–16 record, but lost to the 2005 defending champion Sacramento Monarchs in another sweep. 2006 was the last playoff appearance for the Houston Comets. 

After the Comets&#x27; season ended in 2006, the team went through a major front-office changes during the off-season. In October 2006, team owner Leslie Alexander – who also owned the Houston Rockets -- announced he was selling the Comets, and longtime head coach Van Chancellor resigned in January 2007.

===New ownership and a new home (2007)===
On January 31, 2007, the WNBA Board of Governors approved the sale of the team to Hilton Koch, a Houston-based mattress and furniture businessman. Two weeks later, Comets assistant coach Karleen Thompson was named to become the team&#x27;s new head coach and general manager for the 2007 season.

For the 2007 season, they would miss the playoffs for the second time in franchise history after starting the season 0–10, resulting in a 13–21 record.

On December 12, 2007, team owner Hilton Koch announced that the Comets would be moving from the Toyota Center to Reliant Arena for the 2008 WNBA season. This resulted in a loss of fans. The Toyota Center drew 13,000 fans, but the Reliant Arena could only house 7,200. In 2008, the Comets&#x27; final year, they only drew an average 6,000 fans per game and sold out four games.

===End of the era (2008)===
In 2008, Koch put the team up for sale, with an asking price of $10 million, however no investors stepped up. The WNBA took over management of the Comets and disbanded the team in December 2008. They stated that they would only be suspending operations in 2009, which some people saw as a sign that the franchise could be revived if an investor came in. Comets players were sent off to other teams in a dispersal draft.

League president Donna Orender said that the collapse of the Comets was not a sign that the WNBA was in trouble. Cynthia Cooper said that the loss of the Comets was &quot;disturbing news&quot; and that the Comets were integral to the WNBA.

The Comets played their final home game on September 15, 2008 at the Strahan Coliseum on the campus of Texas State due to Hurricane Ike. They defeated the Sacramento Monarchs 90–81. They finished the season 17–17 and missed the playoffs for the third time in their history.

==Potential revival==
In April 2024, the Rockets, now led by Tilman Fertitta, had submitted to the WNBA to revive the Comets franchise and intends to retain the team&#x27;s branding if successfully landing an expansion bid.

<text>Janet Paterson Frame (28 August 1924 – 29 January 2004) was a New Zealand author. She is internationally renowned for her work, which includes novels, short stories, poetry, juvenile fiction, and an autobiography, and received numerous awards including being appointed to the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand&#x27;s highest civil honour.

Frame&#x27;s celebrity derived from her dramatic personal history as well as her literary career. Following years of psychiatric hospitalisation, Frame was scheduled for a lobotomy that was cancelled when, just days before the procedure, her debut publication of short stories was unexpectedly awarded a national literary prize. Many of her novels and short stories explore her childhood and psychiatric hospitalisation from a fictional perspective, and her award-winning three-volume autobiography was adapted into the film &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1990), directed by Jane Campion.

== Biography ==

=== Early years: 1924–1956 ===
Janet Frame was born Janet Paterson Frame in Dunedin in the south-east of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, the third of five children to parents of Scottish descent. She grew up in a working-class family. Her father, George Frame, worked for the New Zealand Government Railways, and her mother Lottie (née Godfrey), served as a housemaid to the family of writer Katherine Mansfield. New Zealand&#x27;s first female medical graduate, Dr Emily Hancock Siedeberg, delivered Frame at St. Helens Hospital in 1924.

Frame spent her early childhood years in various small towns in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island provinces of Otago and Southland, including Outram and Wyndham, before the family eventually settled in the coastal town of Oamaru (recognisable as the &quot;Waimaru&quot; of her début novel and subsequent fiction). As recounted in the first volume of her autobiographies, Frame&#x27;s childhood was marred by the deaths of two of her adolescent sisters, Myrtle and Isabel, who drowned in separate incidents, and the epileptic seizures suffered by her brother George (referred to as &quot;Geordie&quot; and &quot;Bruddie&quot;).

In 1943, Frame began training as a teacher at the Dunedin College of Education, auditing courses in English, French and psychology at the adjacent University of Otago. After completing two years of theoretical studies with mixed results, Frame started a year of practical placement at the Arthur Street School in Dunedin, which, according to her biographer, initially went quite well. Things started to unravel later that year when she attempted suicide by ingesting a packet of aspirin. As a result, Frame began regular therapy sessions with junior lecturer John Money, to whom she developed a strong attraction, and whose later work as a sexologist specialising in gender reassignment controversial.

In September 1945, Frame abandoned her teacher-training classroom at Dunedin&#x27;s Arthur Street School during a visit from an inspector. She was then briefly admitted to the psychiatric ward of the local Dunedin hospital for observation. Frame was unwilling to return home to her family, where tensions between her father and brother frequently manifested in outbursts of anger and violence. As a result, Frame was transferred from the local hospital&#x27;s psychiatric ward to Seacliff Lunatic Asylum, a fabled and feared mental institution located 20 miles north of Dunedin. During the next eight years, Frame was repeatedly readmitted, usually voluntarily, to psychiatric hospitals in New Zealand. In addition to Seacliff, these included Avondale Lunatic Asylum, in Auckland, and Sunnyside Hospital in Christchurch. During this period, Frame was first diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, which was treated with electroconvulsive therapy and insulin.

In 1951, while Frame was still a patient at Seacliff, New Zealand&#x27;s Caxton Press published her first book, a critically acclaimed collection of short stories titled &quot;The Lagoon and Other Stories&quot;. The volume was awarded the Hubert Church Memorial Award, at that time one of New Zealand&#x27;s most prestigious literary prizes. This resulted in the cancellation of Frame&#x27;s scheduled lobotomy. Four years later, after her final discharge from Seacliff, Frame met writer Frank Sargeson. She lived and worked at his home in Takapuna, an Auckland suburb, from April 1955 to July 1956, producing her first full-length novel, &quot;Owls Do Cry&quot; (Pegasus, 1957).

== Literary career ==

=== 1957–1989 ===
Frame left New Zealand in late 1956, and the next seven years were most prolific in terms of publication. She lived and worked in Europe, primarily based in London, with brief sojourns to Ibiza and Andorra. In May 1958 she legally changed her name to Nene Janet Paterson Clutha, in part to make herself more difficult to locate and in part to recognise Māori leader Tamati Waka Nene, whom she admired, and the Clutha River, which was a source of creative inspiration. Frame still struggled with anxiety and depression, and in September 1958 admitted herself to the Maudsley in London. American-trained psychiatrist Alan Miller, who studied under John Money at Johns Hopkins University, proposed that she had never suffered from schizophrenia. In an effort to alleviate the ill effects of her years spent in and out of psychiatric hospitals, Frame then began regular therapy sessions with psychiatrist Robert Hugh Cawley, who encouraged her to pursue her writing. Frame dedicated seven of her novels to Cawley.

Frame returned to New Zealand in 1963, though not before spending a short period of time living in rural north Suffolk (near the town of Eye) which gave her the inspiration for her 1965 novel &quot;The Adaptable Man&quot;. She accepted the Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago in 1965. She later lived in several parts of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, including Auckland, Taranaki, Wanganui, the Horowhenua, Palmerston North, Waiheke, Stratford, Browns Bay and Levin.

During this period Frame travelled extensively, occasionally to Europe, but principally to the United States, where she accepted residencies at the MacDowell and Yaddo artists&#x27; colonies. Partly as a result of these extended stays in the U.S., Frame developed close relationships with several Americans. These included the painter Theophilus Brown (whom she later referred to as &quot;the chief experience of my life&quot;) and his long-time partner Paul John Wonner, the poet May Sarton, John Phillips Marquand and Alan Lelchuk. Frame&#x27;s one-time university tutor/counsellor and longtime friend John Money worked in North America from 1947 onwards, and Frame frequently based herself at his home in Baltimore.

In the 1980s Frame authored three volumes of autobiography (&quot;To the Is-land&quot;, &quot;An Angel at my Table&quot; and &quot;The Envoy from Mirror City&quot;) which collectively traced the course of her life to her return to New Zealand in 1963. The Australian novelist Patrick White described the first two volumes as &quot;amongst the wonders of the world&quot;. Director Jane Campion and screenwriter Laura Jones adapted the trilogy for television broadcast. It was eventually released as an award-winning feature film, &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot;. Actresses Kerry Fox, Alexia Keogh and Karen Fergusson portrayed the author at various ages. Frame&#x27;s autobiographies sold better than any of her previous publications, and Campion&#x27;s successful film adaptation of the texts introduced a new generation of readers to her work. These successes increasingly pushed Frame into the public eye.

In the 1983 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Frame was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature. That year, &quot;To the Is-land&quot; also received the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book of the Year Award, the top literary prize in New Zealand.

Frame intended the autobiographies to &quot;set the record straight&quot; regarding her past and in particular her mental status. However, critical and public speculation has continued to focus on her mental health. In 2007, after Frame&#x27;s death, &quot;The New Zealand Medical Journal&quot; published an article by a medical specialist who proposed that Frame may have been on the autism spectrum, a suggestion that was disputed by the author&#x27;s literary executor.

During her lifetime, Frame&#x27;s work was principally published by American firm George Braziller, garnering numerous literary prizes in her native New Zealand, and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize in 1989 for her final novel, &quot;The Carpathians&quot;.

=== 1990–2000 ===
On 6 February 1990, Frame was the sixteenth appointee to the Order of New Zealand, the nation&#x27;s highest civil honour. Frame also held foreign membership of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and, in her native New Zealand, received two honorary doctorates as well as the status of cultural icon. Rumours occasionally circulated portraying Frame as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, most notably in 1998, after a journalist spotted her name at the top of a list later revealed to have been in alphabetical order, and again five years later, in 2003, when Åsa Beckman, the influential chief literary critic at the Swedish daily &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, wrongly predicted that Frame would win the prestigious prize.

Frame&#x27;s writing became the focus of academic criticism from the late 1970s, with approaches ranging from Marxist and social realist, to feminist and poststructuralist. In later years, book-length monographs on Frame were published. These included Patrick Evans’s bio-critical contribution for the &quot;Twayne&#x27;s World Authors Series,&quot; &quot;Janet Frame&quot; (1977), Gina Mercer&#x27;s feminist reading of the novels and autobiographies, &quot;Janet Frame: Subversive Fictions&quot; (1994), and Judith Dell Panny&#x27;s allegorical approach to the works, &quot;I have what I gave: The fiction of Janet Frame&quot; (1992). A collection of essays edited by Jeanne Delbaere was first published in 1978, with a revised edition released under the title &quot;The Ring of Fire: Essays on Janet Frame&quot; in 1992. That same year, Dunedin&#x27;s University of Otago hosted a conference dedicated to a discussion of Frame&#x27;s work. Many of the papers were published in a special issue of &quot;The Journal of New Zealand Literature&quot;.

In 2000, New Zealand historian Michael King published his authorised biography of Frame, &quot;Wrestling with the Angel&quot;. The book was simultaneously released in New Zealand and North America, with British and Australian editions appearing in later years. King&#x27;s award-winning and exhaustive work attracted both praise and criticism. Some questioned the extent to which Frame guided the hand of her biographer, while others argued that he had failed to come to terms with the complexity and subtlety of his subject. Adding to the controversy, King openly admitted that he withheld information &quot;that would have been a source of embarrassment and distress to her,&quot; and that he adopted publisher Christine Cole Catley&#x27;s notion of &quot;compassionate truth.&quot; This advocates &quot;a presentation of evidence and conclusions that fulfil the major objectives of biography, but without the revelation of information that would involve the living subject in unwarranted embarrassment, loss of face, emotional or physical pain, or a nervous or psychiatric collapse.&quot; King defended his project and maintained that future biographies on Frame would eventually fill in the gaps left by his own work.

===Death and posthumous publications===
Frame died in Dunedin in January 2004, aged 79, from acute myeloid leukaemia, shortly after becoming one of the first recipients of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Awards, established to celebrate and acknowledge New Zealand artists who have achieved the highest standards of artistic expression. A number of works have been published posthumously, including a volume of poetry titled &quot;The Goose Bath&quot;, which was awarded New Zealand&#x27;s top poetry prize in 2007. This generated a minor controversy among critics who felt the posthumous prize &quot;set an awkward precedent&quot;. A novella, &quot;Towards Another Summer,&quot; was also published posthumously, a work inspired by a weekend Frame spent with British journalist Geoffrey Moorhouse and his family. In 2008, two previously unpublished short stories set in mental hospitals appeared in &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Another previously unpublished short story was carried in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2010. In March 2011, the New Zealand branch of Penguin Books acquired the rights to publish three new editions of Frame&#x27;s work. These were: &quot;Janet Frame in Her Own Words&quot; (2011), a collection of interviews and nonfiction, &quot;Gorse is Not People: New and Uncollected Stories&quot; (2012) (published in the US as &quot;Between My Father and the King: New and Uncollected Stories&quot;), and the novel &quot;In the Memorial Room&quot; (2013).

In 2010, &quot;Gifted,&quot; a novel by New Zealand academic and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. The story is a fictionalised account of the relationship between Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955–56 – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion&#x27;s film, &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1990). In 2013, Evans&#x27; novel was adapted for the stage, premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013, followed by extended tour of New Zealand&#x27;s north and south islands. While garnering positive critical reviews, the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frame&#x27;s literary executor and niece, Pamela Gordon, who maintained it &quot;was designed to demean Frame.&quot; Gordon, who has also criticised Campion&#x27;s film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame, asserted that Evans&#x27; theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative. Festival organiser Philip Tremewan defended the play, while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was &quot;overprotective of [Frame&#x27;s] legacy.&quot; Evans generally avoided the controversy, stating, &quot;I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students. In &quot;Gifted&quot;, the play and novel, you only have to look at the title to see what my attitude is. I really don&#x27;t think I have anything to apologise for.&quot;

Frame&#x27;s personal and literary papers were archived by the Hocken Collections of the University of Otago. In 2024, these archives were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register.

In an interview with the Atlanta-based Reporters and Newspapers website, Andrew Flaming, the CEO of the Organizing Committee (APOC) and a disability rights attorney, expressed gratitude for the efforts of Alana Shepherd. Shepherd founded the world-renowned Shepherd Center, one of the first hospitals dedicated to rehabilitating victims of cervical spine accidents. Until March 1992, it was uncertain whether the 1996 Summer Paralympics would be held in Atlanta, as the event was not part of the original plan and did not include the possibility of being hosted two weeks after the Olympic Games closing ceremonies. Despite the lack of coordination between the two organizing committees, the Paralympics began to be promoted and had already developed a visual identity and international presence.

Concerns arose from various areas, including the disorganization of the Olympic Games&#x27; Organizing Committee (AOCOG) and financial issues that threatened planning the games. Between 1990 and 1992, the Shepherd family noticed a lack of interest in hosting the Paralympic Games in Atlanta, with neglect from local authorities, Olympic sponsors, and large international corporations headquartered in the city. This affected the financing and promotion of the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games, which could have led to significant ticket and licensed product sales. Fleming recalled an interview with Shepherd, noting that if Atlanta failed to host the Games, Great Britain was considered &quot;Plan B&quot; by the newly formed International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Fleming also mentioned that the low-budget model used in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was repeated in Atlanta. In 1984, Los Angeles &quot;forgot&quot; the Paralympics, later dubbed &quot;the last-minute games,&quot; which were hosted by New York City and Stoke Mandeville in Great Britain. Unlike Seoul, which signed late cooperation agreements for the Paralympics, Barcelona decided to organize both events under the same committee in 1987. This decision increased pressure on American organizers, as it was the first time in history that the two events were held together.

In 1990, when Atlanta won the rights to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, a group led by Fleming and the Shepherd family matriarch worked hard to create and submit a bid for the Paralympics, a project that took a year and a half to complete. Fleming noted that Olympic organizers were skeptical about hosting the Paralympics half a week after the Olympics and did not want to commit to them. Consequently, achieving the planned budget of nearly $80 million was challenging, as the Paralympics lacked funding and media rights sales.

Fleming recalled a market survey revealing that only 2% of city locals were aware of the Paralympic Games, compared to 4% who knew about the Atlanta Youth Games. As time passed, this situation became public in 1991, causing internal tensions within the Olympic organization. To avoid further damage to their image, the Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee discreetly donated money and assisted the Paralympic Games in certain areas. Following the situation, Alana Shepherd, co-founder of the Shepherd Center, led a campaign to ensure the 1996 Summer Paralympics were held in Atlanta. After the IPC accepted the bid, she launched an aggressive strategy to involve large companies as sponsors and increase the event&#x27;s visibility.

Press reports from the time described a drastic situation, with the Paralympic Organizing Committee starting its work in a small basement at the Shepherd Center due to a lack of funds to rent commercial space. After sending final documents and proposals to Belgium in late 1990 and making informal agreements the following year, the Shepherd Center Committee spent 1.5 years developing their proposal, which was officially presented during the 1992 Winter Paralympics in Tignes, France.

==A different kind of competition==
Shortly after the IPC announced that Atlanta&#x27;s civil society proposal to host the Paralympics. Another race against time had started, and this one was seen as the worst, as the bidding committee had to get corporate and large sponsors. During the bidding campaign companies like Microsoft, Coca-Cola, CNN and Home Depot were originally committed to buy sponsorship shares, but when the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) executives learned of these promises, they were concerned about that all things that might impact on the &quot;Atlanta 1996 Olympic Summer Games&quot; brand and they turned an uncooperative factor about the Paralympic Games. The USOC understood that any move by the United States Paralympic Committee (USPC) could affect the USOC brand and their stakeholders. The US Department of Justice was sued by the USOC over the Paralympic Games mascot, the phoenix Blaze. Fleming also said the deal was the trap worked perfectly and required them to approach only corporate sponsors who had already signed an Olympics sponsorship agreement. When one Olympic sponsor declined, the Paralympics organizers could only request a competitor with the withdrawing company&#x27;s permission. As main example, Fleming said that McDonald&#x27;s refused to buy a sponsorship quota or act as a partner in a supplier area and the Paralympic catering services, and if any direct competing company wanted to buy it, APOC would have to ask permission for the withdrawing company to sign the contract. It &quot;would not let them solicit Chick-fil-A, even though Dan Cathy, one of its main executives, had a chair at the organizing committee&quot;. Upon realizing she and all of the Paralympic Organizing Committee were being ambushed, Alana Shepherd 
abruptly broken unilaterally all previously signed contracts, taking the personal risk on this issue and through a press conference and released a list she dubbed the &quot;Sinful Six&quot;, as their name were handwritten by her on a piece of paper. This nicknames was given, because along with McDonald&#x27;s another five Olympic Sponsors did not signed a contract to the Paralympics and blocked eventual negotiations with their direct competitors. On this list were this names: Anheuser-Busch, Visa, Bausch and Lomb, John Hancock Financial and Sara Lee. &quot;I keep the list in my wallet,&quot; Shepherd told a reporter at the time. In recent interviews, Shepherd declines to say much about this situation and the deal. &quot;I&#x27;m taking the high road now… I&#x27;m not digging it up,&quot; she said, but added, &quot;They were the losers. We were the winners.&quot; She also attended the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, Spain, and in a stroke of fate happened to have Juan Antonio Samaranch, the then president of the International Olympic Committee, sitting next to her and in an informal talking she said. &quot;You know, it&#x27;s crazy to have two different committees holding events at the same places,&quot; she recalled. &quot;They didn&#x27;t understand it, they were scared of it,&quot; she said of Olympics officials&#x27; attitude toward the Paralympics. &quot;It was something they didn&#x27;t understand would help the city become more accessible.&quot;

All of these issues were a concern for the IPC since the beginning of the application process and exemple of this concerns were reported during the entity&#x27;s General Assembly held in November 1995 in Tokyo, Japan.

Racing against time and all risks, Shepard raised the USD$81 million needed to hold the event. Without the involvement of any public authority, Atlanta successfully held the IX edition of the Summer Paralympic Games. But unlike what had happened four years earlier, not all Olympic Games competition venues were used and the same Barcelona experience could not be delivered. But, contrary to predictions, the event made an impressive profit of millions of dollars, and that amount was used to create BlazeSports America, a Norcross-based non-profit organization that runs sports programs for children and veterans with disabilities.

== Atlanta aftermath ==

Flaming and Shepherd believes until today that Samaranch and others must have heard the key message of these struggles. &quot;After Atlanta, the IOC said it would not accept an Olympic bid unless it also made provisions for the Paralympic Games,&quot; Fleming said. &quot;The IOC leadership essentially said, &#x27;The Paralympic movement is not going away, especially after Atlanta…&#x27;and this was already happening, a few months after the closing of the Atlanta Games, the International Olympic Committee announced that it had changed the rules of the application process and starting from the 2000 Summer Olympics would not accept a bid if the city filed a bid without disclosing its plans for the Paralympic Games. Following this difficult process, when bidding for the Olympic Games between 1991 and 1993, the eventual winner - the Australian city of Sydney - did not originally guarantee that the city wanted to host the Paralympics. But during the process, they changed their attitudes and promised that apart the two events had the possibility to be organized by two different parties, they would give the same treatment to all the participants and public who went to go to Australia for the two events. This also encompassed planning, financing, security, logistics, marketing and ticket sales. This joint planning give the opportunity to share all the functions and made until that Games, won the title of &quot;the best ever&quot; until that date.

The Atlanta 1996 Summer Paralympic Games budget troubles led the IOC to take and study some changes on their management. In the first action held in 1993, IOC and IPC signed a joint protocol of strategic partnership and they undertook to include topics related to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the evaluation questionnaires that would be sent to the cities interested in the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics. Occasionally, another American city Salt Lake City would be elected to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. In a different way that held in Atlanta, as they assumed the responsibility to host the 2002 Winter Paralympics if they won. While of the 11 cities applying for the 2004 Games, 6 had also chosen the joint management model.

Five years later, and after the large and unprecedented success of the 1998 Winter Paralympics and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in 2001, after a change at the Olympic Charter, the International Paralympic Committee became an effective collaborator of the International Olympic Committee, and its president became a compulsory member of the IOC. With that, a cooperation agreement was signed informally called &quot;One city, two events&quot; and from then on, the same city and the same Organizing Committee would be responsible for the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games of the same year, and this concept started to be used during the process that led Beijing to win the process to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.

== Incidents during the Games ==
In addition to the organizational and funding issues between the two committees, other difficulties arose when Paralympic athletes arrived at the Olympic Village. The first delegations to register expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of the accommodations, the availability of food, and especially the logistics between the village and the venues due to distance and accessibility challenges. These problems were not the first reported during the &quot;transition period&quot; from August 5 to 15.

Several media outlets covering the games highlighted accusations that the Olympic Games Organizing Committee was negligent regarding village services, raising concerns about numerous contractual failures between the two parties. This agreement included infrastructure issues, such as site maintenance and cleaning, until APOC could assume operational control. When athletes accessed their accommodations, they discovered missing furniture, and several electronic devices and sockets had been ripped out, turning the residential areas into a disarray. The criticism was so widespread that ACOG publicly denied the situation, claiming that some delegations had arrived two days earlier than planned.

Logistics and accessibility were significant issues, as competitions took place in 17 venues across Metro Atlanta, with only three near the village and six exclusive venues for the Paralympics located within Georgia University System institutions that had served as training facilities during the Olympic Games. The original contract only included some shared competition venues.

Another embarrassing situation arose from how APOC managed athletes with intellectual disabilities, who were included in the Summer Paralympics for the first time. The decision to include them was made late, in 1995, and they were not mentioned in official publicity materials or during the opening ceremony and their early competitions. Despite repeated complaints from Bernard Athos, then president of the International Association of Sports for People with Intellectual Disabilities (INAS-FMH), APOC initially ignored these concerns. The issue gained attention when journalists covering the games reported it, prompting APOC to announce through a press release that the oversight had been unintentional.

== Look of the Games ==
The visual concept for this edition was called &quot;The Ascending Flame&quot; and was based at the logo called &quot;StarFire&quot; released in 1992 and was developed by the local design office Copeland Design who had created all the visual concepts for the city&#x27;s bid for the Olympic Games. The office took advantage of its already being public knowledge that the two events would be held separately. A totally different corporate identity was created. It was from common sense that this would be the biggest edition of the Paralympic Games so far in everything, and that echoed in the logo which is similar to the logo of the Olympic Games bid. The chosen graphic should be connected with the constant expansion and recent recognition of the Paralympic Movement around the world. And also had to be remembered with the fact that the Paralympics &quot;was ceasing to be a second class event and now they are enter into a mainstream visibility&quot;. The highest feature at the concept of &quot;The Ascending Flame&quot; is a special feature of the city as one of main logistics hubs in the world due their strategic location between the south and southeast of the United States. This prominence was enhanced when the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has become one of the main airports in the world and led to the city&#x27;s first period of rapid development. Another recurring idea was that this issue could serve as the &quot;light of inspiration&quot; for the issue of basic rights for people with disabilities around the world in a parallel with what Martin Luther King Jr. did with the civil rights movement. Another association could be held with the city&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Phoenix City&quot; because the resilience of its population made it several times completely destroyed to be reborn by the effort and bravery of its population in a parallel with the life story of each participating athlete and the last connection would be in a direct relation with the Paralympic flame, that this time was born from a spark of the eternal flame that burns at King Center.

According to a survey carried out by the Atlanta History Center, there are few recorded materials about the development of this project. However, Copeland Design was also responsible for creating the visual identity. In these documents, the so-called concept of &quot;The Ascendent Flame&quot; is explained and associated with the Games slogan that was &quot;The Triumph of the Human Spirit&quot; along the mascot that was the phoenix Blaze.

<doc id="168202" wikidata="Q840556" url="?curid=168202" title="Bart the Genius">
<text>&quot;Bart the Genius&quot; is the second episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 14, 1990. It was the first episode written by Jon Vitti. It is the show&#x27;s first normal episode as well as the first to use the signature title sequence, though this version is much different from the one subsequently used, from the second season to the twentieth season. In the episode, Bart cheats on an intelligence test and is declared a genius, so he is sent to a school for gifted children. Though he initially enjoys being treated as a genius, he begins to see the downside of his new life.

It marks the first use of Bart&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Eat my shorts&quot;. As the second episode produced, directly after James L. Brooks&#x27; personal displeasure at the animation of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, the future of the series depended on how the animation turned out on this episode. The animation proved to be more to his liking and production continued.

==Plot==
The Simpsons spend a night playing Scrabble and remind Bart that he should stimulate his brain by improving his vocabulary if he hopes to pass his intelligence test at school. After Bart cheats by inventing a nonsense word, &quot;&quot; – basing its definition on an insulting description of his father – Homer angrily chases after him.

At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for vandalism by Principal Skinner after the class genius, Martin Prince, snitches on him. To get revenge, Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the IQ test results, he labels Bart a genius. Homer and Marge enroll him in a school for academically gifted students. Neither Lisa nor Skinner are fooled by Bart&#x27;s supposed genius, but Skinner is pleased that Bart no longer attends Springfield Elementary.

At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out of place among the other students with advanced academic skills. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject him because of his perceived intelligence. After Bart&#x27;s chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.

Bart returns home and admits to Homer that he cheated on the intelligence test, but he is glad they are closer than before. Though Homer is touched by this sentiment, he is ultimately upset and angry at Bart for lying to him about the test and chases him through the house as Lisa declares that Bart is &quot;stupid again&quot;.

==Production==
The concept for the episode developed from writer Jon Vitti coming up with a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention, imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart&#x27;s cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti&#x27;s childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.

It was Vitti&#x27;s first script for a 30-minute television program. Bart&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;Eat my shorts&quot; was intended to reflect his adoption of catchphrases he had heard on TV; the creative team had told Vitti that he should not come up with original taglines for the character. The scene where the family plays Scrabble was inspired by the 1985 Canadian animated short &quot;The Big Snit&quot;.
Director David Silverman had difficulty devising a legible Scrabble board for the opening scene that would convey the idea that the Simpsons were able to devise only very simple words. The design of Bart&#x27;s visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman&#x27;s use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play &quot;The Adding Machine&quot;. Each successive scene in the sequence was shorter than the one before it by exactly one frame.

The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.

The episode was the first to feature the series&#x27; full title sequence. Creator Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the &quot;chalkboard gag&quot;. The other gag is known as a &quot;couch gag&quot;, in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed. The episode also introduced the characters Martin Prince and his parents, Richard, Bart&#x27;s teacher Edna Krabappel and Dr. J Loren Pryor.

==Cultural references==
In the opening scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her blocks, a reference to Albert Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equivalence equation. A picture of Einstein also appears on the wall of Dr. Pryor&#x27;s office. At one point, Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as the inventor of the light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart&#x27;s proposed work among ordinary children to Jane Goodall&#x27;s study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. In retrospect, Vitti said he should have given the book to Al Jean who came up with the line. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, a reference to animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is &quot;Carmen&quot;, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at the gifted school have lunchboxes featuring images of the 1945 novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.

==Reception and legacy==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; finished 47th place in the weekly ratings for the week of January 8–14, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 12.7. It was the second-highest-rated show on Fox that week.

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, strongly praised the episode calling it &quot;superbly written and directed, often a literal child&#x27;s-eye view of education, the first &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode proper is a classic.&quot; They went on to say, &quot;these twenty minutes cemented Bart&#x27;s position as a cultural icon and a hero to all underachievers, and managed a good few kicks at hothouse schools along the way. Especially worthy of note is the sequence where Bart visualizes his maths problem, the viewing of which should be a required part of teacher training.&quot;

In September 2001, in a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode (of 5) and commented that the episode was &quot;wacky and fun, very Bart-centered, it&#x27;s easy to see with this episode why Bart became the figurehead for a few years of class clowns&quot;.

Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; &quot;offered another decent but unspectacular episode&quot; and &quot;its early vintage seems clear both through the awkward animation and [through] the lack of appropriate character development.&quot;

In February 1991, in an interview, Jon Vitti described &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; as his favorite amongst the episodes he had written to that point. James L. Brooks also mentioned the episode amongst his favorites, saying, &quot;We did things with animation when that happened that just opened doors for us.&quot;

The show received mail from viewers complaining that the throwing away of a comic book was an incident of censorship. The invented word &quot;Kwyjibo&quot; in the episode inspired the creator of the Melissa macro virus and the name of an iron oxide copper-gold deposit in Quebec.

==Home media==
The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled &quot;The Simpsons Collection&quot;; the episode was paired with season one episode &quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it was once re-released as part of the VHS boxed set of the complete first season, released in November 1999.

In the United States, the episode would finally see the home video release as a part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Season One DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Brooks, Silverman, and Vitti participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary. A digital edition of the series&#x27; first season was published on December 20, 2010, in the United States containing the episode, through Amazon Video and iTunes.

<text>Gray&#x27;s Anatomy is a reference book of human anatomy written by Henry Gray, illustrated by Henry Vandyke Carter and first published in London in 1858. It has had multiple revised editions, and the current edition, the 42nd (October 2020), remains a standard reference, often considered &quot;the doctors&#x27; bible&quot;.

Earlier editions were called Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical, Anatomy of the Human Body and Gray&#x27;s Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied, but the book&#x27;s name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject.

== Publication history ==
=== Origins ===
The English anatomist Henry Gray was born in 1827. He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London. In 1855, he approached his colleague Henry Vandyke Carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by John William Parker in London.
It was dedicated by Gray to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet.

An imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations.

Gray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the United Kingdom in 1860, also by J.W. Parker. However, Gray died the following year, at the age of 34, having contracted smallpox while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his &quot;Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical&quot;.

Even so, the work on his much-praised book was continued by others.

Longman&#x27;s publication reportedly began in 1863, after their acquisition of the J.W. Parker publishing business. This coincided with the publication date of the third British edition of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy.&quot; Successive British editions of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; continued to be published under the Longman, and more recently Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier imprints, reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years.

=== American editions ===
The full American rights were purchased by Blanchard and Lea, who published the first of twenty-five distinct American editions of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 1862, and whose company became Lea &amp; Febiger in 1908. Lea &amp; Febiger continued publishing the American editions until the company was sold in 1990.

The first American publication was edited by Richard James Dunglison, whose father Robley Dunglison was physician to Thomas Jefferson. Dunglison edited the next four editions. These were: the &quot;Second American Edition&quot; (February 1862); the &quot;New Third American from the Fifth English Edition&quot; (May 1870); the &quot;New American from the Eighth English Edition&quot; (July 1878); and the &quot;New American from the Tenth English Edition&quot; (August 1883). W. W. Keen edited the next two editions, namely: the &quot;New American from the Eleventh English Edition&quot; (September 1887); and the &quot;New American from the Thirteenth English Edition&quot; (September 1893).

In September 1896, reference to the English edition was dropped and it was published as the &quot;Fourteenth Edition&quot;, edited by Bern B. Gallaudet, F. J. Brockway, and J. P. McMurrich, who also edited the &quot;Fifteenth Edition&quot; (October 1901). There is also an edition dated 1896 which does still reference the English edition stating it is &quot;A New Edition, Thoroughly Revised by American Authorities, from the thirteenth English Edition&quot; and edited by T. Pickering Pick, F.R.C.S. and published by Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia and New York.

The &quot;Sixteenth Edition&quot; (October 1905) was edited by J. C. DaCosta, and the &quot;Seventeenth&quot; (September 1908) by DaCosta and E. A. Spitzka. Spitzka edited the &quot;Eighteenth&quot; (Oct. 1910) and &quot;Nineteenth&quot; (July 1913) editions, and in October 1913, R. Howden edited the &quot;New American from the Eighteenth English Edition&quot;. The &quot;American&quot; editions then continued with consecutive numbering from the Twentieth onwards, with W. H. Lewis editing the 20th (September. 1918), 21st (August 1924), 22nd (August 1930), 23rd (July 1936), and 24th (May 1942). Charles Mayo Goss edited the 25th (August 1948), 26th (July 1954), 27th (August 1959), 28th (August 1966), and 29th (January 1973). Carmine D. Clemente edited and extensively revised the 30th edition (October 1984). With the sale of Lea &amp; Febiger in 1990, the 30th edition was the last American Edition.

=== Discrepancies in numbering of American and British editions ===
Sometimes separate editing efforts with mismatches between British and American edition numbering led to the existence, for many years, of two main &quot;flavours&quot; or &quot;branches&quot; of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;: the U.S. and the British one. This can easily cause misunderstandings and confusion, especially when quoting from or trying to purchase a certain edition. For example, a comparison of publishing histories shows that the American numbering kept roughly apace with the British up until the 16th editions in 1905, with the American editions either acknowledging the English edition, or simply matching the numbering in the 14th, 15th and 16th editions. Then the American numbering crept ahead, with the 17th American edition published in 1908, while the 17th British edition was published in 1909. This increased to a three-year gap for the 18th and 19th editions, leading to the 1913 publication of the &quot;New American from the Eighteenth English&quot;, which brought the numbering back into line. Both 20th editions were then published in the same year (1918). Thereafter, it was the British numbering that pushed ahead, with the 21st British edition in 1920, and the 21st American edition in 1924. This discrepancy continued to increase, so that the 30th British edition was published in 1949, while the 30th and last American edition was published in 1984.

== Currently available editions ==
The current editions also contain histology, embryology, and pathology subjects that complements anatomical knowledge. The newest edition is the 42nd edition. The more popular 41st edition of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; was published on 25 September 2015 by Elsevier in both print and online versions, and is the first edition to have enhanced online content including anatomical videos and a bonus &quot;Gray&#x27;s&quot; imaging library. The 41st edition also has 24 specially invited online commentaries on contemporary anatomical topics such as advances in electron and fluorescent microscopy; the neurovascular bundles of the prostate; stem cells in regenerative medicine; the anatomy of facial aging; and technical aspects and applications of diagnostic radiology.

The senior editor of this book and accompanying website on ExpertConsult is Professor Susan Standring, who is Emeritus Professor of Anatomy at King&#x27;s College London. The three most recent editions differ from all previous editions in an important aspect: they present anatomical structures by their regional anatomy (i.e., ordered according to what part of the body the structures are located in – e.g. the anatomy of the bones, blood vessels and nerves, etc. of the upper extremity is described in one place). All editions of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; previous to the 39th were organized by systemic anatomy (i.e., there were separate sections for the body&#x27;s entire skeletal system, entire circulatory system and entire nervous system, etc.). The editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches but switched to regional anatomy by popular demand.

Older, out-of-copyright editions of the book continue to be reprinted and sold, particularly on the internet. However it is not always clear which (British or American) edition these books are republications of. Many seem to be reprints of the 1901 (probably U.S.) edition. Additionally, there are several sites where various older versions can be read online.

Henry Gray wrote &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; with a readership of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray&#x27;s textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy appears to have been to make each edition come close to containing a &quot;fully comprehensive&quot; account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. The explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight metaphorically and physically. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages. The 41st edition has 1,584 pages.
Newer editions of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; – and even several recent older ones – are still considered to be the most comprehensive and detailed textbooks on the subject. Despite previous efforts to keep &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; readable by students, when the 39th edition was published, students were identified as a secondary market for the book, and companion publications such as &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy for Students&quot;, &quot;Gray&#x27;s Atlas of Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy Review&quot; have also been published in recent years.

On the trunk of the body, the chest is referred to as the thoracic area. The shoulder in general is the acromial, while the curve of the shoulder is the deltoid. The back as a general area is the dorsum or dorsal area, and the lower back as the lumbus or lumbar region. The shoulderblades are the scapular area and the breastbone is the sternal region. The abdominal area is the region between the chest and the pelvis. The breast is called the mamma or mammary, the armpit as the axilla and axillary, and the navel as the umbilicus and umbilical. The pelvis is the lower torso, between the abdomen and the thighs. The groin, where the thigh joins the trunk, are the inguen and inguinal area.

The entire arm is referred to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis.

Anatomists divide the lower limb into the thigh (the part of the limb between the hip and the knee) and the leg (which refers only to the area of the limb between the knee and the ankle). The thigh is the femur and the femoral region. The kneecap is the patella and patellar while the back of the knee is the popliteus and popliteal area. The leg (between the knee and the ankle) is the crus and crural area, the lateral aspect of the leg is the peroneal area, and the calf is the sura and sural region. The ankle is the tarsus and tarsal, and the heel is the calcaneus or calcaneal. The foot is the pes and pedal region, and the sole of the foot the planta and plantar. As with the fingers, the toes are also called the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal area. The big toe is referred to as the hallux.

<text>Yitzhak Shamir (, ; born Yitzhak Yezernitsky; October 22, 1915 – June 30, 2012) was an Israeli politician and the seventh prime minister of Israel, serving two terms (1983–1984, 1986–1992). Before the establishment of the State of Israel, Shamir was a leader of the Zionist militant group Lehi, also known as the &quot;Stern Gang.&quot;

Yitzhak Shamir grew up in interwar Poland. Shamir joined Betar, the paramilitary wing of Revisionist Zionist Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky&#x27;s Hatzohar political party. In 1935, Shamir emigrated from Białystok to British Palestine, where he worked in an accountant&#x27;s office. Shamir joined the Revisionist Zionist Irgun paramilitary group led by Menachem Begin. During World War II the Irgun split over the question of whether to support the Axis Powers against the British Empire. Avraham Stern and Shamir sought an alliance with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and formed the breakaway militia group Lehi. Lehi was unable to persuade the Axis powers to lend it support. Shamir led Lehi after Stern&#x27;s assassination in 1942. In 1944 Shamir married Lehi member Shulamit Levy. During the 1948 Palestine war, Lehi and the Irgun committed the Deir Yassin massacre of over 100 Palestinians.

After the establishment of the Israeli state Shamir served in Mossad between 1955 and 1965. Shamir directed Operation Damocles and resigned from Mossad after Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered an end to the program. In 1969 Shamir joined Menachem Begin&#x27;s Herut Party. Shamir was first elected to the Knesset in 1973 as a member of the Likud alliance of parties. Shamir served as Speaker of the Knesset after Likud became the first right-wing Israeli government after winning the 1977 Israeli legislative election against Prime Minister Shimon Peres&#x27; Alignment. Shamir was named Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Begin in 1980 and would serve in this post until 1986. Shamir was Foreign Minister during the 1982 Israel invasion of Lebanon. 

Shamir won the 1983 Herut leadership election to succeed Begin as party leader, which made him Prime Minister and leader of the Likud. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir lost the 1984 election to Peres. Peres and Shamir entered into a grand coalition deal where Peres became prime minister while Shamir remained foreign minister until 1986, when Peres and Shamir traded jobs. The First Intifada began in 1987 and Shamir resisted a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Shamir unified the Likud alliance into one party in 1988. Shamir reluctantly restarted the Israeli–Palestinian peace process at the behest of the United States and Soviet Union which culminated in the Madrid Conference of 1991. Shamir lost the 1992 Israeli legislative election to Yitzhak Rabin and in 1993 Benjamin Netanyahu replaced him as Likud leader.

==Early life==
Yitzhak Yezernitsky was born in the predominantly Jewish village of Ruzhany, Bialystok-Grodno District of Ober Ost, shortly thereafter incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland (now in Belarus), as the son of Perla and Shlomo, owner of a leather factory. Shamir later moved to Białystok and studied at a Hebrew high school network. As a youth, Yezernitsky joined Betar, the Revisionist Zionist youth movement. Yezernitsky studied law at the University of Warsaw, but cut his studies short in order to emigrate to what was then Mandatory Palestine in 1935. Shamir was the surname Yitzhak Yezernitsky used on a forged underground identity card. Once in British Palestine, Yitzhak Yezernitsky changed his surname to Shamir. He later said &quot;Shamir&quot; means a thorn that stabs and a rock that can cut steel. Shamir initially worked in an accountant&#x27;s office.

==Lehi leadership==
Shamir joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi, a Zionist paramilitary group that opposed British control of Palestine. During World War II the Irgun split over the question of whether to support the Axis Powers against the British Empire. Avraham Stern and Shamir sought an alliance with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and formed the more militant breakaway militia group Lehi.

Lehi was unable to persuade the Axis powers to lend it support and became widely known as the &quot;Stern Gang&quot;. Yitzhak Shamir was imprisoned by British authorities in 1941. A few months after Stern was killed by the British in 1942, Shamir and Eliyahu Giladi hid under a stack of mattresses in a warehouse of the detention camp at Mazra&#x27;a, and at night escaped through the barbed wire fences of the camp. Shamir became the leader of the Stern Gang, and, together with Giladi, Anshell Shpillman and Yehoshua Cohen, reorganized the movement into cells and trained its members. In his memoirs, Shamir admitted in 1994 what had long been suspected: that the killing of Giladi in 1943 was ordered by Shamir himself, allegedly due to Giladi advocating the assassination of David Ben-Gurion, and arguing for other violence deemed too extremist by fellow Stern members.

Lehi leadership consisted of a troika of Yitzhak Shamir, Nathan Yellin-Mor and Israel Eldad. Shamir sought to emulate the anti-British struggle of the Irish Republicans and took the nickname &quot;Michael&quot; after Irish Republican leader Michael Collins. Shamir plotted the 1944 assassination of Lord Moyne, British Minister for Middle East Affairs, and personally selected Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Bet-Zuri to carry it out. Moyne had been targeted due to his perceived role as an architect of British restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine, and in particular, the &quot;Patria&quot; disaster, which was blamed on him.
In 1944 Shamir married fellow Lehi member Shulamit, Shamir had first met Shulamit in a detention camp where she was incarcerated after the ship on which she sailed to Mandate Palestine from Bulgaria in 1941 was declared illegal. They would have two children, Yair and Gilada. 

Shamir&#x27;s parents and two sisters were murdered in the Holocaust. Shamir claimed his father was killed just outside his birthplace in Ruzhany by villagers who had been his childhood friends after he had escaped from a German train transporting Jews to the death camps, though this was never confirmed. His mother and a sister were murdered in the concentration camps, and another sister was shot dead. Shamir once told Ehud Olmert that when his father, living under Nazi occupation, had been informed that the extermination of the Jews was imminent, his father had replied that &quot;I have a son in the Land of Israel, and he will exact my revenge on them&quot;. 

In July 1946, Shamir was arrested. He had been walking in public in disguise and a British police sergeant, T.G. Martin, recognized him by his bushy eyebrows. Arrested, he was exiled to Africa, and interned in Eritrea by British Mandatory authorities. Lehi members subsequently tracked down and killed Martin in September 1946. On January 14, 1947, Shamir and four Irgun members escaped the Sembel Prison (a British Detention Camp) through a tunnel they had dug, 200 feet in length, and Mayer Malka of Khartoum subsequently arranged for them to be hidden in an oil truck for three days as it was driven over the border to French Somaliland. They were re-arrested by the French authorities, but Shamir with Malka&#x27;s assistance was eventually allowed passage to France and granted political asylum. Lehi sent him a forged passport, with which he entered Israel after the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948.

===1948 Deir Yassin massacre===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Lehi became most famous for the Deir Yassin massacre. From April 9 to 11, 1948 around 130 fighters from Irgun and Lehi violated a peace deal with the village of Deir Yassin and killed at least 107 Palestinian Arab villagers, nearly all civilians. Some villagers who had hidden or pretended to be dead were killed by Lehi men on April 10 or 11. News of the killings sparked terror among Palestinians across the country, frightening them to flee their homes in the face of Jewish troop advances and it strengthened the resolve of Arab governments to intervene, which they did five weeks later.

Lehi met fierce resistance from the Labor Zionist establishment in Israel as well as the broader Jewish diaspora for emulating European fascism. When Menachim Begin visited New York City in December 1948 over twenty prominent Jewish intellectuals condemned the Irgun and Lehi for their part in the Deir Yassin massacre in an to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The letter was signed by over twenty prominent Jewish intellectuals, including Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Zellig Harris, and Sidney Hook. 
A shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants (240 men, women, and children) and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin. ...

During the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute. ... Within the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority.

After the backlash to the massacre, the Lehi troika of Shamir, Eldad, and Yellin-Mor formally disbanded most of the organization on May 29, 1948 but continued to lead a minority of the membership from Jerusalem. Lehi leadership continued to be outside of Israeli government control while most of its former membership joined the newly formed Israel Defense Forces. During a UN-imposed truce, Shamir, Eldad, and Yellin-Mor authorized the assassination of the United Nations representative in the Middle East, Count Folke Bernadotte, who was killed in September 1948, when Lehi gunmen ambushed his motorcade in Jerusalem. Lehi had feared that Israel would agree to Bernadotte&#x27;s peace proposals, which they considered disastrous, unaware that the provisional Israeli government had already rejected a proposal by Bernadotte the day before. The Israeli provisional government drafted an ordinance for the prevention of terrorism and then invoked it to declare Lehi a terrorist organisation, consequently rounding up 200 of its members for &quot;administrative detention&quot; (prison). They were granted amnesty some months later and given a state pardon.

==Mossad==
In the first years of Israel&#x27;s independence, Shamir managed several commercial enterprises. In 1955, he joined Mossad, serving until 1965. During his Mossad career, he directed Operation Damocles, the assassinations of German rocket scientists working on the Egyptian missile programme.

He ran a unit that placed agents in hostile countries, created the Mossad&#x27;s division for planning and served on its General Staff.

Shamir resigned from the Mossad in protest over the treatment of Mossad Director-General Isser Harel, who had been compelled to resign after Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered an end to Operation Damocles.

==Political career==


In 1969, Shamir joined the Herut party headed by Menachem Begin and was first elected to the Knesset in 1973 as a member of the Likud. He became Speaker of the Knesset in 1977, and Foreign Minister in 1980 which he remained until 1986, concurrently serving as prime minister from October 1983 to September 1984 after Begin&#x27;s resignation.

Shamir had a reputation as a Likud hard-liner. In 1977 he presided at the Knesset visit of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. He abstained in the Knesset votes to approve the Camp David Accords and the Peace Treaty with Egypt. In 1981 and 1982, as Foreign Minister, he guided negotiations with Egypt to normalize relations after the treaty. Following the 1982 Lebanon War he directed negotiations which led to the May 17, 1983 Agreement with Lebanon, which did not materialize.

===Prime minister===
Shamir won the 1983 Herut leadership election against David Levy to succeed Begin as leader of Herut, the Likud, and Prime Minister of Israel. Shamir won reelection as party leader in the 1984 Herut leadership election, defeating a challenge from Ariel Sharon. His failure to stabilize Israel&#x27;s inflationary economy and to suggest a solution to the quagmire of Lebanon led to an indecisive election in 1984. Shamir lost the election but was able to retain his post as foreign minister in a national unity government between the Likud alliance and the Alignment led by Prime Minister Shimon Peres. As part of the agreement, Peres held the post of Prime Minister until September 1986, when Shamir returned to the prime ministership and Peres became foreign minister.

As he prepared to reclaim the office of prime minister, Shamir&#x27;s hard-line image appeared to moderate. However, Shamir remained reluctant to change the status quo in Israel&#x27;s relations with its Arab neighbours and blocked Peres&#x27;s initiative to promote a regional peace conference as agreed in 1987 with King Hussein of Jordan in what has become known as the London Agreement. Re-elected in 1988, Shamir and Peres formed a new coalition government until &quot;the dirty trick&quot; of 1990, when the Alignment left the government, leaving Shamir with a narrow right-wing coalition. During this period the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip launched the first Intifada, which was suppressed with force by the Israeli government.

Shamir urged the US government to stop granting refugee visas to Soviet Jews, persuading it that they were not refugees because they already had a homeland in Israel and were only moving to the United States for economic reasons. He also termed the emigration of Soviet Jews to the United States rather than to Israel &quot;defection&quot;, and called the issuing of US refugee visas to Soviet Jews when Israel was already willing to take them in &quot;an insult to Israel&quot;. In 1989, a wave of Jewish emigration began from the Soviet Union after the Soviets allowed their Jewish population to emigrate freely. In October of that year, the US agreed to his requests and stopped issuing refugee visas to Soviet emigrants. Subsequently, Israel became the main destination of Soviet Jewish emigrants. Over one million Soviet immigrants would subsequently arrive in Israel, many of whom would have likely gone to the United States had Shamir not pressed the US government to change its policy.
In September 1989, a journalist for the Jerusalem Post asked Shamir, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t it amaze you that in Poland, where hardly a Jew is left, there should still be a powerful anti-Semitic presence?&quot; Shamir replied &quot;They suck it in with their mother&#x27;s milk! This is something that is deeply imbued in their tradition, their mentality.&quot; The comment caused public and diplomatic controversy within Poland as being libelous. Adam Michnik later addressed the comment by stating &quot;the stubborn categorization of Poland as an anti-Semitic nation was used in Europe and America as an alibi for the betrayal of Poland at Yalta. The nation so categorized was seen as unworthy of sympathy, or of help, or of compassion.&quot;

In a 1996 interview with the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, Shamir said the controversy was based on a misunderstanding of what he said:

During the Gulf War, Iraq fired Scud missiles at Israel, many of which struck population centers. Iraq hoped to provoke Israeli retaliation and thus alienate Arab members of the United States-assembled coalition against Iraq. Shamir deployed Israeli Air Force jets to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq. However, after the United States and the Netherlands deployed Patriot antimissile batteries to protect Israel, and US and British special forces began hunting for Scuds, Shamir responded to American calls for restraint, recalled the jets, and agreed not to retaliate.

During his term, Shamir reestablished diplomatic relations between Israel and several dozen African, Asian and other countries. In May 1991, as the Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was collapsing, Shamir ordered the airlifting of 14,000 Ethiopian Jews, known as Operation Solomon. He continued his efforts, begun in the late 1960s, to bring Soviet Jewish refugees to Israel. Shamir restored diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Israel in October 1991, and following its dissolution, established relations between Israel and his native Belarus in May 1992. Shamir was dedicated to bringing Jews from all over the world to Israel, and called on American Jews to emigrate to Israel in spite of a higher standard of living in the US, saying that he expected even American Jewish youth to realize that &quot;man does not live by bread alone&quot; but to &quot;learn and understand Jewish history, the Bible... and reach the only conclusion: to come on aliya to Israel.&quot;

Relations with the US were strained in the period after the war over the Madrid peace talks, which Shamir opposed. As a result, US President George H. W. Bush was reluctant to approve loan guarantees to help absorb immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Finally, Shamir gave in and in October 1991 participated in the Madrid talks. His narrow, right-wing government collapsed, and new elections were necessarily called.

In a February 1992 leadership election, Shamir retained his leadership of Likud, defeating challenges from David Levy and Ariel Sharon.

One of Shamir&#x27;s last acts as Prime Minister was to approve the 16 February 1992 assassination of the leader of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abbas al-Musawi.

===Electoral defeat and retirement===
Shamir was defeated by Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s Labour in the 1992 election. He stepped down from the Likud leadership in March 1993 but remained a member of the Knesset until the 1996 election. For some time, Shamir was a critic of his Likud successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, as being too indecisive in dealing with the Arabs. Shamir went so far as to resign from the Likud in 1998 and endorse Herut, a right-wing splinter movement led by Benny Begin, which later joined the National Union during the 1999 election. After Netanyahu was defeated, Shamir returned to the Likud fold and supported Ariel Sharon in the 2001 election. He was placed honorary 120th last spot on the Likud list in the 2003 Israeli legislative election. Subsequently, in his late eighties, Shamir ceased making public comments.

==Illness and death==

In 2004, Shamir&#x27;s health declined, with the progression of his Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and he was moved to a nursing home. The government turned down a request by the family to finance his stay at the facility.

Shulamit Shamir died on July 29, 2011. Less than a year later, Yitzhak Shamir died on the morning of June 30, 2012, at a nursing home in Tel Aviv where he had spent the last few years as a result of the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease he had suffered since the mid-1990s. He was given a state funeral, which took place on July 2 at Mount Herzl, Jerusalem, and was buried beside his wife, Shulamit, who had died the previous year. As his body was lying in state Speaker of the Knesset Reuven Rivlin laid a wreath on his coffin and said:
Shamir was buried at Mount Herzl.

===Commemoration===
Israeli President Shimon Peres said that &quot;Yitzhak Shamir was a brave warrior for Israel, before and after its inception. He was a great patriot and his enormous contribution will be forever etched in our chronicles. He was loyal to his beliefs and he served his country with the utmost dedication for decades. May he rest in peace.&quot; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s office issued a statement upon hearing of his death that read: &quot;[Shamir] led Israel with a deep loyalty to the nation. [The Prime Minister] expresses his deep pain over the announcement of the departure of Yitzhak Shamir. He was part of a marvelous generation which created the state of Israel and struggled for the Jewish people.&quot; This was despite previous feuds between the two once-Likud members. He was also mourned in the Knesset.

Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman added that Shamir &quot;contributed greatly to the foundation of the state, which he served his entire life with loyalty and unwavering dedication. He set an example in each position that he held. I had the privilege to be personally acquainted with Shamir, and I will always remember him and his great contribution to the state;&quot; while Defense Minister Ehud Barak said: &quot;His whole life, Shamir was as stable as granite and maintained focus without compromises. He always strived to ensure Israel&#x27;s freedom. His devotion knew no bounds [and he] always sought what&#x27;s right for the people of Israel and for the country&#x27;s security.&quot;

Leader of the Opposition and Labor Party head Shelly Yachimovich offered her condolences to Shamir&#x27;s family saying that ... he was a determined prime minister who dedicated his life to the state. He followed his ideological path honestly and humbly, as a leader should. The citizens of Israel will always remember the wisdom he demonstrated during the First Gulf War. He showed restraint and saved Israel from undue entanglement in the Iraq War. This decision proved to be a brave and wise act of leadership.

His daughter Gilada Diamant said: [My father] belonged to a different generation of leaders, people with values and beliefs. I hope that we have more people like him in the future. His political doing has undoubtedly left its mark on the State of Israel. Dad was an amazing man, a family man in the fullest sense of the word, a man who dedicated himself to the State of Israel but never forgot his family, not even for a moment. He was a special man.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2001, Shamir received the Israel Prize, for his lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.
==Published works==
He wrote &quot;Sikumo shel davar&quot;, a book which was published in English by Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, as &quot;Summing Up: An autobiography&quot; (1994).

==Overview of offices held==
Shamir twice served as prime minister (Israel&#x27;s head of government). His first stint spanned from 10 October 1983 through 13 September 1984, leading the 20th government during the latter portion of the 10th Knesset. His second stint lasted from 20 October 1986 through 13 July 1992, leading the 22nd government during the latter half of the 11th Knesset, and 23rd and 24th governments during the 12th Knesset.

<text>The Continental Army was the army of the United Colonies representing the Thirteen Colonies and later the United States during the American Revolutionary War. It was formed on June 14, 1775, by a resolution passed by the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia after the war&#x27;s outbreak. The Continental Army was created to coordinate military efforts of the colonies in the war against the British, who sought to maintain control over the American colonies. General George Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and maintained this position throughout the war.

The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and volunteer troops that were either loyal to individual states or otherwise independent. Most of the Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war. The Continental Army&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Regiments went on to form what was to become the Legion of the United States in 1792, which ultimately served as the foundation for the creation of the United States Army.

==Origins==
The Continental Army consisted of soldiers from all the Thirteen Colonies and, after 1776, from all 13 states. The American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, on April 19, 1775, at a time when the colonial revolutionaries had no standing army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the militia, which was made up of part-time citizen-soldiers for local defense; or the raising of temporary provincial troops during such crises as the French and Indian War of 1754–1763. As tensions with Great Britain increased in the years leading to the war, colonists began to reform their militias in preparation for the perceived potential conflict. Training of militiamen increased after the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774. Colonists such as Richard Henry Lee proposed forming a national militia force, but the First Continental Congress rejected the idea.

On April 23, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the raising of a colonial army consisting of 26 company regiments. New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut soon raised similar but smaller forces. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000). It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from [Pennsylvania]], Maryland, and Virginia to be used as light infantry. The Pennsylvania riflemen became the 1st Continental Regiment in January 1776. On June 15, 1775, Congress elected by unanimous vote George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Washington accepted and served throughout the war without any compensation except for reimbursement of expenses. As the Continental Congress increasingly adopted the responsibilities and posture of a legislature for a sovereign state, the role of the Continental Army became the subject of considerable debate. Some Americans had a general aversion to maintaining a standing army; but on the other hand, the requirements of the war against the British required the discipline and organization of a modern military. As a result, the army went through several distinct phases, characterized by official dissolution and reorganization of units.

==Establishments==
The Continental Army&#x27;s forces included several successive armies or establishments:
* The Continental Army of 1775, comprising the initial New England Army, was organized by Washington into three divisions, six brigades, and 38 regiments. Major General Philip Schuyler&#x27;s ten regiments in New York were sent to invade Canada.
* The Continental Army of 1776, was reorganized after the initial enlistment period of the soldiers in the 1775 army had expired. Washington had submitted recommendations to the Continental Congress almost immediately after he had accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief, but the Congress took time to consider and implement these. Despite attempts to broaden the recruiting base beyond New England, the 1776 army remained skewed toward the Northeast both in terms of its composition and of its geographical focus. This army consisted of 36 regiments, most standardized to a single battalion of 768 men strong and formed into eight companies, with a strength of 640.
* The Continental Army of 1777–1780 evolved out of several critical reforms and political decisions that came about when it became apparent that the British were sending substantial forces to put an end to the American Revolution. The Second Continental Congress passed the &quot;Eighty-eight Battalion Resolve&quot;, ordering each state to contribute one-battalion regiments in proportion to their population, and Washington subsequently received authority to raise an additional 16 battalions. Enlistment terms extended to three years or to &quot;the length of the war&quot; to avoid the year-end crises that depleted forces, including the notable near-collapse of the army at the end of 1776, which could have ended the war in a Continental, or American, loss by forfeit.
* The Continental Army of 1781–1782 saw the greatest crisis on the American side in the war. Congress was bankrupt, making it very difficult to replenish the soldiers whose three-year terms had expired. Popular support for the war reached an all-time low, and Washington had to put down mutinies both in the Pennsylvania Line and in the New Jersey Line. Congress voted to cut funding for the Army, but Washington managed nevertheless to secure important strategic victories.
* The Continental Army of 1783–1784 was succeeded by the United States Army, which exists to the present day. As peace was restored with the British, most of the regiments were disbanded in an orderly fashion, though several had already been diminished.

==Organization==

===Governing bodies===
Military affairs were at first managed by the Continental Congress in plenary session, although specific matters were prepared by a number of ad hoc committees. In June 1776 a five-member standing committee, the Board of War and Ordnance, was established in order to replace the ad hoc committees. The five members who formed the Board fully participated in the plenary activities of Congress as well as in other committees and were unable to fully engage in the administrative leadership of the Continental Army. A new Board of War was therefore formed in October 1777, of three commissioners not member of Congress. Two more commissioners, not members of Congress, were shortly thereafter added, but in October 1778, the membership was set to three commissioners not members of Congress and two commissioners members of Congress. In early 1780, the Quartermaster General, the Commissary General of Purchase, and the Commissary General of Issue were put under the direction of the Board. The Office of the Secretary at War was created in February 1781, although the Office did not start its work until Benjamin Lincoln assumed the office in October 1781.

===Commander-in-chief===

On June 15, 1775, delegates to the Second Continental Congress, convening in present-day Independence Hall in Philadelphia, unanimously elected George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Washington accepted the position, and served throughout the American Revolutionary War without any compensation except for reimbursement of expenses. Washington, as commander-in-chief, was supported by a chief administrative officer, the Adjutant General. Horatio Gates held the position (1775–1776), Joseph Reed (1776–1777), George Weedon and Isaac Budd Dunn (1777), Morgan Connor 1777, Timothy Pickering (1777–1778), Alexander Scammell (1778–1781), and Edward Hand (1781–1783). An Inspector General assisted the Commander-in-Chief through periodically inspecting and reporting on the condition of troops. The first incumbent was Thomas Conway (1777–1778), followed by Baron von Steuben 1778–1784, under whom the position became that of a de facto chief of staff. The Judge Advocate General assisted the commander-in-chief with the administration of military justice, but he did not, as his modern counterpart, give legal advise. William Tudor was the first appointee. He was followed by John Laurance in 1777 and Thomas Edwards in 1781 The Mustermaster General kept track by name of every officer and man serving in the army. The first mustermaster was Stephen Moylan. He was followed by Gunning Bedford Jr. 1776–1777 and Joseph Ward.

===Territorial organization===
Units of the Continental Army were assigned to any one of the territorial departments to decentralize command and administration. In general there were seven territorial departments, although their boundaries were subject to change and they were not all in existence throughout the war. The Department of New York (later the Northern Department) was created when Congress made Philip Schuyler its commander on June 15, 1775. The Southern and Middle Departments were added in February 1776. Several others were added the same year. A major general appointed by Congress commanded each department. Under his command came all Continental Army units within the territorial limits of the department, as well as state troops and militia – if released by the governor of the state.

===Tactical organization===
All troops under the department commander were designated as an army; hence troops in the Northern Department were called the &quot;Northern Army&quot;, in the Southern Department the &quot;Southern Army&quot;, etc. The department commander could be field commander or he could appoint another officer to command the troops in the field. Depending on the size of the army, it could be divided into &quot;wings&quot; or divisions (of typically three brigades) that were temporary organizations, and brigades (of two to five regiments) that in effect were permanent organizations and the basic tactical unit of the Continental Army.

An infantry regiment in the Continental Army typically consisted of 8 to 10 companies, each commanded by a captain. Field officers usually included a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, and a major. A regimental staff was made up of an adjutant, quartermaster, surgeon, surgeon&#x27;s mate, paymaster, and chaplain. Infantry regiments were often called simply regiments or battalions. The regiment&#x27;s fighting strength consisted of a single battalion of 728 officers and enlisted men at full strength. Cavalry and artillery regiments were organized in a similar manner. A company of cavalry was frequently called a troop. An artillery company contained specialized soldiers, such as bombardiers, gunners, and matrosses. A continental cavalry regiment had a nominal strength of 280 officers and men, but the actual strength was usually less than 150 men and even fewer horses. Artificers were civilian or military mechanics and artisans employed by the army to provide services. They included blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, harnessmakers, and wheelwrights.

===Logistical organization===

In June 1775, the Second Continental Congress created the position of Quartermaster General, after the British example. He was charged with opening and maintaining the lines of advance and retreat, laying out camps and assigning quarters. His responsibilities included furnishing the army with materiel and supplies, although the supply of arms, clothing, and provisions fell under other departments. The transportation of all supplies, even those provided by other departments, came under his ambit. The Quartermaster General served with the main army under General George Washington, but was directly responsible to Congress. Deputy quartermasters were appointed by Congress to serve with separate armies, and functioned independently of the Quartermaster General. Thomas Mifflin served as Quartermaster General (1775–1776 and 1776–1778), Stephen Moylan (1776), Nathanael Greene (1778–1780), and Timothy Pickering (from 1780).

Congress also created the position of Commissary General of Stores and Provisions directly responsible to Congress, with Joseph Trumbull as the first incumbent. In 1777, Congress divided the department into two, a Commissary General of Purchases, with four deputies, and a Commissary General of Issues, with three deputies. William Buchanan was head of the Purchase Department (1777–1778), Jeremiah Wadsworth (1778–1779), and Ephraim Blaine (1779–1781). In 1780, the department became subordinated to the Superintendent of Finance, although Blaine retained his position. Charles Stewart served as Commissary General of Issues (1777–1782).

The responsibility for procuring arms and ammunition at first rested with various committees of Congress. In 1775, a field organization, usually known as the Military Branch of the Commissariat of Military Stores, was made responsible for distribution and care of ordnance in the field. In 1777, Congress established a Commissary General of Military Stores. Known as the Civil Branch, this organization was responsible for handling arsenals, laboratories, and some procurement under the general supervision of the Board of War. Later in the war, a Surveyor of Ordnance was made responsible for inspecting foundries, magazines, ordnance shops, and field ordnance. In July 1777, the Board of War was authorized to purchase artillery.

Congress created a hospital department in July 1775 as a part of the Continental Army&#x27;s administrative structure. It came under the Director General of the Hospital Department, chosen by Congress but serving under the Commander-in-Chief, and was staffed by four surgeons, an apothecary, twenty surgeon&#x27;s mates, a nurse for every ten patients, a matron to supervise the nurses, a clerk, and two storekeepers. The department was reorganized in 1777; deputy director generals were added to the administrative structure; commissaries of hospitals were established to provide food and forage; and apothecary generals were established to procure and distribute medicines. The first director general was Benjamin Church (1775), he was followed by John Morgan (1775–1777), William Shippen (1777–1781), and John Cochran (1781).

Keeping the continentals clothed was a difficult task and to do this Washington appointed James Mease, a merchant from Philadelphia, as Clothier General. Mease worked closely with state-appointed agents to purchase clothing and things such as cow hides to make clothing and shoes for soldiers. Mease eventually resigned in 1777 and had compromised much of the organization of the Clothing Department. After this, on many accounts, the soldiers of the Continental Army were often poorly clothed, had few blankets, and often did not even have shoes. The problems with clothing and shoes for soldiers were often not the result of not having enough but of organization and lack of transportation. To reorganize, the Board of War was appointed to sort out the clothing supply chain. During this time they sought out the help of France, and for the remainder of the war clothing was coming from over-sea procurement.

The disbursing of money to pay soldiers and suppliers were the function of the Paymaster-General. James Warren was the first incumbent of this office. His successor was William Palfrey in 1776, who was followed by John Pierce Jr. in 1781.

==Officers and men==

The Continental Army lacked the discipline typically expected of an army. When they first assembled, the count of how many soldiers George Washington had was delayed a little over a week. Instead of obeying their commanders and officers without question, each unit was a community that had democratically chosen its leaders. The regiments came from different states and, due to being compromised of volunteers, were uneven in numbers. While this could have been remedied by reassigning soldiers, many held a belief borne of American republicanism - if separated from the officers they had chosen, soldiers did not believe they should have to serve. Relying on the willingness of his volunteer army to fight, George Washington had to sacrifice this logistical weakness in favor of compromise. 3
Soldiers in the Continental Army were volunteers; they agreed to serve in the army and standard enlistment periods lasted from one to three years. Early in the war, the enlistment periods were short, as the Continental Congress feared the possibility of the Continental Army evolving into a permanent army. The army never numbered more than 48,000 men overall and 13,000 troops in one area. The turnover proved a constant problem, particularly in the winter of 1776–1777, and longer enlistments were approved. As the new country (not yet fully independent) had no money, the government agreed to give grants to the soldiers which they could exchange for money. In 1781 and 1782, Patriot officials and officers in the Southern Colonies repeatedly implemented policies that offered slaves as rewards for recruiters who managed to enlist a certain number of volunteers in the Continental Army; in January 1781, Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly passed a measure which announced that voluntary enlistees in the Virginia Line&#x27;s regiments would be given a &quot;healthy sound negro&quot; as a reward.

The officers of both the Continental Army and the state militias were typically yeoman farmers with a sense of honor and status and an ideological commitment to oppose the policies of the British Crown. Meanwhile, the enlisted men largely came from the working class or minority groups, namely English, Ulster Protestant, or African descent. Up to a fourth of Washington&#x27;s army were of Scots-Irish (English and Scottish descent) Ulster origin, many being recent arrivals and in need of work. They were motivated to volunteer by specific contracts that promised bounty money; regular pay at good wages; food, clothing, and medical care; companionship; and the promise of land ownership after the war. By 1780, more than 30,000 men served in the Continental army, but the lack of resources and proper training resulted in the deaths of over 13,000 soldiers. By 1781–1782, threats of mutiny and actual mutinies were becoming serious. 

The Continental Army was racially integrated, a condition the United States Army would not see again until the late 1940s. During the Revolution, African American slaves were promised freedom in exchange for military service by both the Continental and British armies. Approximately 6,600 people of color (including African American, indigenous, and multiracial men) served with the colonial forces, and made up one-fifth of the Northern Continental Army.

In addition to the Continental Army regulars, state militia units were assigned for short-term service and fought in campaigns throughout the war. Sometimes the militia units operated independently of the Continental Army, but often local militias were called out to support and augment the Continental Army regulars during campaigns. The militia troops developed a reputation for being prone to premature retreats, a fact that General Daniel Morgan integrated into his strategy at the Battle of Cowpens and used to fool the British in 1781.

The financial responsibility for providing pay, food, shelter, clothing, arms, and other equipment to specific units was assigned to states as part of the establishment of these units. States differed in how well they lived up to these obligations. There were constant funding issues and morale problems as the war continued. This led to the army offering low pay, often rotten food, hard work, cold, heat, poor clothing and shelter, harsh discipline, and a high chance of becoming a casualty.

==Operations==

During the siege of Boston in June 1775, the Continental Army in Cambridge, Massachusetts is estimated to have numbered between 14,000 and 16,000 men from New England, though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions. Until George Washington&#x27;s arrival in Cambridge, the Continental Army was commanded by Artemas Ward. The British Army in Boston was increasing by fresh arrivals, then numbering about 10,000 men. The British controlled Boston and defended it with their fleet, but they were outnumbered and did not attempt to challenge the American control of New England. Washington selected young Henry Knox, a self-educated strategist, to take charge of the artillery from an abandoned British fort in upstate New York, and dragged across the snow to and placed them in the hills surrounding Boston in March 1776. The British situation was untenable. They negotiated an uneventful abandonment of the city and relocated their forces to Halifax in Canada. Washington relocated his army to New York. For the next five years, the main bodies of the Continental and British armies campaigned against one another in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These campaigns included the notable battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Morristown, and others.

The army increased its effectiveness and success rate through a series of trials and errors, often at a great human cost. General Washington and other distinguished officers were instrumental leaders in preserving unity, learning and adapting, and ensuring discipline throughout the eight years of war. In the winter of 1777–1778, with the addition of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian expert, the training and discipline of the Continental Army was dramatically upgraded to modern European standards through the &quot;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States&quot;. This was during the infamous winter at Valley Forge. Washington always viewed the Army as a temporary measure and strove to maintain civilian control of the military, as did the Continental Congress, though there were minor disagreements about how this was to be carried out.

Throughout its existence, the Army was troubled by poor logistics, inadequate training, short-term enlistments, interstate rivalries, and Congress&#x27;s inability to compel the states to provide food, money, or supplies. In the beginning, soldiers enlisted for a year, largely motivated by patriotism; but as the war dragged on, bounties and other incentives became more commonplace. Major and minor mutinies—56 in all—diminished the reliability of two of the main units late in the war.

The French played a decisive role in 1781 as Washington&#x27;s Army was augmented by a French expeditionary force under Lieutenant General Rochambeau and a squadron of the French navy under the Comte de Barras. By disguising his movements, Washington moved the combined forces south to Virginia without the British commanders in New York realizing it. This resulted in the capture of the main British invasion force in the south at the Siege of Yorktown, which resulted in the American and their allied victory in the land war in North America and assured independence.

==Demobilization==
A small residual force remained at West Point and some frontier outposts until Congress created the United States Army by their resolution of June 3, 1784. Although Congress declined on May 12 to make a decision on the peace establishment, it did address the need for some troops to remain on duty until the British evacuated New York City and several frontier posts. The delegates told Washington to use men enlisted for fixed terms as temporary garrisons. A detachment of those men from West Point reoccupied New York without incident on November 25. When Steuben&#x27;s effort in July to negotiate a transfer of frontier forts with Major General Frederick Haldimand collapsed, however, the British maintained control over them, as they would into the 1790s. That failure and the realization that most of the remaining infantrymen&#x27;s enlistments were due to expire by June 1784 led Washington to order Knox, his choice as the commander of the peacetime army, to discharge all but 500 infantry and 100 artillerymen before winter set in. The former regrouped as 1st American Regiment, under Colonel Henry Jackson of Massachusetts. The single artillery company, New Yorkers under Major John Doughty, came from remnants of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment.

Congress issued a proclamation on October 18, 1783, which approved Washington&#x27;s reductions. On November 2, Washington, then at Rockingham near Rocky Hill, New Jersey, released his &quot;Farewell Orders issued to the Armies of the United States of America&quot; to the Philadelphia newspapers for nationwide distribution to the furloughed men. In the message, he thanked the officers and men for their assistance and reminded them that &quot;the singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving; while the unparalleled perseverance of the Armies of the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing Miracle.&quot;

Washington believed that the blending of persons from every colony into &quot;one patriotic band of Brothers&quot; had been a major accomplishment, and he urged the veterans to continue this devotion in civilian life. Washington said farewell to his remaining officers on December 4 at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. On December 23 he appeared in Congress, then sitting at Annapolis, and returned his commission as commander-in-chief: &quot;Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of Action; and bidding an Affectionate farewell to this August body under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my Commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.&quot; Congress ended the War of American Independence on January 14, 1784, by ratifying the definitive peace treaty that had been signed in Paris on September 3.

==Military ranks==

===Rank and pay===
Monthly pay of the officers and soldiers of the continental line as established by the resolutions of Congress, fixing the arrangement of the Continental Army May 27, 1778, which rate of pay continued to the end of the war.



===Rank insignia===

During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army initially wore ribbons, cockades, and epaulettes of various colors as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; form of rank insignia, as General George Washington wrote in 1775:
In 1776, captains were to have buff or white cockades.
;Rank insignia in 1775

Later on in the war, the Continental Army established its own uniform with a black and white cockade among all ranks. Infantry officers had silver and other branches gold insignia:

<text>Ehud Barak ( ; born Ehud Brog; 12 February 1942) is an Israeli former general and politician who served as the tenth prime minister from 1999 to 2001. He was leader of the Labor Party between 1997 and 2001 and between 2007 and 2011.

Born on a kibbutz, Barak is the eldest of four sons; his grandparents were murdered in the Holocaust. He graduated in physics and mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and later obtained a master&#x27;s in engineering-economic systems from Stanford University.

Barak&#x27;s military career in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began in 1959, spanning 35 years and culminating in his appointment as Chief of the General Staff in 1991, serving until 1995. His military tenure is noted for his leadership in several operations, including &quot;Operation Isotope&quot; in 1972, the covert 1973 Israeli raid in Lebanon, and the 1976 Entebbe raid. A lieutenant general, Barak shares with two others the honor of being the most highly decorated soldier in Israel&#x27;s history.

In politics, his career began with his appointment as interior minister in 1995 under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Following Rabin&#x27;s assassination, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in Shimon Peres&#x27; government. Barak was elected to the Knesset on the Labor Party list in 1996 and subsequently became party leader. Barak served as Israel&#x27;s last left-wing Prime Minister from 1999 to 2001. His tenure was marked by significant events, including the decision to form a coalition with the Orthodox party Shas, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon in 2000, and participation in the 2000 Camp David Summit aimed at resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Barak&#x27;s government faced challenges, notably the protests in October 2000.

After defeat in the 2001 Israeli prime ministerial election, he left politics and engaged in international business and advisory roles. He made a political comeback in 2005, attempting to regain leadership in the Labor Party, and later served as defense minister − where he led Operation Cast Lead in 2008–09 − and deputy prime minister under Ehud Olmert and then in Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s second government between 2007 and 2013. His decision to form the Independence party in 2011 marked a shift in his politics, influencing the dynamics within the Netanyahu government. Despite retiring from politics in 2012, he attempted another comeback, running in the September 2019 Israeli legislative election as the leader of Israel Democratic Party − a new party he formed. His party merged with others to form an alliance called the Democratic Union, but it did not win enough seats for him to become a member of the Knesset. Outside of his political and military career, Barak has accumulated wealth through business endeavors and investments; his net worth is estimated to be $10–15 million.

==Early life and family==

Ehud Barak was born on kibbutz Mishmar HaSharon in what was then Mandatory Palestine. He is the eldest of four sons of Esther (née Godin; 25 June 1914 – 12 August 2013) and Yisrael Mendel Brog (24 August 1910 – 8 February 2002).

His paternal grandparents, Frieda and Reuven Brog, were murdered in Pušalotas (Pushelat) in northern Lithuania (then ruled by Russian Empire) in 1912, leaving his father orphaned at the age of two. Barak&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Elka and Shmuel Godin, died at the Treblinka extermination camp during the Holocaust.

Ehud hebraized his family name from &quot;Brog&quot; to &quot;Barak&quot; in 1972. It was during his military service that he met his future wife, Nava (née Cohen, born 8 April 1947 in Tiberias). They had three daughters together: Michal (born 9 August 1970), Yael (born 23 October 1974) and Anat (born 16 October 1981). He has grandchildren. Barak divorced Nava in August 2003. On 30 July 2007, Barak married Nili Priel (born 25 April 1944) in a small ceremony in his private residence. In his spare time, Barak enjoys reading works by writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and he is a classical pianist, with many years of study behind him.

Barak earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics and mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1968, and his master&#x27;s degree in engineering-economic systems in 1978 from Stanford University, California.

==Military career==
Barak joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1959. He served in the IDF for 35 years, rising to the position of Chief of the General Staff and the rank of &quot;Rav Aluf&quot; (Lieutenant-General), the highest in the Israeli military.
During his service as a commando in the elite Sayeret Matkal, Barak led several highly acclaimed operations, such as: &quot;Operation Isotope&quot;, the mission to free the hostages on board the hijacked Sabena Flight 571 at Lod Airport in 1972; the covert 1973 Israeli raid in Lebanon in Beirut, in which he was disguised as a woman to kill members of the Palestine Liberation Organization; Barak was also a key architect of the June 1976 Entebbe raid, another rescue mission to free the hostages of the Air France aircraft hijacked by terrorists and forced to land at the Entebbe Airport in Uganda. These highly acclaimed operations, along with Operation Bayonet, led to the dismantling of Palestinian terrorist cell Black September. It has been alluded that Barak also masterminded the Tunis Raid on 16 April 1988, in which PLO leader Abu Jihad was killed.

During the Yom Kippur War, Barak commanded an improvised regiment of tanks which, among other things, helped rescue paratrooper battalion 890, commanded by Yitzhak Mordechai, which was suffering heavy losses in the Battle of the Chinese Farm. He went on to command the 401st armored brigade and the 611st &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and 252nd &quot;Sinai&quot; divisions, before his appointment to head the IDF&#x27;s Planning Directorate. Barak also participated in the Siege of Beirut, overseeing it from Beirut International Airport.
Barak later served as head of Aman, the Military Intelligence Directorate (1983–85), head of Central Command (1986–87) and Deputy Chief of the General Staff (1987–91). He served as Chief of the General Staff between 1 April 1991 and 1 January 1995. During this period he implemented the first Oslo Accords and participated in the negotiations towards the Israel–Jordan peace treaty.

Barak was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service and four Chief of Staff citations (&quot;Tzalash HaRamatkal&quot;) for courage and operational excellence. These five decorations make him the most decorated soldier in Israeli history (jointly with close friend Nechemya Cohen). In 1992 he was awarded the Legion of Merit (Commander) by the United States. In 2012, he was again awarded by the United States with the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.

==Political career==

On 7 July 1995, Barak was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs by Yitzhak Rabin. When Shimon Peres formed a new government following Rabin&#x27;s assassination in November 1995, Barak was made Minister of Foreign Affairs (1995–96). He was elected to the Knesset on the Labor Party list in 1996, and served as a member of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Following internal elections after Peres&#x27; defeat in the election for Prime Minister in 1996, Barak became the leader of the Labor Party.

===Prime Minister of Israel===


In the 1999 Prime Ministerial election, Barak beat Benjamin Netanyahu by a wide margin. However, he sparked controversy by deciding to form a coalition with the ultra-Orthodox party Shas, who had won an unprecedented 17 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Shas grudgingly agreed to Barak&#x27;s terms that they eject their leader Aryeh Deri, a convicted felon, and enact reform to &quot;clean up&quot; in-party corruption. Consequentially, the left wing Meretz party quit the coalition after they failed to agree on the powers to be given to a Shas deputy minister in the Ministry of Education.

In 1999 Barak gave a campaign promise to end Israel&#x27;s 22-year-long occupation of Southern Lebanon within a year. On 24 May 2000 Israel withdrew from Southern Lebanon. On 7 October, three Israeli soldiers were killed in a border raid by Hezbollah and their bodies were subsequently captured. The bodies of these soldiers, along with the living Elhanan Tenenbaum, were eventually exchanged for Lebanese captives in 2004.

The Barak government resumed peace negotiations with the PLO, stating that &quot;Every attempt [by the State of Israel] to keep hold of this area [the West Bank and Gaza] as one political entity leads, necessarily, to either a nondemocratic or a non-Jewish state. Because if the Palestinians vote, then it is a binational state, and if they don&#x27;t vote it is an apartheid state.&quot; As part of these negotiations, Barak took part in the Camp David 2000 Summit which was meant finally to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict but failed. Barak also allowed Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami to attend the Taba Summit with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority, after his government had fallen.

===Domestic issues===
On 22 August 1999, Barak appointed the Tal committee which dealt with the controversial issue of ultra-Orthodox Jews&#x27; exemption from military service. Following the failure of the Camp David summit with Arafat and Bill Clinton in the summer of 2000, when the original 7 years mandate of the PNA expired, and just after Israel pulled out its last troops out of southern Lebanon in May 2000, the weeks-long Riots in October 2000 led to the killing of twelve Israeli Arabs and one Palestinian by Israel Police and one Jewish civilian by Israeli Arabs.

===Resignation===
In 2001, Barak called an election for Prime Minister. In the contest, he was defeated by Likud leader Ariel Sharon, and subsequently resigned as Labor leader and from the Knesset. He left Israel to work as a senior advisor with United States–based Electronic Data Systems. He also partnered with a private equity company focused on &quot;security-related&quot; work.

===Return to politics===

In 2005, Barak announced his return to Israeli politics, and ran for leadership of the Labor Party in November. However, in light of his weak poll showings, Barak dropped out of the race early and declared his support for veteran statesman Shimon Peres. Following his failed attempt to maintain leadership of the Labor party, Barak became a partner of the investment company SCP Private Equity Partners, Pennsylvania. He also established a company &quot;Ehud Barak Limited&quot; which is thought to have made over NIS 30 million.

After Peres lost the race to Amir Peretz and left the Labor party, Barak announced he would stay at the party, despite his shaky relationship with its newly elected leader. He declared, however, that he would not run for a spot on the Labor party&#x27;s Knesset list for the March 2006 elections. Barak&#x27;s attempt to return to a prominent role in Israel politics seemed to have failed. However, Peretz&#x27;s hold on the Labor leadership proved unexpectedly shaky as he was badly damaged by negative views of his performance as Defense Minister during the 2006 Lebanon War, which was seen as something less than a success in Israel.

In January 2007, Barak launched a bid to recapture the leadership of the Labor party in a letter acknowledging &quot;mistakes&quot; and &quot;inexperience&quot; during his tenure as Prime Minister. In early March 2007, a poll of Labor Party primary voters put Barak ahead of all other opponents, including Peretz. In the first round of voting, on 28 May 2007, he gained 39% of the votes, more than his two closest rivals, but not enough to win the election.

As a result, Barak faced a runoff against the second-place finisher, Ami Ayalon, on 12 June 2007, which he won by a narrow margin.

Barak has been critical of what he sees as racist sentiments that have recently been expressed by some Israeli rabbis and rebbetzins; he views such statements as a threat to Israeli unity and that they may lead Israeli society into a &quot;dark and dangerous place&quot;.

====Defense Minister====
====As head of the Labor Party====
After winning back the leadership of the Labor party, Barak was sworn in as Minister of Defense on 18 June 2007, as part of Prime Minister Olmert&#x27;s cabinet reshuffle. However, on 1 July 2007, Barak led a successful effort in the Labor central committee to stipulate that Labor would leave the government coalition if Olmert did not resign by September or October 2007. At that time the Winograd Commission would publish its final report on the performance of the Israel Defense Forces and its civilian leadership. The preliminary Winograd report released earlier this year laid most of the blame on Olmert for poorly planning, executing, and reviewing war strategies in the 2006 conflict against Hezbollah.

From December 2008 to January 2009, Barak led the Israel Defense Forces through Operation Cast Lead in his capacity as Minister of Defence.

Labor won only 13 out of the 120 Knesset seats in the 2009 elections, making them the fourth largest party. Barak and other Labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government. However, over the objections of some in the Labor party, in March 2009, Barak reached an agreement under which Labor joined the governing coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Barak retained his position as Defense Minister.

====Leaving the Labor Party====
In January 2011, Labor Party leader Barak formed a breakaway party, Independence, which enabled him to maintain his loyal Labor&#x27;s MK faction within Netanyahu&#x27;s government, and prevented the departure of Labor party as a whole from Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition-government. Labor previously threatened to force Barak to do so. After Barak&#x27;s move, Netanyahu was able to maintain a majority of 66 MK (out of 120 in the Knesset), previously having 74 MKs within his majority coalition.

In February 2011, Barak attended a ceremony at the UN for the International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. Barak told the UN General Assembly that &quot;an independent, strong, thriving and peaceful State of Israel is the vengeance of the dead.&quot;

Barak&#x27;s Independence party was due to run in a legislative election, but decided not to in 2012, and retired from politics. Barak planned to quit since Operation Pillar of Defense but postponed it until later that year.

Barak stated during an American television interview that he would &quot;probably&quot; strive for nuclear weapons if he were in Iran&#x27;s position, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t delude myself that they are doing it just because of Israel&quot;. This comment has been criticized and compared to Barak&#x27;s comment in 1998 during a television interview when he said that if he were a Palestinian he would probably have joined one of the terror organizations.

In 2023 it was revealed that Barak had visited Jeffrey Epstein around 30 times from 2013 to 2017 and had also flown on his jet, having first met Epstein in 2003. Barak denied any wrongdoing.

====Return to political life====
On 26 June 2019, Barak announced his return to politics and his intention to form a new party named the Israel Democratic Party, intending to challenge Netanyahu in the September 2019 Israeli legislative election. The party ran with Meretz and other parties in the Democratic Union alliance, which received five seats. Barak himself did not enter the Knesset.

==Financial assets==
In an interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported in January 2015, Barak was asked to explain the source of his &quot;big&quot; capital, with which he &quot;bought 5 apartments and connected them,&quot; and by which he &quot;lives in a giant rental apartment in a luxury high rise.&quot; Barak said he currently earns more than a $1 million a year, and that from 2001 to 2007, he also earned more than a $1 million every year, from giving lectures and from consulting for hedge funds. Barak also said he made millions of dollars more from his investments in Israeli real estate properties.

In the interview, Barak was asked whether he is a lobbyist who earns a living from &quot;opening doors&quot;. The interviewer stated &quot;You have arrived recently at the Kazakhstan despot Nazarbayev and the president of Ghana. You are received immediately.&quot; Barak confirmed that he has been received by these heads of state but denied earning money from opening doors for international business deals for Israeli and foreign corporations, and said he does not see any ethical or moral problems in his business activities. He further said there is no logic to demand of him, after &quot;the natural process in democracy has ended&quot; to not utilize the tools he accumulated in his career to secure his financial future. When asked if his financial worth is $10–15 million, Barak said &quot;I&#x27;m not far from there.&quot;

<text>Richard Threlkeld Cox (August 5, 1898 – May 2, 1991) was a professor of physics at Johns Hopkins University, known for Cox&#x27;s theorem relating to the foundations of probability.

==Biography==
He was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of attorney Lewis Cox and Elinor Cox. After Lewis Cox died, Elinor Cox married John Latané, who became a professor at Johns Hopkins University in 1913. In 1915 Richard enrolled at Johns Hopkins University to study physics, but his studies were cut short when he was drafted for World War I. He stayed in the US after being drafted and returned to Johns Hopkins University after the war, completing his BA in 1920. He earned his PhD in 1924; his dissertation was &quot;A Study of Pfund&#x27;s Pressure Gauge&quot;.

He taught at New York University (NYU) from 1924 to 1943, before returning to Johns Hopkins to teach. He studied probability theory, the scattering of electrons, and the discharges of electric eels. Richard Cox&#x27;s most important work was Cox&#x27;s theorem.

His wife, Shelby Shackleford (1899 Halifax, Virginia – 1987), whom he married in 1926, was an accomplished artist and illustrated &quot;Electric Eel Calling&quot;, a book on electric eels.

He died on May 2, 1991. His doctoral students include Carl T. Chase and Clifford Shull.

==Cox and parity violation==
According to T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang, parity violation implies that electrons produced by β decay should be longitudinally polarized. In 1959, Lee Grodzins indicated how a 1928 experiment by R. T. Cox, C. G. McIlwraith, and B. Kurrelmeyer on double scattering of β rays from radium confirms the polarization effect predicted by Lee and Yang. Carl T. Chase in 1929 and 1930 performed experiments confirming the 1928 experiment by Cox, McIlwraith, and Kurrelmeyer.

===Louis Witten interview===
Witten:
... I wanted to tell you something about Richard Cox. You mentioned Richard Cox. He did a lot of things, but he also did some experiments in condensed matter physics. He discovered an anomaly which wasn&#x27;t consistent with physics. It couldn&#x27;t be explained. It wasn&#x27;t at all consistent, and he was told his experiment was wrong, and he knew that his experiment was right. So he published it, and it was an anomaly in the literature. Some years later, it was discovered that parity wasn&#x27;t conserved, and his anomaly was non-parity. It&#x27;s well known now by many people that his experiment was the first experiment that would have shown parity wasn&#x27;t conserved if they had interpreted it correctly.
Rickles:
But he didn&#x27;t give that interpretation; he just thought there was something strange.
Witten:
That&#x27;s right. But he knew that his experiment was right and that people were trying to tell him that his experiment was wrong.

<text>Criminal justice is the delivery of justice to those who have been accused of committing crimes. The criminal justice system is a series of government agencies and institutions. Goals include the rehabilitation of offenders, preventing other crimes, and moral support for victims. The primary institutions of the criminal justice system are the police, prosecution and defense lawyers, the courts and the prisons system.

==Criminal justice system==
===Definition===
The criminal justice system consists of three main parts:
#Law enforcement agencies, usually the police
#Courts and accompanying prosecution and defence lawyers
#Agencies for detaining and supervising offenders, such as prisons and probation agencies.

In the criminal justice system, these distinct agencies operate together as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society.
===Law enforcement===

The first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police (or &quot;law enforcement&quot;) who investigates the suspected wrongdoing and makes an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation, a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order. The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. The word comes from the Latin &quot;politia&quot; (&quot;civil administration&quot;), which itself derives from the for (&quot;city&quot;). The first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France, although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Thames River Police in London, the Glasgow Police, and the Napoleonic police of Paris.

Police are primarily concerned with keeping the peace and enforcing criminal law based on their particular mission and jurisdiction. Formed in 1908, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began as an entity which could investigate and enforce specific federal laws as an investigative and &quot;law enforcement agency&quot; in the United States; this, however, has constituted only a small portion of overall policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different contexts, but the predominant ones are concerned with order maintenance and the provision of services. During modern times, such endeavors contribute toward fulfilling a shared mission among law enforcement organizations with respect to the traditional policing mission of deterring crime and maintaining societal order.

===Courts===
The courts serve as the venue where disputes are settled and justice is then administered. With regard to criminal justice, there are a number of critical people in any court setting. These critical people are referred to as the courtroom work group and include both professional and non professional individuals. These include the judge, prosecutor, and the defense attorney. The judge, or magistrate, is a person, elected or appointed, who is knowledgeable in the law, and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case.

In the U.S. and in a growing number of nations, guilt or innocence (although in the U.S. a jury can never find a defendant &quot;innocent&quot; but rather &quot;not guilty&quot;) is decided through the adversarial system. In this system, two parties will both offer their version of events and argue their case before the court (sometimes before a judge or panel of judges, sometimes before a jury). The case should be decided in favor of the party who offers the most sound and compelling arguments based on the law as applied to the facts of the case.

The prosecutor, or district attorney, is a lawyer who brings charges against a person, persons or corporate entity. It is the prosecutor&#x27;s duty to explain to the court what crime was committed and to detail what evidence has been found which incriminates the accused. The prosecutor should not be confused with a plaintiff or plaintiff&#x27;s counsel. Although both serve the function of bringing a complaint before the court, the prosecutor is a servant of the state who makes accusations on behalf of the state in criminal proceedings, while the plaintiff is the complaining party in civil proceedings.

A defense attorney counsels the accused on the a legal process, likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies. The accused, not the lawyer, has the right to make final decisions regarding a number of fundamental points, including whether to testify, and to accept a plea offer or demand a jury trial in appropriate cases. It is the defense attorney&#x27;s duty to represent the interests of the client, raise procedural and evidentiary issues, and hold the prosecution to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel may challenge evidence presented by the prosecution or present exculpatory evidence and argue on behalf of their client. At trial, the defense attorney may attempt to offer a rebuttal to the prosecutor&#x27;s accusations.

In the U.S., accused people are entitled to a government-paid defense attorney if the individual is in jeopardy of losing life and/or liberty. Those who cannot afford a private attorney may be provided one by the state. Historically, however, the right to a defense attorney has not always been universal. For example, in Tudor England criminals accused of treason were not permitted to offer arguments in their defense. In many jurisdictions, there is no right to an appointed attorney, if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty.

The final determination of guilt or innocence is typically made by a third party, who is supposed to be disinterested. This function may be performed by a judge, a panel of judges, or a jury panel composed of unbiased citizens. This process varies depending on the laws of the specific jurisdiction. In some places the panel (be it judges or a jury) is required to issue a unanimous decision, while in others only a majority vote is required. In America, this process depends on the state, level of court, and even agreements between the prosecuting and defending parties. Some nations do not use juries at all, or rely on theological or military authorities to issue verdicts.

Some cases can be disposed of without the need for a trial. In fact, the vast majority are. If the accused confesses his or her guilt, a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly. Some nations, such as America, allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads guilty, nolo contendere or not guilty, and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment, where the prosecution&#x27;s case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people. This reduced sentence is sometimes a reward for sparing the state the expense of a formal trial. Many nations do not permit the use of plea bargaining, believing that it coerces innocent people to plead guilty in an attempt to avoid a harsh punishment. The courts nowadays are seeking alternative measures as opposed to throwing someone into prison right away.

The entire trial process, whatever the country, is fraught with problems and subject to criticism. Bias and discrimination form an ever-present threat to an objective decision. Any prejudice on the part of the lawyers, the judge, or jury members threatens to destroy the court&#x27;s credibility. Some people argue that the often Byzantine rules governing courtroom conduct and processes restrict a layman&#x27;s ability to participate, essentially reducing the legal process to a battle between the lawyers. In this case, the criticism is that the decision is based less on sound justice and more on the lawyer&#x27;s eloquence and charisma. This is a particular problem when the lawyer performs in a substandard manner. The jury process is another area of frequent criticism, as there are few mechanisms to guard against poor judgment or incompetence on the part of the layman jurors. Judges themselves are very subject to bias subject to things as ordinary as the length of time since their last break.

Manipulations of the court system by defense and prosecution attorneys, law enforcement as well as the defendants have occurred and there have been cases where justice was denied.

===Corrections and rehabilitation===

Offenders are then turned over to the correctional authorities, from the court system after the accused has been found guilty. Like all other aspects of criminal justice, the administration of punishment has taken many different forms throughout history. Early on, when civilizations lacked the resources necessary to construct and maintain prisons, exile and execution were the primary forms of punishment. Historically shame punishments and exile have also been used as forms of censure.

The most publicly visible form of punishment in the modern era is the prison. Prisons may serve as detention centers for prisoners after trial. For containment of the accused, jails are used. Early prisons were used primarily to sequester criminals and little thought was given to living conditions within their walls. In America, the Quaker movement is commonly credited with establishing the idea that prisons should be used to reform criminals. This can be seen as a critical moment in the debate regarding the purpose of punishment.

Punishment (in the form of prison time) may serve a variety of purposes. First, and most obviously, the incarceration of criminals removes them from the general population and inhibits their ability to perpetrate further crimes. A new goal of prison punishments is to offer criminals a chance to be rehabilitated. Many modern prisons offer schooling or job training to prisoners as a chance to learn a vocation and thereby earn a legitimate living when they are returned to society. Religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons, with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners. If a prisoner is released before his time is served, he is released as a parole. This means that they are released, but the restrictions are greater than that of someone on probation.

There are numerous other forms of punishment which are commonly used in conjunction with or in place of prison terms. Monetary fines are one of the oldest forms of punishment still used today. These fines may be paid to the state or to the victims as a form of reparation. Probation and house arrest are also sanctions which seek to limit a person&#x27;s mobility and his or her opportunities to commit crimes without actually placing them in a prison setting. Furthermore, many jurisdictions may require some form of public or community service as a form of reparations for lesser offenses. In Corrections, the department ensures court-ordered, pre-sentence chemical dependency assessments, related Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative specific examinations and treatment will occur for offenders sentenced to Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative in compliance with RCW 9.94A.660.

Execution or capital punishment is still used around the world. Its use is one of the most heavily debated aspects of the criminal justice system. Some societies are willing to use executions as a form of political control, or for relatively minor misdeeds. Other societies reserve execution for only the most sinister and brutal offenses. Others still have discontinued the practice entirely, accepting the use of execution to be excessively cruel and/or irreversible in case of an erroneous conviction.

==Academic discipline==
The functional study of criminal justice is at times distinct from criminology, which involves the study of crime as a social phenomenon, causes of crime, criminal behavior, and other aspects of crime; although in most cases today, criminal justice as a field of study is used as a synonym for criminology and the sociology of law. It emerged as an academic discipline in the 1920s, beginning with Berkeley police chief August Vollmer who established a criminal justice program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1916. Vollmer&#x27;s work was carried on by his student, O.W. Wilson, who led efforts to professionalize policing and reduce corruption. Other programs were established in the United States at Indiana University, Michigan State University, San Jose State University, and the University of Washington. As of 1950, criminal justice students were estimated to number less than 1,000. Until the 1960s, the primary focus of criminal justice in the United States was on policing and police science.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, crime rates soared and social issues took center stage in the public eye. A number of new laws and studies focused federal resources on researching new approaches to crime control. The Warren Court (the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren), issued a series of rulings which redefined citizen&#x27;s rights and substantially altered the powers and responsibilities of police and the courts. The Civil Rights Era offered significant legal and ethical challenges to the &quot;status quo&quot;.

In the late 1960s, with the establishment of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) and associated policy changes that resulted with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The LEAA provided grants for criminology research, focusing on social aspects of crime. By the 1970s, there were 729 academic programs in criminology and criminal justice in the United States. Largely thanks to the Law Enforcement Education Program, criminal justice students numbered over 100,000 by 1975. Over time, scholars of criminal justice began to include criminology, sociology, and psychology, among others, to provide a more comprehensive view of the criminal justice system and the root causes of crime. Criminal justice studies now combine the practical and technical policing skills with a study of social deviance as a whole.

Criminal justice degrees are offered at both the two-year community college and four-year university level. Community college criminal justice programs include the Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS), and the Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees. Criminal justice degree programs at four-year institutions typically include coursework in statistics, methods of research, criminal justice, policing, U.S. court systems, criminal courts, corrections, community corrections, criminal procedure, criminal law, victimology, juvenile justice, and a variety of special topics. A number of universities offer, bachelor&#x27;s, academic minors, graduate certificates, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in Criminal Justice; Criminology, Law and Society; Administration of Justice; or a specially designated Bachelor of Criminal Justice degree.

===Theories of criminal justice===

Theories of criminal justice include utilitarian justice, retributive justice, restorative justice. They can work through deterrence, rehabilitation or incapacitation.

==History==
The modern criminal justice system has evolved since ancient times, with new forms of punishment, added rights for offenders and victims, and policing reforms. These developments have reflected changing customs, political ideals, and economic conditions. In ancient times through the Middle Ages, exile was a common form of punishment. During the Middle Ages, payment to the victim (or the victim&#x27;s family), known as wergild, was another common punishment, including for violent crimes. For those who could not afford to buy their way out of punishment, harsh penalties included various forms of corporal punishment. These included mutilation, branding, and flogging, as well as execution.

Though a prison, Le Stinche, existed as early as the 14th century in Florence, incarceration was not widely used until the 19th century. Correctional reform in the United States was first initiated by William Penn, towards the end of the 17th century. For a time, Pennsylvania&#x27;s criminal code was revised to forbid torture and other forms of cruel punishment, with jails and prisons replacing corporal punishment. These reforms were reverted, upon Penn&#x27;s death in 1718. Under pressure from a group of Quakers, these reforms were revived in Pennsylvania toward the end of the 18th century, and led to a marked drop in Pennsylvania&#x27;s crime rate. Patrick Colquhoun, Henry Fielding and others led significant reforms during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The development of a modern criminal justice system was contemporary to the formation of the concept of a nation-state, later defined by German sociologist Max Weber as establishing a &quot;monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force&quot;, which was exercised in the criminal justice case by the police.

===Modern police===
The first modern police force is commonly said to be the Metropolitan Police in London, established in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel. Based on the Peelian principles, it promoted the preventive role of police as a deterrent to urban crime and disorder. In the United States, police departments were first established in Boston in 1838, and New York City in 1844. Early on, police were not respected by the community, as corruption was rampant.

In the 1920s, led by Berkeley, California, police chief, August Vollmer and O.W. Wilson, police began to professionalize, adopt new technologies, and place emphasis on training and professional qualifications of new hires. Despite such reforms, police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders, and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community. Following urban unrest in the 1960s, police placed more emphasis on community relations, enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring, and many police agencies adopted community policing strategies.

In the 1990s, CompStat was developed by the New York Police Department as an information-based system for tracking and mapping crime patterns and trends, and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems. CompStat has since been replicated in police departments across the United States and around the world, with problem-oriented policing, intelligence-led policing, and other information-led policing strategies also adopted.

<text>Charles Eliot Silberman (January 31, 1925 – February 5, 2011) was an American journalist and author.

Silberman was born in Des Moines, Iowa. After service in the Pacific during World War II, he gained a B.A. in Economics from Columbia University in 1946 and also undertook graduate studies at Columbia. Subsequently, he taught at Columbia and City College of New York before joining &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1953 where he remained until the early 1970s.

He was the author of &quot;Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice&quot; (1978), a study of crime and the American criminal justice system.

Silberman used econometric methods to measure the effectiveness in terms of criminal deterrence of two factors: the degree of punishment; and the probability of apprehension. A simple &quot;expected loss&quot; model would predict that deterrent effect would depend only on the result of multiplying the penalty by the probability of it occurring. Silberman concluded that contrary to this model, the likelihood of punishment had a greater effect in most situations. Silberman also stated, &quot;Crime does more than expose the weakness in social relationships; it undermines the social order itself, by destroying the assumptions on which it is based.&quot;

Silberman&#x27;s book &quot;Crisis in the Classroom: The Remaking of American Education&quot; is regarded as one of the leading investigations into and critiques of the performance of the American educational system and has been praised for its scope and insight.

He was also the author of &quot;Crisis in Black and White&quot; and &quot;A Certain People: American Jews and Their Lives Today&quot;.

Silberman died on February 5, 2011, in Sarasota, Florida, aged 86. He had four sons and seven grandchildren.

<doc id="168222" wikidata="Q880570" url="?curid=168222" title="Jim Hunt">
<text>James Baxter Hunt Jr. (born May 16, 1937) is an American politician and retired attorney who was the 69th and 71st governor of North Carolina (1977–1985, and 1993–2001). He is the longest-serving governor in the state&#x27;s history.

Hunt is tied with former Ohio governor Jim Rhodes for the sixth-longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at days. He is also the father of current North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Rachel Hunt.

Many credit Hunt and his leadership example being a major reason why, in contrast to many ex-Confederate and border states, North Carolina&#x27;s Democratic Party has managed to stay relevant in state politics from Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency through 2024.

==Early life==
Hunt was born on May 16, 1937, in Greensboro, North Carolina to James Baxter Hunt, a soil conservationist, and Elsie Brame Hunt, a schoolteacher. When he was a child, the family moved to a farm outside of Wilson, North Carolina. He was raised in the Free Will Baptist Church but later converted to Presbyterianism.

He is a graduate of North Carolina State College, now known as North Carolina State University, with a B.S. in agricultural education and a M.S. in agricultural economics. During his undergraduate career, Hunt was involved in Student Government. He was the second student to serve two terms as Student Body President of NC State. His master&#x27;s thesis was about economic analysis of different tobacco production techniques. In 1964, he received a J.D. from the University of North Carolina School of Law. He went on to serve as the president of the Young Democratic Clubs of North Carolina, now known as the Young Democrats of North Carolina.

==Political career==

From 1964 to 1966, Hunt was a Ford Foundation economic advisor in Nepal. After working on several state and national campaigns for Democratic candidates and attending several Democratic conventions as a delegate, in addition to his work with the North Carolina Young Democratic Clubs, in 1972 he ran successfully for lieutenant governor. He was sworn in on January 5, 1973. With the election of James Holshouser as governor in 1972—the first Republican to win the office in decades—the Democratic majority in the General Assembly was compelled to raise the stature of the office of the lieutenant governor. It raised the job&#x27;s salary from $5,000 to $30,000 per year, increased the office operating budget, and expanded its staff from two to five.
Hunt was first sworn in as Governor of North Carolina on January 8, 1977. He is the only Governor of North Carolina to have been elected to four terms. He was first elected governor in 1976 over Republican David Flaherty and was re-elected in 1980, defeating I. Beverly Lake. Hunt supported a constitutional change during his first term that allowed him to be the first North Carolina governor to run for a second consecutive term.

In 1981 Hunt chaired the Hunt Commission, named after himself, which established superdelegates in the Democratic National Convention.

In 1984 he lost a bitterly contested race for the Senate seat held by Jesse Helms, and left elective politics for eight years. He returned in 1992 and defeated Republican lieutenant governor and Hardee&#x27;s executive Jim Gardner to win the governorship. Hunt was re-elected by a large margin over future US Congressman Robin Hayes in 1996. He left office in January 2001, and was replaced by fellow Democrat, Attorney General Mike Easley.

===Actions and political views===
In the 1970s Governor Hunt was a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and, with his wife Carolyn, he urged its approval by the state legislature (which failed to ratify it by two votes) and appointed Betty Ray McCain as his chief lobbyist for the amendment. Hunt was an early proponent of teaching standards and early childhood education, gaining national recognition for the Smart Start program for pre-kindergarteners. In his book, &quot;First in America: An Education Governor Challenges North Carolina&quot;, Hunt says that under testing and accountability measures he put into place test scores went up. He says 56% of students were proficient in 1994 compared with 70% in the year 2000. He says without testing students slip through the cracks and face a &quot;limited future&quot; (p. 55). In 2000 he was mentioned as a possible Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States or Education Secretary for Al Gore had Gore been successful in the 2000 presidential race. 2004 Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry was likewise considering Hunt for Secretary of Education had he won, and he was considered a candidate to be Barack Obama&#x27;s Secretary of Education.

Hunt served on the Carnegie Task Force, which created the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and more recently on the Spellings Commission on the Future of Higher Education.

As governor, Hunt was involved in a variety of efforts to promote technology and technology-based economic development, including the establishment of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. He was also very successful at recruiting business to his state.

Hunt was key actor in the trial of the Wilmington Ten. By the late 1970s, their case had gained international attention and was viewed as an embarrassment to the US and North Carolina in particular. CBS had broadcast a &quot;60 Minute&quot; piece about the case that suggested that the evidence against the ten had been fabricated. In January 1978, following the higher courts&#x27; refusal to dismiss these charges, Hunt decided to reduce their sentencing of 20–25 years to 13–17 years rather than pardon and free them. Many black North Carolinian politicians at the time disapproved of Hunt&#x27;s decision but the general mentality at the time was that &quot;right now blacks have nowhere else to turn&quot; so there was no organized opposition movement. Howard Nathaniel Lee, however, refused to resign from his appointed role as cabinet secretary, as a form of protest against Hunt.

Hunt was criticized for allowing Darryl Hunt (no relation known) to remain in prison for 20 years after the wrongfully convicted Winston-Salem man was exonerated by exculpatory DNA evidence which pointed to another perpetrator. Darryl Hunt was pardoned by the succeeding governor, Mike Easley. During his terms in office Hunt oversaw 13 executions (two during his first period in office, 11 during his second), including the first post-Furman execution of a female (Velma Barfield) and the first post-Furman execution in North Carolina (James W. Hutchins).

Hunt was a proponent of North Carolina&#x27;s tobacco industry, even after the negative health effects of tobacco use became clear. When Reagan Administration Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop accused the tobacco industry of directing advertising at children and threatening human lives, Hunt called for his impeachment.

==Retirement==
Hunt founded and is chair emeritus of the Institute for Emerging Issues at N.C. State University in Raleigh. In 2001 Hunt founded the James B. Hunt Jr. Institute for Educational Leadership &amp; Policy Foundation, Inc., commonly known as The Hunt Institute. The organization&#x27;s mission is to secure America&#x27;s future through quality education, and is dedicated to empowering governors, policymakers, and other educational leaders in the development and implementation of comprehensive strategies for the transformation of public education.

==Personal life==
Hunt has been married to Carolyn Leonard Hunt since 1958 and they have a son (James Baxter Hunt III) and three daughters (including former State Senator and current Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina Rachel Hunt).

<doc id="168223" wikidata="Q1389242" url="?curid=168223" title="Theodore Hall">
<text>Theodore Alvin Hall (October 20, 1925 – November 1, 1999) was an American physicist and an atomic spy for the Soviet Union, who, during his work on United States efforts to develop the first and second atomic bombs during World War II (the Manhattan Project), gave a detailed description of the &quot;Fat Man&quot; plutonium bomb, and of several processes for purifying plutonium, to Soviet intelligence. 

His brother, Edward N. Hall, was a rocket scientist who led the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s program to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, personally designing the Minuteman missile and convincing the Pentagon and President Eisenhower to adopt it as a key part of the nation&#x27;s strategic nuclear triad.

==Early life==
Theodore Alvin Holtzberg was born in Far Rockaway, New York City to a devout Jewish couple, Barnett Holtzberg and Rose Moskowitz. His father was a furrier who had emigrated to America to escape antisemitic pogroms in the Russian Empire. His mother was a second-generation Russian Jew who died while Theodore was a teenager and a student at Harvard University. The Great Depression hurt Barnett&#x27;s business significantly; when it was no longer able to support the household, the family moved to Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan.

Even at a young age, Theodore showed an impressive aptitude for mathematics and science, mostly being tutored by his elder brother Edward, who was 11 years his senior. After skipping three grades at Public School 173 in Washington Heights, in the fall of 1937, Hall entered the Townsend Harris High School for gifted boys. He attended the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and was deeply impressed by the Soviet pavilion and a copy of the Mayakovskaya Metro station. After graduation from high school, he was accepted into Queens College at the age of 14 in 1940, and transferred to Harvard University in 1942 as junior physics major, where he graduated at the age of 18 in 1944.

In the fall of 1936, despite the protests of their parents, Edward, his brother, legally changed both his and Theodore&#x27;s last name to Hall in an effort to avoid antisemitic hiring practices he was experiencing that were prevalent at the time.

==Manhattan Project==

At the age of 18, on the recommendation of Prof. John Van Vleck, Hall was hired as the youngest physicist to be recruited to work on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. At Los Alamos, after first helping to determine the critical mass of uranium used for &quot;Little Boy&quot;, Hall was assigned to conduct experiments on and tests of the implosion system (&quot;Fat Man&quot;). He was eventually, while still a teen, put in charge of a team working on that difficult task.

Hall later claimed that as it became clear in the summer of 1944 that Germany was losing the war and would not ever manage to develop an atomic bomb, he became concerned about the consequences of an American monopoly on atomic weapons once the war ended. He was especially worried about the possibility of the emergence of a fascist government in the United States, should it have such a nuclear monopoly and want to keep it that way. He was not alone. It was widely known inside the confines of Los Alamos, that Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, had revealed to a group of top physicists there at a dinner that the real target of the US atom bomb was the Soviet Union, a shocking statement that led one top physicist, Josef Rotblat, to resign from the Project, and others like Niels Bohr and Leo Szilard to vainly petition first Roosevelt, and later Truman to halt it, not use it on people in Japan, or to inform the Soviets about it.

On the pretext of returning to his home in New York City for his 19th birthday in October 1944, Ted Hall visited the headquarters of Amtorg, the Soviet Union trading company located in a loft building on 24th Street in Midtown Manhattan. There an American worker for Amtorg gave him the name and address of Sergey Kurnakov, a military writer for &quot;Soviet Russia Today&quot; and &quot;Russky Golos&quot;—the same contact that was also recommended to his Harvard friend, roommate and eventually initial spy courier Saville Sax, by the head of a Soviet Cultural center in New York, Artkino. Unaware initially that Kurnakov was an NKVD agent, Hall handed him a report on the scientists who worked at Los Alamos, the conditions at Los Alamos, and the basic science behind the bomb. Saville Sax subsequently delivered the same report to the Soviet Consulate, which he visited under the guise of inquiring about relatives still in the Soviet Union. The two eventually met with Anatoly Yatskov, the New York station chief operating under the cover of being a Consular clerk, who two weeks later transmitted the information about both young men to NKVD headquarters in Moscow using a one-time pad cipher. After officially becoming an informant for the Soviet Union, Hall was given the code-name MLAD, a Slavic root meaning &quot;young&quot;, and Sax, who was almost a year older than Hall, was given the code-name STAR, a Slavic root meaning &quot;old&quot;.

Kurnakov reported in November 1944:


Unbeknownst to Hall, Klaus Fuchs, a Los Alamos colleague, and others still unidentified, were also spying for the Soviet Union; none seems to have known of the others. Sax acted as Hall&#x27;s courier until spring of 1945 when, because he was returning to full-time student status at Harvard, he was replaced by Lona Cohen. Igor Kurchatov, a scientist and the head of the Soviet atomic bomb effort, probably used information provided by Klaus Fuchs to confirm corresponding information provided earlier by Hall. Despite other scientists giving information to the Soviet Union, Hall was the only known scientist to give details on the design of an atomic bomb until recent revelations of the role of Oscar Seborer.

==Career after Los Alamos==
In June 1946, Hall&#x27;s security clearance was revoked by the US Army, not over suspicions of being a Soviet asset but because of discovery of a letter he had received from his British sister-in-law, his brother Edward&#x27;s wife Edith, who inquired jokingly of him: &quot;I hear you&#x27;re working on something that goes up with a big bang! Can you send us one of them for Guy Fawkes Day?&quot; as well as left-wing publications he had been receiving at Los Alamos over the prior year that overworked censors had apparently overlooked at the time. Furloughed out of the military with an honorable discharge and a citation from President Truman for the achievements of the Army&#x27;s Special Engineering Detachment at Los Alamos, Hall headed that fall for the University of Chicago, where he finished out his master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in physics, met his wife, and started a family. After graduating he became a biophysicist.

In Chicago, as a graduate student research assistant he pioneered important techniques in X-ray microanalysis. In 1952, he left the University of Chicago&#x27;s Institute for Radiobiology and Biophysics to take a research position in biophysics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York City. In 1962, he became unsatisfied with his equipment and the techniques available to him. He then moved to Vernon Ellis Cosslett&#x27;s electron microscopy research laboratory at Cambridge University in England. At Cambridge he created the Hall Method of continuum normalization, developed for the specific purpose of analyzing thin sections of biological tissue. He remained working at Cambridge until he retired at the age of 59 in 1984.

Hall later became active in obtaining signatures for the Stockholm Peace Pledge.

==Death==
On November 1, 1999, Theodore Hall died at the age of 74, in Cambridge, England. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. Although he had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he ultimately succumbed to renal cancer, likely acquired as a result of the experimental work he was doing with plutonium in his year working on the &quot;Gadget&quot; used for the Trinity test.

==FBI investigation==
The US Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service Venona project, decrypted some Soviet messages and in January 1950 uncovered one cable identifying Hall and Sax by name as Soviet spies (albeit misspelled as Teodor Kholl and Savil Sachs), but until the document&#x27;s public release along with many other pages of Soviet wartime spy cables in July 1995, nearly all of the espionage regarding the Los Alamos nuclear weapons program was attributed to Klaus Fuchs. Hall was questioned by the FBI in March 1951 but was not charged. The FBI and Justice Department claimed this was because their only evidence was the Venona document and that the US did not want to let the Soviets know they had broken their elaborate and supposedly &quot;unbreakable&quot; code. Alan H. Belmont, the number-three man in the FBI, claims he decided at that time that information coming out of the Venona project would be inadmissible in court as hearsay evidence, so its value in the case was not worth compromising the program.

However, journalist Dave Lindorff, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot; on January 4, 2022, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Hall&#x27;s FBI file in 2021. This 130-page file included communications between FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the head of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Gen. Joseph F. Carroll, showing that Carroll had effectively blocked Hoover&#x27;s intended pursuit of Hall and Sax, probably fearing that Hall&#x27;s arrest would have, in the political climate of the McCarthy Era, forced the Air Force to furlough and lose their top missile expert, Edward Hall. Carroll, a former top aide to Hoover before he became the first head of the USAF OSI, ultimately allowed Hoover&#x27;s agents to question Ed Hall on June 12, 1951 (with an OSI officer monitoring the interview). Within several weeks of that session, the Air Force, which had conducted and completed its own investigation into Edward Hall&#x27;s loyalty (having their own investigators question him four times), promoted him to Lt. Colonel, and later Colonel, and elevated him from assistant director to director of its missile development program. The promotions were a clear slap in the face to Hoover. Ed Hall went on to complete the development of the Minuteman missile program, and then retired. In 1999 the Air Force honored him seven years before his death, by adding him to the Air Force Aerospace Hall of Fame.

Lindorff co-produced the 2022 documentary film &quot;A Compassionate Spy&quot; based on Hall&#x27;s life and spying. In 2023, Lindorff wrote the book &quot;Spy for No Country: The Story of Ted Hall, the Teenage Atomic Spy Who May Have Saved the World&quot;.

===Statements in 1990s===
The Venona project became public knowledge in July 1995.

In a written statement published in 1997, Hall came very close to admitting that the Soviet spy cable identifying him as a Soviet asset was accurate, although obliquely, saying that in the immediate postwar years, he felt strongly that &quot;an American monopoly&quot; on nuclear weapons &quot;was dangerous and should be avoided&quot;:

A year before his death, he gave a more direct confession in an interview for the TV-series &quot;Cold War&quot; on CNN in 1998, saying:

<text>Cold War espionage describes the intelligence gathering activities during the Cold War ( 1947–1991) between the Western allies (primarily the US and Western Europe) and the Eastern Bloc (primarily the Soviet Union and allied countries of the Warsaw Pact). Both relied on a wide variety of military and civilian agencies in this pursuit.

While several organizations such as the CIA and KGB became synonymous with Cold War espionage, many others played key roles in the collection and protection of the section concerning detection of spying, and analysis of a wide host of intelligence disciplines.

== Background ==
Soviet espionage in the United States during the Cold War was an outgrowth of World War II nuclear espionage, with both sides utilizing and evolving techniques and practices developed during World War II. Cold War espionage has been fictionally depicted in works such as the James Bond and Matt Helm books and movies.

The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II led by the United States (and the Western Bloc) and the Soviet Union (and the Eastern Bloc). After World War II, the victory of the Soviet Union over Germany granted them considerable territorial spoils; the Soviet Union banded together these states economically and politically creating a superpower challenging the might of the United States. Prior even to the United States&#x27; use of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union had been developing the technology to make similar devices. Although the two powers never engaged in a full-scale war, both countries were constantly preparing for an all-out nuclear war. Cold War espionage was focused on gaining an advantage in information about the enemies&#x27; capabilities, especially related to atomic weaponry.

During the Cold War, information was a key commodity. It was vital to know what the adversary was up to, and the possibility of using the hi-tech surveillance that is used today was not around. Instead of trusting technology, states relied on spies: people who infiltrated enemy territory and tried to discover information while staying undetected.

Espionage activities continued from prior to the beginning of the cold war in the late thirties- early forties, and all the way through the late 1960s and even continuing through today. Due to the nature of espionage, the information that we can gather about these activities is limited, equally as limited is the prosecutorial reach with regards to people who commit espionage are subjected to (especially in the United States). These spies were decoding encrypted information, and using many skills to gain an advantage over enemy countries.

== Major spy rings ==
Cambridge Five: The Cambridge Five consisted of five members that were recruited from the University of Cambridge in the 1930s. There is debate surrounding the exact timing of their recruitment, but it is generally believed that they were not recruited as agents until after they had graduated. The group included Kim Philby (cryptonym &#x27;Stanley&#x27;), Donald Maclean (cryptonym &#x27;Homer&#x27;), Guy Burgess (cryptonym &#x27;Hicks&#x27;), Anthony Blunt (cryptonyms &#x27;Tony&#x27;, &#x27;Johnson&#x27;), and John Cairncross (cryptonym &#x27;Liszt&#x27;). There were many others that were accused of being a part of the Cambridge Spy Ring, but these five members were collectively known as the Cambridge Five.

Portland spy ring: The Portland spy ring operated in England, as a Soviet spy ring, from the 1950s until 1961 when the core of the network were arrested by British Security Services. This spy ring was unique because they did not use the cover of an embassy as the cover for their spies. Its members included Harry Houghton, Ethel Gee, Gordon Lonsdale, and most famously Morris and Lona Cohen (cryptonym Peter and Helen Kroger).

Ware Group: Sleeper spy ring in US headed by J. Peters, first organized under Harold Ware, inherited by Whittaker Chambers (under orders from Peters), and also included: John Abt, Marion Bachrach (Abt&#x27;s sister), Lee Pressman, Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, Charles Kramer, Nathan Witt, Henry Collins, George Silverman, John Herrmann, Nathaniel Weyl, and Victor Perlo. When Chambers defected in 1938, the Ware Group went dormant and then broke up. Harry Dexter White (below) contributed materials to Chambers but not as part of the Ware Group.

Silvermaster spy ring: The Silvermaster Spy Ring was led by Harry Dexter White, assistant secretary of the Treasury and the second most influential member of the Treasury department. His job was to aid placement of Soviet spies within the United States Government. The United States Treasury Department was successfully infiltrated by many Soviet spies, the most successful of which belonged to the Silvermaster Spy Ring. Harold Glasser, Elizabeth Bentley, and Nathan Silvermaster were other major members of the Silvermaster Spy Ring.

Atomic spies: While the Atomic Spies were not exactly a network of spies, the collective information that was obtained by this group of Soviet spies was critical to the Soviet Union&#x27;s ability to build an atomic bomb. Many of the members of the Atomic spies group worked for, or around, the Manhattan Project, or the United States building of the atomic bomb. This group included:

*Klaus Fuchs: a German-born British theoretical physicist. He worked with the British delegation on the Manhattan Project.
*Morris Cohen: an American who gained insight to the plans from the secret laboratory at Los Alamos and delivered it to the designers of the Soviet atomic bomb.
*Harry Gold: an American who was a courier for Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass.
*David Greenglass: an American machinist at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. He gave crude schematics of lab experiments to the Russians.
*Theodore Hall: an American, and the youngest physicist at Los Alamos, gave a detailed description of the Fat Man plutonium bomb and several processes for purifying plutonium to the Soviets.
*George Koval: an American-born son of a Russian family. He obtained information from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Dayton Project about the Urchin (detonator) used for the Fat Man plutonium bomb.
*Irving Lerner: an American film director who was caught photographing the cyclotron at the University of California in 1944.
*Alan Nunn May: a British physicist who worked for the British nuclear research and then in Canada on the Manhattan Project. His uncovering in 1946 was responsible for the United States restricting sharing atomic secrets with the British.
*Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: Americans who were involved in the coordinating and recruiting of an espionage network. Ethel&#x27;s brother was David Greenglass.
*Saville Sax: an American who acted as a courier for Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall.
*Morton Sobell: an American engineer who admitted to spying for the Soviets and uncovered how extensive the Rosenberg&#x27;s recruiting network was.

== Surveillance devices of the Cold War ==
# &quot;Sight Unseen -&quot; an F21 &#x27;Ammer&#x27; spy camera. Currently on exhibit in Berlin, Germany. Used by the Stasi secret police. 
# &quot;Sedgley OSS .38 Glove Pistol&quot; &quot;-&quot; 0.38 single shot pistol. Designed by Stanley M. Height. The bullet must be fired at point-blank range to be effective.
# &quot;Maxwell Smart&#x27;s Other Shoe&quot;&quot;-&quot; A miniature camera stowed in the heel of the spy&#x27;s shoe. This gadget was used by most spies at the time including those in the CIA.
# &quot;The Bulgarian Umbrella&quot; &quot;-&quot; This umbrella had a very small attachment that allowed it to inject a small poisonous dart (usually containing ricin) into the spy&#x27;s target. 
# &quot;Can You Hear Me Now? -&quot; an eavesdropping device 
# &quot;Lipstick Gun -&quot; a 4.5mm gun that was placed inside a tube of lipstick. Many museums and historians refer to it as the &quot;Kiss of Death.&quot; Just a simple twist would fire a bullet.

== American satellite surveillance systems ==
Weapons System 117L - Weapons System 117L was the first program designed to develop space-based reconnaissance satellite systems. Several satellite systems would be developed through this program including Corona, the Satellite and Missile Observation System (SAMOS), and the Missile Detection Alarm System (MIDAS).

SAMOS - SAMOS or the Satellite and Missile Observation system was one of the first of a series of short lived satellite systems developed by the United States, operated from October 1960 to November 1962. The SAMOS satellite system was one of the first systems developed through the WS-117L program. The system consisted of three primary components: visual reconnaissance, communications, and electronic intelligence gathering. Of the eleven launched attempted, 8 were successful. The program was likely cancelled because of poor image quality. The satellite could produce photos with 100 foot resolution. It was also heavily overshadowed by the Corona system operated by the CIA.

MIDAS - MIDAS or the Missile Defense Alarm System was a satellite system operated by the United States between 1960 and 1966. This system was designed to be made of twelve satellites, although only nine satellites were successfully launched. The system was designed to provide early warning of Soviet missile launches. The system was eventually cancelled because of the high price and because of the slow warning times. This system, however, would be directly responsible for technologies used in its successors.

Corona - Corona was among the first of a series of reconnaissance satellite systems developed through the WS-117L program. The Corona program was headed by the Central Intelligence Agency along with the Air Force. Corona satellites were used to photograph Soviet and other installations. The first successful Corona mission began on August 10, 1963. The Corona satellite system was expedited largely in part to the U-2 incident in 1960. All of the Corona missions, with the exception of the KH-11 Kennan program, would make use of photographic film, which would have to survive re-entry through the atmosphere and be recovered.

Keyhole - Keyhole was the designation for the initial Corona launches, which included KH-1, KH-2, KH-3, KH-4A, and KH-4B. The name was used because it is analogous to spying through the keyhole of a door. 144 satellites would be launched through this program, and 102 returned usable photos.

Keyhole/Argon (KH-5) - Argon was the designation the surveillance satellites, manufactured by Lockheed, used by the United States from February 1961 to August 1964. Argon made use of photographic film in a way similar of the original Corona satellites. Of the twelve known launches, seven were not successful for varying reasons.

Keyhole/Lanyard (KH-6) - Lanyard was the designation for the first, albeit unsuccessful, attempt to establish a high resolution, optical satellite system. This program would be led by the newly established National Reconnaissance Office, and operated from March–July 1963. Because it was only able to achieve a resolution similar to that of the KH-4 satellites, it was discontinued after only 3 launches.

Keyhole/Gambit (KH-7) - Gambit was the next of a series of satellites operated by the United States, by the National Reconnaissance Office, from July 1963 to June 1967. It was among the first successful Corona missions as it produced some of the first high resolution photos. These photos were typically of Soviet and Chinese missile emplacements. Gambit satellites would make use of a three camera system and missions would last typically up to eight days.

Keyhole/Gambit III (KH-8) - The Gambit III satellite system was amongst the longest serving satellite reconnaissance programs operated by the United States during the Cold War. This satellite system would operate from July 1966 to April 1984. Of the fifty-four launch attempts, only three would fail, all of which were attributed to rocket failure. The average mission time of the Gambit III satellite systems were thirty-one days. The Gambit III satellites would differ from the Gambit I satellites in that the Gambit III had a four camera system, which carried over twelve thousand feet of film, and were able to produce resolutions as small as four inches.

Keyhole/Hexagon (KH-9) - The Hexagon satellite system, commonly known as Big Bird, this satellite system was operated from 1971 and 1986. The Hexagon system was officially known as the Broad Coverage Photo Reconnaissance satellites. These satellites photographed large areas of the Earth at a time with moderate resolution. These satellites were also used for mapping missions, which were used in map making. Three Hexagon missions also included electronic intelligence or ELINT gathering capabilities. These were used to eavesdrop on soviet communications and on soviet missile launches. Twenty launches were attempted, only one was unsuccessful. These satellites operated for an increasing duration of time, with the longest mission lasting 275 days.

Keyhole/Kennan (KH-11) - The KH-11 Kennan, which goes under the code name Crystal, was first launched in 1976, and missions are still ongoing. According to leaked documents, this program is currently operation under the code name Evolved Enhanced Crystal. The Kennan satellite system was the first satellite system to use electro-optical imaging, which gives real time imaging capabilities. The resolution of these satellites is estimated to be as low as 2 inches. These satellites are unique in that they have been placed in Sun-synchronous orbits, which allow them to use shadows to help discern ground features. These satellites became famous in 1978 when a CIA employee tried to leak the design of the satellite to the Soviets. He was tried and convicted of espionage.

Keyhole/Improved Crystal (KH-12) – The later KH-11 satellites have been called KH-12 improved Crystal or Ikon satellites. These satellites also had increased download times which allowed for faster processing of photos. It is also suspected that these satellites may have stealth technology to avoid detection by other satellites.

Vela - The Vela satellite system was developed to by the United States to ensure that the Soviet Union complied with the Partial Test Ban Treaty which was ratified in 1963. The satellites were designed to monitor for nuclear explosions in space and in the atmosphere by measuring for neutrons and gamma rays. A total of twelve Vela satellites were launched during the course of the Cold War. The Vela satellites became publicly famous because of the Vela Incident which occurred on 22 September 1979. It was theorized at the time that it was a nuclear test conducted by South Africa and Israel, but new evidence does not support this theory. They have also been used in the study of Gamma-Ray Bursts.

== American surveillance aircraft ==
U-2 – The U-2 aircraft, known as the &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;, was developed by the Lockheed Skunk Works, and was first flown on August 1, 1955. The aircraft was initially flown by the CIA, but control was later transferred to the Air Force. The aircraft was designed to fly at altitudes of 70,000 ft. The U-2 was equipped with a camera which had a resolution of 2.5 feet at an altitude of 60,000 ft. The first overflights of the Soviet Union by the U-2 began in May 1956. The aircraft became publicly prominent after a U-2 aircraft flown by Francis Gary Powers was hit by an SA-2 missile and crash landed in the USSR.

SR-71 – The SR-71 Blackbird is a long-range reconnaissance aircraft developed by Lockheed Skunk Works, and designed by Kelly Johnson. The aircraft is known for setting speed and altitude records. The SR-71 was equipped with optical and infrared imaging systems, electronic intelligence gathering systems, side looking airborne radar, and recorders for those systems which are listed. The aircraft required two personnel to pilot it, one to pilot the aircraft, and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO) to operate the systems.

== Soviet satellite surveillance systems ==
Zenit (Zenith) - The Zenith Satellite program, was a satellite program developed by the Soviet Union and used from 1961 to 1994. During the course of its lifespan over 500 Zenith satellites were launched, making it the most used satellite system ever. The Soviets concealed the nature of the system by giving the satellites the Kosmos designation. The Zenith satellites had an advantage over the satellites developed by the United States, in that they could be reused. A total of eight variants would be developed for a variety of mission types, ranging from high-resolution photography to ELINT to cartographic and topographic missions.

Yantar - The Yantar satellites, designed to replace the Zenit satellite system, are among the newest Russian satellites. Yantar satellites have been launched as recently as 2015. Two variants of the satellite have been developed for high-resolution photography and for medium-resolution broad spectrum imaging.

==Historiography==

After 1990s new memoirs and archival materials have opened up the study of espionage and intelligence during the Cold War. Scholars are reviewing how its origins, its course, and its outcome were shaped by the intelligence activities of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other key countries. Special attention is paid to how complex images of one&#x27;s adversaries were shaped by secret intelligence that is now publicly known.

The Soviet Union proved especially successful in placing spies in Britain and West Germany. It was largely unable to repeat its successes in the 1930s in the United States. NATO, on the other hand, also had a few successes of importance, of whom Oleg Gordievsky was perhaps the most influential. He was a senior KGB officer who was a double agent on behalf of Britain&#x27;s MI6, providing a stream of high-grade intelligence that had an important influence on the thinking of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He was spotted by Aldrich Ames a Soviet agent who worked for the CIA, but he was successfully exfiltrated from Moscow in 1985. Biographer Ben McIntyre argues he was the West&#x27;s most valuable human asset, especially for his deep psychological insights into the inner circles of the Kremlin. He convinced Washington and London that the fierceness and bellicosity of the Kremlin was a product of fear, and military weakness, rather than an urge for world conquest. Thatcher and Reagan concluded they could moderate their own anti-Soviet rhetoric, as successfully happened when Mikhail Gorbachev took power, thus ending the Cold War.

<text>Worksop ( ) is a market town in the Bassetlaw District in Nottinghamshire, England. It is located south of Doncaster, south-east of Sheffield and north of Nottingham. Located close to Nottinghamshire&#x27;s borders with South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, it is on the River Ryton and not far from the northern edge of Sherwood Forest. Other nearby towns include Chesterfield, Gainsborough, Mansfield and Retford. The population of the town was recorded at 44,733 in the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman history===
Worksop was part of what was called Bernetseatte (burnt lands) in Anglo-Saxon times. The name Worksop is likely of Anglo-Saxon origin, deriving from a personal name &quot;We(o)rc&quot; plus the Anglo-Saxon placename element &quot;hop&quot; (valley). The first element is interesting because while the masculine name Weorc is unrecorded, the feminine name Werca (Verca) is found in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Cuthbert&quot;. A number of other recorded place names contain this same personal name element.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Worksop appears as &quot;Werchesope&quot;. Thoroton states that the Domesday Book records that before the Norman Conquest, Werchesope (Worksop) had belonged to Elsi, son of Caschin, who had &quot;two manors in Werchesope, which paid to the geld as three car&quot;. After the conquest, Worksop became part of the extensive lands granted to Roger de Busli. At this time, the land &quot;had one car. in demesne, and twenty-two sochm. on twelve bovats of this land, and twenty-four villains, and eight bord. having twenty-two car. and eight acres of meadow, pasture wood two leu. long, three quar. broad.&quot; This was valued at 3l in Edward the Confessor&#x27;s time and 7l in the Domesday Book. De Busli administered this estate from his headquarters in Tickhill.

The manor then passed to William de Lovetot, who established a castle and endowed the Augustinian priory around 1103. After William&#x27;s death, the manor was passed to his eldest son, Richard de Lovetot, who was visited by King Stephen, at Worksop, in 1161. In 1258, a surviving &quot;inspeximus&quot; charter confirms Matilda de Lovetot&#x27;s grant of the manor of Worksop to William de Furnival (her son).

===Medieval and early modern history===
A skirmish occurred in the area during the Wars of the Roses on 16 December 1460, commonly known as the Battle of Worksop.

In 1530, Worksop was visited by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was on his way to Cawood, in Yorkshire. &quot;Then my lord [Wolsey] intending the next day to remove from thence [Newstead Abbey] there resorted to him the Earl of Shrewsbury&#x27;s keeper, and gentlemen, sent from him, to desire my lord, in their maister&#x27;s behalf, to hunt in a parke of their maister&#x27;s, called Worsoppe Parke.&quot; (Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wolsey&quot;)

A surviving (Cotton) manuscript written by Henry VIII nominated Worksop as one of three places in Nottinghamshire (along with Welbeck and Thurgarton) to become &quot;Byshopprykys to be new made&quot;, but nothing was to come of this (White 1875), and the priory later became a victim of the dissolution of the monasteries – being closed in 1539, with its prior and 15 monks pensioned off. All the priory buildings, except the nave and west towers of the church, were demolished at this time and the stone reused elsewhere.

In 1540, John Leland noted that Worksop castle had all but disappeared, saying it was: &quot;clene down and scant knowen wher it was&quot;. Leland noted that at that time Worksop was &quot;a praty market of 2 streates and metely well buildid.&quot;

Worksop Manor became a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots in 1568. In 1580s the new house was built on the same site for George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. He was the husband of Elizabeth Talbot, Bess of Hardwick. 

In the hearth tax records of 1674, Worksop is said to have had 176 households, which made it the fourth-largest settlement in Nottinghamshire after Nottingham (967 households), Newark (339), and Mansfield (318). At this time, the population is estimated to have been around 748 people.

===Modern history===
By 1743, 358 families were in Worksop, with a population around 1,500. This had risen by 1801 to 3,391, and by the end of the 19th century had reached 16,455.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Worksop benefitted from the building of the Chesterfield Canal, which passed through the town in 1777, and the subsequent construction of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1849. This led to growth that was further boosted by the discovery of coal seams beneath the town.

Worksop and area surrounding are known as the &quot;Gateway to the Dukeries&quot; due to the former ducal seats of Clumber House, Thoresby Hall, Welbeck Abbey, and Worksop Manor either owned by the Dukes of Newcastle, Portland and Kingston.

==Transport==
===Waterways===
Worksop is connected to the UK Inland Waterways network by the Chesterfield Canal. It was built to export coal, limestone and lead from Derbyshire; iron from Chesterfield; and corn, deals, timber, groceries and general merchandise into Derbyshire. Today, the canal is used for leisure purposes together with the adjacent Sandhill Lake.

===Railway===


Worksop lies on the Sheffield-Lincoln line and the Robin Hood line. Northern services run between Sheffield, Lincoln and Leeds; East Midlands Railway services from Nottingham, via Mansfield, terminate at the station.

===Roads===
Worksop lies on the A57 and A60, with links to the A1 and M1. The A57 Worksop bypass was opened on Thursday 1 May 1986, by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Michael Spicer and the Chairman of Bassetlaw council. The bypass had been due to open in October 1986 and was built by A.F. Budge of Retford; as part of the contract, a small part of the A60, Turner Road, was opened on Monday 29 September 1986, three months early.

The main arterial roundabout into the town, located on the A57, has for a long time been known locally as &quot;The Gulf of Worksop&quot;

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 6, a waymarked route between London and the Lake District, passes through the town.

===Buses===
Stagecoach East Midlands operates bus services in and around the town, with destinations including Doncaster, Rotherham, Chesterfield and Nottingham.

==Healthcare==
Worksop is served by Bassetlaw District General Hospital, part of the Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Foundation Trust. Bassetlaw Hospital treats about 33,000 people each year, and roughly 38,000 emergencies. Bassetlaw Hospital is one of the University of Sheffield teaching hospitals and medical school.

Mental health services in Worksop are provided by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which provide local community services. In-patient services are provided in Mansfield and Nottingham.

==Local economy==
===Current economy===
The local economy in Worksop is dominated by service industries, manufacturing, and distribution. Unemployment levels in the area are now lower than the national average, owing to large number of distribution and local manufacturing companies, including Premier Foods, RDS Transport, Pandrol UK Ltd, and Laing O&#x27;Rourke.

Major employers in the area include Premier Foods (Worksop Factory), Greencore, RDS Transport (the Flying Fridge), B&amp;Q, MAKE polymers, OCG Cacao, part of Cargill, Pandrol, GCHQ, and the National Health Service (Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Trust).

===Agricultural and forestry===
John Harrison&#x27;s survey of Worksop for the Earl of Arundel reveals that at that time, most people earned their living from the land. A tenant farmer, Henry Cole, farmed 200 acres of land, grazing his sheep on &quot;Manton sheepwalk&quot;. This survey also described a corn-grinding water mill (Bracebridge mill) and Manor Mill situated near to Castle Hill, with a kiln and a malthouse.

One unusual crop associated with Worksop is liquorice. This was originally grown in the priory gardens for medicinal purposes but continued until around 1750. William Camden records in &quot;Britannia&quot; that the town was famous for growing liquorice. John Speed noted: &quot;In the west, near Worksop, groweth plenty of Liquorice, very delicious and good&quot;. White says the liquorice gardens were &quot;principally situated on the eastern margin of the park, near the present &#x27;Slack Walk&#x27;.&quot; He notes that the last plant was dug up about &quot;fifty years ago&quot; and that this last garden had been planted by &quot;the person after whom the &#x27;Brompton stock&#x27; is named&quot;. A pub in Worksop is now named after this former industry.

Additionally, with much of the area being heavily forested, timber was always an important industry, supplying railway sleepers to the North Midland Railway, timber for the construction of railway carriages, and packing cases for the Sheffield cutlery industry. The town also became notable for the manufacture of Worksop Windsor chairs. Timber firms in the town included Benjamin Garside&#x27;s woodyard and Godley and Goulding, situated between Eastgate and the railway.

===Brewing and malting===
The malting trade began in Retford, but gradually moved to Worksop, where it became an important trade, though it never employed many people. In 1852, Clinton malt kilns were built. Worksop has a strong tradition of brewing, including being the site of the historic Worksop and Retford Brewery. This brewery had previously been known as Garside and Alderson and Prior Well Brewery.

The brewing tradition is continued by a number of local independent breweries in and around the town, including Welbeck Abbey Brewery.

===Former Mining===
At the start of the 19th century, Worksop had a largely agricultural economy with malting, corn milling, and timber working being principal industries. However, the discovery of coal meant that by 1900, the majority of the workforce was employed in coal mining, which provided thousands of jobs – both directly and indirectly – in and around Worksop for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The first coal mine was Shireoaks Colliery, which by 1861 employed over 200 men, which rose to 600 men by 1871. Steetley Colliery started producing coal in 1876, and in Worksop a mine was developed on land to the south-east, owned by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle. This mine was fully operational in around 1907, with three shafts, and was named Manton Colliery.

The closure in the 1990s of the pits, compounding the earlier decline of the timber trade and other local industry, resulted in high unemployment in parts of the Worksop area, as well as other social problems.

===Textiles===
In John Harrison&#x27;s survey of Worksop for the Earl of Arundel, a dye house and a tenter green (where lengths of cloth were stretched out to dry) indicates a small cloth industry was present in Worksop. Late attempts during the Industrial Revolution to introduce textile manufacturing saw two mills constructed, one at Bridge Place and the other somewhere near Mansfield Road. Both enterprises failed and closed within three years. They were converted to milling corn.

==Religion==
Worksop has three churches, all of which are on the National Heritage List for England.

Officially titled the Priory Church of Saint Mary and Saint Cuthbert, the Anglican parish church is usually known as Worksop Priory. It was an Augustinian priory founded in 1103. The church has a nave and detached gatehouse. Monks at the priory made the Tickhill Psalter, an illuminated manuscript of the medieval period, now held in New York Public Library. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the east end of the church fell into disrepair, but the townspeople were granted the nave as a parish church. The eastern parts of the building have been restored in several phases, the most recent being in the 1970s when architect Lawrence King rebuilt the crossing.

St. Anne&#x27;s Church is an Anglican parish church and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade-II listed building. The church was built in 1911 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. The church has an historic pipe organ originally built by Gray and Davison in 1852 for Clapham Congregational Church.

St. John&#x27;s Church is a parish church built between 1867 and 1868 by architect Robert Clarke.

St Mary&#x27;s is a Roman Catholic church, built from 1838 to 1840 and paid for by the Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, after the sale of Worksop Manor, which the duke owned. The church was designed by Matthew Ellison Hadfield and it is a Grade II-listed building. In late 1913, the church was visited by Archduke Franz Ferdinand seven months before his assassination in Sarajevo.

Relatively few religious minorities live in the town, with the largest non-Christian community being Worksop&#x27;s 243 Muslims. A small community and prayer centre for adherents is on Watson Road.

==Local Media==
The town receives local news and television programmes from the BBC and ITV Yorkshire region. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield on 104.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire on 107.9 FM, and Trust AM, an online hospital radio station serving the Bassetlaw District General Hospital in the town. The local newspapers are the &quot;Worksop Guardian&quot; and &quot;Worksop Trader&quot;.

==Places of interest==

Mr Straw&#x27;s House, the family home of the Straw family, was inherited by the Straw brothers, William and Walter, when their parents died in the 1930s. The house remained unaltered until the National Trust acquired it in the 1990s and opened it to the public.

Clumber Park, located south of Worksop, is a country park, also owned by the National Trust. It has 3,800 acres of parkland.

Worksop Town Hall was originally established as a corn exchange, designed by Isaac Charles Gilbert, which opened in 1851.

The Worksop War Memorial is a large Grade II* listed cenotaph dedicated to the memory of local residents that died during World War I and II.

<text>During the weekend of July 4, 1999, white supremacist Benjamin Smith targeted Orthodox Jews and members of racial and ethnic minorities in a three-day drive-by shooting rampage in the U.S. states of Illinois and Indiana, after which he committed suicide. Smith was member of the neo-Nazi World Church of the Creator.

== Events ==
Smith was a follower of the white supremacist organization now known as the Creativity Movement, and was a devoted disciple of the group&#x27;s leader Matthew Hale. Two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law in Illinois, Smith loaded his light blue Ford Taurus with guns and ammunition and went on a three-day, two-state shooting spree, killing two people and wounding nine others.

On the evening of Friday, July 2, Smith shot and wounded nine Orthodox Jews in drive-by shootings in the West Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. Smith then shot and killed former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, an African-American, in front of two of his three children, while they were walking outside Byrdsong&#x27;s Skokie, Illinois, home.

The next day, Smith traveled to Urbana, Springfield and then Decatur, where he shot and wounded an African-American minister.

On Sunday, July 4, Smith traveled to Bloomington, Indiana, where he killed Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old Korean graduate student in economics at Indiana University, who was on his way to the Korean United Methodist Church. Smith shot at but missed another nine people. On Sunday, July 4, fleeing the police in a high-speed chase on a southern Illinois highway, Smith shot himself twice in the head and crashed his automobile into a metal post. He then shot himself again, in the heart, this time fatally. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

== Perpetrator ==
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith (March 22, 1978 – July 4, 1999) was born and raised in Wilmette, Illinois. He attended high school at New Trier Township High School. During this time he accosted a Skokie, Illinois, police officer and pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor battery. He transferred to Mary D. Bradford High School in Kenosha for his senior year. He did not pose for a photograph in his senior yearbook, but in his class statement he wrote, &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; (Thus always to tyrants). This phrase was shouted by John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln.

After graduating, Smith attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Smith dropped out of the university in 1998 after several conflicts with campus authorities. After dropping out, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington. Police reported that Smith was known for passing out hate-filled fliers against Jews, blacks and Asians on university campuses. In October 1998, Smith was the subject of a story on his university&#x27;s public broadcasting station.

Smith was a follower of the white supremacist organization now known as the Creativity Movement, and was a devoted disciple of the group&#x27;s leader Matthew Hale. Two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law in Illinois, Smith loaded his light blue Ford Taurus with guns and ammunition and committed the shooting spree.

== Aftermath ==
Around 2,000 people attended Won-Joon Yoon memorial service at the Indiana University Musical Arts Center on July 12, 1999. Attorney General of the United States Janet Reno spoke at the memorial service. IU created a scholarship to honor Won-Joon. Every July 4, the Korean United Methodist Church holds an early morning service to remember Yoon who was murdered on his way to the church&#x27;s Sunday service.

Ricky Byrdsong&#x27;s widow established The Ricky Byrdsong Foundation to &quot;arrest the growing epidemic of hate and violence in our society by and against our youth.&quot; The foundation holds a number of events in and around Evanston; the most well-known is the Race Against Hate, a 5K running race held annually in late June in Evanston. The Race Against Hate race draws several thousand runners. In 2009, a 10,000-meter running race was added in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Race Against Hate.

One of the victims has filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the Creator and its leader Matthew Hale, Smith&#x27;s parents, and the person who has been charged with selling guns to Smith without a license.

A chapter of &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; (a study of spree killers), by Pan Pantziarka, is devoted to Smith and his crimes. &quot;Invisible Revolution&quot;, a documentary by filmmaker Beverly Peterson, features an interview with Smith less than two weeks before his killing spree. The film includes scenes of Smith distributing World Church of the Creator leaflets in his home town and saying, &quot;If they violate our constitutional rights and say we can&#x27;t put out our literature, we have no choice but to resort to acts of violence and really to plunge this country into a terrorist war they&#x27;ve never seen before.&quot;

<text>A spree killer is someone who commits a criminal act that involves two or more murders in a short time, often in multiple locations. There are different opinions about what durations of time a killing spree may take place in. The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics has spoken of &quot;almost no time break between murders&quot;, but some academics consider that a killing spree may last weeks or months, e.g. the case of Andrew Cunanan, who murdered five people over three months.

== Definition == 

The general definition of spree murder is two or more murders committed by a person (or people) with no cooling-off period, in contrast to serial murder, where there is a period of time between killings. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found the category to be of no real value to law enforcement because quantifying a &quot;cooling-off period&quot; is arbitrary. Serial killers commit murders in separate events, at different times. Mass murderers are defined by one incident, with no distinctive period between the murders.

How to distinguish a spree killer from a mass murderer, or a serial killer, is subject to considerable debate, and the terms are not consistently applied even within the academic literature.

The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics has defined a spree killing as &quot;killings at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders&quot;.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment&quot; lists five different categories of spree killers and cites Mark O. Barton as an example of the second one. He is also noted alongside mass murderers, such as Patrick Sherrill, in the respective entry about mass murder. In &quot;The Anatomy of Motive&quot;, John E. Douglas cites Charles Starkweather and Andrew Cunanan (who murdered five people over three months) as examples of spree killers, while Jack Levin calls Starkweather a mass murderer and Cunanan a serial killer.

In &quot;Controversial Issues in Criminology&quot;, Fuller and Hickey write that &quot;[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers&quot;, later elaborating those spree killers &quot;will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks&quot; while the &quot;methods of murder and types of victims vary&quot;. Andrew Cunanan is given as an example of spree killing, while Charles Whitman is mentioned in connection with mass murder and Jeffrey Dahmer with serial killing.

In &quot;Serial Murder,&quot; Ronald M. Holmes and StephenT. Holmes defines spree murder as &quot;the killing of three or more people within a 30-day period&quot; and add that killing sprees are &quot;usually accompanied by the commission of another felony.&quot; They cite Charles Starkweather and the Beltway Snipers as examples of spree killers. They define &quot;serial&quot; murder as &quot;the killing of three or more people over a period of more than 30 days, with a significant cooling-off period between the killings.&quot; Under this definition, Andrew Cunanan would be categorized as a serial killer and not a spree killer.

In &quot;Sexual Homicide&quot;, Ressler, Burgess and Douglas gave more emphasis to killings being at more than one location, and less precision about the time span, saying that a single event can last a short or long time, citing Christopher Wilder&#x27;s seven-week &quot;murder event&quot; or &quot;killing spree&quot;.

Douglas wrote that the identity of serial killers is generally unknown until they are caught, and a mass murderer&#x27;s identity is learned only after they have committed the crime. The identity of the spree killer, on the other hand, usually becomes known by police while the spree is still in progress.

The term rampage killer has also been used sometimes to describe spree killers,
especially when a single individual perpetrator:

<text>Ricky Byrdsong (June 24, 1956 – July 3, 1999) was an American college basketball coach and insurance executive. He served as the head men&#x27;s basketball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy (1988–1993) and Northwestern University (1993–1997), compiling a career coaching record of 89–163. Byrdsong was the first African American head coach of the Northwestern Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball program. On July 2, 1999, he was shot during a racially motivated killing spree and died the next day.

==Early life==
Byrdsong grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, raised by his mother with his younger sister Marcia. He attended Frederick Douglass High School. Besides basketball, Byrdsong played the saxophone in the band, sang with the chorus and appeared in school plays. After graduation in 1974, Byrdsong accepted a basketball scholarship to Pratt Community College in Pratt, Kansas.

Byrdsong then played his final two seasons of college basketball for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa under Coach Lynn Nance from 1976–1978. He was named team captain, but played sparingly for the Cyclones averaging 0.9 points and 0.9 rebounds in his career. After graduating from Pratt, Byrdsong had been offered scholarships from many schools, before choosing Iowa State. He said, &quot;Then I went there and I never played. I probably was the only non-playing captain in Iowa State history. Total all my minutes in two years and it might equal two games.&quot;

However, after he graduated from Iowa State, Coach Nance asked Brydsong consider coaching and then asked him to stay with the Cyclones as a graduate assistant. He accepted the advice and began his coaching career in 1978.

== Coaching career ==
In a ten year run as a college assistant, Byrdsong was an assistant at Arizona six seasons under Coach Lute Olson. Byrdsong was an assistant as the Wildcats advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1988, after the program had been 4–24 in 1983. After the season he was offered the head coaching position at Detroit Mercy.

As coach for the Northwestern University Wildcats from 1993 to 1997, Byrdsong led them to a National Invitation Tournament berth in 1994, the second postseason appearance in school history, defeating DePaul University in the first round.

He had previously been head coach at the University of Detroit-Mercy (1988–1993) and assistant coach at the University of Arizona (1982–1988), Eastern Illinois University (1980–1982), Western Michigan University (1979–1980) and Iowa State University (1978–1979). After he left Northwestern, he worked as an vice president of community affairs for Aon Corporation until his death.

===The walk on the wild side===
On February 5, 1994, while coaching a game against Minnesota, Byrdsong abruptly left the game and joined the fans in the stands shaking hands, high-fiving the Minnesota Gopher mascot and taking an unticketed seat until removed by an usher. The team had started the season 9–0 but was at this point on a 9-game losing streak.

After returning to Evanston, Byrdsong&#x27;s wife requested a leave of absence for the coach, to which Byrdsong remarked, &quot;My wife, after watching me, obviously got concerned, now, any time I&#x27;m going to take a walk on the wild side, I should let her know.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
On July 2, 1999, while jogging near his Skokie, Illinois home with his son and daughter, ages 8 and 10, Byrdsong was shot by Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a member of the white supremacist Creativity Movement who went on a shooting spree that killed one person and injured ten others. Byrdsong died four hours later on July 3 at Evanston Hospital. Smith was a disciple of Mathew Hale, the leader of Creativity Movement, and his shooting spree took place two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law in Illinois. According to eyewitnesses, Smith pulled alongside Byrdsong and shot him multiple times. Smith committed suicide on July 4 after he crashed his car into a metal post during a high-speed chase in Southern Illinois.

Byrdsong and his wife, Sherialyn, had three children: Sabrina, Kelley and Ricky Jr.

===Media coverage and public reaction===
A fair amount of media coverage was centered on the events of Byrdsong&#x27;s death and his achievements as a former Northwestern basketball coach. In 2000, an award was created in his honor by the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative. Anya Cordell, Byrdsong&#x27;s neighbor, wrote the anti-hate crime book &quot;Race: An Open and Shut Case&quot;. Cordell said that she was inspired by the urge to combat the hate that fueled Benjamin Smith&#x27;s deadly shooting rampage. Byrdsong&#x27;s children also received college scholarships from the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, an organization which helps victims of families from hate crimes.

In 2009, a documentary about Byrdsong, entitled &quot;Fly Like the Byrd&quot;, was created by Northwestern students from the Medill School of Journalism. The 25-minute documentary examines race relations and how his legacy has lived on, ten years later.

==The Ricky Byrdsong Foundation==
His widow established The Ricky Byrdsong Foundation. Its mission is to &quot;arrest the growing epidemic of hate and violence in our society by and against our youth.&quot;

The foundation holds a number of events in and around Evanston; the most well-known is the Race Against Hate, a 5K running race held annually in late June in Evanston. The Race Against Hate race draws several thousand runners. In 2009, a 10,000-meter running race was added in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Race Against Hate.

<doc id="168229" wikidata="Q124628901" url="?curid=168229" title="Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting">
<text>On September 15, 1999, a mass shooting occurred at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. 47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook entered during a See You at the Pole Rally featuring a concert by the Christian rock group Forty Days, where he killed seven people and wounded seven others before committing suicide. Most of the victims were teenagers. 

Prior to the shooting, he had displayed behavior considered erratic and frightening by those around him, and had mailed multiple letters to a local newspaper proclaiming he was being framed for murder and being watched by intelligence agencies. During the shooting, Ashbrook disparaged Christianity and the beliefs of the churchgoers.

== Shooting ==
Ashbrook arrived at the Wedgwood Baptist Church wearing mirrored sunglasses and a pullover. As he entered the church, he did not put out his cigarette, which was viewed by churchgoers as odd. According to an injured victim, Ashbrook asked him: &quot;Is this where that damn religious meeting is being held?&quot;; he planned to tell Ashbrook to put out his cigarette, but Ashbrook then proceeded to pull out a gun from under his shirt and shoot him twice. He interrupted a teen prayer rally, slamming his hand on a door to make his presence known. Spouting anti-Christian rhetoric, he opened fire with a Ruger 9 mm semi-automatic handgun and a .380-caliber handgun. 

He reloaded several times during the shooting; three empty magazines were found at the scene. Ashbrook threw a pipe bomb into the church, where it exploded upwards and released shrapnel. There were no deaths from the bomb. Seven people were killed, four of whom were teenagers (a 14-year-old boy, two 14-year-old girls and a 17-year-old boy). Three people sustained major injuries while four others received relatively minor injuries.

During the shooting, Ashbrook was confronted by a 19-year-old former football lineman, Jeremiah &quot;Jeremy&quot; Neitz, who recounted the ensuing conversation for the &quot;Houston Press&quot;:

Ashbrook fired several more rounds and yelled, &quot;This religion is bullshit.&quot; Neitz replied, &quot;Sir, what you need is Jesus Christ in your life.&quot; Neitz asked Ashbrook &quot;What about you?&quot; Ashbrook replied, &quot;Fuck off&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you believe in this junk.&quot; He then sat down in a pew and shot himself. The shooting lasted less than 10 minutes.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine described accounts of the confrontation as &quot;unconfirmed&quot; and possibly &quot;pious invention&quot;, but the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that the story had been confirmed, quoting the Fort Worth police detective who had interviewed Neitz: &quot;Maybe he did frustrate Ashbrook with what he was saying. There&#x27;s no way we&#x27;ll ever really know. All I can say is that I&#x27;m impressed by what he did that evening. It was a very brave thing. You have to admire that.&quot;

== Perpetrator ==

The shooter was 47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook, born July 10, 1952. Nine years before the shooting, Ashbrook&#x27;s mother died. This reportedly sent him into a cycle of erratic and frightening behavior. Ashbrook lived for many years with his father, Jack D. Ashbrook. Across the street from the Ashbrooks&#x27; home, neighbors said they saw Ashbrook treat his father violently but were afraid to report it. Newspaper editor Stephen Kaye, whom Ashbrook had visited days before the shooting, described him as being &quot;the opposite of someone you&#x27;d be concerned about&quot;, saying he &quot;couldn&#x27;t have been any nicer.&quot; In Ashbrook&#x27;s home, police found materials used to make pipe bombs. He had legally purchased the Ruger and the .380 caliber at a flea market February 13 and 15 of the year, from two different sellers.

However, his neighbors had an entirely different view of him, describing him as strange and violent. Investigators at his house discovered that he had virtually destroyed the interior of his house - holes were bashed into the walls with crowbars, the toilets were filled with concrete, and the fruit trees growing in the front yard had been poisoned. He sent &quot;rambling&quot; letters to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram describing encounters with the CIA. His brother described him as a paranoid schizophrenic.

Police investigating the shooting could find no solid motive for the crime. In the months before the shooting, people who knew Ashbrook said he became increasingly paranoid, certain that he was being framed for serial murder and other crimes that he did not commit. He also feared that the CIA was targeting him, and he reported psychological warfare, assaults by co-workers and being drugged by the police. Just days before the shooting he voiced these concerns to a newspaper, saying &quot;I want someone to tell my story, no one will listen to me; no one will believe me.&quot;

According to those who knew Ashbrook when he was a child, the shooter &quot;resented being made to attend church three times a week&quot; and journals left behind at his house contained anti-religious material. Reportedly, Ashbrook mutilated a Bible before the attack.

Houston-area writer John Craig claimed that Ashbrook was a member of Phineas Priesthood and he interviewed Ashbrook in 1997, an anti-Semitic hate group. Craig said he notified the FBI after the interview and called the Fort Worth police after realizing he knew the shooter but FBI official said there were no plans to pursue Craig&#x27;s story, and police spokesman Lt. David Ellis said he had no knowledge that Craig had called. Several representatives of organizations that monitor hate groups said Ashbrook appeared nowhere in their databases. Some believe that Ashbrook targeted a Southern Baptist church because the Texas Baptist Association had called for members to convert Jews.

== Aftermath ==
In the immediate aftermath, Ashbrook&#x27;s identity was unknown. The church was closed to check for explosives. President Clinton stated after the shooting &quot;Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by gun violence, taking children brimming with faith and promise and hope before their time.&quot; George W. Bush, then presidential candidate and governor of Texas, cancelled two fundraisers and returned to the state. He condemned a &quot;wave of evil&quot; and said the solution was &quot;more love in society&quot;.

A Sunday service was held just four days after the shooting, as the lead pastor of the church, Al Meredith, said they did not wish to &quot;give an inch to the darkness.&quot; During his sermon at the service, he said that &quot;this tragedy that the devil wanted to use to stop the people of God has ended up strengthening us&quot;, and that the shooting had united the church. He preached forgiveness for Ashbrook, describing him as a &quot;poor man&quot; influenced by Satan. He, and other members of the church, later met with Ashbrook&#x27;s family.

Meredith expressed his condolences for victims of the Charleston church shooting in 2015 and the Sutherland Springs church shooting in 2017. On the 20th anniversary of the shooting, he stated, referring to the recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton: “[we] hardly get shocked anymore, [...] after three days, it’s old news. And all our thoughts and prayers, that’s about all we can conjure up for the victims. There’s something tragically wrong with that.” A memorial service was held at the church for the 20th anniversary. 

Following the attack, the seven victims were recognized as Christian martyrs. A memorial to them was constructed outside the church.

<text>A lifting body is a fixed-wing aircraft or spacecraft configuration in which the body itself produces lift. In contrast to a flying wing, which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage, a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing. Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces, lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic flight, or spacecraft re-entry. All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight safety.

Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 70s as a means to build a small and lightweight crewed spacecraft. The US built a number of lifting body rocket planes to test the concept, as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific. Interest waned as the US Air Force lost interest in the crewed mission, and major development ended during the Space Shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage.

Advanced spaceplane concepts in the 1990s and 2000s did use lifting-body designs. Examples include the HL-20 Personnel Launch System (1990) and the Prometheus spaceplane (2010). The Dream Chaser lifting-body spaceplane, an extension of HL-20 technology, was proposed as one of three vehicles to potentially carry US crew to and from the International Space Station, but eventually was selected as a resupply vehicle instead. In 2015 the ESA Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle performed the first ever successful reentry of a lifting body spacecraft.

==History==
The lifting body had been imagined by 1917, in which year an aircraft with something like a delta wing plan form with a thick included fuselage was described in a patent by Roy Scroggs. However at low airspeeds the lifting body is inefficient and did not enter mainstream airplane design.

Aerospace-related lifting body research arose from the idea of spacecraft re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and landing much like a regular airplane. Following atmospheric re-entry, the capsule spacecraft from the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo series had very little control over where they landed. A steerable spacecraft with wings could significantly extend its landing envelope. However, the vehicle&#x27;s wings would have to be designed to withstand the dynamic and thermal stresses of both re-entry and hypersonic flight. One proposal eliminated wings altogether: design the fuselage body to produce lift by itself.

NASA&#x27;s refinements of the lifting body concept began in 1962 with R. Dale Reed of NASA&#x27;s Armstrong Flight Research Center. The first full-size model to come out of Reed&#x27;s program was the NASA M2-F1, an unpowered craft made of wood. Initial tests were performed by towing the M2-F1 along a dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base California, behind a modified Pontiac Catalina. Later the craft was towed behind a C-47 and released. Since the M2-F1 was a glider, a small rocket motor was added in order to extend the landing envelope. The M2-F1 was soon nicknamed the &quot;Flying Bathtub&quot;.

In 1963, NASA began programs with heavier rocket-powered lifting-body vehicles to be air launched from under the starboard wing of a NB-52B, a derivative of the B-52 jet bomber. The first flights started in 1966. Of the Dryden lifting bodies, all but the unpowered NASA M2-F1 used an XLR11 rocket engine as was used on the Bell X-1. A follow-on design designated the Northrop HL-10 was developed at NASA Langley Research Center.
Air flow separation caused the crash of the Northrop M2-F2 lifting body.
The HL-10 attempted to solve part of this problem by angling the port and starboard vertical stabilizers outward and enlarging the center one.

Starting 1965 the Russian lifting-body Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 or EPOS (Russian acronym for Experimental Passenger Orbital Aircraft) was developed and several test flights made. Work ended in 1978 when the efforts shifted to the Buran program, while work on another small-scale spacecraft partly continued in the Bor program.

The IXV is a European Space Agency lifting body experimental re-entry vehicle intended to validate European reusable launchers which could be evaluated in the frame of the FLPP program. The IXV made its first flight in February 2015, launched by a Vega rocket.

Orbital Sciences proposed a commercial lifting-body spaceplane in 2010. The Prometheus is more fully described below.

==Aerospace applications==

Lifting bodies pose complex control, structural, and internal configuration issues. Lifting bodies were eventually rejected in favor of a delta wing design for the Space Shuttle. Data acquired in flight test using high-speed landing approaches at very steep descent angles and high sink rates was used for modeling Shuttle flight and landing profiles.

In planning for atmospheric re-entry, the landing site is selected in advance. For reusable reentry vehicles, typically a primary site is preferred that is closest to the launch site in order to reduce costs and improve launch turnaround time. However, weather near the landing site is a major factor in flight safety. In some seasons, weather at landing sites can change quickly relative to the time necessary to initiate and execute re-entry and safe landing. Due to weather, it is possible the vehicle may have to execute a landing at an alternate site. Furthermore, most airports do not have runways of sufficient length to support the approach landing speed and roll distance required by spacecraft. Few airports exist in the world that can support or be modified to support this type of requirement. Therefore, alternate landing sites are very widely spaced across the U.S. and around the world. The Shuttle&#x27;s delta wing design was driven by these issues. These requirements were further exacerbated by requirements that extended the Shuttle&#x27;s flight landing envelope.

Nonetheless, the lifting body concept has been implemented in a number of other aerospace programs, the previously mentioned NASA X-38, Lockheed Martin X-33, BAC&#x27;s Multi Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device, Europe&#x27;s EADS Phoenix, and the joint Russian-European Kliper spacecraft. Of the three basic design shapes usually analyzed for such programs (capsule, lifting body, aircraft) the lifting body may offer the best trade-off in terms of maneuverability and thermodynamics while meeting its customers&#x27; mission requirements.

==Current systems==
The Dream Chaser is a suborbital and orbital vertical-takeoff, horizontal-landing (VTHL) lifting-body spaceplane being developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). The Dream Chaser design is planned to eventually carry up to seven people to and from low Earth orbit, and the spaceplane is currently planned to be used for delivering cargo to the International Space Station under the Commercial Resupply Services program. The vehicle will launch vertically on a Vulcan Centaur and land horizontally on conventional runways.

==Body lift==

Some aircraft with wings also employ bodies that generate lift. Some of the early 1930s high-wing monoplane designs of the Bellanca Aircraft Company, such as the Bellanca Aircruiser, had vaguely airfoil-shaped fuselages capable of generating some lift, with even the wing struts on some versions given widened fairings to give them some lift-generating capability. The Gee Bee R-1 Super Sportster racing plane of the 1930s, likewise, from more modern aerodynamic studies, has been shown to have had considerable ability to generate lift with its fuselage design, important for the R-1&#x27;s intended racing role, while in highly banked pylon turns while racing. Vincent Burnelli developed several aircraft between the 1920s and 1950 that used fuselage lift. Like the earlier Bellanca monoplanes, the Short SC.7 Skyvan produces a substantial amount of lift from its fuselage shape, almost as much as the 35% each of the wings produces. 

Fighters like the F-15 Eagle also produce substantial lift from the wide fuselage between the wings. Because the F-15 Eagle&#x27;s wide fuselage is so efficient at lift, an F-15 is able to land successfully with only one wing, albeit under nearly full power, with thrust contributing significantly to lift. In the summer of 1983, an Israeli F-15 staged a mock dogfight with Skyhawks for training purposes, near Nahal Tzin in the Negev desert. During the exercise, one of the Skyhawks miscalculated and collided forcefully with the F-15&#x27;s wing root. The F-15&#x27;s pilot was aware that the wing had been seriously damaged, but decided to try and land in a nearby airbase, not knowing the extent of his wing damage. It was only after he had landed, when he climbed out of the cockpit and looked backward, that the pilot realized what had happened: the wing had been completely torn off the plane, and he had landed the plane with only one wing attached. A few months later, the damaged F-15 had been given a new wing, and returned to operational duty in the squadron. The engineers at McDonnell Douglas had a hard time believing the story of the one-winged landing: as far as their planning models were concerned, this was an impossibility.

In 2010, Orbital Sciences proposed the Prometheus &quot;blended lifting-body&quot; spaceplane vehicle, about one-quarter the size of the Space Shuttle, as a commercial option for carrying astronauts to low Earth orbit under the commercial crew program.
The Vertical Takeoff, Horizontal Landing (VTHL) vehicle was to have been launched on a human-rated Atlas V rocket but would land on a runway.
The initial design was to have carried a crew of 4, but it could carry up to 6, or a combination of crew and cargo. In addition to Orbital Sciences, the consortium behind the proposal included Northrop Grumman, which would have built the spaceplane, and the United Launch Alliance, which would have provided the launch vehicle.
Failing to be selected for a CCDev phase 2 award by NASA, Orbital announced in April 2011 that they would likely wind down their efforts to develop a commercial crew vehicle.

Design principles of lifting bodies are used also in the construction of hybrid airships.

==Armstrong Flight Research Center==

The US government developed a variety of proof-of-concept and flight-test vehicle lifting body designs from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s at Armstrong Flight Research Center. These included:
*M2-F1
*M2-F2
*M2-F3
*HL-10
*X-24A
*X-24B

===Pilots and flights===
:* Wood, Haise and Engle each made a single car-towed flight of the M2-F1.

==Popular culture==

Lifting bodies have appeared in some science fiction works, including the movie &quot;Marooned&quot;, and as John Crichton&#x27;s spacecraft Farscape-1 in the TV series &quot;Farscape&quot;. The Discovery Channel TV series conjectured using lifting bodies to deliver a probe to a distant earth-like planet in the animated &quot;Alien Planet.&quot; Gerry Anderson&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; used a VTOL lifting body lander / ascender to visit an Earth-like planet, only to crash in both attempts. His series UFO featured a lifting body craft visually similar to the M2-F2 for orbital operations (&quot;The Man Who Came Back&quot;). In the &quot;Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s Race Into Space&quot; computer game, a modified X-24A becomes an alternative lunar capable spacecraft that the player can choose over the Gemini or Apollo capsule.

The 1970s television program &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; used footage of a lifting body aircraft, culled from actual NASA exercises, in the show&#x27;s title sequence. The scenes included an HL-10&#x27;s separation from its carrier plane—a modified B-52—and an M2-F2 piloted by Bruce Peterson, crashing and tumbling violently along the Edwards dry lakebed runway. The cause of the crash was attributed to the onset of &quot;Dutch roll&quot; stemming from control instability as induced by flow separation.

The episode &quot;The Deadly Replay&quot; (season 2 episode 8 aired 9/22/1974) features the HL-10 as a prop of the story.

<text>Judith Marjorie Collins (born May 1, 1939) is an American singer-songwriter and musician with a career spanning nearly seven decades. An Academy Award-nominated documentary director and a Grammy Award-winning recording artist, she is known for her eclectic tastes in the material she records (which has included folk music, country, show tunes, pop music, rock and roll and standards), for her social activism, and for the clarity of her voice. Her discography consists of 36 studio albums, nine live albums, numerous compilation albums, four holiday albums, and 21 singles.

Collins&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;A Maid of Constant Sorrow&quot;, was released in 1961 and consisted of traditional folk songs. She had her first charting single with &quot;Hard Lovin&#x27; Loser&quot; (No. 97) from her fifth studio album &quot;In My Life&quot; (1966), but it was the lead single from her sixth studio album &quot;Wildflowers&quot; (1967), &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; – written by Joni Mitchell – that gave her international prominence. The single reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart and won Collins her first Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance. She enjoyed further success with her recordings of &quot;Someday Soon&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot; (also written by Mitchell), &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, and &quot;Cook with Honey&quot;.

Collins experienced the biggest success of her career with her recording of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; from her tenth studio album &quot;Judith&quot; (1975). The single peaked at No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart in 1975 and then again in 1977 at No. 19, spending 27 non-consecutive weeks on the chart and earning her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, as well as a Grammy Award for Sondheim for Song of the Year. &quot;Judith&quot; also became her best-selling studio album; it was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1975 for sales of over 500,000 copies and Platinum in 1996 for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.

In 2017, Collins&#x27; rendition of the song &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. That same year, she received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Folk Album for &quot;Silver Skies Blue&quot; with Ari Hest. In 2019 at the age of 80, she scored her first No. 1 album on an American &quot;Billboard&quot; chart with &quot;Winter Stories&quot;, a duet album with Norwegian singer, songwriter, and guitarist Jonas Fjeld featuring Chatham County Line. In 2022, she released her first studio album of all original material, titled &quot;Spellbound&quot;, and it earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album.

==Early life==
Collins was born the eldest of five siblings in Seattle where she lived for the first ten years of her life. Her father, Chuck Collins (a blind singer, pianist, and radio show host) took a job in Denver in 1949 and the family moved there. Her grandfather on her father&#x27;s side was Irish. 

Judy Collins contracted polio at the age of 11 and spent two months in isolation in a hospital. She grew up listening to the traditional Irish music her father sang. She did not know what folk music was when she was young. She said, &quot;I just thought it was probably Rodgers and Hart. Those were the songs he (her father) sang on the radio. I didn&#x27;t understand until I discovered &quot;The Gypsy Rover&quot; and &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; when I was 15. I didn&#x27;t realize I had been singing &quot;Danny Boy&quot; all of that time... &quot;Danny Boy&quot; was a folk song.

==Career==
===Beginnings===

Collins studied classical piano with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13 performing Mozart&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos. She also played Chopin, Debussy, and Rachmaninoff as a child. Brico took a dim view of her developing interest in folk music, which led her to the difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins&#x27; hands into hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, &quot;Little Judy—you really could have gone places.&quot; Still later, she discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing jazz and ragtime piano (&quot;Singing Lessons&quot;, pp. 71–72). 

In her early life, Collins met many professional musicians through her father.

It was the music of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and the traditional songs of the folk revival of the early 1960s, however, that kindled Collins&#x27; interest and awoke in her a love for lyrics. Three years after her debut as a piano prodigy, she was playing guitar. Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver&#x27;s East High School were at Michael&#x27;s Pub in Boulder, Colorado and the folk club Exodus in Denver. Her music became popular at the University of Connecticut, where her husband taught. She performed at parties and for the campus radio station along with David Grisman and Tom Azarian.

===1960s===
Collins eventually made her way to Greenwich Village, New York City where she played in clubs like Gerde&#x27;s Folk City until she signed with Elektra Records, a label she was associated with for 35 years. In 1961, she released her debut studio album, &quot;A Maid of Constant Sorrow&quot;, at age 22.

At first, Collins sang traditional folk songs or songs written by others–in particular the protest songwriters of the time, such as Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, and Bob Dylan. She recorded her own versions of important songs from the period, such as Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;. She was also instrumental in bringing little-known musicians to a wider public. For example, she recorded songs by Canadian poet Leonard Cohen, who became a close friend over the years. She also recorded songs by singer-songwriters such as Eric Andersen, Fred Neil, Ian Tyson, Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman, Robin Williamson, and Richard Fariña long before they gained national acclaim.
Collins&#x27; first few studio albums consisted of straightforward guitar-based folk songs, but with her fifth studio album &quot;In My Life&quot; (1966), she began branching out to include works from such diverse sources as the Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Jacques Brel, and Kurt Weill. Mark Abramson produced and Joshua Rifkin arranged the album, adding lush orchestration to many of the numbers. The album was a major departure for a folk artist and set the course for Collins&#x27; subsequent work over the next decade.

With her sixth studio album &quot;Wildflowers&quot; (1967), also produced by Abramson and arranged by Rifkin, Collins began to record her own compositions, beginning with &quot;Since You Asked&quot;. The album also provided her with a major hit and a Grammy Award in Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, which in December 1968 reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, later (February 1970) reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.

Collins&#x27; seventh studio album &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; (1968) was produced by David Anderle, and featured back-up guitar by Stephen Stills (of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash), with whom she was romantically involved at the time. (She was the inspiration for Stills&#x27;s CSN classic &quot;&quot;.) &quot;Time Goes&quot; had a mellow country sound and included Ian Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Someday Soon&quot; and the title track, written by the UK singer-songwriter Sandy Denny. The album also featured Collins&#x27; composition &quot;My Father&quot; and one of the first covers of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;.

Two of Collins&#x27; songs (&quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; composed by Sandy Denny and &quot;Albatross&quot;) were featured in the 1968 film &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;.

===1970s===
By the 1970s, Collins had a solid reputation as an art song singer and folksinger and had begun to stand out for her own compositions. She was also known for her broad range of material: her songs from this period include the traditional Christian hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, the Stephen Sondheim Broadway ballad &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; (both of which were top 20 hits as singles in both the U.S. and the U.K.), a recording of Joan Baez&#x27;s &quot;A Song for David&quot;, and her own compositions, such as &quot;Born to the Breed&quot;.

In 1971, Collins issued her second live album, &quot;Living&quot;, and the compilation album &quot;Colors of the Day: The Best of Judy Collins&quot; followed a year later. Collins&#x27; ninth studio album &quot;True Stories and Other Dreams&quot; (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life (&quot;Song for Martin&quot;) and another about the life of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (&quot;Che&quot;). For her tenth studio album &quot;Judith&quot; (1975), she collaborated with producer Arif Mardin, who gave the album a sophisticated sound. &quot;Judith&quot; produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;, and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.

As Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by James Oppenheim commonly associated with a 1912 garment workers strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, were balanced with such pop compositions as Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Come Down in Time&quot;, but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of &quot;Judith&quot;. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album &quot;So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years&quot; (1977) sold modestly.
Collins guest starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in an episode broadcast in January 1978, singing &quot;Leather-Winged Bat&quot;, &quot;There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly&quot;, &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, and &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;. She also appeared several times on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, where she performed &quot;Fishermen&#x27;s Song&quot; with a chorus of Anything Muppet fishermen, sang a trio with Biff and Sully using the word &quot;yes&quot;, and even starred in a modern musical fairy tale skit called &quot;The Sad Princess&quot;. In 1979, she returned to music with her twelfth studio album &quot;Hard Times for Lovers&quot;, a pop-oriented album in the same vein as &quot;Judith&quot;; she gained some extra publicity with the cover sleeve photograph of her in the nude.

===1980s===
&quot;Running for My Life&quot; (1980) and &quot;Times of Our Lives&quot; (1982) were well-crafted exercises in adult pop and soft rock, but as tastes changed, Collins&#x27; sales were on the decline. &quot;Home Again&quot; (1984) found her exploring some new musical avenues, including a synth-based cover of Yaz&#x27;s &quot;Only You&quot; and a duet with country star T. G. Sheppard on the title cut. While the &quot;Home Again&quot; single was a minor hit, the album was not, and after 23 years, Collins and Elektra parted ways. She performed the music for the 1983 animated television special &quot;The Magic of Herself the Elf&quot;, as well as the theme song of the Rankin/Bass Productions television film &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.
Collins traveled to England in 1985 and struck a one-off deal with Telstar Records to record the studio album &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, in which she re-recorded several of her better-known songs with an inspirational bent. In 1987, she signed with the independent Gold Castle label, and her first studio album for them, &quot;Trust Your Heart&quot;, which collected seven tracks from &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and added three new selections. That same year, she released her first memoir, &quot;Trust Your Heart&quot;.

In 1989, Collins released two albums: a live disc titled &quot;Sanity and Grace&quot;, and a collaboration with clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, &quot;Innervoices&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1990, Collins released her eighteenth studio album &quot;Fires of Eden&quot; on Columbia Records. The album spawned one single – &quot;Fires of Eden&quot;, written by Kit Hain and Mark Goldenberg. The single peaked at No. 31 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart. At the time of its release, Collins performed it live on several occasions, including on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;. A music video promoting it and featuring her was also released. Later, Cher recorded &quot;Fires of Eden&quot; for her 1991 studio album &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. Other songs from &quot;Fires of Eden&quot; include &quot;The Blizzard&quot;, &quot;Home Before Dark&quot;, and a cover of the Hollies song – &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot;. That same year saw the release of a pair of children&#x27;s albums, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Morningtime&quot; and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Bedtime&quot;. Collins performed at President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first inauguration in 1993, singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;. (The Clintons have stated that they named their daughter, Chelsea, after her recording of the song.)

For her next studio album, Collins turned to a project that was both personal and familiar, a set of Bob Dylan covers titled &quot;Judy Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman&quot;. Released in 1993, the album was a commercial success and reminded fans she was still active and in fine voice. In 1994, she issued her first Christmas album, &quot;Come Rejoice! A Judy Collins Christmas&quot;. It would prove to be the first in a series, with other holiday releases soon following, the first being the live album &quot;Christmas at the Biltmore Estate&quot; in 1997, followed by &quot;All on a Wintry Night&quot; in 2000. Collins combined her interests in music and literature for her next project. In 1995, she published a novel, &quot;Shameless&quot;, that took place against the backdrop of the music business; she also released an album of the same name that served as the soundtrack.

In 1998, Collins published her third book, &quot;Singing Lessons: A Memoir of Love&quot;, &quot;Loss, Hope and Healing,&quot; which focused on her struggles with alcoholism, depression, and the emotional trauma of her son&#x27;s death. In 1999, she released &quot;Classic Broadway&quot;, a collection of vintage show tunes. That same year, she and her manager Katherine DePaul founded Wildflower Records.

===2000s–2020s===

Collins maintained a busy release schedule via Wildflower, issuing numerous live albums and reissues as well as new material such as 2005&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of an American Girl&quot;, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Paradise&quot;, and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian&quot;, all of which focused on her continued strength as an interpretive vocalist. In 2006, she sang &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; in a commercial for Eliot Spitzer. In 2007, she released her own covers collection of Beatles songs, entitled &quot;Judy Collins Sings Lennon and McCartney&quot;. Various artists, including Shawn Colvin, Rufus Wainwright, and Chrissie Hynde, covered Collins&#x27;s compositions for the tribute album &quot;Born to the Breed&quot; in 2008. In the same year, she received an honorary doctorate from Pratt Institute. The tribute albums &quot;Tom Thumb&#x27;s Blues: A Tribute to Judy Collins&quot; and &quot;Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins&quot; appeared in 2000 and 2008, respectively.

In 2010, Collins sang &quot;The Weight of the World&quot; at the Newport Folk Festival, a song by Amy Speace. Another memoir from Collins, &quot;Sweet Judy Blue Eyes: My Life in Music&quot;, appeared the following year and put its focus on her career as an artist. In July 2012, she appeared as a guest artist on the Australian SBS television programme &quot;RocKwiz&quot;. She paid homage to some of her favorite songwriters as well as her favorite vocalists with the 2015 album &quot;Strangers Again&quot;, which featured duets with Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Jeff Bridges, and Glen Hansard. The album also included a track with singer-songwriter Ari Hest. Collins and Hest joined forces again in 2016 for a full studio album titled &quot;Silver Skies Blue&quot;, which later earned them a Grammy Award nomination for Best Folk Album.

In 2017, Collins returned to the work of the songwriter who gave her &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; with &quot;A Love Letter to Stephen Sondheim&quot;, and the same year, she and her longtime friend, Stephen Stills, collaborated on an album, &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;. In addition to the two albums, she bared her soul in another book, &quot;Cravings: How I Conquered Food,&quot; where she opened up about her difficult relationship with food and her years of dealing with eating disorders. In 2019, she released the album &quot;Winter Stories&quot;, a collaboration with Norwegian singer Jonas Fjeld and the North Carolina country-folk quartet Chatham County Line. In 2022, she released her first studio album of all original material, entitled &quot;Spellbound&quot;.

Collins joined the judging panel for the 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Annual Independent Music Awards.

==Activism==
Like many other folk singers of her generation, Collins was drawn to social activism. Her political idealism led her to compose a ballad, &quot;Che,&quot; in honor of the 1960s Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Collins sympathized with the Yippie movement and was friendly with its leaders, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. On March 17, 1968, she went to Hoffman&#x27;s press conference at the Americana Hotel in New York to announce the party&#x27;s formation. In 1969, she testified in Chicago in support of the Chicago Seven; during her testimony, she began singing Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; and was admonished by prosecutor Tom Foran and judge Julius Hoffman.

In 1971, Collins signed her name to a &quot;Ms&quot;. campaign, &quot;We Have Had Abortions&quot;, which called for an end to &quot;archaic laws&quot; regarding abortion rights; the campaign encouraged women to share their stories and take action. In 1982, she wrote the song &quot;Mama Mama&quot; about a mother of five and her ambivalence over her decision to abort an unintended pregnancy. In the late 1990s, she was a representative for UNICEF and campaigns on behalf of the abolition of landmines. Later songs include &quot;River of Gold&quot; about the environment and &quot;My Name is Maria&quot; about DREAMers, who are mostly undocumented students and youth.

==Personal life==
Collins has been married twice. She was married to Peter Taylor in 1958 and they had her only child, Clark C. Taylor, who was born the same year. The marriage ended in divorce in 1965. In April 1996, she married industrial designer Louis Nelson, whom she had been seeing since April 1978. They lived in New York City. Nelson died of cancer in 2024.

In 1962, shortly after her debut at Carnegie Hall, Collins was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was in a sanatorium for six months recuperating. She is the subject of the Stephen Stills composition &quot;&quot;, which appeared on the 1969 eponymous debut studio album of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

Collins suffered from bulimia nervosa after she quit smoking in the 1970s. &quot;I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder&quot;, she told &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1992. &quot;I started throwing up. I didn&#x27;t know anything about bulimia, certainly not that it is an addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 pounds, were of increasing despair.&quot; 

She wrote at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression. She admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, by suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since then, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.

Collins is a member of the Episcopal Church. In 2000, she cancelled a planned appearance and concert at the Episcopal Church&#x27;s General Convention in protest of the Church&#x27;s positions regarding gay rights.

<text>The Meters (later The Funky Meters) are an American funk band formed in 1965 in New Orleans by Zigaboo Modeliste (drums), George Porter Jr. (bass), Leo Nocentelli (guitar) and Art Neville (keyboards). The band performed and recorded their own music from the late 1960s until 1977 and played an influential role as backing musicians for other artists, including Lee Dorsey, Robert Palmer, Dr. John, and Allen Toussaint. Their original songs &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; and &quot;Look-Ka Py Py&quot; are considered funk classics.

While they rarely enjoyed significant mainstream success, they are considered originators of funk along with artists like James Brown, and their work is influential on many other bands, both their contemporaries and modern musicians. Their sound is defined by a combination of tight melodic grooves and syncopated New Orleans &quot;second line&quot; rhythms under highly charged guitar and keyboard riffing. The band has been nominated four times for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, most recently in 2017. In 2018 the band was presented with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==History==
===1960s–1970s===
Art Neville, the group&#x27;s frontman, launched a solo career around the New Orleans area in the mid-1950s while still in high school. The Meters formed in 1965 with a line-up of keyboardist and vocalist Art Neville, guitarist Leo Nocentelli, bassist George Porter Jr. and drummer Joseph &quot;Zigaboo&quot; Modeliste. They were joined later by percussionist-vocalist Cyril Neville. The Meters became the house band for Allen Toussaint and his record label, Sansu Enterprises.

In 1969 the Meters released &quot;Sophisticated Cissy&quot; and &quot;Cissy Strut&quot;, both major R&amp;B chart hits. &quot;Look-Ka Py Py&quot; and &quot;Chicken Strut&quot; were their hits the following year. After a label shift in 1972, the Meters had difficulty returning to the charts, but they worked with Dr. John, Paul McCartney, King Biscuit Boy, Labelle, Robert Palmer, and others.

In 1975 Paul McCartney invited the Meters to play at the release party for his &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; album aboard the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California. Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was in attendance at the event and was greatly taken with the Meters and their sound. The Rolling Stones invited the band to open for them on their Tour of the Americas &#x27;75 and Tour of Europe &#x27;76. In the same year the Meters recorded one of their most successful albums, &quot;Fire on the Bayou&quot;. From 1976 to 1977, they played in The Wild Tchoupitoulas with George and Amos Landry and The Neville Brothers.

Art and Cyril Neville left the band in early 1977, but The Meters still appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 19, 1977, during the show&#x27;s second season. After the Nevilles&#x27; departure, David Batiste Sr. joined on keyboards and Willie West became the band&#x27;s lead singer. Porter left the group later that year and by 1980 The Meters had officially broken up.

After the break-up, Neville continued his career as part of The Neville Brothers. Modeliste toured with Keith Richards and Ron Wood, while Nocentelli and Porter &quot;became in-demand session players and formed new bands.&quot;

===1980s–1990s===
In 1989 Art Neville, George Porter Jr., and Leo Nocentelli reunited as The Meters, adding drummer Russell Batiste Jr. to replace Zigaboo Modeliste. Nocentelli left the group in 1994 and was replaced with guitarist Brian Stoltz, formerly of The Neville Brothers. The band was renamed The Funky Meters. They were referred to as &quot;the Funky Meters&quot; as early as 1989. They were billed as such when playing in a tiny venue called Benny&#x27;s Bar at Valence and Camp streets in New Orleans.

===2000s–2010s===
The Funky Meters continued to play into the 2000s with Stoltz being replaced by Art Neville&#x27;s son, Ian Neville, from 2007 to 2011 while Stoltz pursued a solo career. Stoltz returned to the band permanently in 2011.

In 2000 a large offer enticed all four original Meters to reunite for a one-night stand at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco; by this time Modeliste wanted to make the reunion a permanent one, but the other members and their management teams objected. It wasn&#x27;t until Quint Davis, producer and director of the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, got them to &quot;put aside their differences and hammer out the details&quot; and perform at the Festival in 2005.

In June 2011 The Original Meters along with Allen Toussaint and Dr. John played the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The six men performed songs from Dr. John&#x27;s album &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo&quot; which was originally recorded with the Meters, to a sold-out crowd. The Original Meters also played a set at the 2011 Voodoo Experience in New Orleans. On May 5, 2012 The Meters returned to New Orleans for a performance to a sold-out crowd at the Howlin&#x27; Wolf.

In late 2012, Zigaboo Modeliste, Leo Nocentelli, and George Porter Jr. played concerts with Phish keyboardist Page McConnell under the name The Meter Men. During his time off from Phish, McConnell has continued to play with Porter Jr., Nocentelli, and Modeliste under the moniker of The Meter Men since those shows in 2012. The Meter Men had performed 16 shows together as of spring 2015, with their third annual appearance as a late night act during New Orleans&#x27; Jazz and Heritage Festival. In 2014, during The Meter Men&#x27;s second appearance as a late night act during Jazzfest, the band performed at The Republic on April 26, 2014, after McConnell had headlined the NOLA Jazzfest at the New Orleans Fairgrounds with Phish earlier that day. The Meter Men had also played the previous night at The Republic. As of spring 2015 The Meter Men appeared in Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Colorado, and Vermont. They also had a performance in Washington, D.C.

As of 2017, The Funky Meters toured consistently, performing songs by The Meters, while The Meters performed sporadically. The lineup of Neville, Porter, Nocentelli, and Modeliste typically billed themselves as The Original Meters to avoid confusion with The Funky Meters. When not performing with The Original Meters, guitarist Leo Nocentelli leads his own group, The Meters Experience, which also performs the music of The Meters.

The last performance of the original Meters (with all four of the founding members) was at the Arroyo Seco Festival in Pasadena, California on June 25, 2017. 

Art Neville announced his retirement from music on December 18, 2018. Neville died on July 22, 2019.

==Influence==
According to Brian Knight of &quot;The Vermont Review&quot;, &quot;In a sense, the Meters defined the basic characteristics of the groove. While Funkadelic, Cameo, James Brown and Sly Stone are synonymous with funk, these artists look to the Meters for the basic-down to earthy and raw sound.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau called the band &quot;totally original&quot; and placed the compilation album &quot;Funkify Your Life: The Meters Anthology&quot; on his list of top six New Orleans classics.

The Meters&#x27; music has been sampled by musicians around the world, including rap artists Heavy D, LL Cool J and Queen Latifah, Musiq, Big Daddy Kane, Run-DMC, N.W.A, Ice Cube, Scarface, Cypress Hill, EPMD, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Naughty by Nature, and Tweet.

Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the Meters&#x27; song &quot;Africa&quot;, renamed &quot;Hollywood (Africa)&quot;, on their 1985 album &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;.
The eclectic jazz-fusion guitarist Oz Noy has recorded his version of &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; twice. Primus covered the Meters&#x27; song &quot;Tippi Toes&quot; on their 1992 EP &quot;Miscellaneous Debris&quot;.

Bands such as the Grateful Dead, KVHW, Steve Kimock Band, Widespread Panic, Rebirth Brass Band, Galactic, Jaco Pastorius, and The String Cheese Incident have performed songs by The Meters in their concert rotations.

The song &quot;They All Ask&#x27;d for You&quot; from the 1975 album &quot;Fire on the Bayou&quot; remains popular in the New Orleans region and is the unofficial theme song of the Audubon Zoo.

<doc id="168243" wikidata="Q983385" url="?curid=168243" title="John C. Baez">
<text>John Carlos Baez (; born June 12, 1961) is an American mathematical physicist and a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) in Riverside, California. He has worked on spin foams in loop quantum gravity, applications of higher categories to physics, and applied category theory. Additionally, Baez is known on the World Wide Web as the author of the crackpot index.

== Education ==
John C. Baez attended Princeton University where he graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1982; his senior thesis was titled &quot;Recursivity in quantum mechanics&quot;, under the supervision of John P. Burgess.
He earned his doctorate in 1986 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the direction of Irving Segal.

== Career ==
Baez was a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University. Since 1989, he has been a faculty member at UC Riverside. From 2010 to 2012, he was a visiting professor at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore and continued working there in the summers until at least 2016.

=== Research ===
His research includes work on spin foams in loop quantum gravity. He also worked on applications of higher categories to physics, such as the cobordism hypothesis. He has also dedicated many efforts towards applied category theory, including network theory.

=== Recognition ===
Baez won the 2013 Levi L. Conant Prize for his expository paper with John Huerta, &quot;The algebra of grand unified theories&quot;. He was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, in the 2022 class of fellows, &quot;for contributions to higher category theory and mathematical physics, and for popularization of these subjects&quot;.

=== Forums ===
Baez is the author of &quot;This Week&#x27;s Finds in Mathematical Physics&quot;, an irregular column on the internet featuring mathematical exposition and criticism. He started &quot;This Week&#x27;s Finds&quot; in 1993 for the Usenet community, and it now has a following in its new form, the blog &quot;Azimuth&quot;. &quot;This Week&#x27;s Finds&quot; anticipated the concept of a personal weblog. Baez creates blog posts about topics or questions he wants to understand more through his column publishings. &quot;Azimuth&quot; also covers other topics that include combating climate change and various other environmental issues.

He is also co-founder of the n&quot;-Category Café (or n&quot;-Café), a group blog concerning higher category theory and its applications, as well as its philosophical repercussions. The founders of the blog are Baez, David Corfield and Urs Schreiber, and the list of blog authors has extended since. The &quot;n&quot;-Café community is associated with the &quot;n&quot;Lab wiki and &quot;n&quot;Forum forum, which now run independently of &quot;n&quot;-Café. It is hosted on The University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s official website.

== Family ==
Baez&#x27;s uncle Albert Baez was a physicist and a co-inventor of the X-ray microscope; Albert interested him in physics as a child. Through Albert, he is cousins with singers Joan Baez and Mimi Fariña. 

John Baez is married to Lisa Raphals who is a professor of Chinese and comparative literature from ancient Greece at UCR.

<text>An f-number is a measure of the light-gathering ability of an optical system such as a camera lens. It is calculated by dividing the system&#x27;s focal length by the diameter of the entrance pupil (&quot;clear aperture&quot;). The f-number is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or f-stop, and it is key in determining the depth of field, diffraction, and exposure of a photograph. The f-number is dimensionless and is usually expressed using a lower-case hooked f with the format &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is the f-number.

The f-number is also known as the inverse relative aperture, because it is the inverse of the relative aperture, defined as the aperture diameter divided by focal length. The relative aperture indicates how much light can pass through the lens at a given focal length. A lower f-number means a larger relative aperture and more light entering the system, while a higher f-number means a smaller relative aperture and less light entering the system. The f-number is related to the numerical aperture (NA) of the system, which measures the range of angles over which light can enter or exit the system. The numerical aperture takes into account the refractive index of the medium in which the system is working, while the f-number does not.

== Notation ==

The f-number is given by:

formula_1

where is the focal length, and is the diameter of the entrance pupil (&quot;effective aperture&quot;). It is customary to write f-numbers preceded by &quot;&quot;, which forms a mathematical expression of the entrance pupil&#x27;s diameter in terms of and . For example, if a lens&#x27;s focal length were and its entrance pupil&#x27;s diameter were , the f-number would be 2. This would be expressed as in a lens system. The aperture diameter would be equal to .

Camera lenses often include an adjustable diaphragm, which changes the size of the aperture stop and thus the entrance pupil size. This allows the user to vary the f-number as needed. The entrance pupil diameter is not necessarily equal to the aperture stop diameter, because of the magnifying effect of lens elements in front of the aperture.

Ignoring differences in light transmission efficiency, a lens with a greater f-number projects darker images. The brightness of the projected image (illuminance) relative to the brightness of the scene in the lens&#x27;s field of view (luminance) decreases with the square of the f-number. A focal length lens has an entrance pupil diameter of . A focal length lens has an entrance pupil diameter of . Since the area is proportional to the square of the pupil diameter, the amount of light admitted by the lens is four times that of the lens. To obtain the same photographic exposure, the exposure time must be reduced by a factor of four.

A focal length lens has an entrance pupil diameter of . The lens&#x27;s entrance pupil has four times the area of the lens&#x27;s entrance pupil, and thus collects four times as much light from each object in the lens&#x27;s field of view. But compared to the lens, the lens projects an image of each object twice as high and twice as wide, covering four times the area, and so both lenses produce the same illuminance at the focal plane when imaging a scene of a given luminance.

== Stops, f-stop conventions, and exposure ==

The word &quot;stop&quot; is sometimes confusing due to its multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The &quot;aperture stop&quot; is the aperture setting that limits the brightness of the image by restricting the input pupil size, while a &quot;field stop&quot; is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.

In photography, stops are also a &quot;unit&quot; used to quantify ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of one-half. The one-stop unit is also known as the EV (exposure value) unit. On a camera, the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as f-stops. Each &quot;stop&quot; is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a halving of the light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of 1/ or about 0.7071, and hence a halving of the area of the pupil.

Most modern lenses use a standard f-stop scale, which is an approximately geometric sequence of numbers that corresponds to the sequence of the powers of the square root of 2: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc. Each element in the sequence is one stop lower than the element to its left, and one stop higher than the element to its right. The values of the ratios are rounded off to these particular conventional numbers, to make them easier to remember and write down.
The sequence above is obtained by approximating the following exact geometric sequence:

formula_2
In the same way as one f-stop corresponds to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of &quot;reciprocity&quot;. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where there is reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.

Photographers sometimes express other exposure ratios in terms of &#x27;stops&#x27;. Ignoring the f-number markings, the f-stops make a logarithmic scale of exposure intensity. Given this interpretation, one can then think of taking a half-step along this scale, to make an exposure difference of a &quot;half stop&quot;.

=== Fractional stops ===
Most twentieth-century cameras had a continuously variable aperture, using an iris diaphragm, with each full stop marked. Click-stopped aperture came into common use in the 1960s; the aperture scale usually had a click stop at every whole and half stop.

On modern cameras, especially when aperture is set on the camera body, f-number is often divided more finely than steps of one stop. Steps of one-third stop ( EV) are the most common, since this matches the ISO system of film speeds. Half-stop steps are used on some cameras. Usually the full stops are marked, and the intermediate positions click but are not marked. As an example, the aperture that is one-third stop smaller than is , two-thirds smaller is , and one whole stop smaller is . The next few f-stops in this sequence are:

formula_3

To calculate the steps in a full stop (1 EV) one could use

formula_4

The steps in a half stop ( EV) series would be

formula_5

The steps in a third stop ( EV) series would be

formula_6

As in the earlier DIN and ASA film-speed standards, the ISO speed is defined only in one-third stop increments, and shutter speeds of digital cameras are commonly on the same scale in reciprocal seconds. A portion of the ISO range is the sequence

formula_7

while shutter speeds in reciprocal seconds have a few conventional differences in their numbers (, , and second instead of , , and ).

In practice the maximum aperture of a lens is often not an integral power of (i.e., to the power of a whole number), in which case it is usually a half or third stop above or below an integral power of .

Modern electronically controlled interchangeable lenses, such as those used for SLR cameras, have f-stops specified internally in -stop increments, so the cameras&#x27; -stop settings are approximated by the nearest -stop setting in the lens.

Sometimes the same number is included on several scales; for example, an aperture of may be used in either a half-stop
or a one-third-stop system;
sometimes and and other differences are used for the one-third stop scale.

=== H-stop ===

An H-stop (for hole, by convention written with capital letter H) is an f-number equivalent for effective exposure based on the area covered by the holes in the diffusion discs or sieve aperture found in Rodenstock Imagon lenses.

=== T-stop ===

A T-stop (for transmission stops, by convention written with capital letter T) is an f-number adjusted to account for light transmission efficiency (&quot;transmittance&quot;). A lens with a T-stop of projects an image of the same brightness as an ideal lens with 100% transmittance and an f-number of . A particular lens&#x27;s T-stop, , is given by dividing the f-number by the square root of the transmittance of that lens:
formula_9
For example, an lens with transmittance of 75% has a T-stop of 2.3:
formula_10
Since real lenses have transmittances of less than 100%, a lens&#x27;s T-stop number is always greater than its f-number.

With 8% loss per air-glass surface on lenses without coating, multicoating of lenses is the key in lens design to decrease transmittance losses of lenses. Some reviews of lenses do measure the T-stop or transmission rate in their benchmarks. T-stops are sometimes used instead of f-numbers to more accurately determine exposure, particularly when using external light meters. Lens transmittances of 60%–95% are typical. T-stops are often used in cinematography, where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable. Cinema camera lenses are typically calibrated in T-stops instead of f-numbers. In still photography, without the need for rigorous consistency of all lenses and cameras used, slight differences in exposure are less important; however, T-stops are still used in some kinds of special-purpose lenses such as Smooth Trans Focus lenses by Minolta and Sony.

=== ASA/ISO numbers ===
Photographic film&#x27;s and electronic camera sensor&#x27;s sensitivity to light is often specified using ASA/ISO numbers. Both systems have a linear number where a doubling of sensitivity is represented by a doubling of the number, and a logarithmic number. In the ISO system, a 3° increase in the logarithmic number corresponds approximately to a doubling of sensitivity. Doubling or halving the sensitivity is equal to a difference of one T-stop in terms of light transmittance.

=== Gain ===

Most electronic cameras allow the user to adjust the amplification of the signal coming from the image sensor. This amplification is usually called gain and is measured in decibels. A of gain is roughly equivalent to one T-stop in terms of light transmittance. Many camcorders have a unified control over the lens f-number and gain. In this case, starting from (arbitrarily defined) zero gain and a fully open iris, one can either increase the f-number by reducing the iris size while gain remains zero, or increase the gain while the iris remains fully open.

=== Sunny 16 rule ===
An example of the use of f-numbers in photography is the &quot;sunny 16 rule&quot;: an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day by using an aperture of and the shutter speed closest to the reciprocal of the ISO speed of the film; for example, using ISO 200 film, an aperture of and a shutter speed of second. The f-number may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light. Selecting a lower f-number is &quot;opening up&quot; the lens. Selecting a higher f-number is &quot;closing&quot; or &quot;stopping down&quot; the lens.

== Effects on image sharpness ==

Depth of field increases with f-number, as illustrated in the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, with the rest of the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality known as &#x27;bokeh&#x27;) can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer&#x27;s focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr&#x27;s method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers (and thus potentially more difficult or complex optics) when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.

Beyond focus, image sharpness is related to f-number through two different optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, and diffraction which is due to the wave nature of light. The blur-optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having six or seven elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around –, while for older standard lenses having only four elements (Tessar formula) stopping to will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. At small apertures, depth of field and aberrations are improved, but diffraction creates more spreading of the light, causing blur.

Light falloff is also sensitive to f-stop. Many wide-angle lenses will show a significant light falloff (vignetting) at the edges for large apertures.

Photojournalists have a saying, &quot;and be there&quot;, meaning that being on the scene is more important than worrying about technical details. Practically, (in 35 mm and larger formats) allows adequate depth of field and sufficient lens speed for a decent base exposure in most daylight situations.

== Human eye ==

Computing the f-number of the human eye involves computing the physical aperture and focal length of the eye. Typically, the pupil can dilate to be as large as 6–7 mm in darkness, which translates into the maximal physical aperture. Some individuals&#x27; pupils can dilate to over 9 mm wide.

The f-number of the human eye varies from about in a very brightly lit place to about in the dark. Computing the focal length requires that the light-refracting properties of the liquids in the eye be taken into account. Treating the eye as an ordinary air-filled camera and lens results in an incorrect focal length and f-number.

== Focal ratio in telescopes ==
In astronomy, the f-number is commonly referred to as the &quot;focal ratio&quot; (or &quot;f-ratio&quot;) notated as formula_11. It is still defined as the focal length formula_12 of an objective divided by its diameter formula_13 or by the diameter of an aperture stop in the system:

formula_14

Even though the principles of focal ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) is a function of absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.

For example, the SOAR four-meter telescope has a small field of view (about ) which is useful for stellar studies. The LSST 8.4 m telescope, which will cover the entire sky every three days, has a very large field of view. Its short 10.3 m focal length () is made possible by an error correction system which includes secondary and tertiary mirrors, a three element refractive system and active mounting and optics.

== Camera equation (G#) ==

The camera equation, or G#, is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens:

formula_15

where is the transmission coefficient of the lens, and the units are in inverse steradians (sr−1).

== Working f-number ==
The f-number accurately describes the light-gathering ability of a lens only for objects an infinite distance away. This limitation is typically ignored in photography, where f-number is often used regardless of the distance to the object. In optical design, an alternative is often needed for systems where the object is not far from the lens. In these cases the working f-number is used. The working f-number is given by:

formula_16

where is the uncorrected f-number, is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens, formula_17 is the absolute value of the lens&#x27;s magnification for an object a particular distance away, and is the pupil magnification. Since the pupil magnification is seldom known it is often assumed to be 1, which is the correct value for all symmetric lenses.

In photography this means that as one focuses closer, the lens&#x27;s effective aperture becomes smaller, making the exposure darker. The working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor. This is of particular importance in macro photography.

== History ==
The system of f-numbers for specifying relative apertures evolved in the late nineteenth century, in competition with several other systems of aperture notation.

=== Origins of relative aperture ===
In 1867, Sutton and Dawson defined &quot;apertal ratio&quot; as essentially the reciprocal of the modern f-number. In the following quote, an &quot;apertal ratio&quot; of &quot;&quot; is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop:

In every lens there is, corresponding to a given apertal ratio (that is, the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6-inch focus, with a in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the &#x27;focal range&#x27; of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms &#x27;apertal ratio&#x27; and &#x27;focal range&#x27; have not come into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.

In 1874, John Henry Dallmeyer called the ratio formula_18 the &quot;intensity ratio&quot; of a lens:

The &quot;rapidity&quot; of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus. To ascertain this, divide the &quot;equivalent focus&quot; by the diameter of the actual &quot;working aperture&quot; of the lens in question; and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1, or unity, for the numerator. Thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus, divide the focus by the aperture, or 6 divided by 2 equals 3; i.e., is the intensity ratio.

Although he did not yet have access to Ernst Abbe&#x27;s theory of stops and pupils, which was made widely available by Siegfried Czapski in 1893, Dallmeyer knew that his &quot;working aperture&quot; was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop:

It must be observed, however, that in order to find the real &quot;intensity ratio&quot;, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted &quot;between&quot; the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.

This point is further emphasized by Czapski in 1893. According to an English review of his book, in 1894, &quot;The necessity of clearly distinguishing between effective aperture and diameter of physical stop is strongly insisted upon.&quot;

J. H. Dallmeyer&#x27;s son, Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer, inventor of the telephoto lens, followed the &quot;intensity ratio&quot; terminology in 1899.

=== Aperture numbering systems ===
At the same time, there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture, rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio. But these systems all involved some arbitrary constant, as opposed to the simple ratio of focal length and diameter.

For example, the &quot;Uniform System&quot; (U.S.) of apertures was adopted as a standard by the Photographic Society of Great Britain in the 1880s. Bothamley in 1891 said &quot;The stops of all the best makers are now arranged according to this system.&quot; U.S. 16 is the same aperture as , but apertures that are larger or smaller by a full stop use doubling or halving of the U.S. number, for example is U.S. 8 and is U.S. 4. The exposure time required is directly proportional to the U.S. number. Eastman Kodak used U.S. stops on many of their cameras at least in the 1920s.

By 1895, Hodges contradicts Bothamley, saying that the f-number system has taken over: &quot;This is called the system, and the diaphragms of all modern lenses of good construction are so marked.&quot;

Here is the situation as seen in 1899:
Piper in 1901 discusses five different systems of aperture marking: the old and new Zeiss systems based on actual intensity (proportional to reciprocal square of the f-number); and the U.S., C.I., and Dallmeyer systems based on exposure (proportional to square of the f-number). He calls the f-number the &quot;ratio number&quot;, &quot;aperture ratio number&quot;, and &quot;ratio aperture&quot;. He calls expressions like the &quot;fractional diameter&quot; of the aperture, even though it is literally equal to the &quot;absolute diameter&quot; which he distinguishes as a different term. He also sometimes uses expressions like &quot;an aperture of f 8&quot; without the division indicated by the slash.

Beck and Andrews in 1902 talk about the Royal Photographic Society standard of , , , , etc. The R.P.S. had changed their name and moved off of the U.S. system some time between 1895 and 1902.

=== Typographical standardization ===

By 1920, the term &quot;f-number&quot; appeared in books both as &quot;F number&quot; and &quot;f/number&quot;. In modern publications, the forms &quot;f-number&quot; and &quot;f number&quot; are more common, though the earlier forms, as well as &quot;F-number&quot; are still found in a few books; not uncommonly, the initial lower-case &quot;f&quot; in &quot;f-number&quot; or &quot;f/number&quot; is set in a hooked italic form: ƒ.

Notations for f-numbers were also quite variable in the early part of the twentieth century. They were sometimes written with a capital F, sometimes with a dot (period) instead of a slash, and sometimes set as a vertical fraction.

The 1961 ASA standard PH2.12-1961 &quot;American Standard General-Purpose Photographic Exposure Meters (Photoelectric Type)&quot; specifies that &quot;The symbol for relative apertures shall be or followed by the effective ƒ-number.&quot; They show the hooked italic &#x27;ƒ&#x27; not only in the symbol, but also in the term &quot;f-number&quot;, which today is more commonly set in an ordinary non-italic face.

<doc id="168245" wikidata="Q669759" url="?curid=168245" title="Moby Grape">
<text>Moby Grape is an American rock band founded in 1966. Part of San Francisco&#x27;s psychedelic music scene, the band merged elements of rock and roll, folk music, pop, blues, and country. They were one of the few groups of which all members were lead vocalists and songwriters. The group&#x27;s first incarnation ended in 1969, in part due to members Bob Mosley and Skip Spence suffering from mental illness. The group has reformed many times afterwards and continues to perform occasionally. 

Moby Grape&#x27;s success was accompanied by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz. Legal difficulties originated shortly after the group&#x27;s formation, when Katz insisted on ownership of the group name. The dispute with Katz became more acute after the group members&#x27; rights to their songs were signed away in 1973, in a settlement made without their knowledge.

As described by Jeff Tamarkin, &quot;The Grape&#x27;s saga is one of squandered potential, absurdly misguided decisions, bad luck, blunders and excruciating heartbreak, all set to the tune of some of the greatest rock and roll ever to emerge from San Francisco. Moby Grape could have had it all, but they ended up with nothing, and less.&quot;

==Career==
===1966–1967===
The group was formed in September 1966 in San Francisco at the instigation of Skip Spence and Matthew Katz. Both had previously been associated with Jefferson Airplane, Spence as the band&#x27;s first drummer, playing on their first album, &quot;Jefferson Airplane Takes Off&quot;, and Katz as the band&#x27;s manager, but the group had dismissed both of them. Katz encouraged Spence to form a band similar to Jefferson Airplane, with varied songwriting and vocal work by several group members, and with Katz as the manager. According to band member Peter Lewis, &quot;Matthew (Katz) brought the spirit of conflict into the band. He didn&#x27;t want it to be an equal partnership. He wanted it all.&quot; At the time, various group members were indebted to Katz, who had been paying for apartments and various living costs prior to the release of the group&#x27;s first album. Despite objecting, group members signed without seeking outside legal advice, believing in part that there would be no further financial support from Katz unless they did so. Neil Young, then of Buffalo Springfield, was in the room at the time, and kept his head down, playing his guitar, and saying nothing. According to Peter Lewis, &quot;I think Neil knew, even then, that this was the end. We had bought into this process that we should have known better than to buy into.&quot;

The band name, chosen by Bob Mosley and Spence, came from the punch line of the joke &quot;What&#x27;s big and purple and lives in the ocean?&quot; Lead guitarist Jerry Miller and drummer Don Stevenson (both formerly of the Frantics, originally based in Seattle) joined guitarist (and son of actress Loretta Young) Peter Lewis (of the Cornells), bassist Bob Mosley (of the Misfits, based in San Diego), and Spence, now on guitar instead of drums. Miller and Stevenson had moved the Frantics from Seattle to San Francisco after a 1965 meeting with Jerry Garcia, then playing with the Warlocks at a bar in Belmont, California. Garcia encouraged them to move to San Francisco. Once the Frantics were settled in San Francisco, Mosley joined the band.

While Miller was the principal lead guitarist, all three guitarists played lead at various points, often playing off against each other, in a guitar form associated with Moby Grape as &quot;crosstalk&quot;. The other major three-guitar band at the time was Buffalo Springfield. Moby Grape&#x27;s music has been described by Geoffrey Parr as follows: &quot;No rock and roll group has been able to use a guitar trio as effectively as Moby Grape did on &quot;Moby Grape&quot;. Spence played a distinctive rhythm guitar that really sticks out throughout the album. Lewis, meanwhile, was a very good guitar player overall and was excellent at finger picking, as is evident in several songs. And then there is Miller. The way they crafted their parts and played together on Moby Grape is like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life. The guitars are like a collage of sound that makes perfect sense.&quot;

All band members wrote songs and sang lead and backup vocals for their debut album, &quot;Moby Grape&quot; (1967). Mosley, Lewis, and Spence generally wrote alone, while Miller and Stevenson generally wrote together. In 2003, &quot;Moby Grape&quot; was ranked at number 121 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Noted rock critic Robert Christgau listed it as one of the 40 &quot;Essential Albums of 1967&quot;. In 2008, Spence&#x27;s song &quot;Omaha&quot;, from the first Moby Grape album, was listed as number 95 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;. The song was described as follows:
On their best single, Jerry Miller, Peter Lewis and Skip Spence compete in a three-way guitar battle for two and a quarter red-hot minutes, each of them charging at Spence&#x27;s song from different angles, no one yielding to anyone else.&quot;

In a marketing stunt, Columbia Records immediately released five singles at once, and the band was perceived as being over-hyped. This was during a period in which mainstream record labels heavily promoted what were then considered counter-cultural music genres. The record was critically acclaimed and fairly successful commercially, with The Move covering the album&#x27;s &quot;Hey Grandma&quot; (a Miller-Stevenson composition) on their self-titled first album. More recently, &quot;Hey Grandma&quot; was included in the soundtrack to the 2005 Sean Penn-Nicole Kidman film, &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, as well as being covered in 2009 by the Black Crowes, on &quot;Warpaint Live&quot;. Spence&#x27;s &quot;Omaha&quot; was the only one of the five singles to chart, reaching number 88 in the US in 1967 and number 87 in Canada. Miller-Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;8:05&quot; became a country rock standard (covered by Robert Plant, Guy Burlage, and others).

One of Moby Grape&#x27;s earliest major onstage performances was the Mantra-Rock Dance — a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. At the event Moby Grape performed along with the Bhaktivedanta Swami, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, beat poet Allen Ginsberg, and fellow rock bands Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company donating proceeds to the temple. The group appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967. Due to legal and managerial disputes, the group was not included in the D.A. Pennebaker-produced film of the event, &quot;Monterey Pop&quot;. Moby Grape&#x27;s Monterey recordings and film remain unreleased, allegedly because Katz demanded one million dollars for the rights. According to Lewis, &quot;[Katz] told Lou Adler they had to pay us a million bucks to film us at the Monterey Pop Festival. So instead of putting us on Saturday night right before Otis Redding, they wound up putting us on at sunset on Friday when there was nobody in the place.&quot;

The Moby Grape footage was shown in 2007 as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the film. Miller recalled that Laura Nyro was given Moby Grape&#x27;s original position opening for Redding, &quot;because everybody was arguing. Nobody wanted to play first and I said that would be fine for me.&quot; In addition to the marketing backlash, band members found themselves in legal trouble for charges (later dropped) of consorting with underage girls, and the band&#x27;s relationship with their manager rapidly deteriorated.

===1968===
The second album, &quot;Wow/Grape Jam&quot;, released in 1968, was generally viewed as a critical and commercial disappointment, even though the album charted at No. 20 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts, partially due to the special low price double-album packaging. The album included the track &quot;Just Like Gene Autry, a Foxtrot&quot;, a tribute to the big band era which was tracked to only be played back properly at the speed of 78 RPM. The &quot;Grape Jam&quot; LP was one of loose, improvised studio jams with outside musicians. Also in 1968, the band contributed to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;The Sweet Ride&quot;, and appeared, credited, in the film.

The band was also introduced to a wide group of UK listeners in 1968 through the inclusion of &quot;Can&#x27;t Be So Bad&quot;, from the &quot;Wow&quot; album, on the sampler album&quot; The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot; (CBS).

But, amidst this success, troubled times plagued the band when founding member Spence began abusing LSD, which led to increasingly erratic behavior. According to Miller: &quot;Skippy changed radically when we were in New York. There were some people there (he met) who were into harder drugs and a harder lifestyle, and some very weird shit. And so he kind of flew off with those people. Skippy kind of disappeared for a little while. Next time we saw him, he had cut off his beard, and was wearing a black leather jacket, with his chest hanging out, with some chains and just sweating like a son of a gun. I don&#x27;t know what the hell he got a hold of, man, but it just whacked him. And the next thing I know, he axed my door down in the Albert Hotel. They said at the reception area that this crazy guy had held an ax to the doorman&#x27;s head.&quot; After spending time in the infamous Tombs jail in New York, Spence was committed to New York&#x27;s Bellevue Hospital, where he spent six months under psychiatric care.

Recalling this troubled time for Spence, Lewis said, &quot;We had to do (the album) in New York because the producer (David Rubinson) wanted to be with his family. So we had to leave our families and spend months at a time in hotel rooms in New York City. Finally I just quit and went back to California. I got a phone call after a couple of days. They&#x27;d played a Fillmore East gig without me, and Skippy took off with some black witch afterward who fed him full of acid. It was like that scene in The Doors movie. He thought he was the anti-Christ. He tried to chop down the hotel room door with a fire axe to kill Don [Stevenson] to save him from himself. He went up to the 52nd floor of the CBS building where they had to wrestle him to the ground. And Rubinson pressed charges against him. They took him to the Tombs (and then to Bellevue) and that&#x27;s where he wrote &quot;Oar&quot;. When he got out of there, he cut that album in Nashville. And that was the end of his career. They shot him full of Thorazine for six months. They just take you out of the game.&quot;

===1969–1970===
After the forced departure of Spence, the remaining four members continued recording throughout 1968 and released &quot;Moby Grape &#x27;69&quot; in January 1969. Spence&#x27;s &quot;Seeing&quot; (also known as &quot;Skip&#x27;s Song&quot;) was finished by the foursome, and it is one of the highlights. Despite the collaborative effort to complete the song, the songwriting credit was left solely with Spence. After a tour of the UK and the Netherlands in February 1969 as a four piece, Bob Mosley left the group, shocking the remaining members by joining the Marines. The remaining three released their final album for Columbia, &quot;Truly Fine Citizen&quot;, in late 1969, with session bassist Bob Moore filling in for the departed Mosley during the sessions for the album. &quot;Truly Fine Citizen&quot; would be the final work conducted by the band prior to their initial dissolution.

Miller and Stevenson then formed The Rhythm Dukes, later joined by Bill Champlin. The band achieved a degree of success as a second-billed act during much of the latter part of 1969 to 1971, and recorded one album, not released until 2005.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1971, the original five members reunited and, along with violinist Gordon Stevens, recorded &quot;20 Granite Creek&quot; for Reprise Records. The group performed a few concerts to support the album, most notably during the last days of the Fillmore East before Spence left and the group broke up. These concerts were described by contemporary accounts as disastrous, and circulating recordings do little to challenge that assessment. These shows are noteworthy, however, due to their inclusion of original material that did not appear on their albums proper. Mosley contributed &quot;When You&#x27;re Down The Road&quot; and &quot;Just A Woman&quot;, Lewis &quot;There Is No Reason&quot;, and Spence brought along a song referred to as &quot;We Don&#x27;t Know Now&quot; (a misinterpretation of Miller on an audience recording telling them that they were &quot;going to do Omaha now&quot; before launching into the song) and &quot;Sailing&quot;, a song which would be all but forgotten until Spence performed it with Moby Grape at a 1996 gig near Spence&#x27;s home in Santa Cruz, California, at the Palookaville nightclub. They also performed songs cut for &quot;20 Granite Creek&quot;. A Fillmore East gig saw Mosley doing an a capella rendition of &quot;Ode To The Man At The End of The Bar&quot;.

Following the departure of Spence, and the band&#x27;s consequent dissolution, the band reformed several times over the following years; featuring different combinations of the members. In 1973, Lewis, Miller, and Mosley reformed the band for some live shows; with guitarist Jeff Blackburn and drummer Johnny Craviotto filling the roles vacated by Spence and Stevenson. Following the end of the shows in 1975, Miller, Mosley, and Craviotto were joined by Michael Been (later of The Call), under the name Fine Wine, and recorded an LP under the same name on Polydor Records in Germany in 1976. Following the end of Fine Wine, Mosley and Craviotto joined with Jeff Blackburn and Neil Young to form The Ducks, which played in and around the Santa Cruz area during 1977, and were popular during the band&#x27;s brief life; whilst Miller and Been went on to form The Original Haze, also originating around the Santa Cruz area, before joining Lewis and Spence in another reformation of Moby Grape; this time joined by keyboardist/sax Cornelius Bumpus, drummers John Oxendine and Daniel Spencer, and bassist Chris Powell. The band released 1978&#x27;s &quot;Live Grape&quot; album on Escape Records before again splitting in 1979.

The 1980s saw the band reform again on two occasions; firstly in 1983 with a line-up consisting of Lewis, Miller, Mosley, and Stevenson, which released the &quot;Moby Grape &#x27;84&quot; album before dissolving in 1984. Then, in February 1987, the full original line-up of Moby Grape, along with It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day, Fraternity of Man, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock, got together for a couple of shows. They performed their debut tunes &quot;Hey Grandma&quot;, &quot;Naked, If I Want To&quot;, &quot;Omaha&quot;, &quot;Fall on You&quot;, and &quot;8:05&quot;, among others, before fans at the Marin Civic and Cupertino&#x27;s DeAnza College. Following these shows Spence departed the band (for the final time), and his role within the group was filled by Dan Abernathy for recording and touring purposes.

Due to continued legal battle between the band and Matthew Katz over ownership of the &quot;Moby Grape&quot; name, other names were used during this period for performance or recording purposes; including Mosley Grape, Legendary Grape, Maby Grope, the previously used Fine Wine, and The Melvilles. This led to the band&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Legendary Grape&quot; album being considered by some to be a Melvilles recording, as, while it was originally issued as a Moby Grape cassette-only release, the tape eventually had to be withdrawn due to pressure from Katz&#x27;s legal team; and it was subsequently repackaged and reissued as being by The Melvilles. Despite Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Peter Lewis continuing to release solo records in the 1990s and 2000s, Moby Grape has not released an album of new material since the release of &quot;Legendary Grape&quot; in 1989. Jerry Miller considers the 2003 remastered and supplemented CD version of &quot;Legendary Grape&quot; to be an essential Moby Grape album.

===1990s–2000s===
The debut album and &quot;Wow/Grape Jam&quot; were first released on CD during the late 1980s by the San Francisco Sound label, a company owned by their former manager, Matthew Katz. These releases suffer from mediocre sound and poor quality packaging. It is also contended that Moby Grape has never been properly compensated for recordings released by this label. The double CD 1993 Legacy Recordings compilation &quot;Vintage: The Very Best of Moby Grape&quot; includes their entire first album and most of &quot;Moby Grape &#x27;69&quot;, selected tracks from &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Truly Fine Citizen&quot;, as well as studio outtakes and alternate versions, in much better quality. This compilation attracted new attention to the band and helped introduce their music to a new audience. In 1994, the group members commenced an action against Matthew Katz, Columbia Records and parent company Sony Music, seeking to have the settlement overturned. This settlement from 1973 meant that the group members would receive no royalties whatsoever from &quot;Vintage&quot;.

The band had folded again in 1991 due to the deteriorating emotional state of Bob Mosley; who ultimately ended up being homeless in San Diego. This led Lewis, Miller, and Stevenson to regroup with Mosley and reform the band in 1996 as a means to help him resolve his problems; with health problems preventing Skip Spence from also joining the band. Spence lived in a residential care facility in northern California, and despite an extended period of homelessness and suffering from mental illness, there was a marked improvement in his domestic life in his later years before he died from lung cancer in 1999, two days before his 53rd birthday.

===2000s–present===
Amid the ongoing legal proceedings between Moby Grape and Katz, the surviving members of the band decided to dissolve the group once again in 2001. Finally, in 2006, and after three decades of court battles, the band finally won back its name; and subsequently reformed. As described in 1998 by David LaFlamme of It&#x27;s A Beautiful Day, &quot;Yes (Moby Grape) did, eventually they did win their case. In that case and in the (Jefferson) Airplane case, in both cases, the judge determined that (Matthew Katz) did business in a fraudulent and deceptive manner and that over the years he had continued to, what they call, &#x27;muddy the water&#x27; by continually firing attorneys, making postponements and that these decisions could have been made years ago but he was making it impossible for that to happen. Now they have regained the rights to their songs and so on. Thank God. But most of the money that he has made doing to them what he has been doing to me is money he has already made. You can&#x27;t get that. It&#x27;s gone! It&#x27;s gone!&quot; To celebrate, in September 2007, a reunited Moby Grape performed for over 40,000 fans at the Summer of Love 40th Anniversary Celebration in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. In October 2007, Sundazed Music reissued Moby Grape&#x27;s first five albums (with bonus tracks) on CD and vinyl. The following month, the label was forced to both withdraw and recall &quot;Moby Grape&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Grape Jam&quot; from print on both vinyl and CD because of a new lawsuit by former manager Katz. Sundazed stated on their website that they were directed to withdraw the three titles by Sony, from whom Sundazed had licensed the recordings. Following the reunion performance, Stevenson departed the band and semi-retired from the music industry. Moby Grape continues to perform occasionally, performing with core members Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Peter Lewis, and in such incarnations as with Skip Spence&#x27;s son Omar joining on vocals and Jerry Miller&#x27;s son Joseph on drums. New recording commenced in 2009, following the release of &quot;The Place and the Time&quot;, a well-received collection of demos, outtakes, alternate versions and otherwise unreleased material from the band&#x27;s 1960s recording period.

In 2018 a detailed biography - &quot;What&#x27;s Big And Purple And Lives In The Ocean?: The Moby Grape Story&quot; by Cam Cobb was published in the U.S. and the U.K. by Jawbone.

Matthew Katz died on September 30, 2023, at the age of 93.

Guitarist and co-founder Jerry Miller died on July 20, 2024, at the age of 81.

===Later releases===
Subsequent to the withdrawal of &quot;Vintage&quot;, Sony released &quot;Cross Talk: The Best of Moby Grape&quot; (2004), followed by &quot;Listen My Friends! The Best of Moby Grape&quot; (2007). &quot;Legendary Grape&quot; was issued for the first time in CD by Dig Music in 2003. In 2009, Sundazed Music issued &quot;The Place and the Time&quot;, a two-disc collection of alternate takes, live versions and other previously unreleased material.
In February 2010, Sundazed released the First Official Live Moby Grape &#x27;Live&#x27; Album on Vinyl and Compact Disc formats.

===Tribute albums===
Moby Grape has been the subject of five fan-initiated tribute albums, whereby Moby Grape songs are covered by fans of the band. The series commenced with &quot;Mo&#x27;Grape&quot; (2000) and &quot;Even Mo&#x27;Grape&quot; (2002) and has been followed by &quot;Still Mo&#x27; Grape,&quot; &quot;Forever Mo&quot; and &quot;Just Say Mo&quot;.

==Work outside of Moby Grape==

Lewis, Miller, Mosley and Stevenson continued to perform and record, contributing to various artist&#x27;s projects. 

Peter Lewis released a debut CD in 1995 and formed an acoustic duo with David West (released &quot;Live in Bremen&quot;, 2003). Lewis also spent three years (2000–2003) as a guitarist with the reformed Electric Prunes, contributing to the band&#x27;s &quot;Artifact&quot; album (2002).

Jerry Miller appeared as both a solo artist and as a member of the Jerry Miller Band, and played regularly prior to his death in 2024 in the Seattle/Tacoma, Washington area.

Bob Mosley&#x27;s relocation to the Santa Cruz area was noteworthy for weekly guest appearances with country music artist Larry Hosford, and in occasional duos with ex-Doobie Brothers keyboardist Dale Ockerman. Don Stevenson, who has rejoined Moby Grape for occasional performances, has developed business interests outside of the music industry, including time share sales of recreational property in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, where he maintains a residence.

In 2010, Don Stevenson, Jerry Miller and Omar Spence performed at the South by Southwest music festival (the performance at the Dirty Dog was recorded by Eric Sigsbey), while Peter Lewis appeared separately.

<text>Moving Sidewalks were an American rock band formed in 1966 from Houston, Texas. They released several singles and an album, before bassist Don Summers and keyboardist Tom Moore were drafted into the army, bringing the band to an end. Vocalist/guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell then formed band ZZ Top.

==History==
Gibbons founded Moving Sidewalks in the mid-1960s and they quickly drew a large following, especially among the Houston &quot;teen scene&quot;. They recorded several singles and one full-length album, &quot;Flash&quot;. Their single &quot;99th Floor&quot; was well received, and topped the charts at No. 1 in Houston for six weeks. The success of this record led them to sign with Wand Records, which then released &quot;Need Me&quot;, also a Top 10 hit for the band. The group was asked to open for many rock tours, including Jimi Hendrix and the Doors.

After Tom Moore and Don Summers were drafted into the United States Army, Gibbons and Mitchell added Lanier Greig and formed the original ZZ Top.

While attending Warner Brothers&#x27; art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including the Saints, Billy G &amp; the Blueflames, and the Coachmen. By 1967, Gibbons returned to Houston and formed an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators. &#x27;The Moving Sidewalks&#x27; name was chosen, and shortly thereafter they recorded &quot;99th Floor&quot;. Around this time Gibbons developed a camaraderie with Jimi Hendrix. As a guest on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Hendrix deflected the implication that he was the greatest guitarist. He did not say who the greatest guitarist was, but a myth has circulated that Hendrix considered Gibbons the best, and stated so in an interview, but no such interview has ever been located.

The Moving Sidewalks continued to appear along with the 13th Floor Elevators at the short-lived yet Houston psychedelic venue, Love Street Light Circus, at Allen&#x27;s Landing. One night, the Elevators set was cut short by Houston Police, who arrested the band&#x27;s lead singer Erickson for marijuana possession.

In January 2013, Gibbons announced the Moving Sidewalks would reunite with all original members for one show on March 30, 2013, at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club in New York City. Since that successful sold out show and despite their single show announcement, the band played as official headliners of Austin Psych Fest on May 1, 2013, and the Charity Gala for The Deacons of Deadwood Ball on September 28, 2013, in Houston.

<text>Edwin Fischer (6 October 1886 – 24 January 1960) was a Swiss classical pianist and conductor. He is regarded as one of the great interpreters of J.S. Bach and Mozart in the twentieth century.

==Biography==
Fischer was born in Basel and studied music first there with Hans Huber, and later in Berlin at the Stern Conservatory under Martin Krause. He first came to prominence as a pianist following World War I. In 1926, he became conductor of the Lübeck Musikverein and later conducted in Munich. In 1932, he formed his own chamber orchestra, and was one of the first to be interested in presenting music of the Baroque and Classical periods in a historically accurate way. Although his performances were not historically accurate by present-day standards, they were for his time; e.g., he did conduct Bach and Mozart concertos from the keyboard, an unusual practice at that time.

In 1932, he returned once again to Berlin, succeeding Artur Schnabel in a teaching role at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik, who had emigrated from Germany because of increasing anti-Semitism. In 1942, he moved back to Switzerland, temporarily putting his career on hold through World War II. After the war he began to perform again, and gave master classes in Lucerne for a number of later prominent pianists such as Alfred Brendel, Helena Sá e Costa, Mario Feninger, Reine Gianoli, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim.

As well as solo recitals, concerto performances and conducting, Fischer performed much chamber music. Particularly highly regarded was the piano trio he formed with the cellist Enrico Mainardi and the violinist Georg Kulenkampff (who was replaced by Wolfgang Schneiderhan after Kulenkampff&#x27;s death).

Fischer published a number of books on teaching, and one on the piano sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven. He also made a number of recordings, including the first complete recording of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; for EMI Records, recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936. Fischer&#x27;s historically important recordings have been reissued on CD by EMI and specialty labels such as APR, Music &amp; Arts, Pearl and Testament. Other classic recordings by Fischer include Bach keyboard concertos, miscellaneous solo Bach works such as the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, various sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven, Schubert&#x27;s Wanderer Fantasy and Impromptus, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; and Brahms&#x27; Second Piano Concerto, both conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Mozart concertos K. 453, 466, 482, 491 and 503, the last three conducted by John Barbirolli, Lawrance Collingwood and Josef Krips in 1935, 1937 and 1947 respectively.

Fischer also accompanied Elisabeth Schwarzkopf in a 1950s EMI LP of Schubert Lieder. His last musical collaboration was with the violinist Gioconda de Vito. During their recording sessions for the Johannes Brahms first and third violin sonatas, he had to go to London for medical treatment, where he was told he was seriously ill. He died shortly afterwards in Zürich. His body was cremated and his ashes buried at the Friedental cemetery in Lucerne.

<doc id="168254" wikidata="Q918576" url="?curid=168254" title="Paul Butterfield">
<text>Paul Vaughn Butterfield (December 17, 1942May 4, 1987) was an American blues harmonica player, singer, and bandleader. After early training as a classical flautist, he developed an interest in blues harmonica. He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters and other blues greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions. He soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts Nick Gravenites and Elvin Bishop.

In 1963, he formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which recorded several successful albums and was popular on the late-1960s concert and festival circuit, with performances at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, the Fillmore East in New York City, the Monterey Pop Festival, and Woodstock. The band was known for combining electric Chicago blues with a rock urgency. and for their pioneering jazz fusion performances and recordings. The band was also among the first racially integrated blues groups. After the breakup of the group in 1971, Butterfield continued to tour and record with the band Paul Butterfield&#x27;s Better Days, with his mentor Muddy Waters, and with members of the roots-rock group the Band. While still recording and performing, Butterfield died in 1987 at age 44 of an accidental drug overdose.

Music critics have acknowledged his development of an original approach that places him among the best-known blues harp players. In 2006, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. Butterfield and the early members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Both panels noted his harmonica skills and his contributions to bringing blues music to a younger and broader audience.

==Career==
Paul Vaughn Butterfield was born on December 17, 1942, in Chicago and raised in the city&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. The son of a lawyer and a painter, he attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school associated with the University of Chicago. Exposed to music at an early age, he studied classical flute with Walfrid Kujala, of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to Brown University. However, a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction. He met guitarist and singer songwriter Nick Gravenites, who shared an interest in authentic blues music. By the late 1950s, they were visiting blues clubs in Chicago, where musicians such as Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Little Walter, and Otis Rush encouraged them and occasionally let them sit in on jam sessions. The pair were soon performing as Nick and Paul in college-area coffee houses.

In the early 1960s, Butterfield met aspiring blues guitarist Elvin Bishop. Bishop recalled:

Eventually, Butterfield, on vocals and harmonica, and Bishop, accompanying him on guitar, were offered a regular gig at Big John&#x27;s, a folk club in the Old Town district on Chicago&#x27;s near North Side. With this booking, they persuaded bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s touring band) to form a group with them in 1963. Their engagement at the club was highly successful and brought the group to the attention of record producer Paul A. Rothchild.

===Paul Butterfield Blues Band===

During their engagement at Big John&#x27;s, Butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist Mike Bloomfield, who was also playing at the club. By chance, producer Rothchild witnessed one of their performances and was impressed by the chemistry between the two. He persuaded Butterfield to bring Bloomfield into the band, and they were signed to Elektra Records. Their first attempt to record an album, in December 1964, did not meet Rothchild&#x27;s expectations. To capture their sound better, Rothchild convinced Elektra president Jac Holzman to record a live album. In the spring of 1965, the Butterfield Blues Band was recorded at the Cafe Au Go Go in New York City. These recordings also failed to satisfy Rothchild, but the group&#x27;s appearances at the club brought them to the attention of the East Coast music community. Rothchild persuaded Holzman to agree to a third attempt at recording an album., securing the band more engagements outside of Chicago. At the last minute, the band was booked to perform at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1965. Maria Muldaur, with her husband Geoff, who later toured and recorded with Butterfield, recalled the group&#x27;s performance as stunning; it was the first time that many of the mostly folk-music fans had heard a high-powered electric blues combo. Among those who took notice was festival regular Bob Dylan, who invited the band to back him for his first live electric performance. With little rehearsal, Dylan performed a short, four-song set the next day with Bloomfield, Arnold, and Lay (along with Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg). The performance was not well received by some and generated a controversy, but it was a watershed event and brought the band to the attention of a much larger audience.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Paul Butterfield Blues Band&quot;, was released in 1965, reaching number 123 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. On March 28, 1966, Butterfield appeared on the CBS game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. At the end of his segment, he performed &quot;Born in Chicago&quot; with the house band. In August 1966, the band released their second album, &quot;East-West&quot;, which reached number 65 in the album chart.

In England in November 1966, Butterfield recorded several songs with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, who had recently finished the album &quot;A Hard Road&quot;. Butterfield and Mayall contributed vocals, and Butterfield&#x27;s Chicago-style blues harp was featured. Four songs were released in the UK on a 45-rpm EP, &quot;John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers with Paul Butterfield&quot;, in January 1967.

The Butterfield Blues Band changed its lineup, with Arnold and Davenport leaving the band, and Bloomfield going on to form his own group, Electric Flag. The band added bassist Bugsy Maugh, drummer Phillip Wilson, and saxophonists David Sanborn and Gene Dinwiddie. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw&quot;, in 1967. It was Butterfield&#x27;s highest-charting album, reaching number 52 on the album chart. Most of this lineup performed at the seminal Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;In My Own Dream&quot;, released in 1968, continued to move away from the band&#x27;s Chicago blues roots towards a more soul-influenced, horn-based sound, with Butterfield singing only three songs. It reached number 79 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. By the end of 1968, both Bishop and Naftalin had left the band. In April 1969, Butterfield took part in a concert at Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Theater and a subsequent recording session organized by record producer Norman Dayron, featuring Muddy Waters backed by Otis Spann, Mike Bloomfield, Sam Lay, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, and Buddy Miles. Such Waters warhorses as &quot;Forty Days and Forty Nights&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, and &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot; were recorded and later released on the album &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;. Waters commented, &quot;We did a lot of the things over we did with Little Walter and Jimmy Rogers and Elgin Evans on drums [an early configuration of Waters&#x27;s band] ... It&#x27;s about as close as I&#x27;ve been [to that feel] since I first recorded it&quot;. To one reviewer, these recordings represent Paul Butterfield&#x27;s best performances.

The Butterfield Blues Band was invited to perform at the Woodstock Festival on August 18, 1969. The band performed seven songs, and although its performance did not appear in the film &quot;Woodstock&quot;, one song, &quot;Love March&quot;, was included on the album &quot;&quot;, released in 1970. In 2009, Butterfield was included in the expanded &quot;40th Anniversary Edition Woodstock&quot; video, and an additional two songs appeared on the box set &quot;&quot;.

The album &quot;Keep On Moving&quot;, with only Butterfield remaining from the original lineup, was released in 1969. It was produced by veteran R&amp;B producer and songwriter Jerry Ragovoy, reportedly brought in by Elektra to turn out a &quot;breakout commercial hit&quot;. The album was not embraced by critics or long-time fans. It reached number 102 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

A live double album by the Butterfield Blues Band, &quot;Live&quot;, was recorded March 21–22, 1970, at The Troubadour, in West Hollywood, California. By this time, the band included a four-piece horn section in what has been described as a &quot;big-band Chicago blues with a jazz base&quot;.
After the release of another soul-influenced album, &quot;Sometimes I Just Feel Like Smilin&quot;&#x27; in 1971, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band disbanded. In 1972, a retrospective of their career, &quot;Golden Butter: The Best of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band&quot;, was released by Elektra.

===Better Days and solo===
After the breakup of the Butterfield Blues Band and no longer under contract with Elektra, Butterfield retreated to Woodstock, New York, where he eventually formed his next band, Paul Butterfield&#x27;s Better Days, with drummer Chris Parker, guitarist Amos Garrett, singer Geoff Muldaur, pianist Ronnie Barron and bassist Billy Rich. In 1972–1973, the group recorded the albums &quot;Paul Butterfield&#x27;s Better Days&quot; and &quot;It All Comes Back&quot;, released by Albert Grossman&#x27;s Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart. The band did not last to record a third studio album, but its album &quot;Live at Winterland Ballroom&quot;, recorded in 1973, was released in 1999.
Butterfield next pursued a solo career and appeared as a sideman in several different musical settings. In 1975, he again joined Muddy Waters to record Waters&#x27;s last album for Chess Records, &quot;The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album&quot;. The album was recorded at Levon Helm&#x27;s Woodstock studio with Garth Hudson and members of Waters&#x27;s touring band. In 1976, Butterfield performed at the Band&#x27;s final concert, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, accompanying the Band on the song &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and backing Muddy Waters on &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;. Butterfield kept up his association with former members of the Band, touring and recording with Levon Helm and the RCO All Stars in 1977 and touring with Rick Danko in 1979. A 1984 live performance with Danko and Richard Manuel was recorded and released as &quot;Live at the Lonestar&quot; in 2011.

As a solo act with backing musicians, Butterfield continued to tour and recorded &quot;Put It in Your Ear&quot; in 1976 and &quot;North South&quot; in 1981, with strings, synthesizers, and funk arrangements. In 1986, he released his final studio album, &quot;The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again&quot;, which was an attempt at a comeback with an updated rock sound. On April 15, 1987, he participated in the concert &quot;B.B. King &amp; Friends&quot;, with Eric Clapton, Etta James, Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others.

==Legacy==
Aside from &quot;rank[ing] among the most influential harp players in the Blues&quot;,
Butterfield has also been seen as pointing blues-based music in new, innovative directions. AllMusic critic Steve Huey commented,
In 2006, Butterfield was inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Blues Hall of Fame, which noted that &quot;the albums released by the Butterfield Blues Band brought Chicago Blues to a generation of Rock fans during the 1960s and paved the way for late 1960s electric groups like Cream&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 2015. The induction biography commented that &quot;the Butterfield Band converted the country-blues purists and turned on the Fillmore generation to the pleasures of Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Little Walter, Willie Dixon and Elmore James&quot;.

In 2017, a documentary titled &quot;Horn from the Heart: the Paul Butterfield Story&quot; premiered at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Directed by John Anderson and produced by Sandra Warren, it won the Outstanding Achievement Award in Filmmaking: Editing. In October 2018, the documentary was released nationally in select US theaters. It has received critical acclaim, including being named a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critic&#x27;s Pick, as well as features in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Harmonica style==
Like many Chicago blues harp players, Butterfield approached the instrument like a horn, preferring single notes to chords, and used it for soloing. His style has been described as &quot;always intense, understated, concise, and serious&quot;, and he was &quot;known for purity and intensity of his tone, his sustained breath control, and his unique ability to bend notes to his will&quot;. In his choice of notes he has been compared to Big Walter Horton, but he was never seen as an imitator of any particular harp player. Rather, he developed &quot;a style original and powerful enough to place him in the pantheon of true blues greats&quot;.

Butterfield played Hohner harmonicas (and endorsed them). He preferred the diatonic ten-hole Marine Band model. He wrote a harmonica instruction book, &quot;Paul Butterfield Teaches Blues Harmonica Master Class&quot;, a few years before his death (it was not published until 1997). In it, he explains various techniques, demonstrated on an accompanying CD. Butterfield played mainly in cross-harp, or second position. Reportedly left-handed, he held the harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right-handed player, i.e., in his right hand, upside down (with the low notes to the right), using his left hand for muting effects.

Also like other electric Chicago blues harp players, Butterfield frequently used amplification to achieve his sound. He has been associated with a Shure 545 Unidyne microphone, although producer Rothchild noted that around the time of a 1965 recording session, Butterfield favored an Altec harp microphone run through an early model Fender tweed amplifier. Beginning with album &quot;The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw&quot;, he used an acoustic harmonica style, following his shift to a more R&amp;B-based approach.

==Personal life==
By all accounts, Paul Butterfield was absorbed in his music. According to his brother Peter,

Producer Norman Dayron recalled the young Butterfield as &quot;very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, kind of a hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets ... Paul was hard to be friends with.&quot; Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: &quot;He was a bad guy. He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. I was scared to death of that cat&quot;. Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as &quot;always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly&quot;. He remembered Butterfield as &quot;not much interested in other people&quot;.

By 1971, Butterfield had purchased his first house, in rural Woodstock, New York, and began enjoying family life with his second wife, Kathy Peterson, and their infant son, Lee. According to Maria Muldaur, she and her husband were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but &quot;it was Butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing the blues [and] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes ... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me ... And he&#x27;ll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician.&quot;

==Death==
Beginning in 1980, Butterfield underwent several surgical procedures to relieve his peritonitis, a serious and painful inflammation of the intestines. Although strongly opposed to heroin as a bandleader, he developed an addiction to it, which, according to Steve Huey in AllMusic&#x27;s Butterfield biography, led to &quot;speculation that he was trying to ease his peritonitis symptoms&quot;. The financial strain of supporting his drug habit was bankrupting him, and the deaths of his friend and one-time musical partner Mike Bloomfield, and manager Albert Grossman had shaken him. On May 4, 1987, at age 44, Butterfield died at his apartment in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles. An autopsy by the county coroner concluded that he was the victim of an accidental drug overdose, with &quot;significant levels of morphine (heroin), ... codeine, the tranquilizer Librium and a trace of alcohol.&quot;

By the time of his death, Butterfield was out of the commercial mainstream. Although for some, he was very much the blues man, Maria Muldaur commented &quot;he had the whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat ... He just went for it and took it all in, and he embodied the essence of what the blues was all about. Unfortunately, he lived that way a little too much.&quot;

==Discography==
In 1964, Butterfield began his association with Elektra Records and eventually recorded seven albums for the label. After the break up of the Butterfield Blues Band in 1971, he recorded four albums for manager Albert Grossman&#x27;s Bearsville Records – two with Paul Butterfield&#x27;s Better Days and two solo. His last solo album was released by Amherst Records. After his death in 1987, his former record companies released a number of live albums and compilations.

<doc id="168255" wikidata="Q25120" url="?curid=168255" title="Pier Paolo Pasolini">
<text>Pier Paolo Pasolini (; 5 March 1922 – 2 November 1975) was an Italian poet, film director, writer, actor and playwright. He is considered one of the defining public intellectuals in 20th-century Italian history, influential both as an artist and a political figure. He is known for directing &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot;, the films from Trilogy of Life (&quot;The Decameron&quot;, &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) and &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;.

A controversial personality due to his straightforward style, Pasolini&#x27;s legacy remains contentious. Openly gay while also a vocal advocate for heritage language revival, cultural conservatism, and Christian values in his youth, Pasolini became an avowed Marxist shortly after the end of World War II. He began voicing extremely harsh criticism of Italian petty bourgeoisie and what he saw as the Americanization, cultural degeneration, and greed-driven consumerism taking over Italian culture. As a filmmaker, Pasolini often juxtaposed socio-political polemics with an extremely graphic and critical examination of taboo sexual matters. A prominent protagonist of the Roman intellectual scene during the post-war era, Pasolini became an established and major figure in European literature and cinema.

Pasolini&#x27;s unsolved and extremely brutal abduction, torture, and murder at Ostia in November 1975 prompted an outcry in Italy, where it continues to be a matter of heated debate. Recent leads by Italian cold case investigators suggest a contract killing by the Banda della Magliana, a criminal organisation with close links to far-right terrorism, as the most likely cause.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Pier Paolo Pasolini was born in Bologna, Italy. He was the son of elementary-school teacher Susanna Colussi, named after her great-grandmother, and Carlo Alberto Pasolini, a lieutenant in the Royal Italian Army; they had married in 1921. Pasolini was born in 1922 and named after a paternal uncle. His family moved to Conegliano in 1923, then to Belluno in 1925, where their second son, Guidalberto, was born. In 1926, Pasolini&#x27;s father was arrested for gambling debts. His mother moved with the children to her family&#x27;s home in Casarsa della Delizia, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. In that same year, his father first detained, then identified Anteo Zamboni as the would-be assassin of Benito Mussolini following his assassination attempt. Carlo Alberto was persuaded of the virtues of Italian fascism.

Pasolini began writing poems at age seven, inspired by the natural beauty of Casarsa. One of his early influences was the work of Arthur Rimbaud. His father was transferred to Idria in the Julian March (now in Slovenia) in 1931; in 1933 they moved again to Cremona in Lombardy, and later to Scandiano and Reggio Emilia. Pasolini found it difficult to adapt to all these dislocations, although he enlarged his poetry and literature readings (Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Coleridge, Novalis) and left behind the religious fervour of his early years. In the Reggio Emilia high school, he met his first true friend, Luciano Serra. The two met again in Bologna, where Pasolini spent seven years completing high school. Here he cultivated new passions, including football. With other friends, including Ermes Parini, Franco Farolfi, Elio Meli, he formed a group dedicated to literary discussions.

In 1939, Pasolini graduated and entered the Literature College of the University of Bologna, discovering new themes such as philology and aesthetics of figurative arts. He also frequented the local cinema club. Pasolini always showed his friends a virile and strong exterior, totally hiding his interior turmoil. In his poems of this period, Pasolini started to include fragments in Friulan, a minority language he did not speak but learned after he had begun to write poetry in it. &quot;I learnt it as a sort of mystic act of love, a kind of &quot;félibrisme&quot;, like the Provençal poets.&quot; In 1943, he would found the &quot;Academiuta della lenga furlana&quot; (Academy of the Friulan Language) with fellow students. As a young adult, Pasolini identified as an atheist.

In the waning years of World War II, Pasolini was drafted into the Italian Army. After his regiment was captured by the Germans following Italy&#x27;s surrender, he escaped and fled to the small town of Casarsa where he remained for several years.

=== Early poetry ===

In 1942, Pasolini published at his own expense a collection of poems in Friulan, &quot;Poesie a Casarsa&quot;, which he had written at the age of eighteen. The work was noted and appreciated by such intellectuals and critics as Gianfranco Contini, Alfonso Gatto and Antonio Russi. Pasolini&#x27;s pictures had also been well received. He was chief editor of a magazine called &quot;Il Setaccio&quot; (&#x27;The Sieve&#x27;), but was fired after conflicts with the director, who was aligned with the Fascist regime. A trip to Germany helped him also to perceive the &quot;provincial&quot; status of Italian culture in that period. These experiences led Pasolini to revise his opinion about the cultural politics of Fascism and to switch gradually to a Communist position.

Pasolini&#x27;s family took shelter in Casarsa, considered a more tranquil place to wait for the conclusion of the Second World War, a decision common among Italian military families. Here he joined a group of other young enthusiasts of the Friulan language who wanted to give Casarsa Friulan a status equal to that of Udine, the official regional standard. From May 1944, they issued a magazine entitled &quot;Stroligùt di cà da l&#x27;aga&quot;. In the meantime, Casarsa suffered Allied bombardments and forced enlistments by the Italian Social Republic, as well as partisan activity.

Pasolini tried to distance himself from these events. Starting in October 1943, Pasolini, his mother and other colleagues taught students unable to reach the schools in Pordenone or Udine. This educational workshop was considered illegal and broke up in February 1944. It was here that Pasolini had his first experience of homosexual attraction to one of his students. His brother Guido, aged 19, joined the Party of Action and their Brigate Osoppo, taking to the bush near Slovenia. On 12 February 1945, Guido was killed in an ambush planted by the Brigate Garibaldi serving in the lines of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavian guerrillas. This devastated Pasolini and his mother.

Six days after his brother&#x27;s death, Pasolini and others founded the Friulan Language Academy (&quot;Academiuta di lenga furlana&quot;). Meanwhile, on account of Guido&#x27;s death, Pasolini&#x27;s father returned to Italy from his detention period in November 1945, settling in Casarsa. That same month, Pasolini graduated from university after completing a final thesis about the work of Giovanni Pascoli (1855–1912), an Italian poet and classical scholar.

In 1946, Pasolini published a small poetry collection, &quot;I Diarii&quot; (&#x27;The Diaries&#x27;), with the Academiuta. In October he traveled to Rome. The following May he began the so-called &quot;Quaderni Rossi&quot;, handwritten in old school exercise books with red covers. He completed a drama in Italian, &quot;Il Cappellano&quot;. His poetry collection, &quot;I Pianti&quot; (&#x27;The cries&#x27;), was also published by the Academiuta.

=== Rome ===
In January 1950, Pasolini moved to Rome with his mother Susanna to start a new life. He was acquitted of two indecency charges in 1950 and 1952. After one year sheltered in a maternal uncle&#x27;s flat next to Piazza Mattei, Pasolini and his 59-year-old mother moved to a run-down suburb called Rebibbia, next to a prison, living there for three years; he transferred his Friulan countryside inspiration to this Roman suburb, one of the infamous &quot;borgate&quot; where poor proletarian immigrants lived, often in horrendous sanitary and social conditions. Instead of asking for help from other writers, Pasolini preferred to go his own way.

Pasolini found a job working in the Cinecittà film studios and sold his books in the &quot;bancarelle&quot; (&#x27;sidewalk shops&#x27;) of Rome. In 1951, with the help of the Abruzzese-language poet Vittorio Clemente, he found a job as a secondary school teacher in Ciampino, just outside the capital. He had a long commute involving two train changes and earned a meagre salary of 27,000 lire.

== Career ==
=== Writing ===

In 1954, Pasolini, who now worked for the literary section of Cinecittà, left his teaching job and moved to the Monteverde quarter. At this point, his cousin Graziella moved in. They also accommodated Pasolini&#x27;s ailing, cirrhotic father Carlo Alberto, who died in 1958. Pasolini published &quot;La meglio gioventù&quot;, his first important collection of Friulan poems. His first novel, &quot;Ragazzi di vita&quot; (English: &quot;Hustlers&quot;), which dealt with the Roman lumpenproletariat, was published in 1955. The work had great success but was poorly received by the Italian Communist Party (PCI) establishment and, most importantly, by the Italian government. It initiated a lawsuit for &quot;obscenity&quot; against Pasolini and his publisher, Garzanti. Although exonerated, Pasolini became a target of insinuations, especially in the tabloid press.

In 1955, together with Francesco Leonetti, Roberto Roversi and others, Pasolini edited and published a poetry magazine called &quot;Officina&quot;. The magazine closed in 1959 after fourteen issues. That year he also published his second novel, &quot;Una vita violenta&quot;, which unlike his first was embraced by the Communist cultural sphere: he subsequently wrote a column titled &quot;Dialoghi con Passolini&quot; (meaning &quot;Passolini in Dialogue&quot;), for the PCI magazine &quot;Vie Nuove&quot; from May 1960 to September 1965, which were published in book form in 1977 as &quot;Le belle bandiere&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Flags&quot;). In the late 1960s Pasolini edited an advice column in the weekly news magazine &quot;Tempo&quot;.

In 1966, Pasolini wrote a screenplay for a never-produced film about the apostle Saint Paul which he subsequently revised. Pasolini&#x27;s screenplay was intended to depict Paul as a modern contemporary without modifying any of Paul&#x27;s statements. In Pasolini&#x27;s story, Paul is a fascist Vichy France collaborator who becomes illuminated while traveling to Franco&#x27;s Spain and joins the antifascist French resistance, an event which serves as the modern analogue for the Pauline conversion. The screenplay follows Paul as he preaches resistance in Italy, Spain, Germany, and New York (where he is betrayed, arrested, and executed). As philosopher Alain Badiou writes, &quot;The most surprising thing in all this is the way in which Paul&#x27;s texts are transplanted unaltered, and with an almost unfathomable naturalness, into the situations in which Pasolini deploys them: war, fascism, American capitalism, the petty debates of Italian intelligentsia[.]&quot;

In 1970, Pasolini bought an old castle near Viterbo, several miles north of Rome, where he began to write his last novel, &quot;Il Petrolio&quot;, in which he denounced obscure dealing in the highest levels of government and the corporate world (Eni, CIA, the Mafia, etc.). The novel-documentary was left incomplete at his death. In 1972, Pasolini started to collaborate with the far-left organization Lotta Continua, producing a documentary, &quot;12 dicembre&quot;, concerning the Piazza Fontana bombing. The following year he began a collaboration for Italy&#x27;s most renowned newspaper, &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;. At the beginning of 1975 Garzanti published a collection of his critical essays, &quot;Scritti corsari&quot; (&#x27;Corsair Writings&#x27;).

=== Films ===
In 1957, together with Sergio Citti, Pasolini collaborated on Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot;, writing dialogue for the Roman dialect sections. Fellini also asked him to work on dialogue for some episodes of &quot;La dolce vita&quot;. Pasolini made his debut as an actor in &quot;The Hunchback of Rome&quot; in 1960, and co-wrote &quot;Long Night in 1943&quot;. Along with &quot;Ragazzi di vita&quot;, he had his celebrated poem &quot;Le ceneri di Gramsci&quot; published, where Pasolini voiced tormented tensions between reason and heart, as well as the existing ideological dialectics within communism, a debate over artistic freedom, socialist realism and commitment.

Pasolini&#x27;s first film as director and screenwriter was &quot;Accattone&quot; in 1961, again set among Rome&#x27;s marginal communities, a story of pimps, prostitutes, and thieves that contrasted with Italy&#x27;s postwar economic recovery. Although Pasolini tried to distance himself from neorealism, it is considered to be a type of second neorealism. Nick Barbaro, a critic writing in the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, stated it &quot;may be the grimmest movie&quot; he has ever seen. The film aroused controversy and scandal, with conservatives demanded stricter censorship by the government. In 1963, the episode &quot;La ricotta&quot;, included in the anthology film &quot;Ro.Go.Pa.G.&quot;, was censored, and Pasolini was tried for &quot;offence to the Italian state and religion&quot;.

During this period, Pasolini frequently travelled abroad: in 1961, with Elsa Morante and Alberto Moravia to India (where he went again seven years later); in 1962, to Sudan and Kenya; in 1963, to Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Jordan and Palestine (where he shot the documentary &quot;Sopralluoghi in Palestina&quot;). In 1970 he travelled again to Africa to shoot another documentary, &quot;Appunti per un&#x27;Orestiade africana&quot;. Pasolini was a member of the jury at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966. In 1967, in Venice, he met and interviewed American poet Ezra Pound. They discussed the Italian movement &quot;neoavanguardia,&quot; and Pasolini read some verses from the Italian translation of Pound&#x27;s &quot;Pisan Cantos&quot;.

The late 1960s and early 1970s were the era of the student movement. Pasolini, although acknowledging the students&#x27; ideological motivations, and referring to himself as a &quot;Catholic Marxist&quot;, thought them &quot;anthropologically middle-class&quot; and therefore destined to fail in their attempts at revolutionary change. Regarding the Battle of Valle Giulia, which took place in Rome in March 1968, he said that he sympathized with the police, as they were &quot;children of the poor&quot;, while the young militants were exponents of what he called &quot;left-wing fascism&quot;. His film that year, &quot;Teorema&quot;, was shown at the Venice Film Festival in a hot political climate. Pasolini had proclaimed that the festival would be managed by the directors.

He wrote and directed the black-and-white film &quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; (1964). It is based on scripture, but adapted by Pasolini, and he is credited as a writer. Jesus, a barefoot peasant, is played by Enrique Irazoqui. In his 1966 film &quot;Uccellacci e uccellini&quot; (literally &quot;Bad Birds and Little Birds&quot; but translated in English as &quot;The Hawks and the Sparrows&quot;), a picaresque—and at the same time mystic—fable, Pasolini hired great Italian comedian Totò to work with Ninetto Davoli, the director&#x27;s lover at the time and one of his preferred &quot;naif&quot; actors. It was a unique opportunity for Totò to demonstrate that he was a great dramatic actor as well. In &quot;Teorema&quot; (&quot;Theorem&quot;, 1968), starring Terence Stamp as a mysterious stranger, Pasolini depicted the sexual coming-apart of a bourgeois family. (Variations of this theme were later done by François Ozon in &quot;Sitcom&quot;, Joe Swanberg in &quot;The Zone&quot; and Takashi Miike in &quot;Visitor Q.&quot;)

Later films centred on sex-laden folklore, such as Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (1971), Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1972), and &quot;Il fiore delle mille e una notte&quot; (literally &quot;The Flower of 1001 Nights&quot;, released in English as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, 1974). These films are usually grouped as the &quot;Trilogy of Life&quot;. While basing them on classics, Pasolini wrote the screenplays and took sole writing credit. This trilogy, prompted largely by Pasolini&#x27;s attempt to show the secular sacredness of the body against man-made social controls and especially against the venal hypocrisy of the religious state (indeed, the religious characters in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; are shown as pious but amorally grasping fools) were an effort at representing a state of natural sexual innocence essential to the true nature of free humanity. Alternately playfully bawdy and poetically sensuous, wildly populous, subtly symbolic and visually exquisite, the films were popular in Italy and remain perhaps his most enduringly popular works. Yet despite the fact that the trilogy as a whole is considered by many as a masterpiece, Pasolini later reviled his own creation on account of the many soft-core imitations of these three films in Italy that happened afterwards on account of the very same popularity he wound up deeply uncomfortable with. He believed that a bastardisation of his vision had taken place that amounted to a commoditisation of the body he had tried to deny in his trilogy in the first place. The disconsolation this provided is seen as one of the primary reasons for his final film, &quot;Salò&quot;, in which humans are not only seen as commodities under authoritarian control but are viewed merely as cyphers for its whims, without the free vitality of the figures in the Trilogy of Life.

His final work, &quot;Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma&quot; (&quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, 1975), exceeded what most viewers could accept at the time in its explicit scenes of sexual perversity and intensely sadistic violence. Based on the novel &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot; by Marquis de Sade, it is considered Pasolini&#x27;s most controversial film. In May 2006, &quot;Time Out&quot;″s Film Guide named it the &quot;Most Controversial Film&quot; of all time. Salò was intended as the first film of his &quot;Trilogy of Death&quot;, followed by an aborted biopic film about Gilles de Rais.

== Personal life ==
A small scandal broke out during a local festival in Ramuscello in September 1949. Someone informed Cordovado, the local sergeant of the Carabinieri, of sexual conduct (masturbation) by Pasolini with three youngsters aged sixteen and younger after dancing and drinking. Cordovado summoned the boys&#x27; parents, who refused to file charges despite Cordovado&#x27;s urging. Cordovado nevertheless drew up a report, and the informer elaborated publicly on his accusations, sparking a public uproar. A judge in San Vito al Tagliamento charged Pasolini with &quot;corruption of minors and obscene acts in public places&quot;. He and the 16-year-old were both indicted.

The next month, when questioned, Pasolini would not deny the facts, but talked of a &quot;literary and erotic drive&quot; and cited André Gide, the 1947 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate. Cordovado informed his superiors and the regional press stepped in. According to Pasolini, the Christian Democrats instigated the entire affair to smear his name (&quot;the Christian Democrats pulled the strings&quot;). He was fired from his job in Valvasone and was expelled from the PCI by the party&#x27;s Udine section, which he considered a betrayal. He addressed a critical letter to the head of the section, his friend Ferdinando Mautino, and claimed he was being subject to a &quot;tacticism&quot; of the PCI. In the party, the expulsion was opposed by Teresa Degan, Pasolini&#x27;s colleague in education. He also wrote her a letter admitting his regret for being &quot;such a naif, even indecently so&quot;. Pasolini&#x27;s parents reacted angrily and the situation in the family also became untenable. In late 1949, he decided to move to Rome along with his mother, seeking to start a new life, settling down in the outskirts of Rome.

In 1963, at the age of 41, Pasolini met &quot;the great love of his life&quot;, 15-year-old Ninetto Davoli, whom he later cast in his 1966 film &quot;Uccellacci e uccellini&quot; (literally &quot;Bad Birds and Little Birds&quot; but translated in English as &quot;The Hawks and the Sparrows&quot;). Pasolini became the youth&#x27;s mentor and friend.

Important women in Pasolini&#x27;s life with whom he shared a feeling of profound and unique friendship were, in particular, actress Laura Betti and singer Maria Callas. Dacia Maraini, an Italian writer, said of Callas&#x27; behaviour towards Pasolini: &quot;She used to follow him everywhere, even to Africa. She hoped to &#x27;convert&#x27; him to heterosexuality and to marriage.&quot; Pasolini was also sensible to the problematics related to the &quot;new&quot; role ascribed to women through the Italian media, stating in a 1972 interview that &quot;women are not slot machines&quot;.

He was a supporter of his hometown football club Bologna.

== Political views ==

=== Relationship with the Italian Communist Party ===

By October 1945, the political status of the Friuli region became a matter of contention between different political factions. On 30 October, Pasolini joined the pro-devolution association &quot;Patrie tal Friul&quot;, founded in Udine. Pasolini wanted a Friuli based on its tradition, attached to the Catholic Church in Italy, but intent on civic and social progress, as opposed to those advocates of regional autonomy who wanted to preserve their privileges based on &quot;immobilism&quot;. He also criticized the Italian Communist Party (PCI) for its opposition to regional devolution and preference instead for State centralisation. Pasolini founded the party Movimento Popolare Friulano, but resigned upon realizing that it was being covertly manipulated by Italy&#x27;s ruling Christian Democratic Party to counter local Titoists, who were attempting to annex large swaths of the Friuli region to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

On 26 January 1947, Pasolini wrote a declaration that was published on the front page of the newspaper &quot;Libertà&quot;: &quot;In our opinion, we think that currently only Communism is able to provide a new culture.&quot; It generated controversy, partly due to the fact he was still not a member of the PCI. Pasolini planned to extend the work of the Academiuta to the literature of other Romance languages, and met exiled Catalan poet Carles Cardó. He took part in several demonstrations after joining the PCI. In May 1949, he attended the Peace Congress in Paris. Observing the struggles of workers and peasants, and watching the clashes of protesters with Italian police, he began to conceive his first novel. During this period, while holding a position as a teacher in a secondary school, he stood out in the local Italian Communist Party section as a skilful writer, while defying the official Party platform that Stalinism was anti-Christian. Along with the Party leadership, local Christian Democrats and Catholic clergy also took notice. In the summer of 1949, Pasolini was warned by a Roman Catholic priest to renounce Marxist-Leninism or lose his teaching position. Similarly, after some posters were put up in Udine, Giambattista Caron, a Christian Democrat deputy, warned Pasolini&#x27;s cousin Nico Naldini that &quot;[Pasolini] should abandon communist propaganda&quot; to prevent &quot;pernicious reactions&quot;.

=== Anti-fascism and 1968 protests ===
Pasolini generated heated public discussion with controversial analyses of public affairs. For instance, autonomist university students were carrying on a guerrilla-style uprising against the police in the streets of Rome during the disorders of 1968. For their supporters, the disorders were a civil fight of the proletariat against the system. Pasolini made comments that have been interpreted that he was with the police or that he was a man of order, and that he was an anti-anti-fascist. According to the Centro Studi, Pier Paolo Pasolini, the myth of an &quot;anti-anti-fascist&quot; Pasolini served to propose unlikely anti-globalist alliances by neo-fascists. &quot;Anti-antifascismo&quot; was never used by Pasolini and was only added in later years as the title of the &quot;Scritti corsari&quot; collection. Pasolini used the concept to attack various institutional subjects, such as Christian Democracy, the Italian president Giuseppe Saragat, RAI, and the Health Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, which were all guilty of ignoring some requests from Marco Pannella, who had been on hunger strike for over two months. He excluded the PCI from those parties of the constitutional arc that, as declared by Pasolini in June 1975, tried to &quot;rebuild an anti-fascist virginity ... but, at the same time, maintaining the impunity of the fascist gangs that they, if they wanted, would liquidate in a day&quot;.

The main source regarding Pasolini&#x27;s views of the student movement is his poem &quot;Il PCI ai giovani&quot; (&#x27;The PCI to Young People&#x27;), written after the Battle of Valle Giulia. Addressing the students, he tells them that, unlike the international news media which has been reporting on them, he will not flatter them. He points out that they are the children of the bourgeoisie (&quot;Avete facce di figli di papà / Vi odio come odio i vostri papà&quot; – &#x27;You have the faces of daddy&#x27;s boys / I hate you like I hate your dads&#x27;), before stating &quot;Quando ieri a Valle Giulia avete fatto a botte coi poliziotti / io simpatizzavo coi poliziotti&quot; (&#x27;When you and the policemen were throwing punches yesterday at Valle Giulia / I was sympathising with the policemen&#x27;). He explained that this sympathy was because the policemen were &quot;figli di poveri&quot; (&#x27;children of the poor&#x27;). The poem highlights the aspect of generational struggle within the bourgeoisie represented by the student movement: &quot;Stampa e Corriere della Sera, News- week e Monde / vi leccano il culo. Siete i loro figli / la loro speranza, il loro futuro... Se mai / si tratta di una lotta intestina&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Stampa&quot; and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; / they kiss your arse. You are their children / their hope, their future... If anything / it&#x27;s in-fighting&#x27;).

The 1968 revolt was seen by Pasolini as an internal, benign reform of the establishment in Italy, since the protesters were part of the petite bourgeoisie. The poem also implied a class hypocrisy on the part of the establishment towards the protesters, asking whether young workers would be treated similarly if they behaved in the same way: &quot;Occupate le università / ma dite che la stessa idea venga / a dei giovani operai / E allora: Corriere della Sera e Stampa, Newsweek e Monde / avranno tanta sollecitudine / nel cercar di comprendere i loro problemi? / La polizia si limiterà a prendere un po&#x27; di botte / dentro una fabbrica occupata? / Ma, soprattutto, come potrebbe concedersi / un giovane operaio di occupare una fabbrica / senza morire di fame dopo tre giorni?&quot; (&#x27;Occupy the universities / but say that the same idea comes / to young workers / So: &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; and &quot;Stampa&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; / will have so much care / in trying to understand their problems? / Will the police just get a bit of a fight / inside an occupied factory? / But above all, how could / a young worker be allowed to occupy a factory / without dying of hunger after three days?&#x27;

Pasolini suggested that the police were the true proletariat, sent to fight for a poor salary and for reasons which they could not understand, against pampered boys of their same age because they had not had the fortune of being able to study, referring to &quot;poliziotti figli di proletari meridionali picchiati da figli di papà in vena di bravate&quot; (&#x27;policemen, sons of proletarian southerners, beaten up by arrogant daddy&#x27;s boys&#x27;). He found that the policemen were but the outer layer of the real power, e.g. the judiciary. Pasolini was not alien to courts and trials. During all his life, Pasolini was frequently entangled in up to 33 lawsuits filed against him, variously charged with &quot;public disgrace&quot;, &quot;foul language&quot;, &quot;obscenity&quot;, &quot;pornography&quot;, &quot;contempt of religion&quot;, and &quot;contempt of the state&quot;, for which he was always eventually acquitted.

The conventional interpretation of Pasolini&#x27;s position has been challenged. In an article published in 2015, Wu Ming argued that Pasolini&#x27;s statements need to be understood in the context of Pasolini&#x27;s self-confessed hatred of the bourgeoisie which had persecuted him for so long, as &quot;Il PCI ai giovani&quot; states that &quot;We (i.e. Pasolini and the students) are obviously in agreement against the police institution&quot;, and that the poem portrays policemen as dehumanised by their work. Although the battles between students and the police were fights between the rich and the poor, Pasolini concedes that the students were &quot;on the side of reason&quot; whilst the police were &quot;in the wrong&quot;. Wu Ming suggested that Pasolini intended to express scepticism regarding the idea of students being a revolutionary force, contending that only the working class could make a revolution and that revolutionary students should join the PCI. Furthermore, he cites a column by Pasolini which was published in the magazine &quot;Tempo&quot; later that year, which described the student movement, along with the wartime resistance, as &quot;the Italian people&#x27;s only two democratic-revolutionary experiences&quot;. That year, he also wrote in support of the PCI&#x27;s proposals for disarming the police, arguing that this would create a break in the psychology of policemen. He said: &quot;It would lead to the sudden collapse of that &#x27;false idea of himself&#x27; ascribed to him by Power, which has programmed him like a robot.&quot; Pasolini&#x27;s polemics were aimed at goading protesters into re-thinking their revolt, and did not stop him from contributing to the autonomist &quot;Lotta Continua&quot; movement, who he described as &quot;extremists, yes, maybe fanatic and insolently boorish from a cultural point of view, but they push their luck and that is precisely why I think they deserve to be supported. We must want too much to obtain a little.&quot;

=== Rising society of consumption ===
Pasolini was particularly concerned about the class of the subproletariat, which he portrayed in &quot;Accattone&quot;, and to which he felt both humanly and artistically drawn. He observed that the type of purity which he perceived in the pre-industrial popular culture was rapidly vanishing, a process that he named &quot;la scomparsa delle lucciole&quot; (&#x27;the disappearance of the fireflies&#x27;). The &quot;joie de vivre&quot; of boys was being rapidly replaced with more bourgeois ambitions such as a house and a family. He was critical of those leftists who held a &quot;traditional and never admitted hatred against lumpenproletariats and poor populations&quot;. In 1958, he called on the PCI to become &quot;&#x27;the party of the poor people&#x27;: the party, we may say, of the lumpenproletarians&quot;.

Pasolini&#x27;s stance finds its roots in the belief that a Copernican change was taking place in Italian society and the world. Linked to that very idea, he was also an ardent critic of &quot;consumismo&quot;, i.e. consumerism, which he felt had rapidly destroyed Italian society from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. He described the coprophagia scenes in &quot;Salò&quot; as a comment on the processed food industry. As he saw it, the society of consumerism (&quot;neocapitalism&quot;) and the &quot;new fascism&quot; had thus expanded an alienation / homogenization and centralization that the former clerical fascism had not managed to achieve, so bringing about an anthropological change. That change is related to the loss of humanism and the expansion of productivity as central to the human condition, which he despised. He found that &#x27;new culture&#x27; was degrading and vulgar. In one interview, he said: &quot;I hate with particular vehemency the current power, the power of 1975, which is a power that manipulates bodies in a horrible way; a manipulation that has nothing to envy to that performed by Himmler or Hitler.&quot; According to Pasolini scholar Simona Bondavalli, Pasolini&#x27;s definition of neo-capitalism as a &quot;new fascism&quot; enforced uniform conformity without resorting to coercive means. As Pasolini put it, &quot;No Fascist centralism succeeded in doing what the centralism of consumer culture did.&quot; Philosopher Davide Tarizzo summarized Pasolini&#x27;s position:
=== Strong criticism of Christian Democracy ===

Pasolini saw some continuity between the Fascist era and the post-war political system which was led by the Christian Democrats, describing the latter as &quot;clerico-fascism&quot; due to its use of the state as a repressive instrument and its manipulation of power: he saw the conditions among the Roman subproletariat in the &quot;borgate&quot; as an example of this, being marginalised and segregated socially and geographically as they were under Fascism, and in conflict with a criminal police force. He also blamed the Christian Democrats for assimilating the values of consumer capitalism, contributing to what he saw as the erosion of human values.

The 1975 Italian regional elections saw the rise of the leftist parties, and dwelling on his blunt, ever more political approach and prophetic style during this period, he declared in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; that the time had come to put the most prominent Christian Democrat figures on trial, where they would need to be shown walking in handcuffs and led by the Carabinieri; he felt that this was the only way they could be removed from power. Pasolini charged the Christian Democratic leadership with being &quot;riddled with Mafia influence&quot;, covering up a number of bombings by neo-fascists, collaborating with the CIA, and working with the CIA and the Italian Armed Forces to prevent the rise of the left.

=== Television linked to cultural alienation ===
Pasolini was angered by economic globalization and cultural domination of the north of Italy (around Milan) over other regions, especially the south. He felt this was accomplished through the power of television. A debate TV programme recorded in 1971, where he denounced censorship, was not actually aired until the day following his murder in November 1975. In a PCI reform plan that he drew up in September and October 1975, among the desirable measures to be implemented, he cited the abolition of television.

=== Others ===

Pasolini opposed the gradual disappearance of Italy&#x27;s minority languages by writing some of his poetry in Friulan, the regional language of his childhood. His opposition to the liberalization of abortion law made him unpopular on the left.

After 1968, Pasolini engaged with the left-libertarian, anti-clerical, and liberal Radical Party (&quot;Partito Radicale&quot;). He involved himself in polemics with party leader Marco Pannella, supported the Party&#x27;s initiative calling for eight referendums on various liberalising reforms, and had accepted an invitation to speak at the Party&#x27;s congress before he was killed. Despite supporting the holding of a referendum on the decriminalisation of abortion, he was opposed to actually decriminalising it, and he also criticised the Party&#x27;s understanding of democratic activism as being a matter of equalising access to capitalist markets for the working class and other subaltern groups. In an interview he gave shortly before his death, Pasolini stated he frequently disagreed with the Party. He continued to give qualified support to the PCI. in June 1975, he said that he would still vote for the PCI because he felt it was &quot;an island where critical consciousness is always desperately defended: and where human behaviour has been still able to preserve the old dignity&quot;, and in his final months he became close to the Rome section of the Italian Communist Youth Federation. A Federation activist, Vincenzo Cerami, delivered the speech he was due to give at the Radical Party congress: in it, Pasolini confirmed his Marxism and his support for the PCI.

Outside of Italy, Pasolini took a particular interest in the developing world, seeing parallels between life among the Italian underclass and in the third world, going so far as to declare that Bandung was the capital of three-quarters of the world and half of Italy. He was also positive about the New Left in the United States, predicting that it would &quot;lead to an original form of non-Marxist Socialism&quot; and writing that the movement reminded him of the Italian Resistance. Pasolini saw these two areas of struggle as inter-linked: after visiting Harlem he stated that &quot;the core of the struggle for the Third World revolution is really America&quot;.

== Murder ==
Pasolini was murdered on 2 November 1975 at a beach in Ostia. Almost unrecognizable, Pasolini was savagely beaten and also run over several times with his own car. Multiple bones were broken and his testicles were crushed by what appeared to have been a metal bar. An autopsy revealed that his body had been partially burned with gasoline after his death. The crime was long viewed as a Mafia-style revenge killing, one that was extremely unlikely to have been carried out by only one person. Pasolini was buried in Casarsa. 

Giuseppe &quot;Pino&quot; Pelosi (1958–2017), then 17 years old, was caught driving Pasolini&#x27;s car and confessed to the murder. He was convicted and sentenced to 9 years in prison in 1976, initially with &quot;unknown others&quot;, but this phrase was later removed from the verdict. Twenty-nine years later, on 7 May 2005, Pelosi retracted his confession, which he said had been made under the threat of violence to his family. He claimed that three people &quot;with a southern accent&quot; had committed the murder, while further insulting Pasolini as a &quot;dirty communist&quot;. 

Other evidence uncovered in 2005 suggested that Pasolini had been murdered by an extortionist. Testimony by his friend Sergio Citti indicated that some of the rolls of film from &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; had been stolen, and that Pasolini planned to meet with and negotiate its return from the thieves on 2 November 1975 following a visit to Stockholm, Sweden. Citti&#x27;s investigation uncovered additional evidence, including a bloody wooden stick and an eyewitness who said he saw a group of men pull Pasolini from the car. The Rome police reopened the murder as a cold case after Pelosi&#x27;s retraction, but the investigative magistrates responsible for the investigation found that the new elements were insufficient to justify a continued inquiry. As of 2023, a plea to reopen the case was filed based on DNA analysis and links the murder to the Banda della Magliana, a criminal organisation with close ties to far-right terrorism, as the probable culprits.

== Legacy ==
As a director, Pasolini created a picaresque neorealism, showing a sad reality. Many people did not want to see such portrayals in artistic work for public distribution. &quot;Mamma Roma&quot; (1962), featuring Anna Magnani and telling the story of a prostitute and her son, was an affront to the public ideals of the morality of those times. His works, with their unequalled poetry applied to cruel realities, showed that such realities were less distant from most daily lives, and contributed to changes in the Italian psyche.

Pasolini&#x27;s work often engendered disapproval perhaps primarily because of his frequent focus on sexual behaviour, and the contrast between what he presented and what was publicly sanctioned. While Pasolini&#x27;s poetry often dealt with his gay love interests, this was not the only, or even main, theme. His interest in and use of Italian dialects should also be noted. Much of the poetry was about his highly revered mother. He depicted certain corners of the contemporary reality as few other poets could do. His poetry, which took some time before it was translated, was not as well known outside Italy as were his films. A collection in English was published in 1996.

Pasolini also developed a philosophy of language mainly related to his studies on cinema. This theoretical and critical activity was another hotly debated topic. His collected articles and responses are still available today.

These studies can be considered the foundation of his artistic point of view: he believed that the language—such as English, Italian, dialect or other—is a rigid system in which human thought is trapped. He also thought that the cinema is the &quot;written&quot; language of reality which, like any other written language, enables man to see things from the point of view of truth.

His films won awards at the Berlin International Film Festival, Cannes Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, Italian National Syndicate for Film Journalists, Jussi Awards, Kinema Junpo Awards, International Catholic Film Office and New York Film Critics Circle. &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; was nominated for the United Nations Award of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) in 1968.

<text>Steppenwolf (originally ) is the tenth novel by German-Swiss author Hermann Hesse.

Originally published in Germany in 1927, it was first translated into English in 1929. The novel was named after the German name for the steppe wolf. The story in large part reflects a profound crisis in Hesse&#x27;s spiritual world during the 1920s.

&quot;Steppenwolf&quot; was wildly popular and has remained a perpetual success, but Hesse later said the book was largely misunderstood.

== Background and publication history ==
In 1924, Hermann Hesse married singer Ruth Wenger. After several weeks, he left Basel, only returning near the end of the year. Upon his return, he rented a separate apartment, adding to his isolation. After a short trip to Germany with Wenger, Hesse stopped seeing her almost completely. The resulting isolation and inability to make lasting contact with the outside world led to increasing despair and the return of Hesse&#x27;s suicidal thoughts.

Hesse began writing &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; in Basel, and finished it in Zürich. In 1926, he published a precursor to the book, a collection of poems titled &quot;The Crisis: From Hermann Hesse&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The novel was released in 1927. The first English edition, translated by Basil Creighton, was published in 1929 by Martin Secker in the United Kingdom and by Henry Holt and Company in the United States.

In 1926, Hesse also became acquainted with jazz music, attending Swiss performances of the &quot;Revue Nègre&quot; featuring Josephine Baker and Sidney Bechet; Steven C. Tracy, professor of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts, writes, &quot;the character of Pablo... was inspired by Bechet&#x27;s playing&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The book is presented as a manuscript written by its protagonist, a middle-aged man named Harry Haller, who leaves it to a chance acquaintance, his landlady&#x27;s nephew. The acquaintance adds a short preface and has the manuscript published. The title of this &quot;real&quot; book-within-the-book is &quot;Harry Haller&#x27;s Records (For Madmen Only)&quot;.

As the story begins, Harry is beset by reflections on his being ill-suited for the world of everyday, regular people, specifically for frivolous bourgeois society. In his aimless wanderings about the city he encounters a person carrying an advertisement for a magic theatre who gives him a small book, &quot;Treatise on the Steppenwolf&quot;. This treatise, cited in full in the novel&#x27;s text as Harry reads it, addresses Harry by name and strikes him as describing himself uncannily. It is a discourse on a man who believes himself to be of two natures: one high, man&#x27;s spiritual nature, the other low and animalistic, a &quot;wolf of the steppes&quot;. This man is entangled in an irresolvable struggle, never content with either nature because he cannot see beyond this self-made concept. The pamphlet gives an explanation of the multifaceted and indefinable nature of every man&#x27;s soul, but Harry is either unable or unwilling to recognize this. It also discusses his suicidal intentions, describing him as one of the &quot;suicides&quot;: people who, deep down, knew they would take their own life one day. But to counter that, it hails his potential to be great, to be one of the &quot;Immortals&quot;.

By chance, Harry encounters the man who gave him the book, just as they have both attended a funeral. He inquires about the magic theater, to which the man replies, &quot;Not for everybody.&quot; When Harry presses further for information, the man recommends a local dance hall, to Harry&#x27;s disappointment.

When returning from the funeral, Harry meets a former academic friend with whom he had often discussed Oriental mythology, and who invites Harry to his home. While there, Harry is disgusted by the nationalistic mentality of his friend, who inadvertently criticizes a column Harry wrote. In turn, Harry offends the man and his wife by criticizing the wife&#x27;s engraving of Goethe, which Harry feels is too thickly sentimental and insulting to Goethe&#x27;s true brilliance. This episode confirms to Harry that he is, and will always be, a stranger to his society.

Trying to postpone returning home, where he fears all that awaits him is his own suicide, Harry walks aimlessly around town for most of the night, finally stopping to rest at the dance hall where the man had sent him earlier. He happens upon a young woman, Hermine, who quickly recognizes his desperation. They talk at length; Hermine alternately mocks Harry&#x27;s self-pity and indulges his explanations of his view of life, to his astonished relief. Hermine promises a second meeting, and gives Harry a reason to live (or at least a substantial excuse to continue living) that he eagerly embraces.

During the next few weeks, Hermine introduces Harry to the indulgences of what he calls the &quot;bourgeois&quot;. She teaches him to dance, introduces him to casual drug use, finds him a lover (Maria) and, more importantly, forces him to accept these as legitimate and worthy aspects of a full life.

Hermine also introduces Harry to a mysterious saxophonist, Pablo, who appears to be the opposite of what Harry considers a serious, thoughtful man. After attending a lavish masquerade ball, Pablo brings Harry to his metaphorical &quot;magic theatre&quot;, where the concerns and notions that plagued his soul disintegrate as he interacts with the ethereal and phantasmal. At the Magic Theatre he experiences the fantasies that exist in his mind. The Theatre is described as a long, horseshoe-shaped corridor with a mirror on one side and a great number of doors on the other. Harry enters five of these labeled doors, each of which symbolizes a fraction of his life.

Harry appears to kill Hermine with a knife while she lies next to Pablo. Pablo wakes, covers her body with a rug, and exits the room, after which he returns disguised as Mozart to chastise Harry for his attitude in life. Harry realizes that by stabbing Hermine he simply projected his own suicidal desires, recognizes Pablo behind his disguise, and, as the hallucination fades away, Pablo picks up the dead Hermine, transformed into a chess piece, and puts her in his pocket.

In the preface to the novel&#x27;s 1960 edition, Hesse wrote that &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; was &quot;more often and more violently misunderstood&quot; than any of his other books. He felt that his readers focused only on the suffering and despair in Harry Haller&#x27;s life, thereby missing the possibility of transcendence and healing.

== Critical reception ==
Close friends and longtime readers of Hesse criticized the novel for its perceived immorality in its open depiction of sex and drug use, a criticism that remained the primary rebuke of the novel for many years. 

American novelist Jack Kerouac dismissed it in &quot;Big Sur&quot; (1962), though popular interest revived in the 1960s, specifically in the psychedelic movement, because it was seen as a counterculture book and because of its depiction of free love and explicit drug use.

== References in popular culture ==
Hesse&#x27;s 1928 short story &quot;Harry, the Steppenwolf&quot; forms a companion piece to the novel. It is about a wolf named Harry who is kept in a zoo and entertains crowds by destroying images of German cultural icons such as Goethe and Mozart.

A paragraph in Hesse&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; says that &quot;magic theater&quot; is another name of the glass bead game itself.

The name &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; has become notable in popular culture for various organizations and establishments.
