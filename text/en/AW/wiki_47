<text>Power pop (also typeset as powerpop) is a subgenre of rock music and form of pop rock based on the early music of bands such as the Who, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Byrds. It typically incorporates melodic hooks, vocal harmonies, an energetic performance, and cheerful-sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning, longing, despair, or self-empowerment. The sound is primarily rooted in pop and rock traditions of the early-to-mid 1960s, although some artists have occasionally drawn from later styles such as punk, new wave, glam rock, pub rock, college rock, and neo-psychedelia. 

Originating in the 1960s, power pop developed mainly among American musicians who came of age during the British Invasion. Many of these young musicians wished to retain the &quot;teenage innocence&quot; of pop and rebelled against newer forms of rock music that were thought to be pretentious and inaccessible. The term was coined in 1967 by the Who guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend to describe his band&#x27;s style of music. However, power pop became more widely identified with later acts of the 1970s who sought to revive Beatles-style pop.

Early 1970s releases by Badfinger, the Raspberries, and Todd Rundgren are sometimes credited with solidifying the power pop sound into a recognizable genre. Power pop reached its commercial peak during the rise of punk and new wave in the late 1970s, with Cheap Trick, the Knack, the Romantics, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds, and Dwight Twilley among those enjoying the most success. After a popular and critical backlash to the genre&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;My Sharona&quot; (the Knack, 1979), record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups, and most of the 1970s bands broke up in the early 1980s.

Over subsequent decades, power pop continued with modest commercial success while also remaining a frequent object of derision among some critics and musicians. The 1990s saw a new wave of alternative bands that were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they had influenced. Although not as successful as their predecessors, Jellyfish, the Posies, Redd Kross, Teenage Fanclub, and Material Issue were critical and cult favorites. In the mid-1990s, an offshoot genre that combined power pop-style harmonies with uptempo punk rock, dubbed &quot;pop-punk&quot;, reached mainstream popularity.

==Definition and etymology==

===Characteristics===
Power pop is a more aggressive form of pop rock that is based on catchy, melodic hooks and energetic moods. AllMusic describes the style as &quot;a cross between the crunching hard rock of the Who and the sweet melodicism of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, with the ringing guitars of the Byrds thrown in for good measure&quot;. Virtually every artist of the genre has been a rock band consisting of white male musicians who engaged with the song forms, vocal arrangements, chord progressions, rhythm patterns, instrumentation, or overall sound associated with groups of the mid-1960s British Invasion era.

An essential feature of power pop is that its cheerful sounding arrangements are supported by a sense of &quot;yearning&quot;, &quot;longing&quot;, or &quot;despair&quot; similar to formative works such as &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; (the Beach Boys, 1966) and &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; (the Who, 1967). This might be achieved with an unexpected harmonic change or lyrics that refer to &quot;tonight&quot;, &quot;tomorrow night&quot;, &quot;Saturday night&quot;, and so on. Power pop was also noted for its lack of irony and its reverence to classic pop craft. Its reconfiguration of 1960s tropes, music journalist Paul Lester argued, could make it one of the first postmodern music genres.

===Scope and recognition===

The Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend coined the term in a May 1967 interview promoting their latest single &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;. He said: &quot;Power pop is what we play—what the Small Faces used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of &#x27;Fun, Fun, Fun&#x27; which I preferred.&quot; Despite other bands following in the power pop continuum since then, the term was not popularized until the rise of new wave music in the late 1970s. Greg Shaw, editor of &quot;Bomp!&quot; magazine, was the most prominent in the slew of music critics that wrote about power pop (then written as &quot;powerpop&quot;). This mirrored similar developments with the term &quot;punk rock&quot; from earlier in the decade. In light of this, Theo Cateforis, author of &quot;Are We Not New Wave?&quot; (2011), wrote that &quot;the recognition and formulation&quot; of power pop as a genre &quot;was by no means organic.&quot;

There is significant debate among fans over what should be classed as power pop. Shaw took credit for codifying the genre in 1978, describing it as a hybrid style of pop and punk. He later wrote that &quot;much to my chagrin, the term was snapped up by legions of limp, second-rate bands hoping the majors would see them as a safe alternative to punk.&quot; Music journalist John M. Borack also stated in his 2007 book &quot;Shake Some Action – The Ultimate Guide to Power Pop&quot; that the label is often applied to varied groups and artists with &quot;blissful indifference&quot;, noting its use in connection with Britney Spears, Green Day, the Bay City Rollers and Def Leppard.

Power pop has struggled with its critical reception and is sometimes viewed as a shallow style of music associated with teenage audiences. The perception was exacerbated by record labels in the early 1980s who used the term for marketing post-punk styles. Music critic Ken Sharp summarized that power pop is &quot;the Rodney Dangerfield of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.[...] the direct updating of the most revered artists—the Who, the Beach Boys, the Beatles—yet it gets no respect.&quot; In 1996, singer-songwriter Tommy Keene commented that any association to the term since the 1980s is to be &quot;compared to a lot of bands that didn&#x27;t sell records, it&#x27;s like a disease. If you&#x27;re labeled that, you&#x27;re history.&quot; Musician Steve Albini said: &quot;I cannot bring myself to use the term &#x27;power pop.&#x27; Catchy, mock-descriptive terms are for dilettantes and journalists. I guess you could say I think this music is for pussies and should be stopped.&quot; Ken Stringfellow of the Posies concurred that &quot;There’s a kind of aesthetic to power pop to be light on purpose. I wanted something with more gravitas.&quot;

== Original waves ==
=== 1960s: Origins and precursors ===


Power pop originated in the late 1960s as young music fans began to rebel against the emerging pretensions of rock music. During this period, a schism developed between &quot;serious&quot; artists who rejected pop and &quot;crassly commercial&quot; pop acts who embraced their teenybopper audience. Greg Shaw credited the Who as the starting point for power pop, whereas Carl Caferelli (writing in Borack&#x27;s book) said that &quot;the story really begins circa 1964, with the commercial ascension of the Beatles in America.&quot; Caferelli also recognized the Beatles as the embodiment of the &quot;pop band&quot; ideal. According to &quot;The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, British Invasion bands, particularly the Merseybeat sound first popularised by the Beatles and its &quot;jangly guitars, pleasant melodies, immaculate vocal harmonies, and a general air of teenage innocence&quot;, were a key influence on 1970s power-pop bands such as the Raspberries, Big Star, the Knack and XTC.

When Pete Townshend coined the term, he suggested that songs like &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; (1965) and &quot;Substitute&quot; (1966) were more accessible than the changing, more experimental directions other groups such as the Beatles were taking. However, the term did not become widely identified with the Who, and it would take a few years before the genre&#x27;s stylistic elements coalesced into a more recognizable form. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Noel Murray said that &quot;once the sound became more viable and widely imitated, it was easier to trace the roots of the genre back to rockabilly, doo-wop, girl groups, and the early records of the Beatles, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, and the Who.&quot; Robert Hilburn traced the genre &quot;chiefly from the way the Beatles and the Beach Boys mixed rock character and pure Top 40 instincts in such records as the latter&#x27;s &#x27;California Girls&#x27;.&quot; Borack noted, &quot;It&#x27;s also quite easy to draw a not-so-crooked line from garage rock to power pop.&quot;

Townshend himself was heavily influenced by the guitar work of Beach Boy Carl Wilson, while the Who&#x27;s debut single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; was indebted to the Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; (1964). Roy Shuker identified the leading American power pop acts of the time as the Byrds, Tommy James and the Shondells, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Also significant to power pop in the 1960s were the Dave Clark Five, the Creation, the Easybeats, the Move, and the Nazz.

===1970s: Emergence===
In the 1970s, the rock scene fragmented into many new styles. Artists drifted away from the influence of early Beatles songs, and those who cited the Beatles or the Who as influences were in the minority. In Paul Lester&#x27;s description, &quot;powerpop is really a 70s invention. It&#x27;s about young musicians missing the 60s but taking its sound in new directions.[...] not just an alternative to prog and the hippy troubadours, but a cousin to glam.&quot; Novelist Michael Chabon believed that the genre did not truly come into its own until the emergence of &quot;second generation&quot; power pop acts in the early 1970s. Lester added that it was &quot;essentially an American response to the British Invasion, made by Anglophiles a couple of years too young to have been in bands the first time round.&quot;

For many fans of power pop, according to Caferelli, the &quot;bloated and sterile&quot; aspect of 1970s rock was indicative of the void left by the Beatles&#x27; breakup in 1970. During the early to middle part of the decade, only a few acts continued the tradition of Beatles-style pop. Some were younger glam/glitter bands, while others were 60s holdovers&quot; that refused to update their sound. One of the most prominent groups in the latter category was Badfinger, the first artists signed to the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records. Although they had international top 10 chart success with &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1969), &quot;No Matter What&quot; (1970), and &quot;Day After Day&quot; (1971), they were criticized in the music press as Beatles imitators. Caferelli describes them as &quot;one of the earliest—and finest purveyors&quot; of power pop. Conversely, AllMusic states that while Badfinger were among the groups that established the genre&#x27;s sound, the Raspberries were the only power pop band of the era to have hit singles. Noel Murray wrote that Badfinger had &quot;some key songs&quot; that were power pop &quot;before the genre really existed&quot;.

According to &quot;Magnet&quot; Andrew Earles, 1972 was &quot;year zero&quot; for power pop. Developments from that year included the emergence of Big Star and the Raspberries, the release of Todd Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;, and the recording of the Flamin&#x27; Groovies&#x27; &quot;Shake Some Action&quot;; additionally, many garage bands had stopped emulating the Rolling Stones. Chabon additionally credited the Raspberries, Badfinger, Big Star, and Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;Couldn&#x27;t I Just Tell You&quot; and &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; with &quot;inventing&quot; the genre. On a television performance from 1978, Rundgren introduced &quot;Couldn&#x27;t I Just Tell You&quot; as a part of &quot;the latest musical trend, power pop.&quot; Lester called the studio recording of the song a &quot;masterclass in compression&quot; and said that Rundgren &quot;staked his claim to powerpop immortality [and] set the whole ball rolling&quot;.

Earles identified the Raspberries as the only American band that had hit singles. Murray recognized the Raspberries as the most representative power pop band and described their 1972 US top 10 &quot;Go All the Way&quot; as &quot;practically a template for everything the genre could be, from the heavy arena-rock hook to the cooing, teenybopper-friendly verses and chorus.&quot; Caferelli described the follow-up &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot; (1972) as &quot;perhaps the definitive power pop single&quot;. However, like Badfinger, the Raspberries were derided as &quot;Beatles clones&quot;. Singer Eric Carmen remembered that there &quot;were a lot of people in 1972 who were not ready for any band that even remotely resembled the Beatles.&quot; Raspberries dissolved in 1975 as Carmen pursued a solo career.

===1970s–1980s: Commercial peak and decline===
A recognizable movement of power pop bands following in the tradition of the Raspberries started emerging in the late 1970s, with groups such as Cheap Trick, the Jam, the Romantics, Shoes, and the Flamin&#x27; Groovies, who were seen as 1960s revivalist bands. Much of these newer bands were influenced by late 1960s AM radio, which fell into a rapid decline due to the popularity of the AOR and progressive rock FM radio format. By 1977, there was a renewed interest in the music and culture of the 1960s, with examples such as the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; musical and the growing mod revival. AABA forms and double backbeats also made their return after many years of disuse in popular music.

Spurred on by the emergence of punk rock and new wave, power pop enjoyed a prolific and commercially successful period from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. Throughout the two decades, the genre existed parallel to and occasionally drew from developments such as glam rock, pub rock, punk, new wave, college rock, and neo-psychedelia. AllMusic states that these new groups were &quot;swept along with the new wave because their brief, catchy songs fit into the post-punk aesthetic.&quot; Most bands rejected the irreverence, cynicism, and irony that characterized new wave, believing that pop music was an art that reached its apex in the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as the &quot;poptopia&quot;. This in turn led many critics to dismiss power pop as derivative work.

Ultimately, the groups with the best-selling records were Cheap Trick, the Knack, the Romantics, Tommy Tutone and Dwight Twilley, whereas Shoes, the Records, the Nerves, and 20/20 only drew cult followings. Writing for &quot;Time&quot; in 1978, Jay Cocks cited Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds as &quot;the most accomplished purveyors of power pop&quot;, which he described as &quot;the well-groomed stepbrother of punk rock&quot;. Edmunds was quoted: &quot;Before the New Wave[...] There was no chance for the little guy who buys a guitar and starts a band. What we&#x27;re doing is kids&#x27; music, really, just four-four time and good songs.&quot; Cheap Trick became the most successful act in the genre&#x27;s history thanks to the band&#x27;s constant touring schedule and stage theatrics. According to Andrew Earles, the group&#x27;s &quot;astonishing acceptance in Japan (documented on 1979&#x27;s &quot;At Budokan&quot;) and hits &#x27;Surrender&#x27; and &#x27;I Want You To Want Me,&#x27; the Trick took power pop to an arena level and attained a degree of success that the genre had never seen, nor would ever see again.&quot;

The biggest chart hit by a power pop band was the Knack&#x27;s debut single, &quot;My Sharona&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six weeks in August–September 1979. However, the song&#x27;s ubiquitous radio presence that summer spawned a popular and critical backlash against the band, which in turn led to a backlash against the power pop genre in general. Once the Knack failed to maintain their commercial momentum, record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups. Most bands of the 1970s milieu broke up in the early 1980s.

==Succeeding waves==
=== 1980s–1990s: Alternative rock ===
In the 1980s and 1990s, power pop continued as a commercially modest genre with artists such as Redd Kross and the Spongetones. The later records of XTC also became a touchstone for bands such as Jellyfish and the Apples in Stereo, while Big Star developed an avid cult following among members of later bands like R.E.M. and the Replacements who expressed esteem for the group&#x27;s work. Many bands who were primarily influenced by Big Star blended power pop with the ethos and sounds of alternative rock. AllMusic cited Teenage Fanclub, Material Issue, and the Posies as &quot;critical and cult favorites&quot;.

In 1991, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Chris Willman identified Jellyfish, the Posies, and Redd Kross as the leaders of a &quot;new wave of rambunctious Power Pop bands that recall the days when moptops were geniuses, songs were around three minutes long and a great hook--a catchy melodic phrase that &quot;hooks&quot; the listener—was godhead.&quot; Members of Jellyfish and Posies said that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. At the time, it was uncertain whether the movement could have mainstream success. Karen Glauber, editor of &quot;Hits&quot; magazine, said that &quot;The popular conception is that these bands are &#x27;retro,&#x27; or not post-modern enough because they&#x27;re not grunge and because the Posies are from Seattle and don&#x27;t sound like Mudhoney.&quot;

Velvet Crush&#x27;s Ric Menck credited Nirvana with ultimately making it &quot;possible for people like Matthew [Sweet] and the Posies and Material Issue and, to some extent, us to get college radio play.&quot; As power pop &quot;gained the attention of hip circles&quot;, many older bands reformed to record new material that was released on independent labels. Chicago label The Numero Group issued a compilation album called Yellow Pills: Prefill, featuring overlooked pop tracks from 1979–1982. For the rest of decade, AllMusic writes, &quot;this group of independent, grass-roots power-pop bands gained a small but dedicated cult following in the United States.&quot;

With the rise of bands like the Apples In Stereo, power pop became a major component of the Elephant 6 music collective&#x27;s identity often mixing with psychedelic and Slacker rock.

=== 1990s–2010s: Continued interest ===

Power pop has had varying levels of success since the 1990s. In 1994, Green Day and Weezer popularized pop-punk, an alternative rock variant genre that fuses power pop harmonies with uptempo punk moods. According to &quot;Louder Than War&quot; Sam Lambeth, power pop has &quot;ebbed and flowed&quot; while remaining an object of critical derision. Despite this, he cites Fountains of Wayne with inspiring &quot;yet another new era for the format&quot; during the late 1990s, &quot;one they&#x27;d perfect with the magnetic &quot;Welcome Interstate Managers&quot; (2003).&quot; He writes that as of 2017, &quot;you can still hear some of power pop&#x27;s core traits in bands such as Best Coast, Sløtface, Diet Cig and Dude York.&quot;

In 1998, International Pop Overthrow (IPO)—named after the album of the same name by Material Issue—began holding a yearly festival for power pop bands. Originally taking place in Los Angeles, the festival expanded to several locations over the years, including Canada and Liverpool, England (the latter event included performances at the Cavern Club). Paul Collins of the Beat and the Nerves hosted the Power Pop-A-Licious music festival in 2011 and 2013, featuring a mixture of classic and rising bands with an emphasis on power pop, punk rock, garage and roots rock. The concerts were held at Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and the Cake Shop in New York City. Paul Collins and his group the Beat headlined the two-day events.

<text>Amasa Leland Stanford (March 9, 1824June 21, 1893) was an American attorney, industrialist, philanthropist, and Republican Party politician from Watervliet, New York. He served as the eighth governor of California from 1862 to 1863 and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1885 until his death in 1893. He and his wife Jane founded Stanford University, named after their late son.

Stanford became a successful merchant and wholesaler after migrating to California in 1852 during the Gold Rush; he built a business empire. He was an influential executive of the Central Pacific Railroad and later of the Southern Pacific railroads from 1861 to 1890; these positions gave him tremendous power in the Western United States which left a lasting impact on California.
He also played a significant role as a shareholder and executive in the early history of Pacific Life and Wells Fargo. He was the first Republican governor of California. Stanford is widely considered a robber baron.

==Early life and career==
Leland Stanford was born in 1824 in what was then Watervliet, New York (now the Town of Colonie). He was one of eight children of Josiah and Elizabeth Phillips Stanford. Among his siblings were New York State Senator Charles Stanford (1819–1885) and Australian businessman and spiritualist Thomas Welton Stanford (1832–1918). His ancestor, Thomas Stanford, settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in the 17th century. Later ancestors settled in the eastern Mohawk Valley of central New York about 1720.

Stanford&#x27;s father was a farmer of some means. Stanford was raised on family farms in the Lisha Kill and Roessleville (after 1836) areas of Watervliet. The family home in Roessleville was called Elm Grove. The Elm Grove home was razed in the 1940s. Stanford attended the common school until 1836 and was tutored at home until 1839. He attended Clinton Liberal Institute, in Clinton, New York, and studied law at Cazenovia Seminary in Cazenovia, New York, in 1841 to 1845. In 1845, he entered the law office of Wheaton, Doolittle, and Hadley in Albany.

After being admitted to the bar in 1848, Stanford moved with many other settlers to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he began a law practice with Wesley Pierce. His father presented him with a law library said to be the finest north of Milwaukee. In 1850, Stanford was nominated by the Whig Party as Washington County, Wisconsin district attorney.

==Businesses==
In 1852, having lost his law library and other property to a fire, Stanford followed his five brothers to California during the California Gold Rush. His wife, Jane, returned (temporarily) to Albany and her family. He went into business with his brothers and became the keeper of a general store for miners in Michigan City, California, later the name changed to Michigan Bluff in Placer County; later he had a wholesale house. He served as a justice of the peace and helped organize the Sacramento Library Association, which later became the Sacramento Public Library. In 1855, he returned to Albany to join his wife, but found the pace too slow after the excitement of developing California.

=== Central Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads ===
 In 1856, he and Jane moved to Sacramento, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. He was one of the four merchants known popularly as &quot;The Big Four&quot; (or among themselves as &quot;the Associates&quot;), who were the key investors in Chief Engineer Theodore Dehone Judah&#x27;s plan for the Central Pacific Railroad. The five of them incorporated it on June 28, 1861, and Stanford was elected as its president. The other three associates were Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins, and Collis P. Huntington. 
The Central Pacific&#x27;s first locomotive, named &quot;Gov. Stanford&quot; in his honor, is preserved on static display at the California State Railroad Museum, in Sacramento.

Stanford ran unsuccessfully for governor of California in 1859. He was nominated again in 1861 and won the election. Due to the Great Flood of 1862, he had to row to his inauguration in a rowboat. He served one term, then limited to two years.

While the Central Pacific was under construction, Stanford and his associates in 1868 acquired control of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Stanford was elected president of the Southern Pacific, a post he held until 1890 (except for a brief period in 1869–1870 when Tevis was acting president) when he was ousted by Collis Huntington.

As head of the railroad company that built the western portion of the &quot;First Transcontinental Railroad&quot; from Sacramento eastward over the Sierra Nevada mountains in California to Nevada and Utah, Stanford presided at the ceremonial driving of &quot;Last Spike&quot; in Promontory, Utah on May 10, 1869. The grade of the CPRR met that of the Union Pacific Railroad, which had been built westward from its eastern terminus at Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska. He was even given the honor of driving the final spike.

Stanford moved with his family from Sacramento to San Francisco in 1874, where he assumed presidency of the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, the steamship line to Japan and China associated with the Central Pacific.

The Southern Pacific Company was organized in 1884 as a holding company for the Central Pacific-Southern Pacific system. Stanford was president of the Southern Pacific Company from 1885 until 1890 when he was forced out of that post (as well as the presidency of the Southern Pacific Railroad) by Collis Huntington, the company&#x27;s ranking vice president and the corporate directorate. That was thought to be retaliation for Stanford&#x27;s election to the US Senate in 1885 over Huntington&#x27;s friend, Aaron A. Sargent.

Stanford was elected chairman of the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s executive committee in 1890, and he held this post and the presidency of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death.

=== Other interests ===
In May 1868, he joined Lloyd Tevis, Darius Ogden Mills, H.D. Bacon, Hopkins, and Crocker in forming the Pacific Union Express Company. It merged in 1870 with Wells Fargo and Company. Stanford was a director of Wells Fargo and Company from 1870 to January 1884. After a brief retirement from the board, he served again from February 1884 to his death in June 1893. Also in May 1868, he started the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company (now Pacific Life) and served as its first president from 1868 to 1876.

He owned two wineries, the Leland Stanford Winery in Alameda County founded in 1869, and run and later inherited by his brother Josiah, and the Great Vina Ranch in Tehama County, containing what was then the largest vineyard in the world at and given to Stanford University.
Stanford was also interested in horses and owned the Gridley tract of in Butte County. In Santa Clara County, he founded his Palo Alto Stock Farm. He bred Standardbred horses to be raced as trotters, including his chief sire, Electioneer (sired by Hambletonian) and his winning offspring: Arion, Sunol, Palo Alto, and Chimes (out of Stanford&#x27;s best known dam Beautiful Bells); and Thoroughbreds for flat racing. In 1872, Stanford commissioned the photographer Eadweard Muybridge to undertake scientific studies of the gaits of horses at a trot and gallop at the Agricultural Park race track in Sacramento. Images of the horses&#x27; feet were captured there, later moving to his Palo Alto Stock Farm. He wanted to determine if the horses ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The result was the proto-film &quot;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&quot; (1878). As the Palo Alto breeding farm was later developed into the Stanford University, the university was nicknamed &quot;The Farm.&quot;

==Politics==
Stanford was politically active and became a leading member of the Republican Party. In 1856, he met with other Whig politicians in Sacramento on April 30 to organize the California Republican Party at its first state convention. He was chosen as a delegate to the Republican Party convention that selected US presidential electors in both 1856 and 1860. Stanford was defeated in his 1857 bid for California state treasurer, and his 1859 bid for the office of governor of California. In 1860, he was named a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, but did not attend. He was elected governor in a second campaign in 1861.

===Governor of California===

He was elected the eighth Governor of California, serving from January 1862 to December 1863, and the first Republican governor. Due to the Great Flood of 1862, the governor was said to have needed to row in a boat to his own inauguration. A large, slow-speaking man who always read from a prepared text, he impressed his listeners as being more sincere than a glib, extemporaneous speaker.

During his gubernatorial tenure, he cut the state&#x27;s debt in half and advocated for the conservation of forests. He also oversaw the establishment of California&#x27;s first state normal school in San Jose, later to become San Jose State University. Following Stanford&#x27;s governorship, the term of office changed from two years to four years, in line with legislation passed during his time in office.

====Native Americans====
The ongoing eradication of the Native Americans living in California continued under his administration. He did sign into law an act reversing part of the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians that allowed the enslavement of Native Americans. However, he also continued the prosecution of the Bald Hills War in Northern California.

====Chinese immigrants====
The gold strike in California had brought a large influx of newcomers into the territory, including Chinese immigrants, who faced persecution. Anti-Chinese sentiment became a political issue over time. In a message to the legislature in January 1862, Governor Stanford said:

Stanford was initially acclaimed for such statements, but lost support when it was revealed that his Central Pacific Railroad was also importing Chinese workers to construct the railroad.

===United States Senator===

Later, he served in the United States Senate from 1885 until his death in 1893. He served for four years as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds and on the Naval Committee. He was president and director of the Central Pacific Railroad the entire time he sat in the Senate. He authored several Senate bills that advanced ideas advocated by the People&#x27;s Party: a bill to foster the creation of worker-owned cooperatives, and a bill to allow the issuance of currency backed by land value instead of only the gold standard. Neither bill made it out of committee. In Washington, DC, he had a residence on Farragut Square near the home of Baron Karl von Struve, Russian minister to the US.

==Stanford University==

With his wife Jane, Stanford founded Leland Stanford Junior University as a memorial for their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who died as a teenager of typhoid fever in Florence, Italy, in 1884 while on a trip to Europe. The university was established by the Endowment Act of the California Assembly and Senate of March 9, 1885, and the Grant of Endowment from Leland and Jane Stanford signed at the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 14, 1885.

The Stanfords donated approximately $40 million (equivalent to approximately $ today) to develop the university, which held its opening exercises on October 1, 1891, and was intended for agricultural studies. Its first student, admitted to Encina Hall that day, was Herbert Hoover, who went on to become the 31st US president. The wealth of the Stanford family during the late 19th century is estimated at $50 million (equivalent to approximately $ today).

Stanford had ideas of Stanford University employee ownership for more than thirty years before giving them expression in his plans for the university, proposals as a senator, and in interviews with the news media.

==Personal life and death==
On September 30, 1850, Stanford married Jane Elizabeth Lathrop in Albany, New York. She was the daughter of Dyer Lathrop, a merchant of that city, and Jane Anne (Shields) Lathrop. The couple did not have any children for years, until their only child, a son, Leland DeWitt Stanford, was born in 1868 when his father was forty-four.

Stanford was an active Freemason from 1850 to 1855, joining the Prometheus Lodge No. 17 in Port Washington, Wisconsin. After moving west, he became a member of the Michigan City Lodge No. 47 in Michigan Bluff, California. He was also a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in California.
The Stanfords retained ownership of their mansion in Sacramento, where their only son was born in 1868. Now the Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park, the house museum is also used for California state social occasions. The Stanfords&#x27; home in San Francisco&#x27;s Nob Hill district was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; the site is now occupied by the Stanford Court Hotel. The Stanford residence at the Palo Alto Stock Farm became a convalescent home for children in 1919 (the forerunner of the Lucille Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital) and was torn down in 1965.

Long-suffering from locomotor ataxia, Leland Stanford died of heart failure at home in Palo Alto, California, on June 21, 1893. He was buried in the family mausoleum on the Stanford campus. Jane Stanford died in 1905 after being poisoned with strychnine.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1862, California volunteer troops re-building a military post at the confluence of the San Pedro River and Aravaipa Creek in Arizona Territory named the post Fort Stanford after the governor. However, the post later reverted to its former name, Fort Breckenridge, and in 1866 became Camp Grant. In 2008, Stanford was inducted into The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts, California Hall of Fame. A relative, Tom Stanford, accepted the honors on his behalf.

The Stanford Memorial Church on the university campus is dedicated to his memory. Mount Stanford, located in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada, is named in his honor. Central Pacific locomotives named for Stanford were:

* &quot;Gov. Stanford&quot;, a 4-4-0 locomotive built in 1863 by the Norris Locomotive Works in Philadelphia and brought to San Francisco by sailing vessel. This engine is preserved at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento
* &quot;El Gobernador&quot;, a 4-10-0 locomotive built in the Central Pacific shops in Sacramento in 1884. Found to be disappointing in its performance as a freight hauler, it was scrapped in July 1894.

Mount Stanford in California&#x27;s John Muir Wilderness is named for Stanford. This mountain, found in Pioneer Basin, is located near other mountains named for robber barons, including Mount Huntington, Mount Hopkins, and Mount Crocker.

<text>Dieppe () is a city in the Canadian maritime province of New Brunswick. Statistics Canada counted the population at 28,114 in 2021, making it the fourth-largest city in the province. On 1 January 2023, Dieppe annexed parts of two neighbouring local service districts; revised census figures have not been released.

Dieppe&#x27;s history and identity goes back to the eighteenth century. Formerly known as Leger&#x27;s Corner, it was incorporated as a town in 1952 under the Dieppe name, and designated as a city in 2003. The Dieppe name was adopted by the citizens of the area in 1946 to commemorate the Second World War&#x27;s Operation Jubilee, the Dieppe Raid of 1942. It is officially a francophone city; with 63.8% of the population mother tongue French, 24% English, 3% French and English, 8% other. A majority of the population reports being bilingual, speaking both French and English. Residents generally speak French with a regional accent (colloquially called &quot;Chiac&quot;) which is unique to southeastern New Brunswick. A large majority of Dieppe&#x27;s population were in favour of the by-law regulating the use of external commercial signs in both official languages, which is a first for the province of New Brunswick. Dieppe is the largest predominantly francophone city in Canada outside Québec; while there are other municipalities with greater total numbers of francophones, they constitute a minority of the population in those cities. Dieppe was one of the co-hosts of the first Congrès Mondial Acadien (Acadian World Congress) which was held in the Moncton region in 1994, and again in 2019.

Dieppe is part of the census metropolitan area of Moncton, which is New Brunswick&#x27;s most populous city, with a metropolitan population of 144,810 according to Statistics Canada in 2016.

== Name ==
In 1910, the area known as French Village became known as Leger&#x27;s Corner which, in turn, became the Village of Dieppe in 1946 to commemorate the Canadian soldiers killed during the landing of Allied troops on Normandy beaches in Dieppe, France, on August 19, 1942. On January 1, 1952, the Village of Dieppe became the Town of Dieppe. On January 1, 2003, the municipality was designated as the City of Dieppe.

==History==

Acadians from the Petitcoudiac and Shepody (French: &quot;Chipoudy&quot;) regions were the first pioneers to settle in the area and founded Sylvabreau in 1730, followed by the Melanson family at Ruisseau-des-Renards (Fox Creek) in 1746 and the LeBlanc and Boudreau families at Chartersville in 1776. Prior to the arrival of Acadian settlers, the southern part of the province was inhabited by the Algonquin people.

=== Sylvabreau/Battle of the Petitcodiac ===
The Battle of the Petitcodiac was fought on September 2, 1755, during the British expulsion of the Acadians, after the capture of Fort Beauséjour. The Massachusetts-British force was soundly defeated by troops from Boishébert, Acadian militia, and First Nations&#x27; warriors. At the mouth of the Nacadie Creek (Hall&#x27;s) settlements such as le Coude (The Bend), Sylvabreau and the surrounding hamlets were destroyed. Even after these raids, Acadians returned to these villages and the numbers grew as the deportation from peninsular Nova Scotia continued, followed by the deportation from present-day Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton. Victory for the British occurred three years later (1758) during the Petitcodiac River Campaign (:fr:La bataille du Cran) which resulted in the deportation of the Acadians that lived along the Petitcodiac River or had taken refuge there from earlier deportation operations.

=== From municipality to town to city ===
Dieppe was known as Upper Village after the Expulsion and was settled by the Surette, Maillet, and Thibodeau families, while Chartersville was called Leblanc&#x27;s Village and also included members of the Boudreau&#x27;s clan. Prior to 1800, Pierre Bourgeois had established himself on the (&quot;Ruisseau des Renards&quot;) Fox Creek salt marsh. Agriculture, forestry and some fishing sustained these Acadian families up until the mid-1800s, when shipbuilding and railways created employment opportunities for Acadians around the Moncton area. After a bridge was completed in 1867 at the mouth of Hall&#x27;s Creek (&quot;Nacadie&quot; during the French settlement at &quot;Le Coude&quot;), a road was constructed that link the incorporated Town of Moncton&#x27;s Westmorland Road (Main Street) to the (French Village) Dieppe area. This road went through farmland that had belong to the Leger family and intersected the old road (Acadie Avenue) that had taken travellers up and around Hall&#x27;s Creek to the community of Lewisville to get to Moncton. By 1900, the little area around the intersection became known as Léger&#x27;s Corner, and with the increasing traffic from the bridge, merchants became attracted to the corner and soon set up shops and services around the intersection. Prior to the First World War, a small residential development was erected, and the community continue to grow until the Second World War. Then a population explosion occurred. Léger&#x27;s Corner received the largest influx of military personnel in southeastern New Brunswick. Ten thousand airmen (due to the airport) and their support staff arrived overnight in 1940, and soon temporary warehouses and housing were erected. When Léger&#x27;s Corner became incorporated as a municipal village in 1946, the community was renamed Dieppe, after a port in France on the English Channel, to honour the 913 Canadian servicemen who took part in the Dieppe Raid, the bloody landing by Allied soldiers, on August 19, 1942, during the Second World War. Then, part of Lakeburn was annexed in 1946 and Dieppe-East in 1948. A referendum (262 for, 232 against) marginally favoured the village to incorporate as the Town of Dieppe in 1952. At that time, Dieppe had over 3,000 inhabitants within its boundaries. Growth continued unabated throughout the 1950s and 1960s as Dieppe annexed the villages of Saint-Anselme and Chartersville and the local service districts of Dover-Fox Creek (Upper Dover), the parish of Dorchester (part), and the parish of Moncton (part), the latter in 1973. With its rural expansion came a growth in population exceeding 8,500 in the 1981 census. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Town of Dieppe, like the rest of the region, went through an economic downfall which limited its growth in population. By 2001, the Greater Moncton area and Dieppe&#x27;s economy flourished and with it came a population increment of nearly 15,000 in 2001 to over 23,000 in 2011. To preserve its heritage, culture and identity as a community in Southern New Brunswick, Dieppe opted to incorporate itself as a city on January 1, 2003. At that time it became New Brunswick&#x27;s eighth incorporated city.

Maps of Dieppe from the 1960s show Champlain Street below Acadie Avenue as Main Street and above the intersection as Airport Road.

==Neighbourhoods==
Dieppe&#x27;s geographic area is a direct union of Acadian parishes and villages such as:

*Léger&#x27;s Corner (French Village) - The downtown area has both retail and entertainment venues. Located near the City Hall are businesses, professionals, banking institutions, office buildings, restaurants, a public square, a cultural centre and a farmers market. The Dieppe Public Library, which is part of the New Brunswick Public Library System, has very modern facilities in the municipal building. The retail sector is predominantly located on Paul and Champlain Streets.
*Chartersville (Leblanc Village) (1776) Congregation Tiferes Israel Cemetery has been a landmark in Chartersville since 1930. A small Protestant cemetery located on an adjacent lot contains only a few tombstones, several of which bear the names of members of the Charters family, descendants of Chartersville founder John Charters. The Charters gave their name to the former village of Chartersville. Also, it is the home of the Our lady of Calvary Cemetery (Cimetere Notre Dame du Calvaire).
*Dieppe Boulevard sector - Located in the northeast area of Dieppe is a fast-growing commercial, business and residential area. This north-south connector stretches from Route 15 through the Dieppe Industrial Park, the Uptown area, the Fox Creek Golf community and several residential areas before ending at Melanson Road. It is less than a kilometre away from Greater Moncton International Airport.
*Fox Creek/Dover (1746) - Up until the early 1980s, a local merchant, Mother&#x27;s Own Bakery (Fox Creek), which subsequently was purchased by the former Ben&#x27;s Bakery, housed its production and retail store in this district. Dover Road school was the educational institution for the region prior to the modernization of the NB School Act. In the early 20th century, a religious sacramental - a Cross and 1755 Bicentennial Grotto - was erected at the intersection of Dover Road and Amirault Street.
*Lakeburn - a neighbourhood directly south of Greater Moncton International Airport with a population of 371, and almost entirely residential. It contains the Boys and Girls Club of Dieppe and a small Corner Store.
*Painsec North
*Saint-Anselme (1820) - former village and the site of the Roman Catholic Church (Saint-Anselm). The original wooden church that replaced the chapel was erected in the early 19th century. The current stone structure was built in the early 1900s.

=== Prominent buildings ===

*Saint Anselme Church is a Romanesque Revival Catholic church located at 1014 Amirault Street in the Saint-Anselme sector of Dieppe. Built at the turn of the 20th century, this rectangular cut-stone structure has a gable roof and two square towers on the front façade. Saint-Anselme Church is designated a Local Historic Place for its religious role and for its architecture. It illustrates the Acadians’ respect for religious and spiritual matters. The church replaced one that had been built in 1839. Originally, a chapel built in 1812, located west of the current Chapelle Street, was used for worship until 1839. Construction work on Saint-Anselme Church began in 1898. The blessing of the church took place on October 11, 1904.
*Saint Teresa of the Infant Jesus Church is a large stone and concrete structure with a bell tower and Gothic windows. This modern interpretation of Gothic Revival religious architecture is located at the corner of Sainte-Thérèse Street and Acadie Avenue in Dieppe. The church highlights the importance of the Catholic Church in the community life of Leger Corner. In 1930, this parish broke away from the parish of Saint-Anselme and built its first church, made of wood. That building was converted into a community centre in 1950 when this new stone church was opened to the public. Sainte-Thérèse Church is recognized for its architecture. This place of worship was built by contractor Abbey Landry of Memramcook from 1949 to 1950. This building exhibits a modern interpretation of traditional Gothic Revival religious architecture. In its Gothic windows, magnificent stained-glass panels illustrate the life of patron Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, a Carmelite nun who died at Lisieux, France in 1897, at the age of 24.
*Joseph-Doiron House is located at 1150 Amirault Street. Built in 1847, the Joseph-Doiron House was once the meeting and celebration place for the Village of St-Anselme. Its basement also served as a school. Joseph Doiron was a literate notary who had been educated in Memramcook by Father Louis Brodeur.

=== Shopping ===

*Champlain Place—The largest single-building shopping centre in Atlantic Canada by floor space (also the largest single-story mall east of Montreal) opened in 1974 and currently has over 150 stores and services with five anchor tenants.

==Transportation==

===Greater Moncton International Airport===
The Greater Moncton International Airport was officially opened in 2002 by Queen Elizabeth II. It is from downtown Dieppe and from Moncton. Moncton Flight College, the largest private flight school in Canada, is at the airport. MFC has trained over 16,000 pilots from around the world since 1929.

===Public transit===

Within Codiac transpo 47 bus fleet, three services Dieppe&#x27;s main arteries and subdivisions seven days a week; in addition to its numerous fleet of Codiac Buses at the Champlain Place terminal. Services to the inner city has been offered since 1984. Services are provided seven days a week with late evening routes and modified weekend hours.

===Roads and bridges===
*Fox Creek Bridge — Inaugurated in 1982, the current bridge replaced the low-rise structure which was built in 1924. Some facts regarding the Fox Creek bridge from the June 8, 1982, edition of &quot;L&#x27;Evangeline&quot; newspaper. The present site of the Fox Creek bridge holds historical facts which dates back to the 1800s. A geographical map of the region made by the English forces shows families with the Amirault surnames living in the area. Later, Acadians built earthen dykes (aboiteau) at Pointe des renards to prevent flooding, which also served as &quot;bridges&quot; for both banks of the river. In 1924, a low-rise bridge was constructed that flooded every two to three years.
*Hall&#x27;s Creek Bridge — The first Hall&#x27;s Creek bridge in Moncton was built in 1867, which link the city with Leger&#x27;s Corner via the Westmorland Road (Main Street). The current structure at the Wheeler Boulevard intersection opened in 1982.
*In the archives at the McCord Museum of Canadian History in Montreal, there is a postcard with the inscription of &quot;Fox Creek Bridge&quot;. This postcard was mailed from Montreal, Quebec, on 23 September 1913 to a Miss Breau at 28 rue Victoria Street Moncton. A closer look seemingly reveals it to be the Halls Creek Bridge. It is unknown when the picture was taken; however, a small portion of downtown Moncton of the time is visible on the postcard.

Both bridges are on Route 106, which follows the original provincial Route 2 from Quebec to Nova Scotia. Through the late 1950s and 1960s, a number of bypasses and realignments, mostly two-lane, were built to improve Route 2 with federal Trans-Canada Highway funds. The first, built in the 1950s, was around Moncton. The old road became Route 2A, but it was renumbered Route 6 in 1965 and 106 in 1984 during a reclassification of provincial highways. It is still signed as Route 6 at the corner of Cameron St. and Main St. (the current Route 106) in downtown Moncton. At Moncton, Route 106 runs through Main Street and passes Hall&#x27;s Creek bridge up to the intersection in centre-ville Dieppe connecting Amirault Street, which leaves the city to the southeast en route to Memramcook. The aforementioned route had a significant impact for the future community of Dieppe has it linked southeast New Brunswick to Nova Scotia prior to the completion of the new Trans-Canada Highway. In addition, it attracted new residents to cultivate the land and build dwellings throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

<doc id="170920" wikidata="Q320999" url="?curid=170920" title="Shiitake">
<text>The shiitake (; Chinese/black mushroom or Lentinula edodes) is a macrofungus native to East Asia, which is cultivated and consumed around the globe.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first described scientifically as &quot;Agaricus edodes&quot; by Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1877. It was placed in the genus &quot;Lentinula&quot; by David Pegler in 1976. The fungus has acquired an extensive synonymy in its taxonomic history:
*&quot;Agaricus edodes&quot; Berk. (1878)
*&quot;Armillaria edodes&quot; (Berk.) Sacc. (1887)
*&quot;Mastoleucomychelloes edodes&quot; (Berk.) Kuntze (1891)
*&quot;Cortinellus edodes&quot; (Berk.) S.Ito &amp; S.Imai (1938)
*&quot;Lentinus edodes&quot; (Berk.) Singer (1941)
*&quot;Collybia shiitake&quot; J.Schröt. (1886)
*&quot;Lepiota shiitake&quot; (J.Schröt.) Nobuj. Tanaka (1889)
*&quot;Cortinellus shiitake&quot; (J.Schröt.) Henn. (1899)
*&quot;Tricholoma shiitake&quot; (J.Schröt.) Lloyd (1918)
*&quot;Lentinus shiitake&quot; (J.Schröt.) Singer (1936)
*&quot;Lentinus tonkinensis&quot; Pat. (1890)
*&quot;Lentinus mellianus&quot; Lohwag (1918)

The mushroom&#x27;s Japanese name is a compound word composed of , for the tree &quot;Castanopsis cuspidata&quot; that provides the dead logs on which it is typically cultivated, and . The specific epithet &quot;&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;edible&quot;.

It is also commonly called &quot;sawtooth oak mushroom&quot;, &quot;black forest mushroom&quot;, &quot;black mushroom&quot;, &quot;golden oak mushroom&quot;, or &quot;oakwood mushroom&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Shiitake grow in groups on the decaying wood of deciduous trees, particularly shii and other chinquapins, chestnut, oak, maple, beech, sweetgum, poplar, hornbeam, ironwood, and mulberry. Its natural distribution includes warm and moist climates in Southeast Asia.

==Cultivation==
The earliest written record of shiitake cultivation is seen in the &quot;Records of Longquan County&quot; () compiled by He Zhan () in 1209 during the Song dynasty in China. The 185-word description of shiitake cultivation from that literature was later cross-referenced many times and eventually adapted in a book by a Japanese horticulturist in 1796, the first book on shiitake cultivation in Japan.
The Japanese cultivated the mushroom by cutting shii trees with axes and placing the logs by trees that were already growing shiitake or contained shiitake spores. Before 1982, the Japan Islands&#x27; variety of these mushrooms could only be grown in traditional locations using ancient methods. A 1982 report on the budding and growth of the Japanese variety revealed opportunities for commercial cultivation in the United States.

Shiitake are widely cultivated worldwide, contributing about 25% of the total yearly production of mushrooms. Commercially, shiitake mushrooms are typically grown in conditions similar to their natural environment on either artificial substrate or hardwood logs, such as oak.

==Toxicity==
Rarely, consumption of raw or slightly cooked shiitake mushrooms may cause an allergic reaction called &quot;shiitake dermatitis&quot;, including an erythematous, micro-papular, streaky pruriginous rash that occurs all over the body including face and scalp, appearing about 24 hours after consumption, possibly worsening by sun exposure and disappearing after 3 to 21 days. This effect – presumably caused by the polysaccharide, lentinan – is more common in East Asia, but may be growing in occurrence in Europe as shiitake consumption increases. Thorough cooking may eliminate the allergenicity.

==Uses==
Fresh and dried shiitake have many uses in East and Southeast Asia. In Chinese cuisine, they are used in many dishes, including soups, braises, and stir-fried vegetable dishes such as Buddha&#x27;s delight. In Japan, they are served in miso soup, used as the basis for a kind of vegetarian &quot;dashi&quot;, and as an ingredient in many steamed and simmered dishes.

Two prized varieties are produced in cooler temperatures: One high-grade variety is called &#x27; () (literally &quot;winter mushroom&quot;) in Chinese, or in Japanese. The most highly prized variety is called &#x27; () (literally &quot;flower mushroom&quot;) in Chinese, due to the flower-like pattern of cracks in the cap. 
===Nutrition===

In a reference serving, raw shiitake mushrooms provide of food energy and are 90% water, 7% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. Raw shiitake mushrooms contain moderate levels of some dietary minerals.

Like all mushrooms, shiitakes produce vitamin D2 upon exposure of their internal ergosterol to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from sunlight or broadband UVB fluorescent tubes.

<doc id="170925" wikidata="Q810807" url="?curid=170925" title="Bathurst, New Brunswick">
<text>Bathurst () is a city in northern New Brunswick with a population of 12,157 and the 4th largest metropolitan area in New Brunswick as defined by Census Canada with a population of 31,387 as of 2021. The City of Bathurst overlooks Nepisiguit Bay, part of Chaleur Bay and is at the estuary of the Nepisiguit River.

On January 1, 2023, Bathurst annexed parts of the local service districts of the parish of Bathurst, Big River, New Bandon-Salmon Beach, and North Tetagouche. The names of communities in the annexed areas remain in use for address purposes. Revised census figures based on the 2023 local governance reforms have not been released.

==Geography==

Bathurst is on Nepisiguit Bay, which is part of Chaleur Bay, at the mouth of four rivers: the Nepisiguit River, the Middle River, Little River, and the Tetagouche River. Two spits of land, Carron Point and Alston Point, form the enclosure for the harbour. Youghall Beach Park lies to the north of town. Bathurst is located 90 km south of Dalhousie, and 90 km north of Miramichi.

The refuse facility of Bathurst is located south of the city, in Allardville. The so-called Red Pine solid waste facility provided by the Chaleur Regional Service Commission serves, in addition to Bathurst, municipalities all over north-eastern New Brunswick. The city&#x27;s sewage treatment plant is located within the harbor, at the northern end of Riverside Drive, behind the Canadian Tire. City water comes from the Middle River.

Several of the salt marshes around Bathurst Harbour play host to a Chaleur Bay-specific butterfly: the Maritime Ringlet, which flies late July to late August.

==Attractions==

*La Promenade Waterfront is cluster of shops, art, boutiques, a visitor information centre, and an outdoor pavilion that hosts a variety of activities throughout the year. There are boardwalks with views of the Nepisiguit Bay. 
*Youghall Beach Park offers swimming, volleyball, and windsurfing. The Bathurst Marina is also located next to the beach.
*Bathurst has a pair of golf courses. 
*Bathurst Hospitality Days is a week-long festival with many activities for the young and old. It includes four nights of concerts, featuring a mix of classic rock, Acadian and maritime music.
*Bathurst Chamber Music Festival is an annual week-long classical music festival which features over 30 emerging musicians and composers from around Canada and abroad. It was created to help build appreciation, as well as to create a necessity for classical music within the community.
*Bathurst is home to the Acadie–Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. 
*Bathurst is home to the Bathurst Bears of the Eastern Canadian Basketball League.

==Government and politics==

Bathurst has a Mayor–council form of government, with seven at-large councillors. Elections are held quadrennially in May, as are all since 2004 local governments in New Brunswick. Mayor Fongemie won over a field of four candidates with 3,064 votes; the next candidate garnered 1,831 votes. In 2016, 21 candidates put their names on the ballot. The minimum number of votes needed for election was 2,347. Councillor Stever won more votes than the Mayor.

At the 2014 New Brunswick general election, 4,367 residents of Bathurst West-Beresford elected Brian Kenny, while 4,431 residents in Bathurst East-Nepisiguit-Saint-Isidore chose Denis Landry. Both are member of the New Brunswick Liberal Association, and both are cabinet ministers in the Brian Gallant government.

Bathurst is a part of the Acadie—Bathurst federal riding, and represented since 2015 in the House of Commons of Canada by Liberal Party of Canada member Serge Cormier.

Bathurst is the county seat of Gloucester County, New Brunswick. As such it is home to the county court house and houses much of the province&#x27;s regional administration.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bathurst had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


===Language===
Bathurst is officially bilingual, (English and French) with English, French, Irish and Scottish heritage. The city is also home to Míkmaq natives, with the Pabineau First Nations (Kekwapskuk) community on the outskirts of the city.

==Community organizations and churches==
Bathurst has many community-based organisations, including:
*Synergies Chaleur
*Royal Canadian Legion, Branch No. 18
*New Brunswick Association for Community Living
*Maison Doucet Hennessy House (an architectural heritage project)
*St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church
*Holy Family Catholic Church
*Bathurst Pastoral Charge First United Church
*Evangel Bathurst Church

==Legend of the Phantom Ship==
The Bay of Chaleur is known for its phantom ship legend, which dates back more than two centuries. The story claims that a sail ship burned in the waters north of the city - possibly from the Battle of the Restigouche - and that the ghost of the vessel and its crew is visible on the water in certain weather and light conditions to this day. Though some believe it is a ghost ship from the Battle of the Restigouche, others believe it is merely caused by heat waves, reflections, or hallucinations. A drawing of a ghost wielding an anchor and two menacing sailors could be seen on the city&#x27;s old welcome sign.

==Climate==

In spite of its coastal position, Bathurst experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with vast seasonal differences in temperature. Summers are warm and humid. Winters are often cold, windy and snowy. Spring and Fall bring chilly to warm temperatures. In fall, late heat waves known as &quot;Indian summer&quot; are a common occurrence.

During winter, snow generally stays on the ground from December until April.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Bathurst was on 19 June 2024, which is also the warmest June temperature ever recorded in the province of New Brunswick. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 9 January 1887 and 19 January 1925.

==History==
Bathurst had been the location of the annual Mi&#x27;kmaq summer coastal community of Nepisiguit prior to European settlement. Europeans first reached the shores of the Baie des Chaleurs when in 1534 it was named by Jacques Cartier. Early settlers from France came to the area in the 17th century in what became part of the colony of Acadia. In 1607 Samuel de Champlain sailed into the Miramichi, and in 1636, Nicolas Denys was granted a seignory by the French crown, apparently the third grant in the colony of Acadie. Jean Jacques Enaud, who hailed from the French Basque Country, was granted in 1638 the seignory at the southeastern gap of the harbor later named Alston Point. Remark is made on William Francis Ganong&#x27;s map of Bathurst Harbour, depicted here at left, of the residence of Nicolas Denys and the seignory of Gobin.

Little is known about the region between the death of Nicholas Denys in 1688 and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), whereby Louis XIV ceded the territory of Acadia to Anne, Queen of Great Britain. Although it was marked as an inlet, the Nepisiguit river was not noted in a British map dated 1744, although by 1755 Thomas Jefferys illustrates the &quot;Nipisiki River&quot; and &quot;Nipisighit Bay&quot;. Historians remark the Battle of the Restigouche in June 1760 (one of the final events in the Seven Years&#x27; War) in the Baie des Chaleurs, and various other incidents as the colony of Nouvelle France expired.

According to Gamaliel Smethurst, a trader who supposedly was permitted there by Governor Murray, the British attempted to remove the remaining scattered Acadians from the Nepisiguit basin and Caraquet in late October 1761. Following the formal fall of this part of Acadia to British control in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, the region saw the arrival of numerous English and Scottish settlers, eager to exploit the region&#x27;s natural resources. Some grants were rewards for good and loyal service with the King&#x27;s arms: for example, Captain Arthur Goold of the Royal Marines was granted 2,000 acres on both sides of the Nepisiguit River mouth on 9 September 1784 in what is now known as East Bathurst.

===1800s===
One of the Scotsmen was Hugh Munro, who arrived in 1794. By 1800, he was the founder of &quot;the first and most ancient establishment&quot; in the timber trade of Nepisiguit Bay. In 1807 Munro was appointed a justice of the peace and judge of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas for Northumberland County, He was first elected as one of the members of the Legislative Assembly for Northumberland County at the general election of 1820, and maintained that office until the dissolution of that body in 1827. In 1828 he was elected to sit in the 9th New Brunswick Legislature when the county of Gloucester was given its first representative.

It seems that the great 1825 Miramichi Fire had a significant impact on the fortunes of Bathurst, for the devastation of 6,000 acres forced northwards many displaced people. This incident was the reason for the subdivision of two new counties, Kent and Gloucester, out of what had been Northumberland County, and in 1826, St. Peter&#x27;s harbour was renamed in honour of the Colonial Secretary, Lord Bathurst.

The first St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church was built in 1825 and consecrated as a place of worship in 1836. The Anglican burial ground near the old post office dates to 1823. The more recent St. George&#x27;s church, which was built in 1864, on King avenue below St. Andrew Street is a nice example of Carpenter Gothic architecture.
The community, which up to 1828 had been named St. Peters, was renamed by the governor, Sir Howard Douglas (1823–1831), in honor of Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst (1762–1834), Secretary of State for the Colonies of the British government.

A man named Cooney wrote in May 1832 that in 1828, Bathurst only contained a few houses, but that four years&#x27; hence it had sprouted a brick courthouse roofed with slate, a gaol, a post office, a few mercantile establishments, and more than 30 homes. What we now know as Riverside Drive was populated by several Francophone families (who are assumed to be the remnants of Captain MacKenzie&#x27;s evacuation) and their &quot;neat little Chapel... and two or three rustic windmills&quot;, presumably for grinding grain. He estimated the population of Bathurst and its harbor area to be more than 600 souls. Economic activities included farming, lumbering, and fishing.

Joseph Cunard, attracted by the county&#x27;s timber resources, set up a branch of his family&#x27;s shipbuilding firm here at some time after the great fire in Miramichi of 1825. By 1828, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as representative for Northumberland County, and was variously a justice of the peace and served on the board of health. Joseph&#x27;s brother Samuel Cunard was also a landowner in Bathurst. Cunard purchased the Gould grant in 1837 and his production of ships in Bathurst harbor began in earnest. The age of timber ships began its decline in 1848 with the 1848 launch of Brunel&#x27;s SS Great Britain, the revolutionary iron-hulled steamship. This event caused Joseph&#x27;s shipbuilding firm to founder, and with it went New Brunswick&#x27;s economy. Samuel went on to manage the Cunard Line. A shipbuilder who followed in Cunard&#x27;s wake by the name of John O&#x27;Brien built more than 60 ships from 1858 to 1877. Ship&#x27;s carpenters, spar and mast makers, adzemen and other tradesmen were paid up to five dollars per day. It was not unusual during the heyday of Bathurst shipbuilding to see anywhere from five to fifteen ships in various stages of construction along the waterfront.

A stagecoach service between Bathurst and Chatham was launched by James Foran in 1832. Others, like James Waitt, James MacBeath, William Branch and John Rennie soon opened competition.

&quot;Delirium tremens occasioned by the abuse of ardent spirits&quot; caused at least one untimely death in 1831. So it was in 1832 that a Temperance Society was organized in New Bandon, a small town east of Bathurst. Upwards of 50 persons attended.

The first full-time local doctor, Sam Bishop, arrived in 1833; a contemporary of his was known as Robert Gordon. Bishop and Gordon would conduct vaccination clinics throughout the county in 1841 when an epidemic of small pox struck. The third doctor to set up a local practice (but not until 1871) was Gideon Mitchell Duncan.

The Gloucester County Grammar School, later known as the Bathurst Grammar School, opened its doors on 1 October 1835 under the direction of Charles Lloyd. He provided room and board for 24 pounds per annum if the student was under 10 years of age; older students were charged two pounds more. At least two private schools were active elsewhere in the county during the same era.

The town map of 1836 shows &quot;public landing&quot; government docks at the water end of the four downtown streets, Douglas, King, Murray, and Black (now Main), as well as the western end of Water (now Main) Street. The town extends as far south as Munro Street; glebe lots were located between King and Murray, south of Munro.

In the mid-19th century Gloucester County, settlers who petitioned the province for 50 or 100-acre parcels of land were required in order to obtain their grant: to homestead this land for three years, that is, to build a house on it and eventually to cultivate four acres on it.

Charles Lanman wrote in 1856 of fly fishing for salmon in the Nepisiguit that &quot;It has not its superior in the world. It is a marvelous river.&quot; The hire in that era of a river guide with expert local knowledge cost one dollar a day. For this sum, the employers would be transported with their bags to the salmon pools, would have their meals cooked for them, flies tied for them, rods repaired for them, and clothes washed for them. Presumably, their tents would be pitched for them as well.

Samuel Napier, who had grown up in Bathurst, discovered on 14 August 1857 the 145-pound gold &quot;Napier Nugget&quot; somewhere in the Australian state of Victoria. He later represented Gloucester County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1870 to 1874, replacing shipbuilder John Meahan.

The estimated population of the Parish of Bathurst in 1847, the year before the bankruptcy of Joseph Cunard, was 2,605. By 1871 it had apparently shrunk to 600.

One report from 1851 states that 2,000 tons of hay; 3,500 bushels of wheat; 1,500 bushels of barley; 16,700 bushels of oats, 700 bushels of buckwheat; and 10 bushels of Indian corn were produced in the area.

It appears that electors from Bathurst and the wider Gloucester County were not in favour of Confederation. Residents of a harbour that in addition thrived as a shipbuilding center could see little advantage in tying themselves to the anchor that was at the time the United Provinces of Canada. They were instead focused on trade with the United Kingdom and its Atlantic colonies, in addition to any nation which had an Atlantic seaport, including especially the American seaboard states; shipments of lumber, deals or laths were common enough to Manhattan NY.

In the 19th century, men were eager to fell trees in the forest around
Bathurst all winter long from sunup to sundown (Sundays excepted) for
eight to ten dollars a month. Timber camps typically
housed 50 men, who were each employed in one of several job descriptions. The telephone was but a distant dream, and weekends were spent at the camp. Spare time was kept to a minimum, but fiddlers and other musicians developed nonetheless by dint of isolation.

The population of the Parish of Bathurst in 1861 was 3,771 souls, of
whom 292 were farmers, and 1,071 were children between the ages of six
and sixteen. Eighty years before the introduction of mandatory
attendance, only 483 of these attended school. Agriculture was the
primary occupation of the denizens, and potatoes were the crop of
choice. There were one hydraulic grist mill, and one saw mill. The
Anglican faith counted 569 devotees, the Presbyterian 573, the
Methodist 241, and the Roman Catholic
2,371.

The Annual Report of the Department of Fisheries for 1868 lists a so-called &quot;Marine Hospital&quot; in Bathurst, and the place of work for a Fisheries Officer. Bathurst once had a fish processing plant. Navigation in this County consisted of the carrying of wood, fish and grindstones from Bathurst to Britain, ports of the Dominion, Newfoundland, Miquelon, the United States, South America and Italy. In the wood trade, Bathurst employed in 1868 vessels of from 50 to 1,200 tons. The beacons at that time were unlit, a cause of some concern.

In 1871 Bathurst had a population of 600.

On 14 December 1872, Justice William End was assassinated, likely by a ruffian whom he had earlier jailed for four months. The suspect left Bathurst soon afterwards and was never apprehended.

Bathurst Grammar School became graded in 1874.

Hollywood film actor Sam de Grasse was born here in 1875.

The opening of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada in 1876 (shown at the left hand side in the Ganong map) provided a fast connection from the port of Bathurst to the rest of North America which was essential for developing the region&#x27;s principal industries in forestry and zinc mining. For example, the St. Lawrence Lumber Co., which is depicted in the Ganong map at the mouth of the Nepisiguit River, was managed in the late 19th century by Kennedy Francis Burns of Miramichi.

W.J. Kent opened his eponymous department store in 1884 on Main Street.

In 1886, after a fire had destroyed its Temperance Hall, the Roman Catholic Church began construction of what is now known as the Sacré-Coeur Cathedral. The diocese of Chatham was removed to Bathurst in 1938, and what had been up til then a church now became a cathedral.

===1900s===
Even as late as 1900, the Sacred Heart Academy had outdoor toilets; modern water facilities from Carter&#x27;s Brook to a 200 ft AMSL tank on Murray Avenue were provided to the newly formed Town only after August 1916; a sewer system was installed at the same time, although the date of sanitary service installation at the Academy is unknown.
The imposing (county) courthouse and jail at St. Patrick Street—built from the same Connolly (Nepisiquit) quarry granite as other official buildings of the period—dates from 1900. This replaced an earlier, and more modest, wood-frame building. The jail function has been decommissioned for some years, in favour of the provincial facility at Dalhousie.

In 1904 Bathurst was a seaport, a port of entry on the Intercolonial Railway and the Caraquet and Gulf Shore Railway and a town with a post office, 35 stores, six hotels, a steam sawmill, a shingle mill, a flour mill, three fish freezers, two carriage factories, a printing shop, three churches and a population of 3,000. A boy of fifteen, fresh out of school, could earn $18.00 per month &quot;to work in the woods&quot;. That year, John P. Leger formed a private venture called the Bathurst Electric and Water Power Company, with aim to erect and operate at Tetagouche River Falls a hydro-electric plant. Electricity had arrived in Bathurst, twenty-two years after the Pearl Street Station had illuminated New York.
The Northern New Brunswick and Seaboard Railway can lay claim to be the
railway company with the fewest miles of standard gauge
track in history. The province empowered it in 1904 to lay track
between Nepisiguit Junction and Grand Falls, a distance of 16 miles,
to serve the short-lived Drummond Iron Mines. It would serve, for several years from 1920, to ferry construction materials to the (Nepisiguit) Grand Falls hydroelectric power dam.

The &quot;Annie R.&quot; plied her trade between Bathurst, Carron Point and Youghall
Beach early in the 20th century (before private motorized transport became the norm) under the command of Jack Stever. The return fare from Bathurst to either of the points was a
quarter. She was equipped with a steam boiler, was 36 feet long with a
beam of eight feet and built in Bathurst. Owned by John Rennie, then
foreman of the Caraquet Railway, the boat was built in George Eddy&#x27;s
mill by Joe Stackhouse of Saint John while he was engaged in the
construction of the Nepisiguit Lumber Co. sawmill.

In 1911, James Hamet Dunn, who was born in West Bathurst in 1874, returned to Bathurst to endow its first hospital, on the Riverside Drive grounds of what was once a Doctor&#x27;s office. It burned to the ground in 1917, and an expanded 35-bed structure was rebuilt in its place. The hospital eventually would grow to 60 bed capacity, and house a school of nursing. Damaged by fire in January 1951, the Dunn Hospital would pass into collective memory.

Bathurst was incorporated as a town in 1912, following a poll of ratepayers and property holders conducted on 30 May that year in which a majority vote of 195 to 54 determined the outcome. The first election occurred on 11 September, and the budget for the first year was fixed at $8 million. The town of Bathurst&#x27;s first mayor was Patrick J. Burns, who has a street (along Coronation Park) named after him.

The civic expansion happened just prior to the closure in 1913 of the decade-old Drummond Mines Limited iron mine at the Bathurst Mining Camp. The arrival of water and sewer service to individual residences occurred in 1915, too late for the blaze on 28 April 1914 that consumed 35 buildings. Most of downtown was a blackened disaster zone. The Drummond Mine property was eventually acquired by the Dominion Steel and Coal Company, who operated it more successfully.

The Bathurst Power and Paper Company Ltd. built a mill in Bathurst, New Brunswick in 1914. Majority control of the company was obtained in the late 1930s by Arthur J. Nesbitt and his partner Peter A. T. Thomson through their holding company, Power Corporation of Canada. In the early 1960s, Power Corporation bought the Consolidated Paper Company. When Paul Desmarais acquired control of Power Corporation in 1968, the two companies were merged to become Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. By far the largest private employer in the city for many years, Consolidated-Bathurst in 1977 employed 586 people. In 1989, the company was sold to Stone Container Corporation of Chicago, Illinois who renamed it Stone Consolidated Inc.

Herman Good, by then a corporal in the Royal Highlanders, earned a Victoria Cross in the Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918.

A man employed by the Bathurst Company Limited to saw shingles could earn $1 an hour during the 1920s. By the height of the depression in 1933 a project to pave Main Street paid the same worker $2 a day.

Peter Veniot, the owner since 1891 of Bathurst&#x27;s French-language newspaper was the first Acadian premier of the province of New Brunswick. He succeeded upon resignation Walter Foster as Premier in 1923, after a varied career in provincial government and as a civil servant. As Minister of Public Works in the Foster cabinet, Veniot was responsible for the creation of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, latterly NB Power. He was a supporter of the Maritime Rights Movement, which advocated more power for the Maritime provinces in Canadian confederation. His government was defeated in the 1925 provincial election, and he went on to become a Minister in the cabinet of Mackenzie King. All that remains of the newspaper which for a time he owned—the &quot;Courier des Provinces Maritimes&quot;—is a nameplate on its building at 174 St. Andrew Street, which was latterly converted to a rooming house.

 In 1921 the College Sacre-Coeur, a Roman Catholic residential high school for Acadians, was relocated to Bathurst from its previous home in Caraquet. The anglophone Bathurst High School was founded in 1926, with the closure of the Grammar School which had outgrown its premises on St. Andrew Street.

Bathurst Harbour was a busy place early in the Twentieth century. One might find schooners or ships in port, likely as not to board grindstones from the Reid firm, or milled lumber. Tugboats were employed to haul quarried limestone, or timber, which floated behind them between booms, from the Gaspé Peninsula. A steel tug, the &quot;Ste. Anne&quot;, in one trip could haul as many as 6,000 cords to its home at the pulp mill. She measured 135 feet with a beam of 29 feet and a draft of 16 feet making 465 tons. She was powered by a 1,200 horsepower coal-fired steam engine. The &quot;Francis Huntley&quot;, a wooden tug, was owned by a partnership between the Gloucester Lumber Company and White &amp; Rogers Co, and was used to boom timber from the mouth of the Bass River to a mill at White&#x27;s Wharf.

A sanatorium for the care of tuberculosis patients was opened in May 1931. Named &quot;Our Lady of Lourdes of the Lady Dunn Institution&quot;, it was endowed by Sir James Dunn (as he then was called) and his wife. It was entrusted by deed to the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, and located at Vallee Lourdes just north of the town on a 1,000 acre farm which today houses the Chaleur Regional Hospital.

The village bridge, which was badly in need of repair, was reconstructed at the height of Great Depression by the province.

Sail power was employed for commercial purposes even as late as the 1930s for shipments whose origin was Bathurst, such as lumber.

On 27 September 1943, German spy Wolfgang Heyda, who had been interned in Bowmanville, Ontario, evaded capture in Montreal and Bathurst, but finally was caught in Grande-Anse. He had been scheduled to rendez-vous at the Maisonette lighthouse with a German U-boat, but the plan was foiled by the military, whose intelligence services had alerted them to the German plan. In the end, the U-boat got away.

For several years during the 1940s, Bathurst was home to Louis Robichaud, while he studied at the College Sacre-Coeur, in order to study for the Juvénat Saint-Jean-Eudes. He demurred from the priestly vocation and, after a period at Laval University, instead studied law by correspondence at UNB while he articled at a Bathurst law firm. He met the woman who later became his wife in 1950 here at a wedding.

Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, visited Bathurst on her cross-Canada tour in 1951. The same year saw the installation of an artificial ice surface at the hockey barn near the paper mill: a levy was voted for this purpose at the special meeting of Town Council on 11 September, which followed a plebiscite on the issue.
In April 1954, a new 80-foot antenna broadcast CHSJ signals to Bathurst from New Brunswick&#x27;s only television station in Saint John. From 1958 onwards, the francophone CHAU station would broadcast on Channel 5 from its transmitter on Mount St. Joseph near Carleton, Quebec. Radio came to Bathurst in 1955, on CKBC run by the Bathurst Broadcasting Company.

Sacred Heart University awarded &quot;local boy made good&quot; Sir James Dunn an honorary Social Science doctorate in May 1954. The institution had been granted the power to confer degrees by a 1940 Act of Parliament, which lasted until in 1974 the Board of Directors transferred control to the provincial government of Richard Bennett Hatfield, and it became known as the Bathurst Community College. Immature students and malcontented professors had in effect forced this change on the Board.

The fill for the Queen street causeway was obtained from the excavations of the lower reservoir. The Town of Bathurst provided one third of the funds, while the government of Hugh John Fleming provided the other two thirds. The project, which begun in 1955, took two years to complete.

Edward Byrne, KC, who had been Mayor of Bathurst from April 1949 to April 1951, was asked to chair the &quot;Royal Commission on Finance and Municipal Taxation in New Brunswick&quot; in 1960 by Robichaud, who then was Premier. He completed his report on November 4, 1963, and Robichaud later used his work to justify monumental changes in how the province is run.

A petition was presented to the provincial government on 15 March 1960 to request the transformation of the town into a city, after an affirmative vote was produced by ratepayers within the town and outlying districts.

Construction of the present airport near South Tetagouche was begun in 1964 as a project funded by the Town of Bathurst and Gloucester county municipalities. Lights were installed along the 4,000 by 75 foot paved runway in 1968.
Bathurst was meanwhile incorporated as a city, the province&#x27;s sixth, in 1966; hunters were dismayed because the increased size of the city meant, ipso facto, that they were expropriated.

In 1972, the Bathurst Alpine Papermakers won the Hardy Cup, defeating The Rosetown Red Wings 3–0 at the old Bathurst Arena. The Hardy cup was the Canadian national Intermediate &quot;A&quot; ice hockey championship from 1967 until 1984.

The area of the City in 1978 was , while the taxable area was ; the city counted 154 people as employees. The mill rate was 1.0123, the number of water meters was 2,480, and the population was 16,301. The city in 1978 had about of pipe in its water network. Storm and sanitary sewers were, at the time, combined in some areas. Septic tanks were, and are still, used in some outlying areas.

In 1998, the decrepit 1920s-vintage hockey barn near the pulp mill was torn down, and replaced by a modern facility named the K. C. Irving Centre. Laval Titan QMJHL franchise relocated to Bathurst, taking the name Acadie–Bathurst Titan.

===2000s===
The Nepisiguit Centennial Museum/Cultural Centre (established 1967) was designated in October 2005 a local historic place under the provincial Community Planning Act. The Herman J. Good V.C Branch No.18 Royal Canadian Legion War Museum (established 1956) was designated in December 2005 a local historic place.

On the evening of 27 March 2015, the Munro St. home of the Bathurst Agricultural Society—which had celebrated its 125th anniversary the previous year—was destroyed by fire. The society had been formed on 3 May 1853 to assist farmers by providing education, seeds and purebred livestock, and in as of 2014 sold a variety of agricultural-related products including livestock feed. The Bathurst Farmer&#x27;s Market, which had been housed in the same building, eventually moved to near the old Post Office building on Main St. The Society was quickly re-housed in the former location of Save Easy on Rough Waters Drive.

On the evening of 27 November 2015, a fire destroyed four historic commercial buildings at the corner of Main Street and King Avenue. Fifty people in apartments above the stores lost everything and prominent office space was destroyed, including buildings that housed Birds Eye View pet store, Au Cafe Gourmet, local fabric store Christie&#x27;s, the old stone-faced Bank of Montreal, and a wine bar. All the animals in the pet store perished, and electricity service was temporarily suspended to about 450 NB Power customers in the area. Mayor Stephen Brunet said it was a busy and successful corner: &quot;Every building was part of the history of downtown and there for many, many years. It&#x27;s going to be a big hole in downtown.&quot; The previous week, an abandoned building down the street on King Avenue was destroyed by fire, causing Mayor Brunet concerns. The Downtown Bathurst Revitalization Corporation and the local chapter of the Canadian Red Cross were active in the efforts to support the afflicted. The fire was believed to have started at the back of the pet shop. On 5 August 2016, 53-year-old Perry Kinsman was arrested and charged with one count of arson after over nine months of investigation.

==Economy==
The Bathurst Mining Camp provided for almost 50 years a lot of jobs to the regional economy. The Brunswick Mine facility closed in April 2013. Unemployment hit over 20% in northern New Brunswick in March 2013 as a result.

Bathurst is located, and has a station, on the Canadian National railway line. Via Rail provides a Wednesday, Friday and Sunday passenger service in both directions. The economy is primarily focused on mining, fishing and forestry. Other sectors include: tourism, phone call centres, manufacturing, and provincial and federal government.
The service sector is the city&#x27;s largest employer. The city is serviced by one health care facility, Chaleur Regional Hospital.

A regional Tax Services Canada and a Transport Canada Marine Safety Service centre are in the old downtown. Bathurst Marina is listed as an official Port of Entry for small vessels. It is listed as a non-compulsory pilotage zone. The port authority was transferred in February 2003 to a private consortium, after which on 21 September 2006 the port was delisted from the Canada Marine Act along with other ports on the North Shore of the province which by then had fallen into disuse. Bathurst is located 50 km south of the deep-water Port of Belledune, where a petroleum tank farm and a coal-fired electrical generating station are located.

On December 17, 2010, it was determined that an environmental assessment was required in relation to an expansion of a sawmill project because the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency considered providing financial assistance to the proponent. The project consists of building an expansion of approximately 297 square meters (m2) that will be added to the existing building of approximately 372 m2.

Bathurst Airport accommodates general aviation.

The Smurfit-Stone paper mill (formerly part of the Power Corporation of Canada empire) ceased operations in 2009, and the plant is in process of being demolished. The 225ac of industrial wasteland was sold on in January 2010 to the Green Investment Group partners. Their goal is to create innovative, alternative energy projects that enhance the Bathurst region and Northern New Brunswick. The plan anticipates attracting companies that utilize technologies focusing on energy generation, alternative fuels and waste-to-energy conversion. The property was as of July 2015 in violation of the city&#x27;s dangerous and unsightly premises bylaw, but the owner is located outside the country, and was unwilling to deal with the property despite being given final notice by the city. There were almost $1 million in back taxes and environmental reclamation costs associated with the former mill site as of July 2015. The provincial Department of Environment and Local Government Minister, Brian Kenny, issued a ministerial order, which required the company to clean up the site within 120 days, but the deadline passed on 14 August, so the file was passed on to the Attorney-General in order to determine whether charges would be laid.

GDF Suez operates the inland Caribou Wind Park energy farm approximately 70 km west of Bathurst under a power purchase agreement scheme contracted with NB Power, with a nominal power output of 100MW.

==Notable people==
The BBC&#x27;s chief international news correspondent Lyse Doucet and her sister, the sociologist Andrea Doucet, are natives of Bathurst.
Sir James Dunn, of Algoma Steel and Canada Steamship Lines fame, was born in West Bathurst.

==External relations==

The city of Bathurst is twinned with:
* Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados - many soldiers of the North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment gave their lives on D-day in the Normandy campaign of the Second World War; it was the fulcrum between Juno beach and Sword beach.
* Houma, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish is one location of the Acadian diaspora, that eventually grew into the Cajun culture of the American south.

<doc id="170927" wikidata="Q134859" url="?curid=170927" title="Whooping cough">
<text>Whooping cough ( or ), also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by two or three months of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The violent coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase &quot;100-day cough&quot;. The cough may be so hard that it causes vomiting, rib fractures, and fatigue. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods when they cannot breathe. The incubation period is usually seven to ten days. Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.
The bacterium &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; causes pertussis, which is spread easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This sample can then be tested either by culture or by polymerase chain reaction.
Prevention is mainly by vaccination with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age, with four doses to be given in the first two years of life. Protection from pertussis decreases over time, so additional doses of vaccine are often recommended for older children and adults. Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease, antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms, but otherwise have little effect in most people. In pregnant women and children less than one year old, antibiotics are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions for the cough, other than antibiotics, is poor. About 50% of infected children less than a year old require hospitalization and nearly 0.5% (1 in 200) die.
An estimated 16.3 million people worldwide were infected in 2015. Most cases occur in the developing world, and people of all ages may be affected. In 2015, pertussis resulted in 58,700 deaths – down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Outbreaks of the disease were first described in the 16th century. The bacterium that causes the infection was discovered in 1906. The pertussis vaccine became available in the 1940s.

==Signs and symptoms==

The classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis makes it almost half as likely.

The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms including mild coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose (known as the catarrhal stage). After one or two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, sometimes followed by a high-pitched &quot;whoop&quot; sound, as the person tries to inhale. About 50% of children and adults &quot;whoop&quot; at some point in diagnosed pertussis cases during the paroxysmal stage. This stage usually lasts up to 3 months, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. A decrease in paroxysms of coughing marks this stage, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis.

Symptoms of pertussis can be variable, especially between immunized and non-immunized people. Immunized people can present with a milder infection; they may only have the paroxysmal cough for a couple of weeks and may lack the &quot;whooping&quot; characteristic. Although immunized people have a milder form of the infection, they can still spread the disease to others who are not immune.

===Incubation period===
The time between exposure and the development of symptoms is on average 7–14 days (ranging 6–20 days), and rarely as long as 42 days.

==Cause==
Pertussis is caused by the bacterium &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;. It is an airborne disease (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.

===Host species===
Humans are the only host species of &quot;B. pertussis.&quot; Outbreaks of whooping cough have been observed among chimpanzees in a zoo and wild gorillas; in both cases, it is considered likely that the infection was acquired as a result of close contact with humans. Several zoos have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.

==Mechanism==
After the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, including filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin, mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply. In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs.

The bacteria secrete several toxins. Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a fragment of peptidoglycan, kills ciliated epithelial cells in the airway and thereby inhibits the mechanism which clears the airways of mucus and debris. TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis. Pertussis toxin causes lymphocytosis by an unknown mechanism. The elevated number of white blood cells leads to pulmonary hypertension, a major cause of death by pertussis. In infants who develop encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to hypoxia.

==Diagnosis==
===Based on symptoms===
A physician&#x27;s overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis. Single factors are much less useful. In adults with a cough of less than 8 weeks, vomiting after coughing or a &quot;whoop&quot; is supportive. If there are no bouts of coughing or there is a fever the diagnosis is unlikely. In children who have a cough of less than 4 weeks vomiting after coughing is somewhat supportive but not definitive.

===Lab tests===
Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet–Gengou medium), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test). The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period. However, PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.

Serology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibodies against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of &quot;B. pertussis&quot; are present at high levels in the person&#x27;s blood.

===Differential diagnosis===
A similar, milder disease is caused by &quot;B. parapertussis&quot;.

==Prevention==
The primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms. Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).

=== Vaccine ===
Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002.

The multi-component acellular pertussis vaccine is 71–85% effective, with greater effectiveness against more severe strains. Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations. It remains &quot;one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries&quot;. The 21st-century resurgence in pertussis infections is attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines.

Immunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.

An effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1–9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for &quot;B. pertussis&quot; and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine.

Infection induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time. A 2005 study said estimates of the duration of infection-acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could be the result of differences in levels of circulating &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The study said protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4–12 years. One study suggested that the availability of vaccine exemptions increases the number of pertussis cases.

Some studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines effectively prevent disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all. Pertussis infection in these persons may be asymptomatic, or present as illness ranging from a mild cough to classic pertussis with persistent cough (i.e., lasting more than 7 days). Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, those who are infected may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants. Older persons are often found to have the first case in a household with multiple pertussis cases and are often the source of infection for children.

== Treatment ==

The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.

A reasonable guideline is to treat people aged more than a year within three weeks of cough onset, infants aged less than one year, and pregnant women within six weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating &quot;B. pertussis&quot; with fewer and less severe side effects.

People with pertussis are most infectious during the first two weeks following the onset of symptoms.
Effective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed. The use of over-the-counter cough medications is discouraged and has not been found helpful.

== Prognosis ==
While most healthy older children and adults fully recover, infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of US infants under one year of age. First-year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as apneas (31%), pneumonia (12%), seizures (0.6%) and encephalopathy (0.15%). This may be due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system.

==Epidemiology==

Pertussis is endemic worldwide. More than 151,000 cases were reported globally in 2018. However not all cases are reported or correctly diagnosed, especially in developing countries. Pertussis is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide. A study in 2017 estimated the global burden of the disease to be 24 million cases per year with 160,000 deaths among young children, with about 90% of all cases occurring in developing countries.

Epidemics of the disease occur cyclically, every three to 5 years, both in areas with vaccination programs and those without. Over time, immunity declines in those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from infection. In addition, infants are born who are susceptible to infection. An epidemic can occur once herd immunity decreases below a certain level. It is also possible that the bacterium is evolving to evade vaccine-induced immunity.
Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. With the widespread introduction of the DTP combined vaccine (diphtheria tetanus and pertussis) in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976, when they fluctuated between 1,000 and 30,000 annually.

Cases recorded outside of the U.S. were also recorded at high numbers comparable to their populations. Before the vaccine was discovered, Sweden averaged nearly 3,000 children deaths per year. With their population only being 1.8 million in the years 1749-64 this number was very high. The London population during the same period recorded over 3,000 deaths. The rates in London continued to grow into the 18th century. These numbers show how the disease affected not only the U.S. but also those around the world.

According to the CDC, reports that cases of whooping cough have reached their highest levels since 2014. This year, there have been over 16,000 cases, marking a fourfold increase compared to last year’s total of more than 3,700 cases. The CDC has also confirmed two deaths related to the illness. The United States is seeing a return to pre-pandemic trends, where annual cases typically exceed 10,000.

==History==
=== Discovery ===
&quot;B. pertussis&quot; was discovered in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou (the bacterium is subsequently named &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; in honour of Jules Bordet). They were able to successfully culture &quot;B. pertussis&quot; and went on to develop the first inactivated whole-cell vaccine in 1912, followed by other researchers in 1913 and 1914. These early vaccines had limited effectiveness. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital. In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale. Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea, however, two children died shortly after receiving the vaccine.

=== Vaccine ===

In 1932, an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years, her work was published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly &amp; Company, she developed the first safe and effective pertussis vaccine. In 1942, American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by &quot;B. pertussis&quot;. Sato&#x27;s acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of &quot;B. pertussis&quot; and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.

<text>Campbellton is a city in Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada.

Situated on the south bank of the Restigouche River opposite Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec, Campbellton was officially incorporated in 1889 and achieved city status in 1958.

Forestry and tourism are major industries in the regional economy, while a pulp mill in the Campbellton community of Atholville is the largest single employer in the area. As part of the tourism &quot;industry&quot;, wealthy sportfishermen seeking Atlantic salmon flock to the scenic Restigouche Valley every summer. The region sees extensive annual snowfall. Alpine and Nordic ski facilities at Sugarloaf Provincial Park provide winter recreation opportunities for both visitors and local residents. Campbellton is also a local retail and service centre.

On 1 January 2023, Campbellton amalgamated with the villages of Atholville and Tide Head, the local service district (LSD) of Glencoe and parts of four other LSDs; its new population was estimated at 12,000 using 2021 census data. The names of the annexed communities remain in official use.

==History==

The area around the site of the present city was settled by French people circa 1700 with a trading post based upon fishing and fur trading with the Mi&#x27;gmaq. More settlers arrived here when Ile St. Jean was lost to the French as the result of the capitulation of Louisbourg in 1758. The area has had numerous names over the centuries: originally called Wisiamkik (muddy spot) by the Mi&#x27;kmaq who inhabited the region, it was then named Pointe-des-Sauvages by the French in 1700 and subsequently Pointe-Rochelle, Cavenik&#x27;s Point, Kavanagh&#x27;s Point, Quiton&#x27;s Point and Martin&#x27;s Point, before settling in 1833 with its current name in honour of Lieutenant-Governor Sir Archibald Campbell.

===Battle of the Restigouche===

It was here that the Battle of the Restigouche, the final naval battle between the English and French for the possession of North America during the Seven Years&#x27; War, was waged in 1760. It marked a turning point for the settlement.
Robert Ferguson and the development of Campbellton and Atholville
owed their development to the enterprising immigrants from Scotland. In 1769, only nine years after the Battle of Restigouche, Scotsman Hugh Baillie and a partner set up a fur and salted salmon business on the site that would become Campbellton. The business was sold to London merchant John Shoolbred, who in 1773 established the first British settlement on the Restigouche. His agent, William Smith, brought over eight Scottish fishermen from Aberdeen, Scotland, to work for him. Two of these fishermen were John Duncan and Robert Adams, who brought their families with them as well. These two fishermen devoted themselves to the salmon fishing industry at Old Church Point, today Atholville. In 1794, a Scotsman from Perth named Alexander Ferguson settled in Martin&#x27;s Point (Campbellton), where his brother Robert joined him two years later.

===From settlement to town===

Considered the founder of Restigouche County, Robert Ferguson established his control over the development of northern New Brunswick during the first half of the 19th century. In 1803, Ferguson inherited his brother&#x27;s business and quickly became the largest merchant and exporter of fish in Restigouche. Until the 1840s, he shipped between 1,200 and 1,400 barrels of salted salmon per year. He became the most important landowner in the region. He also operated a flour mill and a sawmill and exported hewn wood. He even constructed his own boats in the village that now bears the name of Atholville. In 1812, he built an impressive residence there that he named Athol House in memory of his native region of Scotland.

In 1875, the advent of the Intercolonial Railway, and a permanent railway station in 1876, had a strong impact on Campbellton. Its population increased rapidly, reaching 1,800 in 1891, and development of the settlement shifted westward. In 1889, Campbellton was incorporated as a town, and in the late 1880s, an Hôtel Dieu was founded by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, an order that established hospitals and schools in many towns in Canada.

===The Great Fire===

On 11 July 1910, a disastrous fire sparked by a sawmill on the waterfront destroyed a large portion of the town. The fire was spread throughout the town by flaming shingles. Prior to the fire its population was approaching 4,000 citizens and help came from near and far to provide food and supplies in order to come to their aid. Most of the people had to live in tents while plans to rebuild were being prepared. Campbellton was subsequently rebuilt. In the months and years following the fire, many of the new (now historic) buildings were constructed of brick as Water Street had been designated a &quot;Fire District&quot; where all new buildings had to be built with fireproof exterior walls.

===Growth of the City===

Following the fire, the railway station was moved to Roseberry St. and helped to define Campbellton in its early years. The town was bidding to become the leading commercial center in the North Shore and had three banks, five churches, two schools, 6 hotels and a hospital by the 1920s. At this time Campbellton was seeing upwards of 16 trains a day at the Central Station. In 1928, a pulp mill was built in nearby Atholville which continued to propel the population growth already being experienced. Campbellton was experiencing strong growth as the population grew at a steady rate: 3,817 in 1911, 5,570 in 1921, 6,505 in 1931, 6,714 in 1941, 9,257 in 1949. In 1951, Campbellton opened its new arena, the Memorial Gardens, with an exhibition game featuring the Montreal Canadiens.

In 1958, Campbellton was incorporated as a City and its population was approaching 13,000. At this time the construction of the J.C. Van Horne Interprovincial bridge commenced which was designed to facilitate travel between Quebec and Northern New Brunswick. The bridge was completed in 1961 and allowed the cross-river town of Pointe-à-la-Croix to fully integrate itself commercially with the City of Campbellton. The Salmon Festival was inaugurated in 1967 and has been a popular annual week-long event which is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike. Campbellton&#x27;s city limits were expanded in 1979 when the Richardsville area became part of the city.

===Esplanade Restigouche===

In 2009, Mayor Bruce MacIntosh and Council made significant progress towards restoring the tourism industry in the area and in improving the city&#x27;s waterfront. They announced that the long-awaited &quot;Esplanade Restigouche&quot; development would finally move forward. This is a three phased project, that began in 2011, that will significantly upgrade the already picturesque waterfront and further cement Campbellton&#x27;s place as a tourist destination.
The Restigouche River Experience Center has been constructed with a Restigouche River Museum and an 86 site RV Park which will help Campbellton in becoming the hub for regional experiential tourism. In 2016, the newly elected mayor, Stephanie Anglehart-Paulin and Council have decided to move towards developing the Atlantic Culinary Institute in conjunction with the CCNB.

===Fire Ship===

The history of the City of Campbellton is not complete without mentioning the infamous Phantom Ship known as &quot;Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs&quot;. Stories of its appearance include seeing a burning sailing vessel, sometimes a vessel with all its sails set scudding along the water or sometimes a ball of fire or burning vessel on the water&#x27;s surface or fading out of sight. This is not frequently seen. Some believe it is a ghost ship from the Battle of the Restigouche whereas others believe it is merely caused by heat waves, reflections or hallucinations.

==Geography==
Campbellton is upstream (west) from the mouth of the Bay des Chaleurs Dalhousie and approximately northwest of Bathurst. The city is approximately northeast of St. Leonard in the St. John River valley and approximately the same distance from Mont-Joli, Quebec in the Saint Lawrence River valley. Campbellton was settled by the Scottish including surrounding area like Balmoral, Glencoe, and Glenlevit.

==Arts and culture==

The Restigouche Caledonian Society has been in Campbellton since 1898, the society was formed for the purpose of offering relief and assistance to distressed Scotsmen. The First President of the society was also The First Mayor of Campbellton John McAlister. To display the history of the city and the battle of the Restigouche, Riverside Park is home to two cannons used in the battle; one with three fleurs-de-lys on the barrel and the other with what appears to be stylized anchors. These are French naval guns from a five gun battery erected during the battle at Battery Point on the Quebec side of the river. When the Busteed family received a land grant at Battery Point, circa 1790, they found at least three cannons at the old battery site. One cannon was built into the fireplace of their home, called Bordeaux House, and two others were given to relatives across the river at Athol House in Atholville. For many years the two cannons outside Athol House were fired on ceremonial occasions. After Athol House burned, the guns lay on the riverbank until donated to the City of Campbellton in 1898. The park also features two monuments donated to the City displaying the names of local soldiers who died in battle during World War I and World War II.

The Restigouche Gallery is local gallery and functions as a centre in the cultural program of the region. It has been host to major exhibitions from the N.B. Museum on a travelling basis in hopes that the gallery will eventually join the Atlantic Provinces Art Circuit as a participatory member. The gallery displays a tricultural permanent exhibition highlighting the cultural strength of the region bringing to the forefront Campbellton&#x27;s diverse roots through its heritage Mi&#x27;gmaqs, Scottish and the French &amp; Acadians heritage.

===Events===
The city hosts multiple annual special events which include Sno-Fest in February, Salmon Fest which runs from late June to early July, the Bluegrass Festival which takes place in September, and the Harvest Festival in the fall. Other efforts to increase tourism include an salmon statue made of stainless steel. Restigouche Sam, as the statue was christened, was donated to the city to honour Campbellton&#x27;s historical connection with the &quot;salmon-rich&quot; Restigouche River. Several murals have also been created to beautify the city.

In 2017, Campbellton celebrated the 50th Anniversaries for both the Salmon Festival as well as its Centennial Library.

<doc id="170936" wikidata="Q1412513" url="?curid=170936" title="Harvey (1950 film)">
<text>Harvey is a 1950 American comedy-drama film based on Mary Chase&#x27;s 1944 play of the same name, directed by Henry Koster, and starring James Stewart, Josephine Hull, Charles Drake, Cecil Kellaway, Jesse White, Victoria Horne, Wallace Ford and Peggy Dow. The story centers on a man whose best friend is a púca named Harvey, a tall white invisible rabbit, and the ensuing debacle when the man&#x27;s sister tries to have him committed to a sanatorium.

==Plot==
Elwood P. Dowd is an amiable but eccentric man whose best friend is an invisible, white rabbit named Harvey. As described by Elwood, Harvey is a púca, a benign but mischievous creature from Celtic mythology. Elwood spends most of his time taking Harvey around town, drinking at various bars and introducing Harvey to almost everyone he meets, much to the puzzlement of strangers although Elwood&#x27;s friends have accepted Harvey&#x27;s (supposed) existence. His older sister Veta and his niece Myrtle Mae live with him in his large estate, but have become social outcasts along with Elwood due to his obsession with Harvey.

After Elwood ruins a party Veta and Myrtle Mae arranged in secret, Veta finally tries to have him committed to a local sanatorium. In exasperation she admits to the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Sanderson, that she sees Harvey once in a while herself. Mistaking Veta for the real mental case, Sanderson has Elwood released and Veta locked up. Dr. Chumley, head of the sanatorium, discovers the mistake and realizes he must bring Elwood back, searching the town with Wilson, an orderly. With Veta&#x27;s help, Chumley eventually tracks Elwood to his favorite bar, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s&quot;, and decides to confront him.

Four hours later, Wilson returns to the sanatorium and learns from Sanderson and nurse Kelly that Chumley and Elwood had not returned. They all go to Charlie&#x27;s and find Elwood alone; he explains that Chumley wandered off with Harvey after several rounds of drinks. As they converse, Elwood encourages Sanderson and Kelly to dance, rekindling their romantic relationship. Elwood eventually explains that he met Harvey one night several years ago after escorting a drunk friend to a taxi, and they had since enjoyed going to bars and socializing with other patrons to hear their grand life stories and aspirations. Convinced Elwood is insane and may have harmed Chumley, Wilson calls the police and has Elwood escorted back to the sanatorium.

Chumley returns to the sanatorium disheveled and paranoid, and is followed by an invisible presence. When the others arrive, Chumley invites Elwood to his office. In private, Chumley says that he now knows Harvey is real, and Elwood explains Harvey&#x27;s various powers, including his ability to stop time, send anyone to any destination for as long as they like, and then bring them back without a minute passing. Chumley expresses his fantasy to go to Akron with a beautiful woman for two weeks. Veta arrives with Judge Gaffney and Myrtle Mae, prepared to commit Elwood, but are convinced by Sanderson that an injection of a serum called &quot;Formula 977&quot; will stop Elwood from &quot;seeing the rabbit&quot;.

As they prepare the injection, Veta tries to pay the cab driver but, emptying her purse, is unable to find her smaller coin purse. She interrupts the injection procedure and asks Elwood to pay the driver. Warmed by Elwood&#x27;s kindness, the cab driver explains how he has driven many people to the sanatorium to receive the same formula, warning Veta that Elwood will soon become &quot;a perfectly normal human being, and you know what stinkers they are.&quot; Veta is upset by this, and halts the injection; she then finds her coin purse, and realizes that Harvey had intervened to save her brother. Wilson and Myrtle Mae, who had met at Elwood&#x27;s house, reveal that they have become a couple, and Elwood invites Wilson over for tomorrow night&#x27;s dinner.

Leaving the institute, Elwood sees Harvey on the porch swing. Harvey tells him that he has decided to stay and take Chumley on his fantasy trip to Akron. Dejected, Elwood walks out the gate, but when it is closed he sees Harvey coming back. The gate lever is then moved to the open position by an unseen force. Elwood happily says &quot;Well, thank you, Harvey; I prefer you too&quot;, and they follow Veta and Myrtle Mae along the road and into the sunrise.

==Cast==

In addition, &quot;Harvey as Himself&quot; is shown in an on-screen credit as the final shot of the film.

==Reception==

Reviews from critics were mostly positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;so freely flowing is the screenplay which Mrs. Chase and Oscar Brodney have prepared, so vivid and droll is the direction which Henry Koster has given it and, particularly, so darling is the acting of James Stewart, Josephine Hull and all the rest that a virtually brand new experience is still in store for even those who saw the play.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the play &quot;loses little of its whimsical comedy charm in the screen translation&quot;, and that Stewart &quot;would seem the perfect casting for the character so well does he convey the idea that escape from life into a pleasant half-world existence has many points in its favor.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;A brief synopsis cannot do justice to the humor in the story, much of it delightful and some of it hilarious. Stewart is excellent in the leading role; his casual ease and amiability, and the quiet manner in which he explains his relationship with &#x27;Harvey,&#x27; are fascinating.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;one of the most beguiling comedies possible ... I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll admire the able playing of Stewart and the marvelous out-of-this-world perplexity of the superb Mrs. Hull. Both are Academy Award performances.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a movie that only a case-hardened wowser would fail to find beguiling. Even if you saw the play, I don&#x27;t think your familiarity with the alcoholic hallucinations of Elwood P. Dowd, the hero, will diminish your enjoyment of the film, and though James Stewart, who plays Dowd in the picture, doesn&#x27;t bring to his part all the battered authority of Frank Fay, the originator of the role, he nevertheless succeeds in making plausible the notion that Harvey, the rabbit, would accept him as a pal.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was less positive, writing that &quot;Harvey himself scarcely begins to exist for the audience until the last few minutes. In his absence, the humours that can be extracted from the more obvious aspects of lunacy or suspected lunacy are wrung rather dry.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; says James Stewart gave &quot;one of his finest performances in this lighthearted film&quot;, and it currently has five out of five stars on their site. 

Stewart took a percentage of the profits. In 1953, William Goetz estimated that Stewart had earned $200,000 from the film, equivalent to $ million in .

==Home media==
In March 1990, Stewart recorded a special narrative introduction, which was combined with many of the film&#x27;s still photos and added to the film&#x27;s original release on VHS. MCA Home Video released &quot;Harvey&quot; on VHS in 1990. The special narrative introduction also appears on at least one DVD release of the film.

== Awards and honors ==
James Stewart later declared in an interview that Josephine Hull had the most difficult role in the film, since she had to believe and &quot;not&quot; believe in the invisible rabbit... at the same time.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #35

Producer Don Gregory purchased the merchandising and film rights to &quot;Harvey&quot; from the Mary Chase estate in 1996. In April 1999, Gregory sold the rights to Miramax Films, who beat out several high-profile bidders, including Walt Disney Pictures (represented by the producing team Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson), Universal Pictures and New Line Cinema. However, Miramax still intended to have Gregory produce &quot;Harvey&quot;. Universal was interested in having &quot;Harvey&quot; with Jim Carrey starring and Tom Shadyac directing, while New Line saw it as an Adam Sandler movie. Harvey Weinstein of Miramax was also considering Carrey and Sandler, as well as Tom Hanks. Weinstein wanted &quot;Harvey&quot; to be set in a modern setting. Weinstein eventually took the project to Dimension Films, who partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to co-finance. Craig Mazin was hired by Dimension in November 2001 to adapt the screenplay. John Travolta entered negotiations to star in March 2003, but the rights for Dimension and MGM lapsed, which were picked up by 20th Century Fox in 2008. Jonathan Tropper was hired to write the script, which, in August 2009, drew interest from Steven Spielberg as director. As a result, Spielberg pushed back development for an Abraham Lincoln biopic (which was released in 2012); a remake of &quot;Oldboy&quot; and an adaptation of &quot;The 39 Clues&quot;. It was then announced that &quot;Harvey&quot; would be a joint 50/50 production between 20th Century Fox and Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks, with Spielberg and Gregory also set to produce the film. Tom Hanks, who previously worked with Spielberg on &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; and &quot;The Terminal&quot;, was considered for the lead role. Spielberg had also approached Robert Downey Jr., but in December 2009 Spielberg opted out after a dispute over his vision for the project.

In December 2018, it was reported that streaming service Netflix had started developing a version of &quot;Harvey&quot;.

===Allusions===
The Jimmy Stewart Museum, based in Stewart&#x27;s hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania, presents the Harvey Award to a distinguished celebrity tied to Stewart&#x27;s spirit of humanitarianism. Past recipients include Robert Wagner, Shirley Jones, Janet Leigh, and Rich Little.

In the 1957 comedy film &quot;Desk Set&quot; starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Hepburn&#x27;s character is given a large stuffed pink bunny rabbit by her boyfriend as a Christmas present. Pointing at the gift, she asks “Aren’t you going to introduce me to Harvey?”

A 1971 children&#x27;s film, &quot;Mr. Horatio Knibbles&quot;, also starred a giant talking rabbit, visible only to one person.

The first episode of the 1975 television series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; featured a scene with an invisible rabbit (wearing a visible collar) called &quot;Harvey&quot;, in a cage in a laboratory.

The 1977 comic book story, &quot;The Harvey Pekar Name Story,&quot; written by Harvey Pekar and illustrated by Robert Crumb, alludes to the play/film when Pekar describes how childhood acquaintances made fun of his name by calling him &quot;Harvey the Rabbit.&quot;

A scene in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; has a barfly confessing to Judge Doom, &quot;I seen the rabbit&quot; (seemingly referring to Roger, who is being wrongfully sought as a murder suspect). He puts his arm around an invisible presence and says, &quot;Well say hello – Harvey!&quot;, as a means of both mocking Doom and protecting Roger. The movie takes place in 1947, while the play was released in 1944.

In the 1989 film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice in his cornfield that no one else can hear. His daughter, Karin, is later shown watching a scene from &quot;Harvey&quot; on TV.

The 1992 film &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot; sees the recently-turned-invisible Nick Holloway, afraid to reveal his identity to a sinister government agent, answer &quot;Harvey&quot; when asked his name.

The character Andy Dufresne in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, released in 1994, describes &quot;Randall Stevens&quot; – the fake person Dufresne created to launder money – as &quot;a phantom, an apparition, second cousin to Harvey the rabbit.&quot;

In the &quot;Farscape&quot; television series, produced by The Jim Henson Company between 1999 and 2003, the main character Crichton was often &quot;haunted&quot; by visual-auditory hallucinations referred to as a neural-clone of his archenemy Scorpius, produced by an interactive neurochip embedded in his brain. This character is dubbed &quot;Harvey&quot; and called such by Crichton in direct reference to the original film.

In the 2000 film &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, Ray Winstone&#x27;s character sometimes sees a large imaginary rabbit.

The 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; contains a six-foot tall rabbit named Frank, which haunts the titular character. Despite popular belief that this character was a reference to Harvey, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;&#x27;s writer/director Richard Kelly denies it. In an interview with &quot;Future Movies&quot;, he is quoted as saying: &quot;I have never even seen the movie, it never occurred to me.&quot; In 2002, the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica programmed &quot;Harvey&quot; and &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; as a double feature.

In the series &quot;Scrubs&quot;, J.D.&#x27;s &#x27;conscience&#x27; is his high school gym teacher with his head replaced with a rabbit&#x27;s.

In 2004, the 15th-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;My Big Fat Geek Wedding&quot; contained a similar imaginary rabbit acting as Barney&#x27;s &#x27;anti-sobriety&#x27; sponsor.

The British indie rock band Her&#x27;s included a song named &quot;Harvey&quot; based on the film on their 2018 debut album &quot;Invitation to Her&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Harvey&quot; was one of lead singer Stephen Fitzpatrick&#x27;s favorite films.

In 2019, the thirteenth episode of John Green&#x27;s podcast &quot;The Anthropocene Reviewed&quot; featured the film, and an essay on the film was also included in Green&#x27;s book of the same title published in 2021. In the essay he describes an episode of severe clinical depression, which led to him resigning from his job, upon which his boss told him &quot;Watch Harvey&quot;. He writes how the film helped him to get well, and that he was eventually able to return to his job at &quot;Booklist&quot; magazine.

In the 2024 film &quot;IF&quot;, a film where a young girl discovers imaginary friends, or &quot;IF&quot; for short, the character Bea is watching &quot;Harvey&quot; on television before her attention is drawn to the noise of the IF Blossom outside her grandmother&#x27;s apartment.

<text>In mathematics, a function on the real numbers is called a step function if it can be written as a finite linear combination of indicator functions of intervals. Informally speaking, a step function is a piecewise constant function having only finitely many pieces.
==Definition and first consequences==
A function formula_1 is called a step function if it can be written as 
:formula_2, for all real numbers formula_3

where formula_4, formula_5 are real numbers, formula_6 are intervals, and formula_7 is the indicator function of formula_8:
:formula_9

In this definition, the intervals formula_6 can be assumed to have the following two properties: 
# The intervals are pairwise disjoint: formula_11 for formula_12
# The union of the intervals is the entire real line: formula_13

Indeed, if that is not the case to start with, a different set of intervals can be picked for which these assumptions hold. For example, the step function
:formula_14

can be written as
:formula_15

===Variations in the definition===
Sometimes, the intervals are required to be right-open or allowed to be singleton. The condition that the collection of intervals must be finite is often dropped, especially in school mathematics, though it must still be locally finite, resulting in the definition of piecewise constant functions.

==Examples==

* A constant function is a trivial example of a step function. Then there is only one interval, formula_16
* The sign function , which is −1 for negative numbers and +1 for positive numbers, and is the simplest non-constant step function.
* The Heaviside function , which is 0 for negative numbers and 1 for positive numbers, is equivalent to the sign function, up to a shift and scale of range (formula_17). It is the mathematical concept behind some test signals, such as those used to determine the step response of a dynamical system.

* The rectangular function, the normalized boxcar function, is used to model a unit pulse.

===Non-examples===
* The integer part function is not a step function according to the definition of this article, since it has an infinite number of intervals. However, some authors also define step functions with an infinite number of intervals.

==Properties==
* The sum and product of two step functions is again a step function. The product of a step function with a number is also a step function. As such, the step functions form an algebra over the real numbers.
* A step function takes only a finite number of values. If the intervals formula_18 for formula_19 in the above definition of the step function are disjoint and their union is the real line, then formula_20 for all formula_21
* The definite integral of a step function is a piecewise linear function.
* The Lebesgue integral of a step function formula_22 is formula_23 where formula_24 is the length of the interval formula_8, and it is assumed here that all intervals formula_6 have finite length. In fact, this equality (viewed as a definition) can be the first step in constructing the Lebesgue integral.
* A discrete random variable is sometimes defined as a random variable whose cumulative distribution function is piecewise constant. In this case, it is locally a step function (globally, it may have an infinite number of steps). Usually however, any random variable with only countably many possible values is called a discrete random variable, in this case their cumulative distribution function is not necessarily locally a step function, as infinitely many intervals can accumulate in a finite region.

<doc id="170943" wikidata="Q6685526" url="?curid=170943" title="Lou Grant">
<text>Lou Grant is a fictional character played by Ed Asner in two television series produced by MTM Enterprises for CBS. The first was &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1970–1977), a half-hour light-hearted situation comedy in which the character was the news director at fictional television station WJM-TV in Minneapolis. A spinoff series, entitled &quot;Lou Grant&quot; (1977–1982), was an hour-long serious dramatic series that frequently engaged in social commentary, featuring the same character as city editor of the fictional &quot;Los Angeles Tribune&quot;. Although spin-offs are common on American television, Lou Grant remains one of a very few characters played by the same actor to have a leading role on both a popular comedy and a popular dramatic series.

==Fictional biography==

===Pre-WJM-TV===
Although the setting of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; might have implied that he was a native Minnesotan, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; in fact established that he was born in the fictional rural town of Goshen, Michigan in 1925. He was the son of John Simpson Grant and Ellen Hammersmith Grant; his grandfather was a pharmacist. At some point in his youth and early adulthood he developed a lifelong affection for westerns, particularly those starring John Wayne. In high school, he was a tackle for his school&#x27;s football team. Soon after high school, he married Edie MacKenzie (Priscilla Morrill), at an age young enough to have four grandchildren before he turned 50.

After marriage he became a combatant in World War II. He served in both the Pacific and European Theatres. At one point, he was a sergeant in the Pacific-based 2nd Marine Division. During another phase of his wartime service he was injured by a grenade in France, the last remnants of which were removed only in his late 40s. He was also part of a unit that liberated an unknown town in Germany. During the war he met and befriended Walter Cronkite.

He attended college (although on several occasions he stated he never had the chance to attend), likely after the war. He started his career in print journalism as a copy boy but it is unclear whether this was in Detroit, Minneapolis or San Francisco as he worked for papers in all three cities. In this period of his life, he met and worked with Charlie Hume (Mason Adams) for the first time at the &quot;San Francisco Call-Bulletin&quot;, and worked with Jack Riley (Eugene Roche).

===WJM-TV===
At some point in his late 30s he made the transition to broadcast journalism, and by the time of the 1966 elections he was working on a radio news show, as he explained to Mary Richards on the occasion of her producing her first news show all by herself at WJM-TV. He eventually became the head of the WJM news department. He worked in that capacity for 11 years. For most of that period, Mary Richards served as his associate producer (later producer, with Lou having the title of executive producer, and she reported to him), Ted Baxter as his news anchor and Murray Slaughter as his head writer.

Of these relationships, the one with Richards was likely the closest. Except for one abortive attempt at romance, his general attitude towards Mary was paternalistic. A typical display of his affection for Richards came when his nephew, Allen, tried to put the moves on Mary. Lou became infuriated and said &quot;Listen you, let me remind you of something, and remember this forever. I think of this girl here as if she were my own daughter and that means she is your cousin, you get my drift?&quot;
He was a heavy drinker, with a penchant for hiding whole bottles of scotch in his desk drawers. His personality was outwardly that of a tough loner and a workaholic man&#x27;s man. The real Lou Grant was somewhat more complicated. He was quick to anger and had a violent streak, at times threatening the barely competent Ted Baxter and once causing him physical injury. However, those who understood him best, like Mary Richards, knew he was also painfully shy, with a particular awkwardness around women. With those few people he trusted, Lou was protective and could at times confide his emotional vulnerability. When he learned that Ted considered him his &quot;best friend&quot;, he took pity on him, at least until Ted infuriated him again.

Lou&#x27;s marriage began to slide as he and Edie both adjusted to life after parenthood. They briefly separated for the first time almost immediately after their youngest daughter got married and left the house. Though they reconciled on this occasion, they would occasionally re-separate and seek marriage counseling over the next two years. In about 1973 he and Edie divorced, after which Edie promptly remarried. Lou, who had been consistently portrayed as a devoted husband, tentatively began to date again. He went out with a woman named Charlene (Sheree North; Janis Paige in &quot;Menage-a-Lou&quot; of Season 6) in particularly Season 5; Mary&#x27;s best friend Rhoda Morgenstern in Season 4; Mary&#x27;s next-door neighbor, Paula Kovacks (Penny Marshall) in Season 6; Mary&#x27;s Aunt Flo (Eileen Heckart) in Seasons 6 and 7; and even with Mary herself in the penultimate episode. He and Sue Ann Nivens had a drunken one-night-stand.

Professionally, his career with WJM-TV ended in the final episode. Lou, along with Mary, Murray, and Sue Ann Nivens, was fired due to low ratings. Lou&#x27;s sometime-nemesis, the vacuous Ted Baxter—the real cause for the ratings slide—was retained.

===&quot;Los Angeles Tribune&quot;===

&quot;Lou Grant&quot;, a spin-off drama from the comedy show &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot;, opens with Grant relocating to Los Angeles, to work with as City Editor with an old buddy, Charley Hume, who is managing editor of the fictitious &quot;Los Angeles Tribune&quot;, His subordinates at that time included staff reporters Joe Rossi (Robert Walden); Billie Newman (Linda Kelsey); her predecessor, Carla Mardigian (Rebecca Balding); and photographer Dennis &quot;Animal&quot; Price (Daryl Anderson). His assistant city editor was Art Donovan (Jack Bannon). Charlie Hume was now his boss, who ultimately reported to publisher Margaret Jones Pynchon (Nancy Marchand). They, like those back at WJM, became his family. In the last episode of season one it is revealed that he has just turned 50, a continuity error from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;; he would have turned 53 in 1978. There is one character on &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, reporter Rosenthal, who is mentioned frequently but never seen. &quot;Lou Grant&quot; was cancelled after the star, Ed Asner, publicly protested U.S. interventions into the politics of Latin American countries.

==Unofficial appearances==
*During the second season of the &quot;Lou Grant&quot; series, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; newspaper arranged a series of press conferences, interviews and announcements (with participation from Asner), stating that Lou Grant was joining the Sun as their new senior city editor. Asner (as Grant) ostensibly worked in the newsroom for a day, and the March 23, 1979 issue of the Sun newspaper actually formally named Lou Grant as city editor on their masthead. The publicity stunt concluded with Grant being &quot;fired&quot; from the Sun after one day, allegedly for being &quot;too disruptive to the flow of the newsroom&quot; due to of all the news organizations following him around with cameras.

*In a 1984 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, on which Asner was a guest, Lou hired a team of mercenaries to &quot;rescue&quot; Mary Richards after she got stuck in the &#x27;70s in syndicated reruns. But Mary refused rescue on the grounds that she never ages and never gains weight, and that people still like her. Mary Richards and the rest of the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; characters hadn&#x27;t existed anywhere, except in reruns, for several years. (&quot;Lou Grant&quot; had been cancelled about 2 years previously.)

*In 1996 the character appeared on &quot;Call Waiting&quot;, an episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, in a dream sequence experienced by the show&#x27;s lead. Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) was Mary and Dan (John Goodman) was Lou, and the two got into a heated argument. Lou stomped out, but quickly returned and was then played by Asner. (He commented about not feeling like himself.) Asner was uncredited.

*In 1998, Asner appeared in a cameo role as an Associated Press editor in the miniseries &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; (based on the series of Armistead Maupin novels). Though not identified by any name in dialogue, the character&#x27;s demeanor was similar to that of the Lou Grant character. However, the character was identified as &quot;Jack Lederer&quot; in the credits, and the character&#x27;s apparent age -- if meant to be Lou Grant -- doesn&#x27;t fit with the 1978 setting of the show (Asner was nearly 70 at the time of filming, while Lou Grant in the mid-to-late-1970s would have been around 50).

*In a 2000 episode of the short lived &quot;Ellen Show&quot;, series regular Cloris Leachman reunites with Mary Tyler Moore. Cloris had played Phyllis on the Mary Tyler Moore show and its spinoff, Phyllis. Though the Mary and Cloris reunion was advertised well publicized, Ed Asner had a surprise cameo as Santa Clause. Mary called him &quot;Mister Clause,&quot; in homage to the fact that her character had always called Lou Grant &quot;Mister Grant.&quot; 

*In 2004, Asner unofficially reprised the role in a series of ads promoting Twin Cities station KSTP-TV, a real television station in the same market as the fictional WJM-TV.

*Additionally in 2013, Asner again reprised the role for a series of promos for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; airing on MeTV.

==Reception==
Asner won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Lou, with three of these awards for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and two for &quot;Lou Grant&quot;. Bravo ranked Lou 35th on their list of the 100 greatest TV characters.

<doc id="170944" wikidata="Q823214" url="?curid=170944" title="List of premiers of Manitoba">
<text>The Canadian province of Manitoba was created in 1870. Manitoba has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Manitoba&#x27;s head of government, and the King of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Manitoba, and then presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also happen if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.

Before 1888, Manitoba had no formal party system; premiers were officially non-partisan and were chosen by elected members of the Legislative Assembly from among themselves.

Manitoba has had 24 individuals serve as premier since the province was formed, of which six were non-partisan, nine were Progressive Conservatives, four were Liberals, four were New Democrats and one was Progressive. However, during the early years of the province, the leading minister in the legislature was designated provincial secretary and the government was &quot;de facto&quot; led by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba; it was not until 1874 that responsible government was introduced and the title of &quot;premier&quot; used. The early provincial secretaries, as the most prominent elected officials in the province, are retroactively counted as premiers in modern sources.

This article only covers the time since the province was created in 1870. Before that, the territory was part of the District of Assiniboia in Rupert&#x27;s Land, and was loosely controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Wab Kinew is the incumbent premier, since October 2023.

On 7 December 2023, Louis Riel was granted the honorary title of &quot;First Premier of Manitoba&quot; after the &quot;Louis Riel Act&quot; received royal assent. As it is an honorary title, however, Alfred Boyd remains the official first premier of the province.

<doc id="170945" wikidata="Q12332701" url="?curid=170945" title="Racial discrimination">
<text>Racial discrimination is any discrimination against any individual on the basis of their race, ancestry, ethnic or national origin, and/or skin color and hair texture. Individuals can discriminate by refusing to do business with, socialize with, or share resources with people of a certain group. Governments can discriminate explicitly in law, for example through policies of racial segregation, disparate enforcement of laws, or disproportionate allocation of resources. Some jurisdictions have anti-discrimination laws which prohibit the government or individuals from being discriminated based on race (and sometimes other factors) in various circumstances. Some institutions and laws use affirmative action to attempt to overcome or compensate for the effects of racial discrimination. In some cases, this is simply enhanced recruitment of members of underrepresented groups; in other cases, there are firm racial quotas. Opponents of strong remedies like quotas characterize them as reverse discrimination, where members of a dominant or majority group are discriminated against.

== Boundary problems and related forms of discrimination ==

Racial boundaries can involve many factors (such as ancestry, physical appearance, national origin, language, religion, and culture), and can be set in law by governments, or may depend on local cultural norms.

Discrimination based on skin color (measured for example on the Fitzpatrick scale) or hair texture (measured for example on a scale from 1a to 4c) is closely related to racial discrimination, as skin color and hair texture are often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions, and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria. For example, the Population Registration Act, 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in South Africa, and Brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas. Because of genetic variation, skin color, and other features of physical appearance can vary considerably even among siblings. Some children with the same parents either self-identify or are identified by others as being of different races. In some cases, the same person is identified as a different race on a birth certificate versus a death certificate. Different rules (such as hypodescent vs. hyperdescent) classify the same people differently, and for various reasons some people &quot;pass&quot; as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in, possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination.

A given race is sometimes defined as a set of ethnicities from populations in neighboring geographic areas (such as a continent like Australia or a subcontinental region like South Asia) that are typically similar in appearance. In such cases, racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race, or ethnic discrimination (or ethnic hatred, ethnic conflict, and ethnic violence) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race. Discrimination based on caste is similar; because caste is hereditary, people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity.

A person&#x27;s national origin (the country in which they were born or have citizenship) is sometimes used in determining a person&#x27;s ethnicity or race, but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race (and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws). Language and culture are sometimes markers of national origin and can prompt instances of discrimination based on national origin. For example, someone of a South Asian ethnicity who grew up in London, speaks British English with a London accent, and whose family has assimilated to British culture might be treated more favorably than someone of the same ethnicity who is a recent immigrant and speaks Indian English. Such a difference in treatment might still informally be described as a form of racism, or more precisely as xenophobia or anti-immigrant sentiment.

In countries where migration, unification, or breakup has occurred relatively recently, the process of ethnogenesis may complicate the determination of both ethnicity and race and is related to personal identity or affiliation. Sometimes the ethnicity of immigrants in their new country is defined as their national origin, and span multiple races. For example, the 2015 Community Survey of the United States Census accepted identification as Mexican Americans of any race (for example including Native Americans from Mexico, descendants of Africans transported to New Spain as enslaved people, and descendants of Spanish colonists). In surveys taken by the Mexican government, the same people would have been described as indigenous, black, or white (with a large number of people unclassified who might be described as Mestizo). The U.S. census asks separate questions about Hispanic and Latino Americans to distinguish language from racial identity. Discrimination based on being Hispanic or Latino does occur in the United States and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot; are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the Americas. Many statistical reports apply both characteristics, for example comparing Non-Hispanic whites to other groups.

When people of different races are treated differently, decisions about how to treat a particular person raise the question of which racial classification that person belongs to. For example, definitions of whiteness in the United States were used before the civil rights movement for the purpose of immigration and the ability to hold citizenship or be enslaved. If a race is defined as a set of ethnolinguistic groups, then common language origin can be used to define the boundaries of that group. The status of Finns as white was challenged on the grounds that the Finnish language is Uralic rather than Indo-European, purportedly making the Finns of the Mongoloid race. The common American notion that all people of geographically European ancestry and of light skin are &quot;white&quot; prevailed for Finns, and other European immigrants like Irish Americans and Italian Americans whose whiteness was challenged and who faced interpersonal if not legal discrimination. American and South African laws which divided the population into whites from Europe and blacks from sub-Saharan Africa often caused problems of interpretation when dealing with people from other areas, such as the rest of the Mediterranean Basin, Asia, North Africa, or even Native Americans, with classification as non-white usually resulting in legal discrimination. (Some Native American tribes have treaty rights which grant privileges rather than disadvantages, though these were often negotiated on unfavorable terms.) Though as an ethno-religious group they often face religious discrimination, the whiteness of all Jews was also challenged in the United States, with attempts to classify them as Asiatic (Palestine being in western Asia) or Semitic (which would also include Arabs). The actual ancestry of most Jewish people is more varied than simply ancient Hebrew tribes. As the Jewish diaspora spread across Europe and Africa over time many Jewish ethnic divisions arose, resulting in Jews who identify as white, black, and other races. The reunification of diverse populations in modern Israel has led to some problems of racial discrimination against dark-skinned Jews by light-skinned Jews.

== Around the world ==
=== Overall trends ===
A 2013 analysis of World Values Survey data by The Washington Post looked at the fraction of people in each country that indicated they would prefer not to have neighbours from a differing race. It ranged from below 5% in Australia, New Zealand, and many countries in the Americas, to 51.4% in Jordan; Europe had wide variation, from below 5% in the UK, France, Norway, and Sweden, to 22.7% in Germany.

More than 30 years of field experimental studies have found significant levels of discrimination against people of color in labor, housing, and product markets in 10 countries.

=== Discrimination against refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and internally displaced persons ===
Around the world, refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and internally displaced persons have been the victims of racial discrimination, racist attacks, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance. According to the Human Right Watch, &quot;racism is both a cause and a product of forced displacement, and an obstacle to its solution.&quot;

With the influx of refugees to Europe in 2010, media coverage shaped public opinion and created hostility towards refugees. Prior to that the European Union had started implementing the hotspot system, which categorized people them as either asylum seekers or economic migrants, and Europe&#x27;s patrolling of its southern borders between 2010 and 2016 intensified, resulting in deals with Turkey and Libya.

=== The Netherlands ===
A study conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2013 found significant levels of discrimination against job applicants with Arabic-sounding names.

=== Israel ===

Palestinian citizens of Israel, who constitute approximately 20% of the population, face disparities in land ownership, political representation, education, and employment. Over 65 laws create structural advantages for Jewish citizens in areas such as resource allocation, housing, and legal rights. Land ownership laws designate approximately 93% of land as state property or controlled by the Jewish National Fund, which explicitly restricts non-Jewish ownership and leasing. Disparities in public funding result in lower per capita investment in Palestinian-majority municipalities, affecting infrastructure, schools, and social services. The 2018 Nation-State Law defined Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, affirming exclusive national rights for Jewish citizens while downgrading Arabic from an official language to a special status.

=== Africa ===
The British colonial impact greatly affected the cultures of African society but the differences in the countries like Nigeria remain as close to tradition compared to countries like South Africa. American racism also plays a part that escalates racism in Nigeria but American racism ideas influencing African Cultures. The racism that was developed by the influence of colonization and American influenced there to create levels of power based on racism. Racism in African cultures is connected to the opportunities received in life, virus susceptibility, and tribal traditions. For example, in the north, an indirect policy of rule settled a new way of life between the colonizing government and the Fulani- Hausa ruling class. Because of this the North falls behind the South and West on education development which causes racial malignity. 
==== Uganda ====
While Uganda was under Idi Amin&#x27;s rule, there was a policy to replace Asians and white people with blacks. Idi Amin was also an anti Semitic person.

==== Liberia ====
The constitution of Liberia renders non-blacks ineligible for citizenship.

=== United Kingdom===
A 2023 University of Cambridge survey which featured the largest sample of Black people in Britain found that 88% had reported racial discrimination at work, 79% believed the police unfairly targeted black people with stop and search powers and 80% definitely or somewhat agreed that racial discrimination was the biggest barrier to academic attainment for young Black students. Formal equality based on race continues to be violated in the United Kingdom.

=== Germany ===

Racial discrimination in Germany affects various ethnic and religious minority groups, including people of Turkish and Middle Eastern descent, Black Germans, Romani communities, asylum seekers, and Jewish populations.

People of Turkish and Middle Eastern descent constitute one of the most discriminated against minorities in Germany. Many are descendants of guest workers (&quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;) who arrived during the 1960s and 1970s. Studies indicate that job applicants with Turkish, Arab, or Muslim-sounding names receive significantly fewer interview invitations compared to those with German-sounding names. In the education system, children of Turkish and Arab backgrounds are disproportionately placed in lower-tier secondary schools, limiting access to higher education and skilled professions.

The Romani community in Germany, estimated to number between 120,000 and 200,000, also faces persistent discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Many Roma families experience forced evictions and struggle to secure rental contracts due to widespread ethnic profiling by landlords. In the education system, Roma children are disproportionately placed in special education schools and have lower enrollment rates in higher education.

=== United States ===

With regard to employment, multiple audit studies have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the United States&#x27; labor market, with magnitudes of employers&#x27; preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50% to 240%. Other such studies have found significant evidence of discrimination in car sales, home insurance applications, provision of medical care, and hailing taxis. There is some debate regarding the method used to signal race in these studies.

==== Employment ====
Racial discrimination in the workplace falls into two basic categories:
*Disparate Treatment: An employer&#x27;s policies discriminate based upon any immutable racial characteristic, such as skin, eye or hair color, and certain facial features;
*Disparate Impact: Although an employer may not intend to discriminate based on racial characteristics, its policies nonetheless have an adverse effect based upon race.

Discrimination may occur at any point in the employment process, including pre-employment inquiries, hiring practices, compensation, work assignments and conditions, privileges granted to employees, promotion, employee discipline and termination.

Researchers Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, at the University of Chicago and MIT found in a 2004 study, that there was widespread racial discrimination in the workplace. In their study, candidates perceived as having &quot;white-sounding names&quot; were 50% more likely than those whose names were merely perceived as &quot;sounding black&quot; to receive callbacks for interviews. The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the United States&#x27; long history of discrimination (e.g., Jim Crow laws, etc.)

Devah Pager, a sociologist at Princeton University, sent matched pairs of applicants to apply for jobs in Milwaukee and New York City, finding that black applicants received callbacks or job offers at half the rate of equally qualified whites. Another recent audit by UCLA sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high-quality state higher education institutions. This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst.

A 2001 study of workplace evaluation in a large U.S. company showed that black supervisors rate white subordinates lower than average and vice versa.

Research indicates that unemployment rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for whites.

==== Housing ====

Multiple experimental audit studies conducted in the United States have found that blacks and Hispanics experience discrimination in about one in five and one in four housing searches, respectively.

A 2014 study also found evidence of racial discrimination in an American rental apartment market.

Researchers found in contrast to White families, families of color were led to obtain housing in poor, low-quality communities due to discrimination during the home-buying process.

Persons affected by Homelessness also show a large disparity with more individuals being minorities in the United States. We Can Now is a Texas-based nonprofit that serves these people.

== Effects on health ==

Studies have shown an association between reported racial discrimination and adverse physical and mental health outcomes. This evidence has come from multiple countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.

=== Racism in healthcare system ===
Racial bias exists in the medical field affecting the way patients are treated and the way they are diagnosed. There are instances where patients’ words are not taken seriously, an example would be the recent case with Serena Williams. After the birth of her daughter via C-section, the tennis player began to feel pain and shortness of breath. It took her several times to convince the nurse they actually took her self-said symptoms seriously. Had she not been persistent and demanded a CT scan, which showed a clot resulting in blood thinning, Williams might have not been alive. This is just one of hundreds of cases where systemic racism can affect women of color in pregnancy complications.

One of the factors that lead to higher mortality rates amongst black mothers is the poorly conditioned hospitals and lack of standard healthcare facilities. Along with having deliveries done in underdeveloped areas, the situation becomes complicated when the pain dealt by patients are not taken seriously by healthcare providers. Pain heard from patients of color are underestimated by doctors compared to pain told by patients who are white leading them to misdiagnose.

Many say that the education level of people affect whether or not they admit to healthcare facilities, leaning to the argument that people of color purposefully avoid hospitals compared to white counterparts however, this is not the case. Even Serena Williams, a well-known athlete, was not taken seriously when she described her pain. It is true that the experiences of patients in hospital settings influence whether or not they return to healthcare facilities. Black people are less likely to admit to hospitals however those that are admitted have longer stays than white people

The longer hospitalization of black patients does not improve care conditions, it makes it worse, especially when treated poorly by faculty. Not a lot of minorities are admitted into hospitals and those that are receive poor conditioned treatment and care. This discrimination results in misdiagnosis and medical mistakes that lead to high death rates.

Although the Medicaid program was passed to ensure African Americans and other minorities received the healthcare treatment they deserved and to limit discrimination in hospital facilities, there still seems to be an underlying cause for the low number of black patients admitted to hospitals, like not receiving the proper dosage of medication. Infant mortality rates and life expectancies of minorities are much lower than that of white people in the United States. Illnesses like cancer and heart diseases are more prevalent in minorities, which is one of the factors for the high mortality rate in the group. however are not treated accordingly.

Although programs like Medicaid exists to support minorities, there still seems to be a large number of people who are not insured. This financial drawback discourages people in the group to go to hospitals and doctors offices.

Financial and cultural influences can impact the way patients are treated by their healthcare providers. When doctors have a bias on a patient, it can lead to the formation of stereotypes, impacting the way they view their patient&#x27;s data and diagnosis, affecting the treatment plan they implement.

== Welfare of Children ==
The topic of racial discrimination appears in discussion concerning children, and adolescents. Amongst the number of theories evaluating how children come to understand social identities, research presumes that social and cognitive developmental changes influence children&#x27;s perspectives regarding their own racial/ethnic identities and children develop a greater understanding of how their race/ethnicity can be perceived by the greater society.

A study led by Benner et al. (2018) analyzes a combination of previous studies indicating an existing relationship between racial discrimination and well-being, more specifically, in regards to mental health, behaviors, and academic performance of adolescents ranging from early adolescence (10-13) to late adolescence (17 and older). While it includes Asian, African descent, and Latino populations, this study also speculates the variances amongst the racial groups and other differences contributed by intersectionality. To investigate these relationships, the researchers examined data containing reports of racial discrimination from children, which served as a significant tool to further explore these ideas. In addition they analyzed the relationship between racial discrimination and aspects of well-being (e.g., self-esteem, substance abuse, student engagement) by organizing these components into broader categories of youth development: mental health, behavioral conditions and academic success. Subsequently, the results show a relationship between racial discrimination and negative outcomes relating to youth wellness across all three categories. Moreover, while examining differences among racial groups, children of Asian and Latino descent were found to be most at risk for mental health development, and Latino children, for academic success.

Racial discrimination affects about 90% of black adolescents, impacting their personal, social, psychological, and academic well-being. It leads to heightened stress, lowered self-esteem, and decreased academic performance. Creating inclusive educational environments with specialized support is crucial for their holistic development amid such challenges.

Although the studies’ results correlate reported racial discrimination with outcomes to well-being, this does not conclude that one or more racial groups experience greater discrimination than other racial groups. Other factors may have contributed to the relationships’ findings. For example, evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of African descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination, or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination. Also, researchers speculate the meaningful ways intersectionality can play a role in variances of discrimination. Ultimately, they conclude that further studies to examine racial discrimination are necessary to provide a more comprehensive approach in determining effective support systems for children.

A growing number of studies are researching the differences into the mental health of children of different nationalities and races.

== Critical Consciousness in Youth and Racial Discrimination ==
When a person is conscious of their privilege, mindful of oppression and discrimination, and when they address and counteract these injustices, they are expressing critical consciousness. Additionally, critical consciousness can grow in individuals as a result of inequalities they may face such as racial discrimination.

The researchers, Heberle, Rapa, and Farago (2020), conducted a systematic review of research literature on the concept critical consciousness. The study focused on 67 qualitative and quantitative studies regarding the effects of critical consciousness in youth since 1998. For example, one of the studies included in the report by Ngo (2017), studied an extracurricular program that analyzed the racial discrimination faced by Hmong adolescents and the exploration of critical consciousness participation in theater. The non-scholastic theater program encouraged this group of students to explore their identities through the injustices they faced and to fight against the oppression and racial discrimination they experienced.

Critical consciousness can be used as a tool to fight against racial discrimination. Heberle et al. (2020) argued that a decrease in racial discrimination can happen when White youth are aware of differences in groups and injustices due to their critical consciousness. They might change their thinking by fostering antiracist beliefs and having awareness of their own White privilege.

== Reverse discrimination ==

Reverse discrimination is a term for allegations that the member of a dominant or majority group has suffered discrimination for the benefit of a minority or historically disadvantaged group.

=== United States ===
In the United States, courts have upheld race-conscious policies when they are used to promote a diverse work or educational environment. Some critics have described those policies as discriminating against white people. In response to arguments that such policies (e.g. affirmative action) constitute discrimination against whites, sociologists note that the purpose of these policies is to level the playing field to counteract discrimination.

==== Perceptions ====
A 2016 poll found that 38% of US citizens thought that Whites faced a lot of discrimination. Among Democrats, 29% thought there was some discrimination against Whites in the United States, while 49% of Republicans thought the same. Similarly, another poll conducted earlier in the year found that 41% of US citizens believed there was &quot;widespread&quot; discrimination against whites. There is evidence that some people are motivated to believe they are the victims of reverse discrimination because the belief bolsters their self-esteem.

==== Law ====
In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits all racial discrimination based on race. Although some courts have taken the position that a white person must meet a heightened standard of proof to prove a reverse-discrimination claim, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) applies the same standard to all claims of racial discrimination without regard to the victim&#x27;s race.

<text>A reign is the period of a person&#x27;s or dynasty&#x27;s occupation of the office of monarch of a nation (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Andorra), of a people (e.g., the Franks, the Zulus) or of a spiritual community (e.g., Catholicism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nizari Ismailism). In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g., Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign&#x27;s reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed.

In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch&#x27;s tenure in office (e.g., Malaysia).

The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation &quot;r.&quot; (for Latin &quot;&quot;) after a sovereign&#x27;s name, such as the following:
:George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India (r. 1936–1952)

==Regnal periods==
Notable reigns have included the following.
* Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India reigned from 1837 to 1901.
* King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy reigned from 1900 to 1946.
* King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand reigned from 1946 to 2016.
* Queen Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth realms reigned from 1952 to 2022.
* Pope John XXIII reigned from 1958 to 1963.
* Emperor Akihito of Japan reigned from 1989 to 2019.

==End of reign==
A reign can be ended in several ways:

* Abdication
* Abolition of monarchy
* Death
* Deposition

===Abdication===

* Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, King of Lombardy-Venetia (r. 1835–1848) was abdicated due to his disabilities (feeble-mindedness and epilepsy). His successor, Emperor Franz Josef (r. 1848–1916) reigned for 68 years.
* King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom reigned from January to December 1936 before he abdicated the throne. After his abdication he became known as the Duke of Windsor. No other monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or any Dominion or Commonwealth realm has ever abdicated, though forced abdications did occur on rare occasions in the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland prior to their merger in 1707.
* Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands reigned from 1890 to 1948, before abdicating in favor of her daughter, Queen Juliana who then reigned until 1980 when she abdicated in favor of her daughter, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Beatrix followed suit and abdicated in 2013 in favor of her son and heir apparent, King Willem-Alexander.

===Abolition of monarchy===
* King Louis XVI of France reigned from the 1770s until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 and his execution the following year.
* Xuantong Emperor of China abdicated in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution, marking the end of the Chinese monarchy.
* King Humbert II of Italy reigned for only a few weeks in 1946 before the abolition of the Italian Monarchy.
* King Constantine II of Greece reigned from 1964 until the abolition of the Greek monarchy in 1973.
* Tsar Nicholas II of Russia reigned from 1894 until 1917 when he was forced to abdicate and the Russian Empire was overthrown during the Russian Revolution.
* Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia reigned for over 40 years (1930-1974) until the Derg forced him to abdicate and abolished the 3,000 year old monarchy, making him the 225th and final Emperor of Ethiopia.
* Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran reigned for more than 37 years (1941–1979) until the Iranian Revolution, which superseded the 2,500 years of monarchy with an Islamic republic system of government. The Shah died the following year and is buried in Cairo.

<doc id="170947" wikidata="Q231467" url="?curid=170947" title="Patricia Cornwell">
<text>Patricia Cornwell (born Patricia Carroll Daniels; June 9, 1956) is an American crime writer. She is known for her best-selling novels featuring medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, of which the first was inspired by a series of sensational murders in Richmond, Virginia, where most of the stories are set. The plots are notable for their emphasis on forensic science, which has influenced later TV treatments of police work. Cornwell has also initiated new research into the Jack the Ripper killings, incriminating the popular British artist Walter Sickert. Her books have sold more than 120 million copies.

==Early life==
A descendant of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, Cornwell was born on June 9, 1956, in Miami, Florida, second of three children, to Marilyn (née Zenner) and Sam Daniels. Her father was one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, &quot;He was on his deathbed. We knew it was the last time we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother&#x27;s hand and mouthed &#x27;I love you,&#x27; but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad &#x27;How&#x27;s work?&#x27;&quot;

In 1961, Marilyn left with three children in tow and moved to Montreat, North Carolina. Ruth Bell Graham, wife of the evangelist Billy Graham took the wayward family in and arranged for Cornwell and her brothers, Jim and John, to be raised by Lenore and Manfred Saunders, who had recently returned from Africa. Marilyn Daniels, suffering from severe depression, was hospitalized. Cornwell turned to Ruth Bell Graham as an authority figure, and it was she who noticed that Cornwell&#x27;s talent lay in writing and encouraged her literary efforts. A bright student, a capable cartoonist, and a talented athlete on the tennis court, Cornwell attended King College in Bristol, Tennessee briefly before transferring to Davidson College on a tennis scholarship (which she later rejected), from where she graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in English.

==Career==

In 1979, Cornwell began working as a reporter for &quot;The Charlotte Observer,&quot; initially editing TV listings, then moving to features, and finally becoming a reporter covering crime. In 1980, she received the North Carolina Press Association&#x27;s Investigative Reporting Award for a series on prostitution. She continued at the newspaper until 1981, when she moved to Richmond, Virginia with her first husband, Charles Cornwell (married in 1980), who enrolled at the Union Theological Seminary. The same year she began working on the biography of Ruth Bell Graham, &quot;A Time for Remembering: The Ruth Bell Graham Story&quot; (renamed &quot;Ruth, A Portrait: The Story of Ruth Bell Graham&quot; in subsequent editions), which was published in 1983. The biography gained a Gold Medallion Book Award from the Evangelic Christian Publishers Association in 1985. It also, however, was a major blow to her friendship with Graham – they weren&#x27;t on speaking terms for eight years following the book&#x27;s publication.

Cornwell began work on her first novel in 1984, about a male detective named Joe Constable and met Dr. Marcella Farinelli Fierro, a medical examiner in Richmond, and subsequent inspiration for the character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In 1985, she took a job at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, &quot;Postmortem,&quot; based on real-life stranglings in Richmond in the summer of 1987. The novel won her various awards including the British John Creasey Award, the French Prix du Roman d&#x27;Adventure and the American Edgar Award.

The Scarpetta novels include a great deal of detail on forensic science. The initial resolution to the mystery is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim&#x27;s corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners. The novels generally climax with action scenes in which Scarpetta and her associates confront, or are confronted by, the killer or killers, usually concluding with the death of the killer. The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular TV series on forensics, both fictional, such as &quot;&quot;, and documentaries, such as &quot;Cold Case Files&quot;.

Other significant themes in the Scarpetta novels include health, individual safety and security, food, family, and the emerging sexual self-discovery of Scarpetta&#x27;s niece. Often, conflicts and secret manipulations by Scarpetta&#x27;s colleagues and staff are involved in the story-line and make the murder cases more complex. Although scenes from the novels take place in a variety of locations around the United States and (less commonly) internationally, they center around the city of Richmond, Virginia.

There are two marked style shifts in the Scarpetta novels. Starting from &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; (2000), the style changes from past tense to present tense. Starting from &quot;Blow Fly&quot; (2003), the style changes from a first person to a third person, omniscient, narrator. Events are even narrated from the viewpoint of the murderers. Before &quot;Blow Fly&quot; the events are seen through Scarpetta&#x27;s eyes only, and other points of view only appear in letters that Scarpetta reads.

Cornwell shifted back to a first-person perspective in the Scarpetta novel &quot;Port Mortuary&quot; (2010).

===Andy Brazil/Judy Hammer series===
In addition to the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three pseudo-police fictions, known as the Trooper Andy Brazil/Superintendent Judy Hammer series, which are set in North Carolina, Virginia, and off the mid-Atlantic coast. Besides the older-woman/younger-man premise, the books include themes of scatology and sepsis.

===Jack the Ripper theorist===
Cornwell has been involved in a continuing, self-financed quest for evidence to support her theory that Victorian painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. In pursuit of this hypothesis, she has written two books: &quot;Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed&quot;, published in 2002, and &quot;Ripper: The Secret Life Of Walter Sickert&quot;, published in 2017. In total, she is said to have spent a reported $6m on Ripper-related research. 

She wrote &quot;Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed&quot; to much controversy, especially within the British art world and among Ripperologists. Cornwell denied being obsessed with Jack the Ripper in full-page ads in two British newspapers and has said the case was &quot;far from closed&quot;. In 2001, Cornwell was criticized for allegedly destroying one of Sickert&#x27;s paintings in pursuit of the Ripper&#x27;s identity. She believed the well-known painter to be responsible for the string of murders and had purchased over 30 of his paintings and argued that they closely resembled the Ripper crime scenes. Cornwell also claimed a breakthrough: a letter written by someone purporting to be the killer had the same watermark as some of Sickert&#x27;s writing paper. Ripper experts noted, however, that there were hundreds of letters from different authors falsely claiming to be the killer, and the watermark in question was on a brand of stationery that was widely available. 

French art expert Johann Naldi validates the author&#x27;s theory, claiming to have found a portrait that he attributes to the French painter Jacques-Émile Blanche. For Naldi, the discovery of this painting, which depicts a man who appears to share Sickert&#x27;s features, is &quot;visual confirmation of Patricia Cornwell&#x27;s theory&quot;.

=== TV appearance ===
She made a brief appearance on the police procedural drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; in the episode &quot;True Genius&quot; as herself.

==Legal issues==
===DUI case===
On January 10, 1993, Cornwell crashed her Mercedes-Benz while under the influence of alcohol. She was convicted of drunk driving and sentenced to 28 days in a treatment center.

===Leslie Sachs case===
Leslie Sachs, author of &quot;The Virginia Ghost Murders&quot; (1998), claimed there were similarities between his novel and Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;. In 2000, he sent letters to Cornwell&#x27;s publisher, started a web page, and placed stickers on copies of his novel alleging that Cornwell was committing plagiarism. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Cornwell a preliminary injunction against Sachs, opining that his claims were likely to be found baseless.

In 2007, during her libel suit against Sachs, Cornwell testified that Sachs had accused her in online postings of being a &quot;Jew hater&quot; and &quot;neo-Nazi&quot; who bribed judges, conspired to have him killed, and was under investigation by U.S. authorities. The court permanently enjoined Sachs from making defamatory accusations against Cornwell and awarded Cornwell $37,780 in damages to cover the costs of defending herself against Sachs&#x27; internet attacks.

===Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin===
In 2004, Cornwell assigned management of her financial matters to New York-based Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin, managed by principal Evan Snapper. Agreeing to pay the firm a base rate of $40,000/month, her lawyer later claimed that Cornwell had hired Snapper to insulate herself from her money due to her ongoing mental health issues, and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company.

Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net worth of her and her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc., despite having above $10 million in earnings per year during the previous four years, was a little under $13 million, the equivalent of only one year&#x27;s net income. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit, Snapper pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance regulations. The court case opened in January 2013, with Cornwell suing the firm for a combined sum of $100M. On February 19, a Boston jury awarded Cornwell 50.9 million (£33.4 million).

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
On June 14, 1980, she married Charles L. Cornwell, who was 17 years her senior and one of her professors. The marriage occurred shortly before her graduation. Charles Cornwell later became a Christian preacher. In 1989, the couple separated, with Patricia retaining her married name after the divorce.

Cornwell had a relationship with FBI agent Marguerite &quot;Margo&quot; Bennett, which earned headlines in 1989 after Bennett&#x27;s husband attempted to kidnap his estranged wife. 

In 2006, Cornwell married Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University. However, she did not disclose news of her marriage until 2007. Cornwell later stated that turning 50 had made her see the importance of speaking out for equal rights and spoke of how Billie Jean King had helped her come to terms with talking about her sexuality publicly. She lives with Gruber in Massachusetts.

Since childhood, Cornwell has been friends with the family of evangelist Billy Graham and his wife Ruth Bell, often serving as the family&#x27;s unofficial spokesperson to the media. She also wrote an authorized biography of Ruth Bell Graham. Cornwell was previously a personal friend of President George H. W. Bush. She referred to him as &quot;Big George&quot; and vacationed at the family&#x27;s summer retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, but later distanced herself from the Bush family.

===Health problems===
Cornwell has in the past suffered from anorexia nervosa and depression, which began in her late teens. She spoke openly in 2008-09 about her struggle with bipolar disorder, but in 2015 said that she was misdiagnosed.

===Political views===
Since 1998, Cornwell has donated at least $84,000 to the Republican Party and $78,800 to the Democratic Party, and has made individual contributions to Republican and Democratic U.S. Senate candidates, including George Allen, John Warner, Orrin Hatch, Hillary Clinton, Nicola Tsongas, Charles Robb, and Mark Warner.

Cornwell has spoken negatively of the presidency of George W. Bush, saying, &quot;I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. I thought he was going to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It&#x27;s not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on.&quot;

===Charity===
Cornwell has made several notable charitable donations, including funding the Virginia Institute for Forensic Science and Medicine, funding scholarships to the University of Tennessee&#x27;s National Forensics Academy and Davidson College&#x27;s Creative Writing Program (the result of which is the Patricia Cornwell Creative Writing Scholarship, awarded to one or two incoming freshmen), and donating her collection of Walter Sickert paintings to Harvard University. As a member of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital&#x27;s National Council, she is an advocate for psychiatric research. She has also made million-dollar donations to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the Crime Scene Academy and to the Harvard Art Museum. She donated funds to the Richmond City Police Dept. and neighboring Henrico County Police Dept. to purchase bullet-proof vests for the police dogs. Cornwell is also a major contributor at the Five Star level to the Veterans Village of San Diego, with lifetime giving of more than $250,000. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland trains investigators in the Scarpetta House, a full-scale apartment donated by Cornwell, in which crime scenes are staged.

===Hobbies===
Patricia received her private helicopter license in 1999.

<doc id="170948" wikidata="Q3245255" url="?curid=170948" title="List of television spinoffs">
<text>A spinoff in television is a new series containing characters or settings that originated in a previous series, but with a different focus, tone, or theme. For example, the series &quot;Frasier&quot; was a spinoff of the earlier series &quot;Cheers&quot;: the character Frasier Crane was introduced as a secondary character on &quot;Cheers&quot;, and became the protagonist of his own series, set in a different city, in the spinoff. Spinoffs are particularly common in sitcom. A related phenomenon, not to be confused with the spinoff, is the crossover.

Some spinoffs are &quot;engineered&quot; to introduce a new character on the original television series, just so that that character can anchor the new spinoff – that episode of the original series is often known as a &quot;backdoor pilot&quot;. For example, the character Avery Ryan appeared in two episodes of the Las Vegas-based &quot;&quot; before the premiere of &quot;&quot;.

A revival, a later remake of a preexisting show, is not a spinoff. This is the case in &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; where the 2005 series which begins with a new Doctor but maintains the existing continuity. An exception to this rule can be made to series such as &quot;The Transformers&quot; where the lines of continuity are blurred. If a television pilot was written but never shot, it is not considered a spinoff. When a show undergoes a name change, it is not necessarily a spinoff.

Neither is a reboot series, a term recently invented for motion pictures, which can also occur in television (e.g. The &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series of 2003 is a reboot, not a spinoff of the 1978 version). This is distinct from a revival in that there is little or no attempt to retain continuity, or casting, with the original. A recent example is the 1987 series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, rebooted as the 2012 The CW television series &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot;, which keeps only the main premise of a female law enforcement official aided by a man-beast, the New York City locale, and the names of the two main characters. The CW&#x27;s &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot; was later rebooted again as a Max series starting in 2023.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999–present), which is the spinoff of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1990–2010; 2022–present)), is the longest-running spinoff series in American TV history with its landmark 25th season set to premiere on January 18, 2024.

<doc id="170949" wikidata="Q771758" url="?curid=170949" title="List of premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is current title of the first minister for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, which was at certain points in its history a colony, dominion, and province. The province had a system of responsible government from 1855 to 1934, and again since 1949. Newfoundland became a British crown colony in 1855, in 1907 it became a dominion, and in 1949, it became a province and joined Canadian Confederation. Since then, the province has been a part of the Canadian federation and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters. The province was named Newfoundland and Labrador on April 1, 1949 .

The province has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The premier is Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s head of government, and the king of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.

From 1855 to 1907, the position of first minister was known as premier. After the colony was granted dominion status, the position became known as prime minister. Democratic government was suspended in 1934 and replaced by an appointed Commission of Government, until 1949 Newfoundland became a province of Canada. Since the reinstitution of democratic government in 1949, the title of first minister has been premier.

Since 1855, Newfoundland and Labrador has been led by ten Colonial premiers, nine Dominion prime ministers, three chairmen of Commission of Government, and fourteen provincial premiers. Of the provincial premiers, seven are from the Liberal Party, and seven are from the Progressive Conservative Party.

==Premiers of the Newfoundland Colony (1855–1907)==





==Dominion Prime Ministers of Newfoundland (1907–1934)==
By Royal Proclamation, the colony was granted dominion status on 26 September 1907 becoming the Dominion of Newfoundland with its head of government being given the title Prime Minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland.





==Chairmen of the Commission of Government (1934–1949)==
With the suspension of responsible government the dominion was administered by the Commission of Government, from 1934 to 1949. It was a body of seven appointed by the British government, made up of three British officials, three Newfoundlanders, and chaired by the Governor of Newfoundland.

<doc id="170952" wikidata="Q1411213" url="?curid=170952" title="List of premiers of Saskatchewan">
<text>The premier of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan is the province&#x27;s head of government since 1905. Saskatchewan uses a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that has the support of a majority in the Legislative Assembly. The premier chooses a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Saskatchewan, and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. By constitutional standards, general elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election; the province of Saskatchewan has had fixed election dates calling for elections every four years by statutory legislation since 2007, though that has been standard practice since the 1938 election. The premier may also ask the lieutenant governor for early dissolution of the legislative assembly or an early election may be called if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or passage of a non-confidence motion. 

Prior to 1905, Saskatchewan was part of the North-West Territories and was governed by the lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories from 1870 until 1897, and the premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905.

<doc id="170954" wikidata="Q369022" url="?curid=170954" title="Walter Bagehot">
<text>Walter Bagehot ( ; 3 February 1826 – 24 March 1877) was an English journalist, businessman, and essayist, who wrote extensively about government, economics, literature and race. He is known for co-founding the &quot;National Review&quot; in 1855, and for his works &quot;The English Constitution&quot; and &quot;Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market&quot; (1873).

==Life==
Bagehot was born in Langport, Somerset, England, on 3 February 1826. His father, Thomas Watson Bagehot, was managing director and vice-chairman of Stuckey&#x27;s Bank. He attended University College London (UCL), where he studied mathematics and, in 1848, earned a master&#x27;s degree in moral philosophy. Bagehot was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but preferred to join his father in 1852 in his family&#x27;s shipping and banking business.

In 1858, Bagehot married Elizabeth (Eliza) Wilson (1832–1921), whose father, James Wilson, was the founder and owner of &quot;The Economist&quot;. The couple were happily married until Bagehot&#x27;s untimely death at age 51, but had no children. A collection of their love-letters was published in 1933.

===Journalism===
In 1855, Bagehot founded the &quot;National Review&quot; with his friend Richard Holt Hutton. In 1861, he became editor-in-chief of &quot;The Economist&quot;. In the 16 years he served as its editor, Bagehot expanded the reporting of politics by &quot;The Economist&quot;, and increased its influence among policy-makers. He was widely accepted by the British establishment and was elected to the Athenaeum in 1875.

He considered himself a &quot;conservative Liberal or &#x27;between size in politics.&#x27;&quot;

===Works===

In 1867, Bagehot wrote &quot;The English Constitution&quot;, a book that explores the nature of the constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically its Parliament and monarchy. It appeared at the same time that Parliament enacted the Reform Act of 1867, requiring Bagehot to write an extended introduction to the second edition which appeared in 1872.

Bagehot also wrote &quot;Physics and Politics&quot; (1872), in which he examines how civilisations sustain themselves, arguing that, in their earliest phase, civilisations are very much in opposition to the values of modern liberalism, insofar as they are sustained by conformism and military success but, once they are secured, it is possible for them to mature into systems which allow for greater diversity and freedom.

His viewpoint was based on his distinction between the qualities of an &quot;accomplished man&quot; and those of a &quot;rude man&quot;, which he considered to be the result of iterative inheritances by which the &quot;nervous organisation&quot; of the individual became increasingly refined down through the generations. He regarded that distinction as a moral achievement whereby, through the actions of the will, the &quot;accomplished&quot; elite was able to morally differentiate themselves from &quot;rude men&quot; by a &quot;hereditary drill&quot;. He equally applied such reasoning to develop a form of pseudoscientific racism, whereby those of mixed race lacked any &quot;inherited creed&quot; or &quot;fixed traditional sentiments&quot; upon which, he considered, human nature depended.

He attempted to provide empirical support for his views by citing John Lubbock and Edward Tylor although, in their writings on human evolution, neither of them accepted arguments for innate hereditary differences, as opposed to cultural inheritance. Tylor, in particular, rejected Bagehot&#x27;s view of the centrality of physical heredity, or that the modern &quot;savage&quot; mind had become &quot;tattooed over with monstrous images&quot; by which base instincts had been preserved in crevices, as opposed to accomplished European man, for whom such instincts had been smoothed away through the inherited will to exercise reason.

In &quot;Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market&quot; (1873) Bagehot seeks to explain the world of finance and banking. His observations on finance are often cited by central bankers, in particular in the period after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. More specifically, there was particular popularity &quot;Bagehot&#x27;s Dictum&quot; that in times of crisis of the financial system, central banks should lend freely to solvent depository institutions, yet only against sound collateral and at interest rates high enough to dissuade those borrowers that are not genuinely in need.

===Legacy===

Bagehot never fully recovered from a bout of pneumonia he suffered in 1867, and he died in 1877 from complications of what was said to be a cold. Collections of Bagehot&#x27;s literary, political, and economic essays were published after his death. Their subjects ranged from Shakespeare and Disraeli to the price of silver. Every year, the British Political Studies Association awards the Walter Bagehot Prize for the best dissertation in the field of government and public administration.

Bagehot&#x27;s collected works were issued in a set of 15 volumes, published by &quot;The Economist&quot; between 1965 and 1986, and edited by Norman St. John-Stevas.

Minor planet 2901 Bagehot, discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, is named in his honour.

&quot;The Economist&quot; carries a weekly current affairs commentary entitled &quot;Bagehot&quot;, which is named in his honour and is described as &quot;an analysis of British life and politics, in the tradition of Walter Bagehot&quot;. 
, the column has been written by Duncan Robinson, political editor of the publication.

<doc id="170965" wikidata="Q1438804" url="?curid=170965" title="Fort Vancouver">
<text>Fort Vancouver was a 19th-century fur trading post built in the winter of 1824–1825. It was the headquarters of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Columbia Department, located in the Pacific Northwest. Named for Captain George Vancouver, the fort was located on the northern bank of the Columbia River in present-day Vancouver, Washington. The fort was a major center of the regional fur trading. Every year trade goods and supplies from London arrived either via ships sailing to the Pacific Ocean or overland from Hudson Bay via the York Factory Express. Supplies and trade goods were exchanged with a plethora of Indigenous cultures for fur pelts. Furs from Fort Vancouver were often shipped to the Chinese port of Guangzhou where they were traded for Chinese manufactured goods for sale in the United Kingdom. At its pinnacle, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Today, a full-scale replica of the fort, with internal buildings, has been constructed and is open to the public as Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.

==Background==

During the War of 1812, the Pacific Northwest was a distant region of the conflict. Two rival fur trading outfits, the Canadian North West Company (NWC) and the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC), had until then both operated in the region peaceably. Funded largely by John Jacob Astor, the PFC operated without many opportunities for military defense by the United States Navy. News of the war and of a coming British warship put the American company in a difficult position. In October 1813, management met at Fort Astoria and agreed to transfer its assets to the NWC. HMS &quot;Racoon&quot; arrived the following month and in honor of George III of the United Kingdom, Fort Astoria was renamed to Fort George.

In negotiations with American Albert Gallatin throughout 1818, British plenipotentiary Frederick John Robinson was offered a proposition for a partition that would have, as Gallatin stated, &quot;all the waters emptying in the sound called the Gulf of Georgia.&quot; Frederick Merk has argued the definition used by the negotiators of the Gulf of Georgia included the entirety of the Puget Sound, in addition to the Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca. This would have given the United Kingdom the most favorable location for ports north of Alta California and south of Russian America. Robinson did not agree to the proposal and subsequent talks did not focus on establishing a permanent border west of the Rocky Mountains.

The Treaty of 1818 made the resources of the vast region were to be &quot;free and open&quot; to citizens from either nation. The treaty wasn&#x27;t made to combine American and British interests against other colonial powers in the region. Rather, the document states that the joint occupancy of the Pacific Northwest was intended to &quot;prevent disputes&quot; between the two nations from arising. In the ensuing years, the North West Company continued to expand its operations in the Pacific Northwest. Skirmishes with its major competitor, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), had already flared into the Pemmican War. The end of the conflict in 1821 saw the NWC mandated by the British Government to merge into the HBC.

===Later negotiations===
Throughout 1825 and 1826, British officials continued to offer Americans partition plans for the Pacific Coast of North America. These largely originated in part from correspondence with the NWC and later HBC. The border would continue to extend west on the 49th parallel to the Rocky Mountains, where the Columbia (and some times the Snake River) would be used as the border until it reached the Pacific Ocean. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs George Canning has been appraised by later historians as the most supportive British Foreign minister in securing a border along the Columbia. United States Secretary of State Henry Clay had given instructions to the American plenipotentiaries to offer a partition of the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean. The difference in the two considered plans were too much to solve, making the diplomats put off a formal colonial division once more.

==Establishment==
Fort Vancouver was established on the north bank of the Columbia River in the winter of 1824–1825. The London-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established it to serve as the headquarters of the Company&#x27;s interior fur trade. In the early 1820s a general reorganization of all NWC properties, now entirely under HBC management, was overseen directly by Sir George Simpson. The newly established Columbia District needed a more suitable headquarters than Fort George at the mouth of the Columbia. Simpson was instrumental in the establishment of Fort Vancouver. Using the HBC position that any settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute would confirm the border placement along the Columbia; Simpson selected a location situated opposite from the mouth of the Willamette River. This expanse was an open and fertile prairie that was outside the flood plain and had easy access to the Columbia.

==Fort==

===Description===
An employee of the HBC, wrote a general description of Fort Vancouver and its structural composition as it was in 1843:

The fort is in the shape of a parallelogram, about 250 yards long, by 150 broad; enclose by a sort of wooden wall, made of pickets, or large beams firmly fixed in the ground, and closely fitted together, twenty feet high, and strong secured on the inside by buttressess. At each angle there is a bastion, mounting two twelve pounders, and in the centre there some eighteen pounders; ... these cannon have become useless. The area within is divided into two courts, around which are arranged about forty neat, strong wooden buildings, one story high, designed for various purposes...

The fort was substantial. The palisades that protected it were long, wide and about high. Inside, there were 24 buildings, including housing, warehouses, a school, a library, a pharmacy, a chapel, a blacksmith, plus a large manufacturing facility. The Chief Factor&#x27;s residence in the center of Fort Vancouver was two stories tall. Inside was a dining hall where company clerks, traders, physicians, and others of the gentleman class would dine with the supervising Chief Factor. In general, the entirety of the Chief Factor&#x27;s House and its meals were typically barred for general laborers and fur trappers. After dinner the majority of these gentlemen would relocate to the &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Hall&quot; to &quot;amuse themselves as they please, either in smoking, reading, or telling and listening to stories of their own and others&#x27; curious adventures&quot;. As Dunn recalled;

The smoking room ... presents the appearance of an armory and a museum. All sorts of weapons, and dresses, and curiosities of civilized and savage life, and of the various implements for the prosecution of the [fur] trade, may be seen there.

Outside the ramparts there was additional housing, as well as fields, gardens, fruit orchards, a shipyard, a distillery, a tannery, a sawmill, and a dairy. By 1843, situated roughly 600 yards outside Fort Vancouver were about sixty wooden houses. This small settlement was inhabited by fur trappers, machinists and other laborers of the fort. There they resided with their Indigenous or Métis wives and families. The dwellings were organized into orderly rows. The settlement was commonly referred to as Kanaka Village because of the many Hawaiians in company employ who lived there. In fact, it has been suggested that the Fort had the &quot;largest single group of Hawaiians ever to congregate outside their home islands&quot;.

===Fur trade operations===
With high demand from Europe for fur-based textiles in the early 19th Century, the HBC was forced to expand its fur trade operations across North America to the Pacific Northwest. Prior to the establishment of Fort Vancouver, the HBC&#x27;s largest westward fort was Fort William in present-day Ontario, which the company gained through its merger with the NWC. From its establishment, Fort Vancouver was the regional headquarters of the HBC&#x27;s fur trade operations in the Columbia District. The territory it oversaw stretched from the Rocky Mountains in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and from Sitka in the north to San Francisco in the south. Fur trappers would bring pelts collected during the winter to the fort to be traded in exchange for company credit. The credit, issued by the company clerks, could be used to purchase goods in the fort&#x27;s trade shops. Furs from throughout the Columbia District were brought to Fort Vancouver from smaller HBC outposts either overland, or by water via the Columbia River. Once they were sorted and inventoried by the company&#x27;s clerks, the furs were hung out to dry in the fur storehouse, a large two-story post-on-sill building located within the walls of the fort. After the furs had been processed, they were mixed, weighed into bundles, and packed with tobacco leaves as an insecticide. The 270-pound bundle of furs would be placed in a large press and wrapped in elk or bear hide to create overseas fur bales. The large 270-pound bales were then placed on boats on the Columbia River for shipment to London via the HBC trade routes. The furs would then be auctioned off to textile manufacturers in London. A large demand came from hatters who produced popular beaver felted hats.

===Personnel===
For most of its existence, Fort Vancouver was th largest non-Indigenous settlement in the Pacific Northwest. The population of the fort and the environs was mostly French Canadians, Métis, and Kanaka Hawaiians; there were also English, Scots, Irish, and a variety of Indigenous peoples including Iroquois and Cree. The common language spoken at the fort was Canadian French, while company records and official journals were kept in English. However, trading and relations with the surrounding community were done in Chinook Jargon, a pidgin of Chinook, Nootka, Chehalis, English, French, Hawaiian, and other elements.

A survey of the total personnel at Fort Vancouver in 1846 reveals a culturally and materially diverse populace. Notably, the number of employees from the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland Islands was 57 men. This is exactly the same number as the combined number of workers from England and mainland Scotland. The number of men hired from Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and Rupert&#x27;s Land was in total 91. These men came from English, French Canadian, Métis, Iroquois, Cree, and other cultural backgrounds. Most notable however, was that Kanaka Hawaiians totaled 154 that year, or 43% of the total fort population.

Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin was its first manager, a position he held for nearly 22 years, from 1824 to 1845. McLoughlin applied the laws of Upper Canada to British subjects, kept peace with the natives and sought to maintain law and order with American settlers as well. McLoughlin was later hailed as the Father of Oregon for allowing Americans to settle south of the Columbia River. Against the company&#x27;s wishes, he provided substantial aid and assistance to westbound American settlers in the territory. He left the company in 1846 to found Oregon City in the Willamette Valley.

James Douglas spent nineteen years in Fort Vancouver; serving as a clerk until 1834 when he was promoted to the rank of Chief Trader. From October 1838 to November 1839, while McLoughlin was on furlough in Europe, Chief Trader Douglas was in charge. In November 1839 Douglas was promoted to the rank of Chief Factor. Douglas took on several temporary assignments elsewhere, to set up HBC&#x27;s trading post at Yerba Buena (San Francisco) California in 1841, and to establish Fort Victoria in 1843, but from 1839 to 1845 there were normally two Chief Factors based at Fort Vancouver, with McLoughlin in charge and Douglas as his subordinate.

===Agricultural production===
At its inception, Governor George Simpson wanted the fort to be self-sufficient as food was costly to ship. Fort staff typically maintained one year&#x27;s extra supplies in the fort warehouses to avoid the disastrous consequences of shipwrecks and other calamities. Fort Vancouver eventually began to produce a surplus of food, some of which was used to provision other HBC posts in the Columbia Department. The area around the fort was commonly known as &quot;La Jolie Prairie&quot; (the pretty prairie) or &quot;Belle Vue Point&quot; (beautiful vista). In time, Fort Vancouver diversified its economic activities beyond fur trading and begin exporting agricultural foodstuffs from HBC farms, along with salmon, lumber, and other products. It developed markets for these exports in Russian America, the Hawaiian Kingdom, and Mexican California. The HBC opened agencies in Sitka, Honolulu, and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) to facilitate such trade.

==Express==

Fort Vancouver was supplied in part through the overland York Factory Express. It originated from a route used by the NWC between Fort George to Fort William on Lake Superior. Each spring two brigades were sent, one from Fort Vancouver and the other from York Factory. A typical brigade consisted of about forty to seventy five men. These men carried supplies, furs and correspondence by boat, horseback and in backpacks for various HBC posts and personnel along the route. Furs stored at the York Factory would in turn be sold at London in an annual fur sale. Indians along the way were often paid in trade goods to help them portage around falls and unnavigable rapids.

==Americans==
The HBC, which controlled the fur trade in much of what Americans styled the Oregon Country, had previously discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. By 1838, however, American settlers were coming across the Rocky Mountains and their numbers increased each subsequent year. Many left from St. Louis, Missouri, and followed a fairly straight, but difficult, route called the Oregon Trail. For many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies before starting their homestead.

During the Great Migration of 1843 an estimated 700 to 1,000 American settlers arrived via the Oregon Trail.

==British response==

The signing of the RAC-HBC Agreement with the Russian-American Company pushed the HBC into creating an agricultural subsidiary, the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company in 1840. Herds of sheep and cattle were purchased in Alta California and raised at Fort Nisqually. Agricultural products were sown and grown in abundance at Fort Cowlitz and exported with foodstuffs produced at Fort Vancouver to Russian America. Recruitment from retired HBC laborers residing in the Willamette Valley as agriculturalists, through the use of priests François Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers, utterly failed to convince any farmer to leave for vicinity of the Cowlitz farms. While additional plans called for recruitment in Scotland, these too came to nothing.

The only successful source of early colonists for the PSAC would come from the Red River colony. In November 1839, Sir George Simpson instructed Duncan Finlayson to begin promoting the PSAC to colonists. James Sinclair was later appointed by Finlayson to guide the settler families that signed the PSAC agreement to Fort Vancouver. They left Fort Garry (modern Winnipeg) in June 1841 with 121 people that consisted of 23 families. When they arrived at Fort Vancouver, they then numbered 21 families of 116 people. Fourteen of them were relocated to Fort Nisqually, while the remaining seven families were sent to Fort Cowlitz.

==Oregon Treaty==
Signed in 1846, the Oregon Treaty set the Canada–United States border at the 49th parallel north, putting Fort Vancouver within American territory. Although the treaty ensured that the HBC could continue to operate and had free access to navigate the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and the Columbia River, company operations were effectively stifled by the treaty and became unprofitable and were soon closed down.

==Restoration==
Because of its significance in United States history a plan was put together to preserve the location. Fort Vancouver was declared a US National Monument on June 19, 1948, and redesignated as Fort Vancouver National Historic Site on June 30, 1961. This was taken a step further in 1996 when a area around the fort, including Kanaka Village, the Columbia Barracks and the bank of the river, was established as the Vancouver National Historic Reserve maintained by the National Park Service. It is possible to tour the fort. Notable buildings of the restored Fort Vancouver include a bake house, where hardtack baking techniques are shown, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop and its collection of carpentry tools, and the kitchen, where daily meals were prepared.

<text>Charlotte County (2016 population 25,428) is the most southwestern county of New Brunswick, Canada.

It was formed in 1784 when New Brunswick was partitioned from Nova Scotia and named for Queen Charlotte. Once a layer of local government, the county seat was abolished with the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program in 1966. Counties continue to be used as census subdivisions by Statistics Canada.

Located in the southwestern corner of the province, bordering the US state of Maine, Charlotte County is at the northern end of the Appalachian Mountains, which gives it a rugged terrain that includes Mount Pleasant. The St. Croix, Magaguadavic, and Digdegaush rivers drain into the Bay of Fundy. The county includes the large, populated islands of Grand Manan, White Head, Deer Island, and Campobello.

Eighteen per cent of the workforce is employed in aquaculture. Connors Bros., the largest sardine canning facility in North America, is located in Blacks Harbour. Cooke Aquaculture is an Atlantic salmon farming company, founded and headquartered in St. George. A paper mill, operated by JD Irving, is in Utopia, and Flakeboard Co. Ltd. operates outside of St. Stephen. Ganong Bros., Canada&#x27;s oldest chocolate company, maintains its factory in St. Stephen.

Governance is in the form of New Brunswick municipalities in the case of the towns of St. Andrews, St. George, and St. Stephen, the villages of Grand Manan and Blacks Harbour, and the rural community of Campobello Island. The remaining parts of the county are administered as local service districts of the Southwest New Brunswick Regional Service Commission, except Clarendon, which is part of RSC 11 in neighbouring Sunbury County.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Charlotte County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="170974" wikidata="Q211787" url="?curid=170974" title="Jules Bordet">
<text>Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet ( , ; 13 June 1870 – 6 April 1961) was a Belgian immunologist and microbiologist. The bacterial genus &quot;Bordetella&quot; is named after him. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity.

==Education and early life==
Bordet was born at Soignies, Belgium. He graduated as Doctor of Medicine from the Free University of Brussels in 1892 and began his work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1894, in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, who had just discovered phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells, an expression of cellular immunity.

==Career==
In 1895 Bordet made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific antibody is significantly enhanced &quot;in vivo&quot; by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as complement). Four years later, in 1899, he described a similar destructive process involving complement, &quot;hemolysis&quot;, in which foreign red blood cells are ruptured or &quot;lysed&quot; following exposure to immune serum. In 1900, he left Paris to found an institute in Brussels like Pasteur&#x27;s, and continued to work extensively on the mechanisms involved in the action of complement. These studies became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for syphilis (specifically, the development of the Wassermann test by August von Wassermann). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases.

With Octave Gengou, he isolated &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of whooping cough. He became Professor of Bacteriology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in 1907.

==Awards and honours==
In March 1916, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society and in 1930, delivered their Croonian Lecture. In this lecture, Bordet also concluded that bacteriophages, the bacteria-killing &quot;invisible viruses&quot; discovered by Felix d&#x27;Herelle did not exist and that bacteria destroyed themselves using a process of autolysis. This theory collapsed in 1941 with the publication by Ruska of the first electron microscope pictures of bacteriophages. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity.

Bordet died in 1961 and was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.
* 1919: Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.
*1921: Awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

The Bordet railway station in Brussels is named after him.

The cancer hospital Institut Jules Bordet is also named after him.

<text>Frederick George Peter Ingle Finch (28 September 191614 January 1977) was an English-Australian actor of theatre, film and radio.

Born in London, he emigrated to Australia at the age of ten and was raised in Sydney, where he worked in vaudeville and radio before becoming a star of Australian films. Joining the Old Vic Company after World War II, he achieved widespread critical success in Britain for both stage and screen performances. One of British cinema&#x27;s most celebrated leading men of the time, Finch won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role five times, and won a posthumous Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of crazed television anchorman Howard Beale in the 1976 film &quot;Network&quot;.

According to the British Film Institute, &quot;it is arguable that no other actor ever chalked up such a rewarding CV in British films, and he accumulated the awards to bolster this view&quot;. He died only two months before the 49th Academy Awards, making him the first person to win a posthumous Oscar in an acting category. As of 2025, the only other person to have done so was fellow Australian Heath Ledger.

==Early life==
===Family===
Finch was born as Frederick George Peter Ingle Finch in London to Alicia Gladys Fisher. At the time, Alicia was married to George Finch.

George Finch was born to British parents in New South Wales, Australia, but was educated in Paris and Zürich. He was a research chemist when he moved to Britain in 1912 and later served during the First World War with the Royal Army Depot and the Royal Field Artillery. In 1915, at Portsmouth, Hampshire, George married Alicia Fisher, the daughter of a Kent barrister. However, Peter only learned in his mid-40s that Wentworth Edward Dallas &quot;Jock&quot; Campbell, an Indian Army officer, not George Finch, was his biological father. George Finch divorced his wife in 1920 on the grounds of her adultery with Campbell. Alicia Finch married Jock Campbell in 1922.

===Early childhood===
George gained custody of Peter, who was taken from his biological mother and raised by his adoptive paternal grandmother, Laura Finch (formerly Black), in Vaucresson, France. In 1925 Laura took Peter with her to Adyar, a theosophical community near Madras, India, for a number of months, and the young boy lived for a time in a Buddhist monastery. Perhaps as a result of his childhood contact with Buddhism, Finch always claimed to be a Buddhist. He is reported to have said: &quot;I think a man dying on a cross is a ghastly symbol for a religion. And I think a man sitting under a bo tree and becoming enlightened is a beautiful one.&quot;

In 1926 he was sent to Australia to live with his great-uncle Edward Herbert Finch at Greenwich Point in Sydney. For three years he attended the local school, then North Sydney Intermediate High School, until 1929. RAF pilot and author Paul Brickhill was a school friend.

==Early career in Australia==
After abandoning school at 15, Finch went into various jobs, including as a copy boy for the Sydney &quot;Sun&quot;.

However, he was more interested in acting, and in late 1933 appeared in a play, &quot;Caprice&quot;, with the New Sydney Repertory Company.

In 1934–35 he appeared in a number of productions for Doris Fitton at the Savoy Theatre, some with a young Sumner Locke Elliott. He also worked as a sideshow spruiker at the Sydney Royal Easter Show, in vaudeville with Joe Cody and as a foil to American comedian Bert le Blanc. At age 19 Finch toured Australia with George Sorlie&#x27;s travelling troupe.

===Radio work===
He did radio acting with Hugh Denison&#x27;s BSA Players (for Broadcasting Service Association, later to become Macquarie Players). He came to the attention of Australian Broadcasting Commission radio drama producer Lawrence H. Cecil, who was to serve as his coach and mentor throughout 1939 and 1940. He was &quot;Chris&quot; in the Children&#x27;s Session and the first Muddle-Headed Wombat.

He later starred with Neva Carr Glyn in an enormously popular series by Max Afford as husband-and-wife detectives &quot;Jeffery and Elizabeth Blackburn&quot; as well as other ABC radio plays.

===First films===
Finch&#x27;s first screen performance was in the short film &quot;The Magic Shoes&quot; (1935), an adaptation of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; fairy tale, where Finch played Prince Charming.

He made his feature film debut in Ken G. Hall&#x27;s &quot;Dad and Dave Come to Town&quot; (1938), playing a small comic role. His performance was well received and Hall subsequently cast Finch in a larger role in &quot;Mr. Chedworth Steps Out&quot; (1939), supporting Cecil Kellaway.

Finch appeared in a war propaganda film, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1941), playing a fifth columnist.

==War service==
Finch enlisted in the Australian Army on 2 June 1941. He served in the Middle East and was an anti-aircraft gunner during the Bombing of Darwin.

During his war service Finch was given leave to act in radio, theatre and film. He appeared in a number of propaganda shorts, including &quot;Another Threshold&quot; (1942), &quot;These Stars Are Mine&quot; (1943), &quot;While There is Still Time&quot; (1943) and &quot;South West Pacific&quot; (1943), the latter for Ken G. Hall. He also appeared in two of the few Australian feature films made during the war, &quot;The Rats of Tobruk&quot; (1944) and the less distinguished &quot;Red Sky at Morning&quot; (1944).

Finch produced and performed Army Concert Party work, and in 1945 toured bases and hospitals with two Terence Rattigan plays he directed, &quot;French Without Tears&quot; and &quot;While the Sun Shines&quot;. He narrated the widely seen documentaries &quot;Whose War Is It?&quot; (1943), &quot;Jungle Patrol&quot; (1944) and &quot;Sons of the Anzacs&quot; (1945).

Finch was discharged from the army on 31 October 1945 at the rank of sergeant.

==Post-war career in Australia==
After the war, Finch continued to work extensively in radio and established himself as Australia&#x27;s leading actor in that medium, winning Macquarie Awards for best actor in 1946 and 1947. He also worked as a compere, producer and writer.

In 1946, Finch co-founded the Mercury Theatre Company, which put on a number of productions in Sydney over the next few years (initially in the diminutive St James&#x27; Hall), as well as running a theatre school.

Finch continued to appear in the (rare) Australian feature films made around this time including &quot;A Son Is Born&quot; (1946) and &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; (1949). He was a leading contender to play Sir Charles Kingsford Smith in &quot;Smithy&quot; (1946) but lost out to Ron Randell.

Finch was also involved in some documentaries, narrating &quot;Indonesia Calling&quot; (1946) and helping make &quot;Primitive Peoples&quot; about the people of Arnhem Land.

===Visit of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, and return to Britain===
Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh toured Australia in 1948 with the Old Vic Company. They attended the Mercury production of &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; on the factory floor of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Glass Factory starring Finch. Olivier was impressed with Finch&#x27;s acting and encouraged him to move to London, his birthplace, which he did that year.

==British career==

===Theatrical success===
When Finch arrived in Britain, success came relatively early. Harry Watt arranged for a screen test at Ealing Studios, which led to Finch being cast as a murderous actor in the movie &quot;Train of Events&quot; (1949) under the direction of Basil Dearden.

While making the film, Olivier cast Finch as a Pole in a stage play at The Old Vic, James Bridie&#x27;s &quot;Daphne Laureola&quot; (1949) supporting Edith Evans. This was a significant critical and commercial success and established Finch in London immediately. Olivier signed Finch to a five-year contract. When &quot;Train of Events&quot; was released, critic C. A. Lejeune praised Finch&#x27;s work in the London &quot;Observer&quot;, commenting that he &quot;adds good cheekbones to a quick intelligence and is likely to become a cult, I fear.&quot; &quot;The Scotsman&quot; said Finch &quot;should be regarded as one of the most hopeful recruits to the British screen.&quot;

Finch had a small role as an Australian prisoner of war in the World War two drama &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; (1950), directed by Jack Lee; this film would be the third-most-popular film at the British box office in 1950.

Finch&#x27;s performance as a Pole in &quot;Daphne Laureola&quot; led to his casting as a Polish soldier in &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; (1950), the British-filmed sequel to the wartime morale boosting film &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;; unlike its predecessor, it was poorly received critically, but it did give Finch an experience of working for a movie financed by a major Hollywood studio.

During this time, Finch continued to appear on stage in various productions while under contract to Olivier. He directed a stage production of &quot;The White Falcon&quot; in January 1950. In February 1950 he toured in a production of &quot;The Damascus Blade&quot; by Bridget Boland under the direction of Olivier, co starring with John Mills.

Finch returned to the London stage in &quot;Captain Carvallo&quot; by Denis Cannan, once more directed by Olivier.

Finch&#x27;s closeness to the Olivier family led to an affair with Olivier&#x27;s wife, Vivien Leigh, which began in 1948, and continued on and off for several years, ultimately ending because of Leigh&#x27;s deteriorating mental condition.

In March 1951 Finch replaced Dirk Bogarde for six weeks in a production of &quot;Point of Departure&quot; by Jean Anouilh. Later that year he played Iago opposite Orson Welles in a production of &quot;Othello&quot;, directed by Welles.

Despite his stage experience, according to the Sunday Times Finch, like his mentor Olivier, had stage fright, and as the 1950s progressed he worked increasingly in film.

===Rising film reputation===
Finch&#x27;s film career received a considerable boost when cast as the Sheriff of Nottingham in &quot;The Story of Robin Hood&quot; (1952) for Walt Disney, opposite Richard Todd.

In 1952 Finch performed at St James&#x27;s Theatre, King Street, London, in Sir Laurence Olivier&#x27;s and Gilbert Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Time&quot; a comedy by Samuel Taylor. He played the part of Papa. He also did &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Old Vic, playing Mercutio, to strong reviews.

He then made two films for Alexander Korda. In &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953) Finch played Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte opposite Robert Morley and Maurice Evans in the lead; the resulting movie was a box office disappointment. In &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1953), from the Graham Greene novel, Finch played a priest opposite Trevor Howard; his performance was a critical success.

Finch returned to the stage at the Old Vic with an appearance in &quot;An Italian Straw Hat&quot; by Eugène Labiche and Marc Michel adapted by Thomas Walton. He then received an offer from Paramount to star in &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; (1954), shot in Ceylon and Los Angeles. The part was intended for Laurence Olivier who turned it down, but Vivien Leigh agreed to play the female lead; Dana Andrews was the other star. The circumstances of production were turbulent; Leigh had a nervous breakdown during production, leading to her being replaced by Elizabeth Taylor. The experience helped sour Finch on a Hollywood career and he would only work occasionally there for the rest of his career.

Back in England, Finch was cast as the villain Flambeau in &quot;Father Brown&quot; (1954), receiving superb reviews opposite Alec Guinness in the title role. He narrated a documentary &quot;The Queen in Australia&quot; and had his first real star part in the Group 3/British Lion comedy, &quot;Make Me an Offer&quot; (1954), playing an antiques dealer. He was then a villain in the medieval swashbuckler &quot;The Dark Avenger&quot; (1955), opposite another Australian, Errol Flynn, for Allied Artists.

He was much in demand. C.G. Scrimgeour of Associated TV wanted Finch to play a patrol officer in a film based on Colin Simpson&#x27;s articles about Shangri-La Valley in New Guinea. The Rank organisation wanted him to star in a film directed by Hugh Stewart called &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot;.

===Under contract to Rank and stardom===

In November 1954 Finch&#x27;s contract with Olivier (five years extended to six) had expired and he signed a seven-year contract with the Rank Organisation worth £87,500 to make one film a year for them. &quot;We are going to build Peter into a major British star&quot;, said Earl St. John, Rank&#x27;s head of production, at the time.

Finch&#x27;s first roles for Rank under the new arrangement gave him star parts but were, on the whole, undistinguished: &quot;Passage Home&quot; (1955), a drama with Anthony Steel and fellow Australian Diane Cilento; &quot;Josephine and Men&quot; (1955), a comedy from the Boulting Brothers with Glynis Johns and Donald Sinden; and &quot;Simon and Laura&quot; (1955), a comedy with Kay Kendall based on a hit play. None of these films performed particularly well at the box office.

Finch was then cast as an Australian soldier in &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; (1956), opposite Virginia McKenna under the direction of Jack Lee from the novel by Neville Shute. The World War II drama, mostly set in Malaya and almost entirely shot at Pinewood Studios, became the third-most-popular film at the British box office in 1956 and won Finch a BAFTA for Best Actor.

Finch followed it with another war movie, &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (1956), playing Captain Hans Langsdorff for the team of Powell and Pressburger. This was also hugely popular at home, and British exhibitors voted Finch the seventh-most-popular British star at the box office for 1956. In October 1956, John Davis, managing director of Rank, announced him as one of the actors under contract that Davis thought would become an international star.

Finch returned to Australia to make &quot;The Shiralee&quot; (1957), made for Ealing Studios and MGM from the novel by D&#x27;Arcy Niland, under the direction of Leslie Norman. It was one of Finch&#x27;s favourite parts; the resulting movie was critically acclaimed and the tenth-most-popular movie at the British box office that year.

Finch followed it with another Australian story filmed on location, the bushranger tale &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (1957), which did less well, despite having the same producer and director as &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot;. However, exhibitors still voted Finch the third-most-popular British star of 1957, and the fifth most popular overall, regardless of nationality.

Finch&#x27;s next two films for Rank were not particularly successful: &quot;Windom&#x27;s Way&quot; (1957), where he played a doctor caught up in the Malayan Emergency (the film was shot in Corsica and London); and &quot;Operation Amsterdam&quot; (1959), a war-time diamond thriller. Finch returned to the stage for the London production of &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; by William Gibson, under the direction of Arthur Penn.

==&quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; and international stardom==
Finch&#x27;s career received a boost when Fred Zinnemann cast him opposite Audrey Hepburn in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959). This was an enormous financial and critical success and established Finch&#x27;s reputation internationally. In August 1959 he said this and &quot;The Shiralee&quot; were the only two films he had done that he liked.

For Disney he played Alan Breck in a version of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1960) then went to Hollywood to make &quot;The Sins of Rachel Cade&quot; (shot in 1959, released in 1961), an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot;, with Angie Dickinson.

He was much in demand and still owed Rank three films under his contract. They wanted him to appear opposite Dirk Bogarde in &quot;The Singer Not the Song&quot;. Instead Finch decided to co-write and direct an award-winning short film, &quot;The Day&quot; (1960). He announced plans to direct a feature – &quot;Dig&quot;, about Australian exploration – but it did not eventuate.

Then, for a fee of £25,000 he played Oscar Wilde in &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960), winning another BAFTA; the film, however, was not popular. He played a Labour politician in Rank&#x27;s &quot;No Love for Johnnie&quot; (1961), and won his third BAFTA for Best Actor – although like &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, the film lost money.

Finch was originally chosen to play Julius Caesar in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) opposite Elizabeth Taylor, and filmed some scenes in London, under the direction of Robert Mamoulian. When the film was postponed Finch withdrew; new director Joseph Mankiewicz wanted to still use him, but the actor was unable to make his schedule work, and the role was recast with Rex Harrison.

Finch made two unsuccessful Hollywood films with director Robert Stevens at MGM: &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot; (1962) and &quot;In the Cool of the Day&quot; (1963). While filming the latter he was reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as saying that the star system was dead and the future lay in independent films. He also said he would direct a second film &quot;The Hero&quot;.

Finch restored his critical reputation with two highly acclaimed British films: &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964) and &quot;Girl with Green Eyes&quot; (1964). He had an uncredited cameo in &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; (1964), then had a good role in a tough adventure film for Robert Aldrich, &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965).

Finch&#x27;s next three films saw him support high-profile female stars: Sophia Loren in &quot;Judith&quot; (1966), Melina Mercouri in &quot;10:30 P.M. Summer&quot; (1966) and Julie Christie in &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967). He was reunited with Aldrich for &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot; (1968). &quot;The Red Tent&quot; (1970) was an expensive international adventure film, with Finch as Umberto Nobile.

==Later career==
Finch&#x27;s career received another boost when Ian Bannen dropped out of the lead in &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971). Finch replaced him and his performance was rewarded with another BAFTA for Best Actor and an Oscar nomination.

The momentum of this was lost somewhat by &quot;Something to Hide&quot; (1972) and the disastrous musical remake of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973). He played Lord Nelson in &quot;Bequest to the Nation&quot; (1973) and an opportunistic financier in &quot;England Made Me&quot; (1973). &quot;The Abdication&quot; (1974) was an unsuccessful historical drama.

===&quot;Network&quot;===
Finch was asked to audition for the part of news presenter Howard Beale in &quot;Network&quot; (1976), written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet. The movie, with Finch as its star, was his biggest commercial and critical hit in years. His line &quot;I&#x27;m as mad as hell, and I&#x27;m not going to take this any more!&quot; has become iconic.

He then played Yitzhak Rabin in &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; (1977).

==Poet==
Finch was also an occasional poet. He was encouraged by Kenneth Slessor, who published Finch&#x27;s poem &quot;Tell them&quot; in &quot;Australian Poetry 1945&quot;, of which he was the editor. Slessor also arranged for a volume of Finch&#x27;s early poems to be published. Finch&#x27;s biographer Trader Faulkner reported that Finch told him that &quot;no film award ... ever gave him the sense of fulfillment comparable to seeing a poem he&#x27;d written in print&quot;.

==Personal life==
Finch was married three times. In 1943, he married Romanian-born French ballerina Tamara Tchinarova; they worked together on a number of films. They had a daughter, Anita, born in 1950. They divorced in 1959, after she discovered his affair with actress Vivien Leigh in California.

Finch then married South African-born actress Yolande Turner (née Yolande Eileen Turnbull); they had two children together, Samantha and Charles Peter. During their marriage, Finch had an affair with the singer Shirley Bassey. Bassey had a daughter, also named Samantha, born in 1963; Bassey&#x27;s husband at the time, the openly gay film producer Kenneth Hume, believed that Finch was Samantha&#x27;s biological father. Finch and Turner divorced in 1965.

On 9 November 1973 in Rome, Finch married Mavis &quot;Eletha&quot; Barrett, who was known as Eletha Finch. They had a daughter together, Diana.

==Death==
Shortly after &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; finished shooting, Finch undertook a promotional tour for &quot;Network&quot;. On 13 January 1977 he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. George Carlin was also on the show that night; he joked about death. The day after, Finch had a heart attack in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel and died at the age of 60. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

===Oscar===
Finch was nominated for an Oscar for &quot;Network&quot; and went on to posthumously win the award, which was accepted by his widow, Eletha Finch. Although James Dean (twice) and Spencer Tracy had previously been posthumously nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, Finch was the first actor to win the award posthumously, as well as the first Australian actor to win a Best Actor award. He was the only posthumous winner of an Oscar in an acting category until fellow Australian Heath Ledger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2009; there were many earlier posthumous Oscar winners in non-acting categories. Finch also won five Best Actor awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), including one for &quot;Network&quot;.

Shortly before he died, Finch told a journalist:We all say we&#x27;re going to quit occasionally. I&#x27;d like to have been more adventurous in my career. But it&#x27;s a fascinating and not ignoble profession. No one lives more lives than the actor. Movie making is like geometry and I hated maths. But this kind of jigsaw I relish. When I played Lord Nelson I worked the poop deck in his uniform. I got extraordinary shivers. Sometimes I felt like I was staring at my own coffin. I touched that character. There lies the madness. You can&#x27;t fake it.

==Biographies==
In 1954, the Australian journalist and author George Johnston wrote a well-researched series of biographical articles on Finch, his life, and his work, which appeared in the Sydney &quot;Sun-Herald&quot; on four consecutive Sundays, which were certainly the first detailed account of Finch&#x27;s life to be published. Finch later provided the inspiration for the character Archie Calverton in Johnston&#x27;s novel, &quot;Clean Straw for Nothing&quot;.

In 1980, American author Elaine Dundy published a biography of Finch titled &quot;Finch, Bloody Finch: A Biography of Peter Finch&quot;. That year, his second wife, Yolande Finch, also published a posthumous account of their life together, &quot;Finchy: My Life with Peter Finch&quot;. Another biography had previously been published by his friend and colleague Trader Faulkner, in 1979.

According to an entry in Brian McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of British Film&quot;, republished on the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline website, Finch &quot;did not emerge unscathed from a life of well-publicised hell-raising, and several biographies chronicle the affairs and the booze, but a serious appraisal of a great actor remains to be written.&quot;

A profile of Finch at Screenonline asserts that &quot;it is arguable that no other actor ever chalked up such a rewarding CV in British films.&quot;

<text>A production sound mixer, location sound recordist, location sound engineer, or simply sound mixer is the member of a film crew or television crew responsible for recording all sound recording on set during the filmmaking or television production using professional audio equipment, for later inclusion in the finished product, or for reference to be used by the sound designer, sound effects editors, or Foley artists (aka Foley dancers). This requires choice and deployment of microphones, choice of recording media, and mixing of audio signals in real time.

Usually, the recordist will arrive on location with their own equipment, which normally includes microphones, radio systems, booms, mixing desk, audio storage, headphones, cables, tools, and a paper or computer sound logs. The recordist may be asked to capture a wide variety of wild sound on location, and must also consider the format of the finished product (mono, stereo or multi channels). Production sound mixers are tasked with recording audio in many different types of environments. Shoots outside require extra equipment such as microphone screens or wind blockers. Larger productions will often take advantage of a sound stage, or a large prepared environment that has been treated for acoustic control and is attended by an audio staff, directed by the mixer. The production sound mixer may travel to each potential shooting site to scout any potential audio disturbances. This is a critical preparatory step that allows the mixer to begin planning the equipment that will be needed for the shoot.

The recorded production soundtrack is later combined with other elements, i.e. effects, music, narration, Foley or re-recorded dialog by automated dialogue replacement (ADR).

Often, when taping on video, the sound recordist may record (single system) audio directly onto the camera rather than use a separate medium (double system), although a separate copy is often made, as it both provides an extra copy which may have more tracks and also may include other sound captured without the camera.

The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound including the hiring of a boom operator and utility sound technician, planning the technical setup involving sound including both sound equipment and ancillary devices involved in syncing and time offsets, anticipating and discussing sound-related problems with the rest of the crew, and ordering and preparing the sound equipment to be used on the set.

<doc id="170977" wikidata="Q42204" url="?curid=170977" title="Hugo Weaving">
<text>Hugo Wallace Weaving (born 4 April 1960) is a British-Australian actor. He is the recipient of six Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards (AACTA) and has been recognised as an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia. Born in Colonial Nigeria to British parents, he has resided in Australia for the entirety of his career.

Weaving landed his first major role as English cricket captain Douglas Jardine on the Australian television series &quot;Bodyline&quot; (1984). He rose to prominence with his appearances in the Australian films &quot;Proof&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994), winning his first AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the former. By the turn of the millennium, Weaving achieved international recognition through roles in mainstream American productions. His most notable film roles include Agent Smith in the first three &quot;The Matrix&quot; films (1999–2003), Elrond in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (2001–2003) and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (2012–2014) trilogies, the title character in &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2005), and Johann Schmidt / Red Skull in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011).

In addition to his live action appearances, Weaving has had several voice over roles, including in the films &quot;Babe&quot; (1995), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011), and the &quot;Transformers&quot; series as Megatron (2007–2011). He reprised his roles of Agent Smith and Elrond in &quot;Matrix&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; video game adaptations.

==Early life and education ==

Weaving was born on 4 April 1960 at the University of Ibadan Teaching Hospital, in Ibadan, Nigeria to British parents; he is the son of Anne Lennard (born 1934), a tour guide and former teacher, and Wallace Weaving (born 1929), a seismologist, who met as students at the University of Bristol. His maternal grandmother was Belgian. A year after his birth, his family returned to the United Kingdom, living in Bedford and Brighton before moving to Melbourne and Sydney in Australia; Johannesburg in South Africa; and then returning to the United Kingdom again.

While in the UK, he attended The Downs School, Wraxall, near Bristol, and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital. While at the Downs School, in 1973 Weaving played one of his first theatrical roles, taking the part of Captain Asquith in Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew&quot;. His family moved back to Australia in 1976, where he attended Knox Grammar School in Sydney. He graduated from Sydney&#x27;s National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1981.

==Career==

===1984–1998===

Weaving&#x27;s first television role was in the 1984 Australian television series &quot;Bodyline&quot;, as the English cricket captain Douglas Jardine. Weaving appeared in the Australian miniseries &quot;The Dirtwater Dynasty&quot; in 1988 and as Geoffrey Chambers in the drama &quot;Barlow and Chambers: A Long Way From Home&quot;. He starred opposite Nicole Kidman in the 1989 TV mini-series &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot;. In 1991, Weaving received the Australian Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Best Actor&quot; award for his performance in the low-budget &quot;Proof&quot; as the blind photographer. He appeared as Sir John in Yahoo Serious&#x27;s 1993 comedy &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot;, a lampoon of Australian outlaw Ned Kelly.

In the mid-1990s, Weaving portrayed the drag queen Anthony &quot;Tick&quot; Belrose/Mitzi Del Bra in the 1994 film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, and provided the voice of Rex the sheepdog in the 1995 family film &quot;Babe&quot; and its 1998 sequel &quot;&quot;. In 1998, he received the &quot;Best Actor&quot; award from the Montreal World Film Festival for his performance as a suspected serial killer in &quot;The Interview&quot;.

===1999–2010===

Weaving played the enigmatic and evil-minded Agent Smith in the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He later reprised that role in the film&#x27;s 2003 sequels, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. He was a voice actor in the cartoon film &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot;.

He received additional acclaim in the role of the half-elven lord Elrond in Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, released between 2001 and 2003. Weaving was the main actor in Andrew Kotatko&#x27;s award-winning film &quot;Everything Goes&quot; (2004). He starred as a heroin-addicted ex-rugby league player in the 2005 Australian indie film &quot;Little Fish&quot;, opposite Cate Blanchett. Weaving played the title role as V in the 2005 film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, in which he was reunited with the Wachowskis, creators of &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy, who wrote the adapted screenplay. Actor James Purefoy was originally signed to play the role, but was fired six weeks into filming over creative differences. Weaving reshot most of Purefoy&#x27;s scenes as V (even though his face is never seen) apart from a couple of minor dialogue-free scenes early in the film while stuntman David Leitch performed all of V&#x27;s stunts.

Weaving reprised his role as Elrond for the video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II&quot;. He regularly appears in productions by the Sydney Theatre Company (STC). In 2006, he worked with Cate Blanchett on a reprise of the STC production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; in New York City. In a controversial move by director Michael Bay, Weaving was chosen as the Decepticon leader Megatron vocally in the 2007 live-action film &quot;Transformers&quot;, rather than using the original version of the character&#x27;s voice created by the voice actor Frank Welker.

Weaving himself was unaware of the controversy, having accepted the role based on Michael Bay&#x27;s personal request; in a November 2008 &quot;Sun Herald&quot; interview, he said he had never seen &quot;Transformers&quot;. Though Weaving reprised his role in two sequels, he does not have much personal investment in the &quot;Transformers&quot; films. In February 2010, Weaving revealed to &quot;The Age&quot;: &quot;Director Michael Bay talks to me on the phone. I&#x27;ve never met him. We were doing the voice for the second one and I still hadn&#x27;t seen the first one. I still didn&#x27;t really know who the characters were and I didn&#x27;t know what anything was. It&#x27;s a voice job, for sure, and people assume I&#x27;ve spent my life working on it, but I really know so little about it.&quot; In 2012, Weaving said to &quot;Collider&quot;: &quot;It was one of the only things I&#x27;ve ever done where I had no knowledge of it, I didn&#x27;t care about it, I didn&#x27;t think about it. They wanted me to do it. In one way, I regret that bit. I don&#x27;t regret doing it, but I very rarely do something if it&#x27;s meaningless. It was meaningless to me, honestly. I don&#x27;t mean that in any nasty way.&quot;

Weaving played a supporting role in Joe Johnston&#x27;s 2010 remake of the 1941 film &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, starring Benicio del Toro. Immediately after &quot;Wolfman&quot; wrapped in spring 2008, he returned home to Australia to film a lead role in the film &quot;Last Ride&quot;, directed by Glendyn Ivin. In early 2009, Guillermo del Toro, then director of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films, prequels to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, confirmed his intent to again cast Weaving as Elrond of Rivendell in a BBC interview. When asked about reprising the role, Weaving replied that he was game, but had not officially been approached. Del Toro eventually left the project; Peter Jackson decided to direct the films himself but Weaving was not officially confirmed in the cast until May 2011.

Weaving spent the summer of 2009 starring in the Melbourne Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, portraying the caustic lawyer Alain Reille. He returned to the stage in November 2010 in Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, co-starring Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh. Weaving filmed a guest role on Roxburgh&#x27;s Australian TV series &quot;Rake&quot; in May 2010.

In May 2009, Weaving accepted a co-starring role in the docudrama &quot;Oranges and Sunshine&quot;, about the forced migration of thousands of British children to Australia in the 1950s. Filming began in autumn 2009 in Nottingham, England, and Adelaide, South Australia, and continued through January 2010. The film premiered at the Rome International Film Festival on 28 October 2010 and garnered positive reviews. 2010 saw the release of &quot;Legend of the Guardians&quot; (formerly &quot;The Guardians of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot;), in which Weaving has another high-profile voice role, portraying two different owls named Noctus and Grimble in Zack Snyder&#x27;s film adaptation of Kathryn Lasky&#x27;s popular series of children&#x27;s books.

On 4 May 2010, it was officially confirmed by Marvel Studios that Weaving would play the fictional Nazi Red Skull in the superhero film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;. Weaving completed filming his role on the project in September 2010 and returned to Sydney to prepare for &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. It is unlikely he will sign on for any further installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; in an August 2011 &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; interview, the actor confided he is weary of typecasting and of &quot;blockbuster&quot; films in general: &quot;I think I&#x27;ve about had enough... I&#x27;m not sure how many more of them I&#x27;ll make. It doesn&#x27;t feel to me as though they&#x27;ve been the majority of my work, though that&#x27;s probably the way it seems to most other people.&quot;

===2011–present===

On 13 March 2011, &quot;The Key Man&quot;, which Weaving filmed in 2006, finally debuted at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. The child migrant saga &quot;Oranges and Sunshine&quot; opened in the UK on 1 April, the culmination of months of success on the festival circuit in late 2010-early 2011. In March, the Sydney Theatre Company and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced that STC&#x27;s 2010 production of Chekhov&#x27;s Uncle Vanya would be reprised in Washington, D.C., during the month of August. In April, months of speculation finally ended when Weaving appeared on &quot;The Hobbit&quot;&#x27;s New Zealand set, shortly before a production spokesman officially confirmed the actor&#x27;s return as Elrond in Peter Jackson&#x27;s prequel trilogy to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He was part of the cast of the Wachowskis&#x27; adaptation of David Mitchell&#x27;s novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;. The project, co-starring Tom Hanks, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon, began filming in September 2011 and was released in October 2012.

2012 found Weaving re-focusing on his theatrical career, with a return to the Sydney Theatre Company to star in a new adaptation of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; in March. He portrayed the notorious Vicomte de Valmont, a character he first played onstage in 1987. His frequent stage foil Pamela Rabe costarred. Weaving and Cate Blanchett reprised their roles in STC&#x27;s internationally lauded production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; for a ten-day run at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in July.

The busy actor joined the cast of three forthcoming Australian films in summer 2012. The Western-tinged police thriller &quot;Mystery Road&quot;, written and directed by Ivan Sen, began filming in June 2012. Weaving appeared in the prison drama &quot;Healing&quot; for director Craig Monahan, with whom he previously made &quot;The Interview&quot; (1998) and &quot;Peaches&quot; (2005). He appeared in a segment of the Australian anthology film &quot;The Turning&quot;, based on Tim Winton&#x27;s collection of linked stories, entitled &quot;The Commission&quot;, directed by David Wenham. He ended 2013 co-starring with Richard Roxburgh and Philip Quast in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting For Godot&quot;, for the Sydney Theatre Company.

In the spring of 2013, Weaving reprised the Agent Smith role for a General Electric television commercial for their &quot;Brilliant Machines&quot; innovations in healthcare management technology, which was slated to air during a break from 13 April&#x27;s edition of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and subsequently continued to receive multiple airings on major cable networks.

From 26 July to 27 September 2014, Weaving played the titular role of Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In an unusual treatment of the Shakespearian tragedy by young Sydney director Kip Williams, Weaving&#x27;s performance was described by Peter Gotting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the role of his career&quot;.

In October 2015, Weaving joined the cast of the film adaption of Craig Silvey&#x27;s novel &quot;Jasper Jones&quot;.

In 2018, Weaving starred as Thaddeus Valentine in &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;. In the same year, he appeared alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in the miniseries &quot;Patrick Melrose&quot;.

In 2020, Weaving starred as Alfred in Tony Kushner&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Visit&quot;.

Since 2021, Weaving has starred as Glen Mathieson in the Australian intergenerational drama series &quot;Love Me&quot;.

In 2024, Weaving played character Frank Harkness in season 4 of Slow Horses.

==Other roles==
In 2004, Weaving became an ambassador for Australian animal rights organisation Voiceless, the animal protection institute. He attends events, promotes Voiceless in interviews, and assists in their judging of annual grants recipients.

, Weaving is on the board of the Adelaide Film Festival.

==Personal life==
When he was 13 years old, Weaving was diagnosed with epilepsy. Although the condition rarely affected him and stopped in his early 30s, he still chooses not to drive, given the risk of a seizure. 

He has been in a relationship with Katrina Greenwood since 1984; they live in Sydney and have two children together: Harry Greenwood, an actor, and Holly Greenwood, an artist. The children were given their mother&#x27;s surname, which Weaving&#x27;s son described as the family&#x27;s &quot;stand against the patriarchy.&quot;

Weaving has a brother and a sister. He is the uncle of actress Samara Weaving, who began her career in Australia before transitioning to American roles. Both appeared in the 2013 Australian film &quot;Mystery Road&quot;. His younger niece Morgan Weaving appeared on the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; alongside her sister.

<text>Tomlinson Miles Holman II (born 1946) is an American film theorist, audio engineer, and inventor of film technologies, notably the Lucasfilm&#x27;s THX sound system. He developed the world&#x27;s first 10.2 sound system.

==Career==
Early in his career, Holman developed what was known as the Holman Preamplifier for the APT Corporation, a former Massachusetts entity founded by Holman. He holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1968).

In 2002 he received the Academy Award for Technical Achievement. Specifically, for &quot;the research and system integration resulting in the improvement of motion picture loudspeaker systems&quot;.

In 2007 he received the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Award.

Holman taught film and television sound at the School of Cinematic Arts, University of Southern California from 1987 to 2011.

In 2011 - 2021, Softpedia reported that Apple Inc. had employed Holman, and speculated that this was to work on audio projects.

After a brief early film career in Czechoslovakia, including the controversial erotic romantic drama &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1933), she fled from her first husband, Friedrich Mandl, and secretly moved to Paris. Traveling to London, she met Louis B. Mayer, who offered her a film contract in Hollywood. Lamarr became a film star with her performance in the romantic drama &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938). She achieved further success with the Western &quot;Boom Town&quot; (1940) and the drama &quot;White Cargo&quot; (1942). Lamarr&#x27;s most successful film was the religious epic &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949). She also acted on television before the release of her final film in 1958. She was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

At the beginning of World War II, along with George Antheil, Lamarr co-invented a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of radio jamming by the Axis powers. However, the technology was not used in operational systems until after World War II, and then independently of their patent.

==Early life==
Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, the only child of Gertrud &quot;Trude&quot; Kiesler (née Lichtwitz) and Emil Kiesler.

Her father was born to a Galician-Jewish family in Lemberg in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, part of the Austrian Empire (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was, in the 1920s, deputy director of Wiener Bankverein, and at the end of his life a director at the united Creditanstalt-Bankverein. Her mother, a pianist and a native of Budapest, had come from an upper-class Hungarian-Jewish family. She had converted to Catholicism and was described as a &quot;practicing Christian&quot; who raised her daughter as a Christian, although Hedy was not baptized at the time.

As a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theater and film. At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest in Vienna. She also began to learn about technological inventions with her father, who would take her out on walks, explaining how devices functioned.

==European film career==
===Early work===
Lamarr was taking acting classes in Vienna when one day, she forged a note from her mother and went to Sascha-Film and was able to have herself hired as a script girl. While there, she had a role as an extra in the romantic comedy &quot;Money on the Street&quot; (1930), and then a small speaking part in the comedy &quot;Storm in a Water Glass&quot; (1931). Producer Max Reinhardt then cast her in a play entitled &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot;, which was performed at the Theater in der Josefstadt. Reinhardt was so impressed with her that he brought her with him back to Berlin.

However, she never actually trained with Reinhardt or appeared in any of his Berlin productions. Instead, she met the Russian theatre producer Alexis Granowsky, who cast her in his film directorial debut, &quot;The Trunks of Mr. O.F.&quot; (1931), starring Walter Abel and Peter Lorre. Granowsky soon moved to Paris, but Lamarr stayed in Berlin and was given the lead role in &quot;No Money Needed&quot; (1932), a comedy directed by Carl Boese. Lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous.

====&quot;Ecstasy&quot;====
In early 1933, at age 18, Lamarr was given the lead in Gustav Machatý&#x27;s film &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (&quot;Ekstase&quot; in German, &quot;Extase&quot; in Czech). She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.

The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr&#x27;s face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief scenes of nudity. Lamarr claimed she was &quot;duped&quot; by the director and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses, although the director contested her claims.

Although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award at the Venice Film Festival. Throughout Europe, it was regarded as an artistic work. In America, it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity, especially among women&#x27;s groups. It was banned there and in Germany.
====Withdrawal====

Lamarr played a number of stage roles, including a starring one in &quot;Sissy&quot;, a play about Empress Elisabeth of Austria produced in Vienna. It won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting to know her.

Mandl was an Austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in Austria. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial wealth. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve due to Mandl&#x27;s ties to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and, later, German Führer Adolf Hitler, but they could not stop the headstrong Lamarr.

On August 10, 1933, Lamarr married Mandl at the Karlskirche. She was 18 years old and he was 33. In her autobiography, &quot;Ecstasy and Me&quot;, she described Mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and prevented her from pursuing her acting career. She claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home, .

Mandl had close social and business ties to the Italian government, selling munitions to the country, and had ties to the Nazi regime of Germany as well, even though his own father was Jewish, as was Hedy&#x27;s. Lamarr wrote that the dictators of both countries attended lavish parties at the Mandl home. Lamarr accompanied Mandl to business meetings, where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.

Lamarr&#x27;s marriage to Mandl eventually became unbearable and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country in 1937. In her autobiography, she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to Paris, but by other accounts she persuaded Mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party and then disappeared afterward. She wrote about her marriage:

==Hollywood career==
===Louis B. Mayer and MGM===

After arriving in London in 1937, she met Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who was scouting for talent in Europe. She initially turned down the offer he made her (of $125 a week), but then booked herself onto the same New York-bound liner as him, and managed to impress him enough to secure a $500 a week contract. Mayer persuaded her to change her name to Hedy Lamarr (to distance herself from her real identity, and &quot;the &quot;Ecstasy&quot; lady&quot; reputation associated with it), choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star, Barbara La Marr, on the suggestion of his wife, who admired La Marr. He brought her to Hollywood in 1938 and began promoting her as the &quot;world&#x27;s most beautiful woman&quot;.

Mayer loaned Lamarr to producer Walter Wanger, who was making &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938), an American version of the French film, &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot; (1937). Lamarr was cast in the lead opposite Charles Boyer. The film created a &quot;national sensation&quot;, says Shearer. She was billed as an unknown but well-publicized Austrian actress, which created anticipation in audiences. Mayer hoped she would become another Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich. According to one viewer, when her face first appeared on the screen, &quot;everyone gasped ... Lamarr&#x27;s beauty literally took one&#x27;s breath away.&quot;
In future Hollywood films, she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin. Her second American film was to be &quot;I Take This Woman&quot;, co-starring with Spencer Tracy under the direction of regular Dietrich collaborator Josef von Sternberg. Von Sternberg was fired during the shoot, replaced by Frank Borzage. The film was put on hold, and Lamarr was put into &quot;Lady of the Tropics&quot; (1939), where she played a mixed-race seductress in Saigon opposite Robert Taylor. She returned to &quot;I Take This Woman&quot;, re-shot by W. S. Van Dyke. The resulting film was a flop.
Far more popular was &quot;Boom Town&quot; (1940) with Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Spencer Tracy; it made $5 million. MGM promptly reteamed Lamarr and Gable in &quot;Comrade X&quot; (1940), a comedy film in the vein of &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939), which was another hit.

Lamarr was teamed with James Stewart in &quot;Come Live with Me&quot; (1941), playing a Viennese refugee. Stewart was also in &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; (1941), where Lamarr, Judy Garland and Lana Turner played aspiring showgirls – a big success.

Lamarr was top-billed in &quot;H. M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941), although the film&#x27;s protagonist was the title role played by Robert Young. She made a third film with Tracy, &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1942). It was successful at the box office, as was &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1942) with William Powell.

Lamarr played the exotic Arab seductress Tondelayo in &quot;White Cargo&quot; (1942), top billed over Walter Pidgeon. It was a huge hit. &quot;White Cargo&quot; contains arguably her most memorable film quote, delivered with provocative invitation: &quot;I am Tondelayo. I make tiffin for you?&quot; This line typifies many of Lamarr&#x27;s roles, which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines. The lack of acting challenges bored Lamarr. She reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.
She was reunited with Powell in a comedy &quot;The Heavenly Body&quot; (1944), then was borrowed by Warner Bros for &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (1944). This was an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1943), and RKO borrowed her for a melodrama &quot;Experiment Perilous&quot; (1944).

Back at MGM Lamarr was teamed with Robert Walker in the romantic comedy &quot;Her Highness and the Bellboy&quot; (1945), playing a princess who falls in love with a New Yorker. It was very popular, but would be the last film she made under her MGM contract.

Her off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image. She spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent&#x27;s pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression:

Author Richard Rhodes describes her assimilation into American culture:

Lamarr also had a penchant for speaking about herself in the third person.

====Wartime fundraiser====
Lamarr wanted to join the National Inventors Council, but was reportedly told by NIC member Charles F. Kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds.

She participated in a war bond-selling campaign with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would kiss Rhodes and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.

====Producer====

After leaving MGM in 1945, Lamarr formed a production company with Jack Chertok and made the thriller &quot;The Strange Woman&quot; (1946). It went over budget and only made minor profits.

She and Chertok then made &quot;Dishonored Lady&quot; (1947), another thriller starring Lamarr, which also went over budget – but was not a commercial success. She tried a comedy with Robert Cummings, &quot;Let&#x27;s Live a Little&quot; (1948).

====Later films====
Lamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing Delilah against Victor Mature as the Biblical strongman in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, the highest-grossing film of 1950. The film won two Oscars.

Lamarr returned to MGM for a film noir with John Hodiak, &quot;A Lady Without Passport&quot; (1950), which flopped. More popular were two pictures she made at Paramount, a Western with Ray Milland, &quot;Copper Canyon&quot; (1950), and a Bob Hope spy spoof, &quot;My Favorite Spy&quot; (1951).
Her career went into decline. She went to Italy to play multiple roles in &quot;Loves of Three Queens&quot; (1954), which she also produced. However she lacked the experience necessary to make a success of such an epic production, and lost millions of dollars when she was unable to secure distribution of the picture.

She played Joan of Arc in Irwin Allen&#x27;s critically panned epic, &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; (1957) and did episodes of &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot; (&quot;Proud Woman&quot;) and &quot;Shower of Stars&quot; (&quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;). Her last film was a thriller &quot;The Female Animal&quot; (1958).

Lamarr was signed to act in the 1966 film &quot;Picture Mommy Dead&quot;, but was let go when she collapsed during filming from nervous exhaustion. She was replaced in the role of Jessica Flagmore Shelley by Zsa Zsa Gabor.
==Inventing career==

Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she invested her spare time, including on set between takes, in designing and drafting inventions, which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a flavored carbonated drink.
During the late 1930s, Lamarr attended arms deals with her then-husband, arms dealer Fritz Mandl, &quot;possibly to improve his chances of making a sale&quot;. From the meetings, she learned that navies needed &quot;a way to guide a torpedo as it raced through the water.&quot; Radio control had been proposed. However, an enemy might be able to jam such a torpedo&#x27;s guidance system and set it off course.

When later discussing this with a new friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, her idea to prevent jamming by frequency hopping met Antheil&#x27;s previous work in music. In that earlier work, Antheil attempted synchronizing note-hopping in the avant-garde piece written as a score for the film &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; (1923–24) that involved multiple synchronized player pianos. Antheil&#x27;s idea in the piece was to synchronize the start time of identical player pianos with identical player piano rolls, so the pianos would play in time with one another. Together, they realized that radio frequencies could be changed similarly, using the same kind of mechanism, but miniaturized.

Based on the strength of the initial submission of their ideas to the National Inventors Council (NIC) in late December 1940, in early 1941 the NIC introduced Antheil to Samuel Stuart Mackeown, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Caltech, to consult on the electrical systems. Lamarr hired the legal firm of Lyon &amp; Lyon to draft the application for the patent which was granted as on August 11, 1942, under her legal name Hedy Kiesler Markey. The invention was proposed to the Navy, who rejected it on the basis that it would be too large to fit in a torpedo, and Lamarr and Antheil, shunned by the Navy, pursued their invention no further. It was suggested that Lamarr invest her time and attention to selling war bonds since she was a celebrity.

==Later years==
Lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States at age 38 on April 10, 1953. Her autobiography, &quot;Ecstasy and Me&quot;, was published in 1966. She said on TV that it was not written by her, and much of it was fictional. Lamarr later sued the publisher, saying that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer, Leo Guild. Lamarr, in turn, was sued by Gene Ringgold, who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in 1965 for &quot;Screen Facts&quot; magazine.

In the late 1950s, along with former husband W. Howard Lee, Lamarr designed and developed the Villa LaMarr ski resort in Aspen, Colorado.

In 1966, Lamarr was arrested in Los Angeles for shoplifting. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in Orlando, Florida, this time for stealing $21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She pleaded no contest to avoid a court appearance, and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year.

===Seclusion===
The 1970s was a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr. She was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed a $10 million lawsuit against Warner Bros., claiming that the running parody of her name (&quot;Hedley Lamarr&quot;) in the Mel Brooks comedy &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; infringed her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered. The studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to Lamarr for &quot;almost using her name&quot;. Brooks said that Lamarr &quot;never got the joke&quot;. In 1981, with her eyesight failing, Lamarr retreated from public life and settled in Miami Beach, Florida.

A large Corel-drawn image of Lamarr won CorelDRAW&#x27;s yearly software suite cover design contest in 1996. For several years, beginning in 1997, it was featured on boxes of the software suite. Lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission. Corel countered that she did not own rights to the image. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Lamarr has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6247 Hollywood Boulevard adjacent to Vine Street where the walk is centered.

Lamarr became estranged from her older son, James Lamarr Loder, when he was 12 years old. Their relationship ended abruptly, and he moved in with another family. They did not speak again for almost 50 years. Lamarr left James Loder out of her will, and he sued for control of the US$3.3 million estate left by Lamarr in 2000. He eventually settled for US$50,000.

In the last decades of her life, the telephone became Lamarr&#x27;s only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone, but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years.

===Death===

Lamarr died in Casselberry, Florida, on January 19, 2000, of heart disease, aged 85. Her son Anthony Loder spread part of her ashes in Austria&#x27;s Vienna Woods in accordance with her last wishes.

In 2014, a memorial to Lamarr was unveiled in Vienna&#x27;s Central Cemetery. The remainder of her ashes were buried there.

== Awards, honors, and tributes ==
On January 7, 1939, Hedy Lamarr was selected the &quot;most promising new actress&quot; of 1938 in a poll of Philadelphia film fans conducted by Elsie Finn, the &quot;Philadelphia Record&quot; film critic.

On January 26, 1939, Lamar was chosen the &quot;ideal type&quot; of woman in a poll of both male and female students conducted by the Pomona College newspaper.

On May 9, 1939, Lamarr was named the &quot;most beautiful actress&quot; in &quot;a secret poll of 30 Hollywood correspondents&quot; conducted by the American magazine &quot;Look&quot;.

On August 30, 1940, Lamarr won &quot;top honors for facial features&quot; in a poll of 400 members of the California Models Association.

In December 1943, makeup expert Max Factor, Jr. included Lamarr among the ten glamorous Hollywood actresses with the most appealing voices.

In 1951, British moviegoers voted Lamarr the year&#x27;s 10th best actress, for her performance in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;.

In 1960, Lamarr was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

In 1997, Lamarr and George Antheil were jointly honored with the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s Pioneer Award and Lamarr also was the first woman to receive the Invention Convention&#x27;s BULBIE Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award, known as the &quot;Oscars of inventing&quot;. given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society. The following year, Lamarr&#x27;s native Austria awarded her the Viktor Kaplan Medal of the Austrian Association of Patent Holders and Inventors.

In 2006, the &quot;Hedy-Lamarr-Weg&quot; was founded in Vienna Meidling (12th District), named after the actress.

In 2013, the IQOQI installed a quantum telescope on the roof of the University of Vienna, which they named after her in 2014.

In 2014, Lamarr was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology. The same year, Anthony Loder&#x27;s request that the remaining ashes of his mother should be buried in an honorary grave of the city of Vienna was realized. On November 7, her urn was buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery in Group 33 G, Tomb No. 80, not far from the centrally located presidential tomb.

On November 9, 2015, Google honored her on the 101st anniversary of her birth, and on her 109th on November 9, 2023 with a doodle.

On August 27, 2019, an asteroid was named after her: 32730 Lamarr.
On August 6, 2023 &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; showrunners Dan and Kevin Hageman debuted the first five minutes of footage from season two, showing the new Lamarr-class USS Voyager-A, in tribute to her.

==Marriages and children==
Lamarr was married and divorced six times and had three children:
# Friedrich Mandl (married 1933–1937), chairman of the &quot;Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik&quot;
# Gene Markey (married 1939–1941), screenwriter and producer. She adopted a boy (however this was later contested by the child, see below) during her marriage with Markey. Lamarr became estranged from the boy when he was 12 years old, their relationship ended abruptly, they did not speak again for almost 50 years, and Lamarr left him out of her will. Lamarr and Markey lived at 2727 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills, California during their marriage, at a place called Hedgerow Farm. The home still exists. 
# John Loder (married 1943–1947), actor. The two had a daughter, Denise, who married Larry Colton, a writer and former baseball player, and a son, Anthony, who worked for illustrator James McMullan. Anthony Loder was featured in the 2004 documentary film &quot;Calling Hedy Lamarr&quot;.
# Ernest &quot;Teddy&quot; Stauffer (married 1951–1952), nightclub owner, restaurateur, and former bandleader
# W. Howard Lee (married 1953–1960), a Texas oilman (who later married film actress Gene Tierney)
# Lewis J. Boies (married 1963–1965), Lamarr&#x27;s divorce lawyer

Following her sixth and final divorce in 1965, Lamarr remained unmarried for the last 35 years of her life.

Throughout her life, Lamarr claimed that her first son, James Lamarr Loder, was not biologically related to her and was adopted during her marriage to Gene Markey. However, years later, her son found documentation that he was the out-of-wedlock son of Lamarr and actor John Loder, whom she later married as her third husband. However, a later DNA test proved him not to be biologically related to either.

==Filmography==


==Radio appearances==
==In popular culture==
In the 1952 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; by Herman Wouk, Hedy Lamarr is mentioned by name in Chapter 37 when defense attorney Lieutenant Barney Greenwald confronts Lieutenant Tom Keefer at a party after Lieutenant Stephen Maryk&#x27;s court-martial acquittal in the &quot;Caine&quot; mutiny.

The Mel Brooks 1974 western parody &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; features a villain, played by Harvey Korman, named &quot;Hedley Lamarr&quot;. As a running gag, various characters mistakenly refer to him as &quot;Hedy Lamarr&quot; prompting him to testily reply &quot;That&#x27;s Hedley.&quot;

In the 1982 off-Broadway musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and subsequent film adaptation (1986), Audrey II says to Seymour in the song &quot;Feed Me&quot;, that he can get Seymour anything he wants including &quot;A date with Hedy Lamarr.&quot;

In the 2004 video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Dr. Kleiner&#x27;s pet headcrab, Lamarr, is named after Hedy Lamarr.

Her son, Anthony Loder, was featured in the 2004 documentary film &quot;Calling Hedy Lamarr&quot;, in which he played excerpts from tapes of her many telephone calls.

In 2008, an off-Broadway play, &quot;Frequency Hopping&quot;, features the lives of Lamarr and Antheil. The play was written and staged by Elyse Singer, and the script won a prize for best new play about science and technology from STAGE.

In the 2009 mockumentary &quot;The Chronoscope&quot;, written and directed by Andrew Legge, the fictional Irish scientist Charlotte Keppel is likely modeled after Hedy Lamarr. The film satirizes the extreme politics of the 1930s and tells the story of a fictionalized fascist group that steals a device invented by Keppel. This chronoscope can see the past and is used by the group to create propaganda films of their heroes from the past.

In 2010, Lamarr was selected out of 150 IT people to be featured in a short film launched by the British Computer Society on May 20.

Also during 2010, the New York Public Library exhibit &quot;Thirty Years of Photography at the New York Public Library&quot; included a photo of a topless Lamarr () by Austrian-born American photographer Trude Fleischmann.

In 2011, the story of Lamarr&#x27;s frequency-hopping spread spectrum invention was explored in an episode of the Science Channel show &quot;Dark Matters: Twisted But True&quot;, a series that explores the darker side of scientific discovery and experimentation, which premiered on September 7. Her work in improving wireless security was part of the premiere episode of the Discovery Channel show &quot;How We Invented the World&quot;.

Also during 2011, Anne Hathaway revealed that she had learned that the original Catwoman was based on Lamarr, so she studied all of Lamarr&#x27;s films and incorporated some of her breathing techniques into her portrayal of Catwoman in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.

In 2015, on November 9, the 101st anniversary of Lamarr&#x27;s birth, Google paid tribute to Hedy Lamarr&#x27;s work in film and her contributions to scientific advancement with an animated Google Doodle.

In 2016, Lamarr was depicted in an off-Broadway play, &quot;HEDY! The Life and Inventions of Hedy Lamarr&quot;, a one-woman show written and performed by Heather Massie.

Also in 2016, the off-Broadway, one-actor show &quot;Stand Still and Look Stupid: The Life Story of Hedy Lamarr&quot;, starring Emily Ebertz and written by Mike Broemmel, went into production.

Also during 2016, Whitney Frost, a character in the TV show &quot;Agent Carter&quot; was inspired by Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall.

In 2017, actress Celia Massingham portrayed Lamarr on The CW television series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; in the sixth episode of the third season, titled &quot;Helen Hunt&quot;. The episode is set in 1937 Hollywoodland. The episode aired on November 14, 2017.

Also during 2017, a documentary about Lamarr&#x27;s career as an actress and later as an inventor, &quot;,&quot; premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival. The documentary was written and directed by Alexandra Dean and produced by Susan Sarandon; it was released in theaters on November 24, 2017, and aired on PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; in May 2018.

<text>Edward James Olmos (born February 24, 1947) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as Lieutenant Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Castillo in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984–1989), &quot;American Me&quot; (1992) (which he also directed), William Adama in the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004–2009), Detective Gaff in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and its sequel &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017) and the voice of Mito in the 2005 English dub of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. For his performance as high school math teacher Jaime Escalante in &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; (1988), he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. 

For his work in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Olmos won the 1985 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. For his performance in &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, Olmos was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

He is also known for his roles as folk hero Gregorio Cortez in &quot;The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez&quot;, patriarch Abraham Quintanilla in the film &quot;Selena&quot;, Felipe Reyes in &quot;Mayans M.C.&quot;, the voice of Chief Tannabok in &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;, narrator El Pachuco in both the stage and film versions of &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;, and the voice of Chicharrón in &quot;Coco&quot;. 

Over the course of his career, Olmos has been a pioneer for more diversified roles and images of Latinos in American media. His notable direction, production, and starring roles for films, made-for-TV movies, and TV shows include &quot;Wolfen&quot;, &quot;Triumph of the Spirit&quot;, &quot;Talent for the Game&quot;, &quot;American Me&quot;, &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, &quot;My Family/Mi Familia&quot;, &quot;Caught&quot;, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, &quot;The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca&quot;, &quot;Walkout&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;, &quot;American Family&quot;, and &quot;Dexter&quot;.

==Early life==
Olmos was born and raised in East Los Angeles, California, the son of Eleanor (née Huizar) and Pedro Olmos, who was a welder and mail carrier. His father was a Mexican immigrant who moved to California in 1945 and his mother was an American of Mexican descent. His parents divorced when he was seven years old, and he was primarily raised by his great-grandparents as his parents worked. He grew up wanting to be a professional baseball player, and at age 13 joined the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; farm system, as a catcher. He left baseball at age 15 to join a rock and roll band, which caused a rift with his father, who was hurt by the decision.

He graduated from Montebello High School in 1964. While there he lost a race for Student Body President to future California Democratic Party Chair Art Torres. In his teen years, he was the lead singer for a psychedelic/hard rock band he named Pacific Ocean, so called because it was to be &quot;the biggest thing on the West Coast&quot;. At the same time, he attended classes at East Los Angeles College, including courses in acting. 

For several years, Pacific Ocean (later renamed Eddie James and The Pacific Ocean) performed at various clubs in and around Los Angeles, and released the album &quot;Purgatory&quot; via VMC Records in late 1968. The album was promoted with two singles, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot;/&quot;I Wanna Testify,&quot; and &quot;My Shrink&quot;/&quot;16 Tons,&quot; and was followed by a nation-wide tour in early 1969. While setting up for a Pacific Ocean show one night, Olmos slipped on stage and landed on a nail that went through his knee. Another time during a concert, Olmos jumped from the top of an organ across the stage into the drum set, getting knocked unconscious and dislocating the drummer&#x27;s shoulder. 

==Career==
=== Theater ===
In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Olmos branched out from music into acting, appearing in many small productions, until his big break portraying the narrator, called &quot;El Pachuco&quot;, in the play &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;, which dramatized the World War II-era rioting in California brought about by the tensions between Mexican-Americans and local police, called the Zoot Suit riots. The play moved to Broadway, and Olmos earned a Tony Award nomination. He subsequently took the role to the filmed version in 1981, and appeared in many other films including &quot;Wolfen&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez&quot;. Olmos has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World, narrating the nativity story. 

=== Film and television ===
In 1980, Olmos was cast in the post-apocalyptic science fiction film &quot;Virus&quot; (復活の日 &quot;Fukkatsu no Hi&quot;), directed by Kinji Fukasaku and based on a novel written by Sakyo Komatsu. His role required him to play a piano while singing a Spanish ballad during the later part of the film. Although not a box office success, &quot;Virus&quot; was notable for being the most expensive Japanese film made at the time.

From 1984 to 1989, he starred in his biggest role up to that date as the taciturn police Lieutenant Martin Castillo in the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, opposite Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, for which he was awarded a Golden Globe and an Emmy in 1985. At this time, Olmos also starred in a short training video for the United States Postal Service entitled &quot;Was it Worth It?&quot;, a video about theft in the workplace. He was contacted about playing the captain of the on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; when it was in pre-production in 1986, but declined.

Returning to film, Olmos became the first American-born Hispanic to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, for his portrayal of real-life math teacher Jaime Escalante. He directed and starred in the controversial crime film &quot;American Me&quot; in 1992, and also starred in &quot;My Family/Mi Familia&quot;, a multi-generational story of a Chicano family. He had a slight appearance in the video of the American rock band Toto, &quot;I Will Remember&quot; (1995), where he can be seen with actor Miguel Ferrer. In 1997, he starred alongside Jennifer Lopez in the film &quot;Selena&quot;. Olmos played Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo in the 2001 film &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot;. He had a recurring role as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Roberto Mendoza in the NBC drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. From 2002 to 2004, he starred as a recently widowed father of a Hispanic family in the PBS drama &quot;American Family: Journey of Dreams&quot;.

From 2003 to 2009, he starred as Commander William Adama in the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; miniseries, and in the television series that followed. He directed four episodes of the show, &quot;Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down&quot; (1.9), &quot;Taking a Break from All Your Worries&quot; (3.13), &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; (4.4), and &quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot; (4.18). He directed a television film based upon the show, &quot;The Plan&quot;. Regarding his work on the show, he told CraveOnline, &quot;I&#x27;m very grateful for the work that I&#x27;ve been able to do in my life, but I can honestly tell you, this is the best usage of television I&#x27;ve ever been a part of to date.&quot;

In 2006, he co-produced, directed, and played the bit part of Julian Nava in the HBO film about the 1968 Chicano Blowouts, &quot;Walkout&quot;. He appeared in Snoop Dogg&#x27;s music video &quot;Vato&quot;. In the series finale of the ABC sitcom &quot;George Lopez&quot;, titled &quot;George Decides to Sta-Local Where It&#x27;s Familia&quot;; he guest-starred as the plant&#x27;s new multi-millionaire owner. He has been a spokesperson for Farmers Insurance Group, starring in their Spanish language commercials.

Olmos joined the cast of the television series &quot;Dexter&quot; for its sixth season, as a &quot;brilliant, charismatic professor of religious studies&quot;.

Olmos starred in the second season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; as Robert Gonzales, the leader of a rival faction of S.H.I.E.L.D., for five episodes.

In 1967, Olmos – as Eddie James (vocals, keyboards) – formed the bluesy psyche rock band that would become &quot;Pacific Ocean&quot;, who the following year released their self-titled, only LP.

In 1972, he contributed backing vocals to the final song on Todd Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; album.

During the 1992 Los Angeles riot in Los Angeles, Olmos went out with a broom and worked to get communities cleaned up and rebuilt. He also attended an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; relating to the L.A. riots as an audience member. In 1997, he co-founded the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival with Marlene Dermer, George Hernandez and Kirk Whisler. That same year, he co-founded with Kirk Whisler the non-profit organization, Latino Literacy Now, that has produced Latino Book &amp; Festivals around the US, attended by over 700,000 people.

In 1998, he founded Latino Public Broadcasting and serves as its chairman.

That same year, he starred in &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;. In 1999, Olmos was one of the driving forces that created &quot;Americanos: Latino Life in the U.S.,&quot; a book project featuring over 30 award-winning photographers, later turned into a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, music CD and HBO special.

He also makes frequent appearances at juvenile halls and detention centers to speak to at-risk teenagers. He has also been an international ambassador for UNICEF. In 2001, he was arrested and spent 20 days in jail for taking part in the Navy-Vieques protests against United States Navy target practice bombings of the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. On January 5, 2007, he blamed the United States government for not cleaning Vieques after the U.S. Navy stopped using the island for bombing practice.

Olmos narrated the 1999 documentary film &quot;Zapatista&quot;, in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a revolutionary group that has abstained from using weapons since 1994. He gave $2,300 to New Mexico governor Bill Richardson for his presidential campaign (the maximum amount for the primaries). In 2020, he supported Joe Biden for President.

Olmos has also vocally supported various animal rights causes over the years. In 2015 Olmos contributed his voice to the Unity (film), which calls for a transformation in humanity&#x27;s treatment of animals and the natural world. Since 2015, Olmos has been a vegan. He has worked with PETA on a number of campaigns (such as in radio and TV ads calling for humans to keep their pets indoors during fireworks, and voicing the Coyote in their &quot;Council of Animals&quot; sculpture) and in September 2023 was awarded a Humanitarian Award by the organization.

He is a supporter of SENS Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to treating and curing diseases of aging by repairing the underlying damage caused by aging. He narrated a series of animations explaining the concept of SENS.

In 1996, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from California State University, Fresno. In 2007, after a seven-year process, he obtained Mexican nationality. Asteroid 5608 Olmos is named in his honor.

In 2022, Olmos was diagnosed with throat cancer and immediately went into chemotherapy for treatment. By the end of the year, the cancer went into remission. This was not made public until May 2023.

=== Sexual assault accusations ===
In 1992, a teenage girl accused Olmos of twice touching her in a sexual manner while they watched TV and flirted together. Olmos paid the family a cash settlement of $150,000 in response to the allegations, but denied that they were true. He claimed that the settlement was in fact meant to protect his son, Bodie Olmos, not him.

<text>Chrétien de Troyes (; ; 1160–1191) was a French poet and trouvère known for his writing on Arthurian subjects such as Gawain, Lancelot, Perceval and the Holy Grail. Chrétien&#x27;s chivalric romances, including &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, &quot;Lancelot&quot;, &quot;Perceval&quot; and &quot;Yvain&quot;, represent some of the best-regarded works of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in &quot;Yvain&quot;, has been seen as a step towards the modern novel.

==Life==
Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes or at least intimately connected with it. Between 1160 and 1172 he served (perhaps as herald-at-arms, as Gaston Paris speculated) at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of King Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who married Count Henry I of Champagne in 1164. Later, he served the court of Philippe d&#x27;Alsace, Count of Flanders. As proposed by Urban T. Holmes III, Chrétien&#x27;s name, meaning literally &quot;Christian from Troyes&quot;, might be a pen name moniker of a Jewish convert from Judaism to Christianity, also known as &quot;Crestien li Gois&quot;.

==Works==
Chrétien&#x27;s works include five major poems in rhyming eight-syllable couplets. Four of these are complete: &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; (); &quot;Cligès&quot; (); &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;; and &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, the latter two written simultaneously between 1177 and 1181. &quot;Yvain&quot; is generally considered Chrétien&#x27;s most masterful work. The last romance commonly attributed to Chrétien, &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, was written between 1181 and 1190, but left unfinished. It is dedicated to Philip, Count of Flanders, to whom Chrétien may have been attached in his last years. He finished only 9,000 lines of the work, but four successors of varying talents added 54,000 additional lines in what are known as the Four Continuations. Similarly, the last thousand lines of &quot;Lancelot&quot; were written by Godefroi de Leigni, apparently by arrangement with Chrétien. In the case of &quot;Perceval&quot;, one continuer says the poet&#x27;s death prevented him from completing the work; in the case of &quot;Lancelot&quot;, no reason is given. This has not stopped speculation that Chrétien did not approve of &quot;Lancelot&quot;″s adulterous subject (in which case he seems unlikely to have invented Lancelot).

There are also several lesser works, not all of which can be securely ascribed to Chrétien. &quot;Philomela&quot; is the only one of his four poems based on Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; that has survived. Two short-lyric chansons on the subject of love are also very likely his, but the attribution of the pious romance &quot;Guillaume d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; to him is now widely doubted. It has also been suggested that Chrétien might be the author of two short verse romances titled &quot;Le Chevalier à l&#x27;épée&quot; and &quot;La Mule sans frein&quot;, but this theory has not found much support. Chrétien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to &quot;Cligès&quot;, where he also mentions his work about King Mark and Iseult. The latter is presumably related to the legend of Tristan and Iseult, though Tristan is not named. Chrétien&#x27;s take on Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Cligès, Chrétien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive. Chrétien&#x27;s works are written in vernacular Old French, although it is marked by traits of the regional Champenois dialect (which is still fairly similar to the &quot;standard&quot; French of Paris).

==Sources and influence==
The immediate and specific sources for his romances are uncertain, as Chrétien speaks in the vaguest way of the materials he used. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who play an important role in Chrétien&#x27;s narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. For his &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, the influence of the story is clearly tied to the story of Saint Galgano (Galgano Guidotti) who died in 1180–1181 and was canonized in 1185: a knight struck by god&#x27;s vision, planted his sword in the ground that immediately solidified (kept in Abbey San Galgano). However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chrétien&#x27;s five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien&#x27;s day.

William Wistar Comfort praised de Troyes&#x27; &quot;significance as a literary artist and as the founder of a precious literary tradition [which] distinguishes him from all other poets of the Latin races between the close of the Empire and the arrival of Dante.&quot; Chrétien&#x27;s writing was very popular, as evidenced by the high number of surviving copies of his romances and their many adaptations into other languages. Three of Middle High German literature&#x27;s finest examples, Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; and Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Erec&quot; and &quot;Iwein&quot;, were based on &quot;Perceval&quot;, &quot;Erec&quot;, and &quot;Yvain&quot;; the Three Welsh Romances associated with the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; (&quot;Peredur, son of Efrawg&quot;, &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, and &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;) are derived from the same trio. Especially in the case of &quot;Peredur&quot;, however, the connection between the Welsh romances and their source is probably not direct and has never been satisfactorily delineated. Chrétien also has the distinction of being the first writer to mention the Holy Grail (&quot;Perceval&quot;), Camelot (&quot;Lancelot&quot;), and the love affair between Queen Guinevere and Lancelot (&quot;Lancelot&quot;), subjects of household recognition even today.

There is a specific Classical influence in Chrétien&#x27;s romances, the likes of which (the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;) were &quot;translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s&quot;. Foster Guyer argues that specifically &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot; contains definite Ovidian influence: &quot;Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year. Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid&#x27;s Epistles he said: &#x27;If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly back to you at will/Many and many a time I would come&#x27;.&quot;

Chrétien has been termed &quot;the inventor of the modern novel&quot;. Karl Uitti argues: &quot;With [Chrétien&#x27;s work] a new era opens in the history of European story telling… this poem reinvents the genre we call narrative romance; in some important respects it also initiates the vernacular novel.&quot; A &quot;story&quot; could be anything from a single battle scene, to a prologue, to a minimally cohesive tale with little to no chronological layout. Uitti argues that &quot;Yvain&quot; is Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;most carefully contrived romance… It has a beginning, a middle, and an end: we are in no doubt that Yvain&#x27;s story is over.&quot; This very method of having three definite parts, including the build in the middle leading to the climax of the story, is in large part why Chrétien is seen to be a writer of novels five centuries before novels, as we know them, existed.

<text>Pandora is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe and was provisionally designated &#x27;. In late 1985, it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as &#x27;.

Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus and has at least two large craters in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on the moon&#x27;s surface.

The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about . Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.

From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. However, there is much uncertainty in these values, so this remains to be confirmed.

<doc id="170992" wikidata="Q242345" url="?curid=170992" title="S&amp;P 500">
<text>The Standard and Poor&#x27;s 500, or simply the S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices and includes approximately 80% of the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies, with an aggregate market cap of more than $43 trillion as of January 2024.

The S&amp;P 500 index is a free-float weighted/capitalization-weighted index. As of September 30, 2024, the nine largest companies on the list of S&amp;P 500 companies accounted for 34.6% of the market capitalization of the index and were, in order of highest to lowest weighting: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (including both class A &amp; C shares), Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and Tesla. The components that have increased their dividends in 25 consecutive years are known as the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

The index is one of the factors in computation of the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, used to forecast the direction of the economy. The index is associated with many ticker symbols, including ^GSPC, INX, and $SPX, depending on market or website. The S&amp;P 500 is maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture majority-owned by S&amp;P Global, and its components are selected by a committee.

==Investing in the S&amp;P 500==
===Mutual and exchange-traded funds===
Index funds, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions. ETFs that replicate the performance of the index are issued by The Vanguard Group (), iShares (), and State Street Corporation (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, and ). The most liquid based on average daily volume is (), although SPY has a higher annual expense ratio of 0.09% compared to 0.03% for VOO and IVV, and 0.02% for SPLG. Mutual funds that track the index are offered by Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, and Charles Schwab Corporation.

Direxion offers leveraged ETFs which attempt to produce three times the daily return of either investing in () or shorting () the S&amp;P 500 index. ProShares offers 2x daily return () and 3x daily return ().

===Derivatives===
In the derivatives market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) offers futures contracts that track the index and trade on the exchange floor in an open outcry auction, or on CME&#x27;s Globex platform, and are the exchange&#x27;s most popular product. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) offers options on the S&amp;P 500 index as well as on S&amp;P 500 index ETFs, inverse ETFs, and leveraged ETFs.

==History==
In 1860, Henry Varnum Poor formed Poor&#x27;s Publishing, which published an investor&#x27;s guide to the railroad industry. In 1923, Standard Statistics Company (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics Bureau) began rating mortgage bonds and developed its first stock market index consisting of the stocks of 233 U.S. companies, computed weekly. Three years later, it developed a 90-stock index, computed daily. In 1941, Poor&#x27;s Publishing merged with Standard Statistics Company to form Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.

On Monday, March 4, 1957, the index was expanded to its current extent of 500 companies and was renamed the S&amp;P 500 Stock Composite Index. In 1962, Ultronic Systems became the compiler of the S&amp;P indices including the S&amp;P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index. On August 31, 1976, The Vanguard Group offered the first mutual fund to retail investors that tracked the index. On April 21, 1982, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading futures based on the index. On July 1, 1983, Chicago Board Options Exchange began trading options based on the index. Beginning in 1986, the index value was updated every 15 seconds, or 1,559 times per trading day, with price updates disseminated by Reuters.

On January 22, 1993, the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Depositary Receipts exchange-traded fund issued by State Street Corporation began trading. On September 9, 1997, CME Group introduced the S&amp;P E-mini futures contract. In 2005, the index transitioned to a public float-adjusted capitalization-weighting. Friday, September 17, 2021, was the final trading date for the original SP big contract which began trading in 1982.

==Selection criteria==
Like other indices managed by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, but unlike indices such as the Russell 1000 Index which are strictly rule-based, the components of the S&amp;P 500 index are selected by a committee. When considering the eligibility of a new addition, the committee assesses the company&#x27;s merit using the following primary criteria:
# Market capitalization - Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to US$20.5 billion. These market cap eligibility criteria are for addition to an index, not for continued membership. As a result, an index constituent that appears to violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change. 
# Market liquidity and public floatAnnual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 0.75.
# VolumeMinimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date
# Stock exchangeMust be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or Nasdaq (Nasdaq Global Select Market, Nasdaq Select Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market).
# DomicileThe company must have its primary listing on a U.S. exchange, be subject to U.S. securities laws and derive at least 50% of its revenue in the U.S.
# Securities that are ineligible for inclusion in the index are limited partnerships, master limited partnerships and their investment trust units, OTC Bulletin Board issues, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, Exchange-traded notes, royalty trusts, tracking stocks, preferred stock, unit trusts, equity warrants, convertible bonds, investment trusts, American depositary receipts, and American depositary shares.

A stock may rise in value when it is added to the index since index funds must purchase that stock to continue tracking the index.

In October 2021, Bloomberg News reported that a study alleged that some companies purchase ratings from S&amp;P Global to increase their chances of entering the S&amp;P 500 Index—even without meeting the full criteria for inclusion.

==Performance==


Since its inception in 1926, the index&#x27;s compound annual growth rate—including dividends—has been approximately 9.8% (6% after inflation), with the standard deviation of the return over the same time period being 20.81%. While the index has declined in several years by over 30%, it has posted annual increases 70% of the time, with 5% of all trading days resulting in record highs.

Returns are generally quoted as price returns (excluding returns from dividends). However, they can also be quoted as total return, which includes returns from dividends and the reinvestment thereof, and &quot;net total return&quot;, which reflects the effects of dividend reinvestment after the deduction of withholding tax.

<text>Robert Jenkins () was a Welsh master mariner from Llanelli, famous as the protagonist of the &quot;Jenkins&#x27;s ear&quot; incident, which became a contributory cause of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Spain in 1739.

Returning home from a trading voyage in the West Indies in command of the smuggling brig &quot;Rebecca&quot; in April 1731, Jenkins&#x27; ship was stopped and boarded by the Spanish guarda-costa or privateer &quot;La Isabela&quot; on suspicion of smuggling. According to some accounts, her commander, Juan de León Fandiño, had Jenkins bound to a mast, then sliced off his left ear with his sword and allegedly told him to say to his King &quot;the same will happen to him (the king) if caught doing the same&quot;. Another account, in the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; for 7 October 1731, attributes the assault to the Spanish lieutenant Dorce, who &quot;took hold of his left Ear, and with his Cutlass slit it down; and then another of the Spaniards took hold of it and tore it off, but gave him the Piece of his Ear again, bidding him carry it to his Majesty King George&quot;.

On arriving in Britain on 11 June, Jenkins addressed his grievances to the king, and gave a deposition which was passed to the Duke of Newcastle in his capacity as Secretary of State for the Southern Department (as such responsible for the American colonies). In his deposition of 18 June 1731, Jenkins stated that the Spanish captain, &quot;took hold of his left Ear and with his Cutlass slit it down, and then another of the Spaniards took hold of it and tore it off, but gave him the Piece of his Ear again.&quot; This report was then forwarded to the Commander-in-chief in the West Indies, who then complained of Jenkins&#x27; treatment to the Governor of Havana.

At the time the incident received little attention, but it was reported in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in June 1731:
There is no evidence corroborating the oft-repeated story that in spring 1738 Jenkins told his story with dramatic details before a committee of the House of Commons, producing his severed ear (pickled in a jar). In any case, as a result from the petitions from West India merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted (257 &quot;For&quot; and 209 &quot;Against&quot;) on 28 March to ask the King to seek redress from Spain. By summer of 1739, all diplomatic efforts having been exhausted, King George II agreed, on 10 July, to direct the Admiralty Board to initiate maritime reprisals against Spain. &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported that on 20 July 1739 Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a squadron of warships departed Britain for the West Indies, and that on 21 July, &quot;Notice was given by the Lords of the Admiralty, that in pursuance of his Majesty&#x27;s Commission under the Great Seal, Letters of Marque or General Reprisals against the Ships, Goods and Subjects of the King of Spain, were ready to be issued.&quot; However, the formal declaration of war against Spain was withheld until Saturday 23 October 1739 [O.S.].

Jenkins was subsequently given the command of a ship in the British East India Company&#x27;s service. In 1741 he was sent from Britain to Saint Helena to investigate charges of corruption brought against the acting governor, and from May 1741 until March 1742 he administered the affairs of the island. Thereafter he resumed his career at sea. He is said to have preserved his own vessel and three others under his care during an engagement with a pirate vessel.

As for Juan de León Fandiño, he was taken with his snow the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; (10 carriage guns, four of them 6 pounders, and 10 swivels) consisting of 80 crew, described as &quot;Indians, negroes and mulattoes&quot; by Captain Thomas Frankland, of &quot;HMS Rose&quot; (20), on 4 June 1742. Frankland also recaptured three prizes taken by Fandiño. At the time &quot;The London Gazette&quot; wrote &quot;Captain Frankland has sent him to England, and he is now in Custody at Portsmouth&quot;. After 19 months in captivity, Fandiño and his son were released by virtue of an agreement to exchange prisoners signed in Paris. They arrived in San Sebastián on 19 January 1744 and proceeded to Cádiz with the object of returning to Havana.

==Fact versus fiction==
The confrontational nature of British politics in 1738 led many who were opposed to launching a naval war against Spain to doubt the truthfulness of Jenkins&#x27; story. No serious research was undertaken until the late 1880s when John Knox Laughton, the founder of the Navy Records Society, uncovered contemporary letters from Jamaica in September and October 1731 which substantiated Jenkin&#x27;s account of his losing an ear to a Spanish &quot;Guarda Costa&quot; on 9 April 1731 (Old Style; 20 April New Style). Writing from on board at Port Royal, Jamaica on 12 October 1731 [O.S.] to the Admiralty in London, Rear-Admiral Charles Stewart confided, &quot;I was a little surprised to hear of the usage Captain Jenkins met with off the Havana.&quot; Earlier, on 12 September 1731, Rear-Admiral Stewart had written to the Governor of Havana to complain of the &quot;violence and villainies&quot; of a Guarda Costa commander named Fandino who, &quot;about the 20th April last [N.S.] sailed out of your harbor in one of those Guarda Costas, and met a ship of this island bound for Britain; and after using the captain in a most barbarous inhuman manner, taking all his money, cutting off one of his ears, plundering him of those necessaries which were to carry the ship safe home...&quot;.

Contained within the Admiralty records files with the 1731 correspondence from Jamaica was a &quot;List of British Merchant ships taken or plundered by the Spaniards&quot; compiled in 1737, listing 52 ships, among them, &quot;Rebecca, Robert Jenkins, Jamaica to London, boarded and plundered near the Havana, 9 April 1731.&quot;

Shortly after Professor Laughton published his &quot;Jenkins&#x27;s Ear&quot; research in the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, a Royal Navy colleague wrote, on 26 October 1889, to inform the historian: &quot;I have a curious book connected with the subject, published in London in 1739, entitled &quot;England&#x27;s Triumph: or a complete History of the many signals victories gained by the Royal Navy &amp; Merchant Ships of Great Britain, for the term of 40 years past over the insulting &amp; haught Spaniards&quot; by Captain Charles Jenkins, who has too severely felt the effects of Spanish tyranny. On page 64 is an illustration representing &quot;A Spanish Guarda Costa boarding Capt. Jenkin&#x27;s ship &amp; cutting off his Ear&quot;.&quot; The 1889 correspondent noted that the 1739 author was named &quot;Charles&quot; Jenkins, while Laughton&#x27;s research had proved the real mariner was named &quot;Robert&quot; Jenkins.

However, when Laughton subsequently examined the 1739 publication, he found it held little detail about Jenkins himself, and, in writing Robert Jenkins&#x27;s entry for the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; he dismissed it as, &quot;a catch-penny chapbook, in which no reference is made to Jenkins&#x27;s case, except in a worthless frontispiece&quot;.

Mirabeau effectively quoted Jenkins&#x27;s case when arguing before the French assembly (20–2 May 1790) against the policy of entrusting a popular assembly with the power of declaring peace or war.

<text>Pelle the Conqueror (, ) is a 1987 epic film co-written and directed by Bille August, based upon the 1910 novel of the same name by Danish writer Martin Andersen Nexø. The film tells the story of two Swedish immigrants to Denmark, a father and son, who try to build a new life for themselves. It stars Pelle Hvenegaard as the young Pelle, with Max von Sydow as his father, and also features Axel Strøbye and Astrid Villaume.

A co-production of Denmark and Sweden, August chose to adapt &quot;Boyhood&quot;, the first part of Nexø&#x27;s novel, seeking to make an epic and citing the novel&#x27;s status as essential reading in Denmark. Pelle Hvenegaard was 11 when he was cast, after some 3,000 children auditioned. Like many other boys in Denmark, he was named by his family for the novel&#x27;s eponymous character.

The film screened at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and New York Film Festival. It was critically acclaimed, winning the Palme d&#x27;Or and the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and numerous other honours.

==Plot==
In the late 1850s, the elderly emigrant Lasse Karlsson and his son Pelle reach the Danish island of Bornholm after leaving Skåne County, in southern Sweden, following the death of the boy&#x27;s mother. Lasse finds it difficult to secure work, given his advanced age and Pelle&#x27;s youth. They are forced to toil at a large farm, where they are generally mistreated by the managers.

The managers work under the tyrannical Kongstrup, who has a history of affairs with female employees, resulting in illegitimate children. Among such children is Rud, who befriends Pelle and helps him learn Danish. Eventually, Pelle becomes more confident and begins attending school, though he is still discriminated against as a foreigner. Pelle also befriends the Swedish worker Erik, who is constantly harassed for alleged sloth. Erik shares his dream of visiting America, China, and &quot;Negroland&quot; with Pelle, aiming to &quot;conquer&quot; the world. Rud runs away after poor performance at school, but Pelle begins to excel.

After Kongstrup impregnates Mrs. Kongstrup&#x27;s visiting niece Miss Sine, his wife castrates him for his abuses. Lasse begins an affair with Mrs. Olsen, believed to be a widow since her husband has not returned from a long sea voyage. Pelle is teased at school for his father&#x27;s affair.

At the farm, Erik is injured and disabled after attempting to lead a revolt against management. Mrs. Olsen&#x27;s husband returns from his voyage, and Lasse is overcome with depression and alcoholism. The two appeal to the Kongstrups for aid against their harassment. Mrs. Kongstrup offers support, but her husband remains silent. Pelle receives a promotion but, after witnessing Erik forced from the farm, vows to leave. Lasse initially resolves to go with him, before deciding he is too old to travel. He sends Pelle alone into the world.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===

The film, based on the 1910 novel of the same name by Martin Andersen Nexø, was a co-production by Danish and Swedish companies. As the story had both Danish and Swedish elements, cooperation between producers in both countries had practical benefit.

The screenplay, by director Bille August, Per Olov Enquist, Max Lundgren, and Bjarne Reuter, adapted only the first &quot;Boyhood&quot; part of Nexø&#x27;s four-volume work. August decided to film the novel, considered essential reading in Denmark, and he wanted to make an epic film.

For the title role, Pelle Hvenegaard, who was 11, was cast after August and the crew auditioned 3,000 children. August decided on Hvenegaard, who he said demonstrated concentration, patience and self-control. The boy was coincidentally named after the character in Nexø&#x27;s book, as are many boys in Denmark, given the decades-long popularity of the book.

===Filming===
The film marked the first collaboration between production designer Anna Asp, who had previously worked on &quot;Offret&quot; (1986), and August, who had attended a Stockholm school of photography with her. Asp said that in designing the house seen in &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;, she wanted to evoke a prison, and thus built the walls and painted them black and white.

Filming took place for nearly six months. Its budget of $4.5 million, secured from the Danish and Swedish film institutes, made it one of the most costly films made in the Scandinavian countries.

==Release==
The film was screened in the Cannes Film Festival in May 1988, and subsequently at the New York Film Festival in September 1988. The film&#x27;s awards attracted the attention of foreign distributors, with Miramax releasing it in the United States.

Buoyed by the Academy Award recognition, &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; grossed $2,053,931 in North America, a &quot;respectable&quot; figure for a foreign film. The film had a re-release at Golden West College in Los Angeles in March 1993.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

&quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; was released to critical acclaim in the U.S. Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars, comparing it to Jan Troell&#x27;s &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (1971), saying Max von Sydow&#x27;s Oscar nomination was &quot;well deserved&quot; and the novice Pelle Hvenegaard &quot;never steps wrong.&quot; Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a vividly re-created, minutely detailed panorama of a particular time,&quot; and said it was a &quot;scandal&quot; that Von Sydow did not win Best Actor at Cannes. Peter Travers, writing for &quot;People&quot;, said that Von Sydow exhibited &quot;wrenching simplicity and power,&quot; but the film &quot;is maddeningly mediocre.&quot; Swedish director Ingmar Bergman told August he saw the film seven times, subsequently choosing August to direct the film &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;.

Mark Chalon Smith, writing in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1993, praised the film as faithful to the novel and said &quot;Cinematographer Jorgen Persson ... captures several memorable images of the starkly beautiful Danish terrain.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote &quot;Despite occasional lapses into sentimentality, the film is saved by its performances and its uncluttered depiction of harsh impoverished lives,&quot; particularly praising von Sydow. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its list of &quot;the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made.&quot; Sarah Lutton, writing for the British Film Institute, named &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; one of &quot;10 great Danish films&quot; and called Von Sydow &quot;extraordinary.&quot; Von Sydow later also called it &quot;a very beautiful film.&quot; The film holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews.

===Accolades===
&quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival The film also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, 1988; it was submitted to the Academy by the Danish government, giving Denmark its second consecutive win after &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;. The Oscars ceremony also marked Max von Sydow&#x27;s first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

<text>THX Ltd. is an American audio company based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is known for its suite of digital high fidelity audiovisual reproduction standards for movie theaters, screening rooms, home theaters, computer speakers, video game consoles, car audio systems, and video games. The THX trailer that precedes compliant films is based on the Deep Note, with a distinctive glissando up from a rumbling low pitch.

THX was developed by Tomlinson Holman at George Lucas&#x27;s company Lucasfilm in 1983 to ensure that the soundtrack for the third &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, would be accurately reproduced in the best venues. THX was named after Holman&#x27;s initials, with the &quot;X&quot; standing for &quot;crossover&quot; or &quot;experiment&quot;. The name is also an homage to Lucas&#x27;s first film, &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971). Deep Note was created by Holman&#x27;s co-worker James A. Moorer.

THX is a quality assurance system, not a recording technology. All sound recording formats, whether digital (Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS) or analog (Dolby Stereo, Ultra Stereo), can be reproduced in a THX system. THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality, predictable playback environment to ensure that any film soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements include a floating floor, baffled and acoustically treated walls, non-parallel walls (to reduce standing waves), a perforated screen (to allow center channel continuity), and NC30 rating for background noise (&quot;ensures noise from air conditioning units and projection equipment does not mask the subtle effects in a movie&#x27;s soundtrack&quot;).

On June 12, 2002, THX was spun off as a separate company from Lucasfilm and sold to the sound card manufacturer Creative Technology Limited, which held a 60% share of the company. Under Creative Technology, the company developed several further innovations, such as the first THX-certified audio card for computers, the Sound Blaster Audigy 2. In 2016, THX was acquired by American-Singaporean video game hardware company Razer Inc.

On September 12, 2024, THX announced Tuyen Pham as chief executive officer.

==History==
Tomlinson Holman, an audio engineer and scientist, had become an employee of Lucasfilm in 1980. In the process of enhancing the setup for the new Sprocket Systems theater, Holman, who was largely responsible for the theater&#x27;s design, and Lucas invented a complex system that arranged speakers to best fit the architectural space. Using an intricate crossover network that integrated equipment with the room&#x27;s unique acoustics, it was observed to be the highest quality theater sound system in existence. Sprocket Systems mixed the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; sound in the room, the first Lucasfilm production mixed in Northern California. Visiting filmmakers and studio executives were astounded at what they heard. Jim Kessler, who hired Holman, thought of calling the system &quot;Tomlinson Holman&#x27;s Crossover&quot;, or, as originally abbreviated, &quot;XVR&quot;. He then changed the &quot;VR&quot; to &quot;TH&quot;, but he realized that was the name for George Lucas&#x27;s first film, &quot;THX 1138&quot;, and found that would be a fitting name. They eventually changed the &quot;X&quot;&#x27;s meaning to &quot;experiment&quot;.

Four movie theaters in the United States fully installed THX sound systems, becoming the first THX-certified theaters. To introduce the new system, James A. Moorer created an ear-catching sound called the Deep Note. THX was dedicated on May 20, 1983, and the first trailer and Deep Note debuted on time with the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in theaters five days later. It was billed as the first advance in motion picture loudspeaker systems since 1948.

In 1990, Lucasfilm unveiled the Home THX Audio System at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. That year, a demo LaserDisc dubbed &quot;Wow!&quot; was unveiled. It featured various clips from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, and &quot;Willow&quot;. Three years later in 1993, the Special Edition cut of &quot;The Abyss&quot; became the first laserdisc to receive the THX certification. In 1995, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy became the first THX certified VHS release. In 1997, &quot;Twister&quot; became the first digitally mastered THX release on the new DVD format.

In early 2002, it was announced that Lincoln became the first auto company to offer THX-certified premium car audio systems. A concept sound system for the Lincoln Blackwood showcased the potential for in-car multi-channel surround sound, demonstrated at the THX booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The license ensured that high-performance audio systems in Lincoln vehicles met the exacting sound quality and performance standards of its new THX Ultra Premium Car Audio program, beginning with the 2003 Lincoln LS, which was introduced later that year.

THX separated from Lucasfilm and became a new independent company in June 2002. The company&#x27;s headquarters continued in Marin County, California, with offices in Burbank and plan for international expansion. It expanded into gaming and car audio systems. On the professional front, THX planned to continue the expansion of its theatrical certification programs as it became more involved in digital theater.

On September 30, 2003, THX announced its seal of approval for video game audio. Electronic Arts became the first company to achieve the game certification. This helped improve game sound, measuring the credibility of games at a time when the industry became important to the entertainment market. Five games by Electronic Arts, including &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; carried logos on their box and pre-game trailers. In 2020, THX Certified Game Mode was introduced, with enhanced contrast and color, and reduced input lag, and greater accuracy to the producers&#x27; intentions. It has judder and smear reduction, meaning that the picture remained crisp with a quick rise time between dark-to-light transitions. On August 3, TCL Technology revealed the first television to include THX Certified Game Mode, a 6-Series TCL Roku TV.

In 2006, THX began to create new high definition Blu-ray discs, debuting with &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;.

A 3D product certification called THX 3D Display debuted in 2010. The first 3D television to feature this technology is the LG Infinia PX950 Plasma HDTV series. To earn the new THX 3D Display Certification, the PX950 passed more than 400 laboratory tests evaluating left and right eye images for color accuracy, cross-talk, viewing angles, and video processing performance. The PX950 had to pass THX certification for picture quality in 2D, which is required for THX 3D certification. Viewers can select THX 2D or 3D cinema modes for 2D or 3D movie experiences from broadcast sources and Blu-ray discs. Four new THX-certified 3D JVC projectors were unveiled during this time. These were the Reference Series DLA-RS60 and DLA-RS50, marketed by JVC&#x27;s Professional Products Company, and the Precision Series DLA-X9 and DLA-X7.

In early 2013, THX unveiled a new app called THX Tune-Up in time for the Super Bowl, available on the Apple App Store and Google Play. It was billed as the company&#x27;s first mobile app.

On March 14, 2013, THX filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging patent infringement, in a federal court in Northern California.

THX expanded to China in 2014 with new offices in Beijing and a partnership with China Film Group Corporation to redefine the cinema experience. The first THX Certified China Giant Screen (CGS) auditoriums opened in Shanghai in September.

In December 2014, THX collaborated with Warren Theatres, opening a large theater complex opened in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma on December 23. Each of the 18 auditoriums in this theater was THX certified and two new Grand Infinity Auditoriums were introduced. They were designed by Bill Warren to revolutionize the large format movie-going experience. These auditoriums featured THX Certification, patented deep curved screens, 65-channel Dolby Atmos immersive surround sound and the first 4K laser projector in the United States.

The company was acquired by Razer Inc. in October 2016.

The first THX-certified laptop was released in 2017, the Razer Blade Pro.

THX introduced Spatial Audio in 2018, a new positional audio solution for an immersive 360-degree sound experience through headphones and speakers. The technology was used on the Kraken gaming headset for simulated 7.1 surround sound. These headphones were included with a Spatial Audio app. This would be later used on Windows 10 devices.

On May 2, 2018, it was announced that over 200 Cinemark XD locations in the United States and Latin America would feature a THX sound system. These auditoriums featured large wall-to-wall screens, 2D and 3D digital projection, immersive, surround sound, premium seats with Luxury Lounger electric recliners, and THX Certification. Both companies had first announced the partnership one year prior in 2017. The first THX Ultimate Cinema debuted at Regency Westwood Village in Los Angeles in 2019. This theater provided exhibitors with a branded and differentiated PLF offering that included projection technology from Cinionic, and an immersive audio system, acoustics, and auditorium specifications that met THX certification standards.

In September 2020, Walmart stores began to sell Gateway laptops and tablets, which were tuned by THX, ensuring brighter contrast with more rich vibrant screen colors. They combined style, performance, and value in a wide range of products for consumers, students, and creators. The laptops featured THX Spatial Audio that delivered an authentic 7.1 surround experience through built-in speakers and attached headphones.

THX premiered its first consumer electronic product called the Onyx in 2021, a mobile headphone DAC and amplifier using THX AAA technology.

<text>Sir Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis (born 29 April 1957) is an English actor. Often described as one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema, he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, four BAFTA Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. In 2014, Day-Lewis received a knighthood for services to drama.

Born and raised in London, Day-Lewis excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years. Despite his traditional training at the Bristol Old Vic, he is considered a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. Protective of his private life, he rarely grants interviews and makes very few public appearances.

Day-Lewis shifted between theatre and film for most of the early 1980s, joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and playing Romeo Montague in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and Flute in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Playing the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the National Theatre in London in 1989, he left the stage midway through a performance after breaking down during a scene where the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father appears before him—this was his last appearance on the stage. After supporting film roles in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984), he earned acclaim for his breakthrough performances in &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; (1988).

He earned three Academy Awards for Best Actor for his roles as Christy Brown in &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989), an oil tycoon in &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007), and Abraham Lincoln in &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012). He was Oscar-nominated for &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1993), &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), and &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017). Other notable films include &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Boxer&quot; (1997). He retired from acting twice, from 1997 to 2000, when he took up a new profession as an apprentice shoe-maker in Italy, and from 2017 to 2024.

==Early life and education ==
Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis was born on 29 April 1957 in Kensington, London, the second child of the poet Cecil Day-Lewis (1904–1972) and his second wife, actress Jill Balcon (1925–2009). His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis (born 1953), is a television chef and food critic. His father, who was born in the Irish town of Ballintubbert, County Laois, was of Protestant Anglo-Irish descent, lived in England from age two, and was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968. Day-Lewis&#x27;s mother was Jewish; her Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors were immigrants to England in the late 19th century, from Latvia and Poland. Day-Lewis&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, became the head of Ealing Studios, helping develop the new British film industry. The BAFTA for Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema is presented every year in honour of Balcon&#x27;s memory.

Two years after Day-Lewis&#x27;s birth, he moved with his family to Croom&#x27;s Hill in Greenwich via Port Clarence, County Durham. He and his older sister did not see much of their older two half-brothers, who had been teenagers when Day-Lewis&#x27;s father divorced their mother. Living in Greenwich (he attended Invicta and Sherington Primary Schools), Day-Lewis had to deal with tough south London children. At this school, he was bullied for being both Jewish and &quot;posh&quot;. He mastered the local accent and mannerisms, and credits that as being his first convincing performance. Later in life, he has been known to speak of himself as a disorderly character in his younger years, often in trouble for shoplifting and other petty crimes.

In 1968, Day-Lewis&#x27;s parents, finding his behaviour to be too wild, sent him as a boarder to the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent. At the school, he was introduced to his three most prominent interests: woodworking, acting, and fishing. However, his disdain for the school grew, and after two years at Sevenoaks, he was transferred to another independent school, Bedales in Petersfield, Hampshire. His sister was already a student there, and it had a more relaxed and creative ethos. He made his film debut at age 14 in &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, in which he played a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as &quot;heaven&quot; for getting paid £2 to vandalise expensive cars parked outside his local church.

For a few weeks in 1972, the Day-Lewis family lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Day-Lewis&#x27;s father had pancreatic cancer, and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use to rest and recuperate. His father died there in May that year. By the time he left Bedales in 1975, Day-Lewis&#x27;s unruly attitude had diminished and he needed to make a career choice. Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London, he applied for a five-year apprenticeship as a cabinet maker. He was turned down due to a lack of experience. He was accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years along with Miranda Richardson, eventually performing at the Bristol Old Vic itself. At one point he played understudy to Pete Postlethwaite, with whom he would later co-star in the film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1994).

John Hartoch, Day-Lewis&#x27;s acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic, recalled:
==Career==
===1980s===
During the early 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television, including &quot;Frost in May&quot; (where he played an impotent man-child) and &quot;How Many Miles to Babylon?&quot; (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven years after his film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982, he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in &quot;Another Country&quot;, which premiered in late 1981. Next, he took on a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal, first mate in &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984). He next joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and Flute in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In 1985, Day-Lewis gave his first critically acclaimed performance playing a young gay English man in an interracial relationship with a Pakistani youth in the film &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;. Directed by Stephen Frears, and written by Hanif Kureishi, the film is set in 1980s London during Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister. It is the first of three Day-Lewis films to appear in the BFI&#x27;s 100 greatest British films of the 20th century, ranking 50th.
Day-Lewis gained further public notice that year with &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), based on the novel by E. M. Forster. Set in the Edwardian period of turn-of-the-20th-century England, he portrayed an entirely different character: Cecil Vyse, the proper upper-class fiancé of the main character Lucy Honeychurch (played by Helena Bonham Carter). In 1987, Day-Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s adaptation of Milan Kundera&#x27;s &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, in which he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman. During the eight-month shoot, he learned Czech, and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule. During this period, Day-Lewis was regarded as &quot;one of Britain’s most exciting young actors&quot;. He and other young British actors of the time, such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth, and Bruce Payne, were dubbed the &quot;Brit Pack&quot;.

Day-Lewis progressed his personal version of method acting in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. It won him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, known as a writer and painter, was born with cerebral palsy, and was able to control only his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, some of whom had no speech. During filming, he again refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off-screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown&#x27;s life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.
Day-Lewis returned to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, as the title character in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the National Theatre, London, but during a performance collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably, and refused to go back on stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam, who gave a triumphant performance. Ian Charleson formally replaced Day-Lewis for the rest of the run. Earlier in the run, Day-Lewis had talked of the &quot;demons&quot; in the role, and for weeks he threw himself passionately into the part. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father. He later explained that this was more of a metaphor than a hallucination. &quot;To some extent I probably saw my father’s ghost every night, because of course if you’re working in a play like &quot;Hamlet&quot;, you explore everything through your own experience.&quot; He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s, to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.

===1990s===
Day-Lewis starred in the American film &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), based on a novel by James Fenimore Cooper. Day-Lewis&#x27;s character research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting, and fishing. Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills, and learned how to make canoes. He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character.
He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; in which he played Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four, who were wrongfully convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA. He lost 2st 2 lb (30 lb or 14 kg) for the part, kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule, and spent stretches of time in a prison cell. He insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him. Starring opposite Emma Thompson (who played his lawyer Gareth Peirce), and Pete Postlethwaite, Day-Lewis earned his second Academy Award nomination, third BAFTA nomination, and second Golden Globe nomination.

Day-Lewis returned to the US in 1993, playing Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. Day-Lewis starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder. To prepare for the film, set in America&#x27;s Gilded Age, he wore 1870s-period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months, including top hat, cane, and cape. Although Day-Lewis was sceptical of the role, thinking himself &quot;too English&quot; for it and hoping for something &quot;more rough-and-tumble&quot;, he accepted due to Scorsese directing the film. The film was critically well received, while Peter Travers in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Day-Lewis is smashing as the man caught between his emotions and the social ethic. Not since Olivier in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; has an actor matched piercing intelligence with such imposing good looks and physical grace.&quot;

In 1996, Day-Lewis starred in the film adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;The Crucible&quot; reunited with Winona Ryder, and starred alongside Paul Scofield, and Joan Allen. During the shoot, he met his future wife, Rebecca Miller, the author&#x27;s daughter. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade of &quot;A&quot;, calling the adaptation &quot;joltingly powerful&quot; and noting the &quot;spectacularly&quot; acted performances of Day-Lewis, Scofield, and Allen. He followed that with Jim Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Boxer&quot; alongside Emily Watson, starring as a former boxer and IRA member recently released from prison. His preparation included training with former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan. Immersing himself into the boxing scene, he watched &quot;Prince&quot; Naseem Hamed train, and attended professional boxing matches such as the Nigel Benn vs. Gerald McClellan world title fight at London Arena. Impressed with his work in the ring, McGuigan felt Day-Lewis could have become a professional boxer, commenting, &quot;If you eliminate the top ten middleweights in Britain, any of the other guys Daniel could have gone in and fought.&quot;

Following &quot;The Boxer&quot;, Day-Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into &quot;semi-retirement&quot; and returning to his old passion of woodworking. He moved to Florence, Italy, where he became intrigued by the craft of shoe-making. He apprenticed as a shoe-maker with Stefano Bemer. For a time, his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known.

===2000s===

After a three-year absence from acting on screen, Day-Lewis returned to film by reuniting with Martin Scorsese for &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002). He took on the role of villainous gang leader William &quot;Bill the Butcher&quot; Cutting, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Bill&#x27;s young protégé as well as Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Brendan Gleeson, and Liam Neeson. To help him get into character, he hired circus performers to teach him to throw knives. While filming, he was never out of character between takes (including keeping his character&#x27;s New York accent). At one point during filming, having been diagnosed with pneumonia, he refused to wear a warmer coat, or to take treatment, because it was not in keeping with the period; he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment. The film divided critics while Day-Lewis received plaudits for his portrayal of Bill the Butcher. Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though flawed, the sprawling, messy &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis&#x27;s electrifying performance.&quot; It earned Day-Lewis his third Oscar nomination, and won him his second BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.
In the early 2000s, Day-Lewis&#x27;s wife, director Rebecca Miller, offered him the lead role in her film &quot;The Ballad of Jack and Rose&quot;, in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his life had evolved, and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter. While filming, he arranged to live separately from his wife to achieve the &quot;isolation&quot; needed to focus on his own character&#x27;s reality. The film received mixed reviews.

In 2007, Day-Lewis starred alongside Paul Dano in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s loose film adaptation of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;Oil!&quot;, titled &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with critic Andrew Sarris calling the film &quot;an impressive achievement in its confident expertness in rendering the simulated realities of a bygone time and place, largely with an inspired use of regional amateur actors and extras with all the right moves and sounds.&quot; Day-Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role (which he dedicated to Heath Ledger, who had died five days earlier, saying he was inspired by Ledger&#x27;s acting and calling the actor&#x27;s performance in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; &quot;unique, perfect&quot;), and a variety of film critics&#x27; circle awards for the role. In winning the Best Actor Oscar, Day-Lewis joined Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson as the only Best Actor winner awarded an Oscar in two non-consecutive decades.

In 2009, Day-Lewis starred in Rob Marshall&#x27;s musical adaptation &quot;Nine&quot; as film director Guido Contini. The film featured a large ensemble of distinguished actresses, including Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman, and Sophia Loren. The film received mixed reviews, with overall praise for the performances of Day-Lewis, Cotillard, and Cruz. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role, as well as sharing nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast and the Satellite Award for Best Cast – Motion Picture with the rest of the cast members.
===2010s===

Day-Lewis portrayed Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s biopic &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012). Based on the book &quot;Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln&quot;, the film began shooting in Richmond, Virginia, in October 2011. Day-Lewis spent a year in preparation for the role, a time he had requested from Spielberg. He read over 100 books on Lincoln, and long worked with the make-up artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln. Speaking in Lincoln&#x27;s voice throughout the entire shoot, Day-Lewis asked the British crew members who shared his native accent not to chat with him. Spielberg said of Day-Lewis&#x27;s portrayal, &quot;I never once looked the gift horse in the mouth. I never asked Daniel about his process. I didn&#x27;t want to know.&quot; &quot;Lincoln&quot; received critical acclaim, especially for Day-Lewis&#x27;s performance. It also became a commercial success, grossing over $275 million worldwide. In November 2012, he received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film. The same month, Day-Lewis featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Actor&quot;.

At the 70th Golden Globe Awards, on 14 January 2013, Day-Lewis won his second Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, and at the 66th British Academy Film Awards on 10 February, he won his fourth BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. At the 85th Academy Awards, Day-Lewis became the first three-time recipient of the Best Actor Oscar for his role in &quot;Lincoln&quot;. John Hartoch, Day-Lewis&#x27;s acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic theatre school, said of his former pupil&#x27;s achievement:

Shortly after winning the Oscar for &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting before making another film. After a five-year hiatus, Day-Lewis returned to the screen to star in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017). Set in 1950s London, Day-Lewis played an obsessive dressmaker, Reynolds Woodcock, who falls in love with a waitress (played by Vicky Krieps). The film and his performance were met with widespread acclaim from critics, and Day-Lewis was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Prior to the film&#x27;s release in June 2017, Day-Lewis announced that he was retiring from acting. In a November 2017 interview, Day-Lewis stated: &quot;I need to believe in the value of what I&#x27;m doing. The work can seem vital, irresistible, even. And if an audience believes it, that should be good enough for me. But, lately, it isn&#x27;t.&quot;

=== 2020s ===
On 1 October 2024, after a seven-year absence, it was announced that Day-Lewis would return to acting. He is attached to star in &quot;Anemone&quot;, the first film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis, with whom Daniel co-wrote the script.

== Technique and reputation ==
Day-Lewis is considered a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. Displaying a &quot;mercurial intensity&quot;, he would often remain completely in character throughout the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health. He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry, having starred in only six films since 1998, with as many as five years between roles. Protective of his private life, he rarely grants interviews, and makes very few public appearances.

Following his third Oscar win in 2013, there was much debate about Day-Lewis&#x27;s standing among the greatest actors in film history. Joe Queenan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked, &quot;Arguing whether Daniel Day-Lewis is a greater actor than Laurence Olivier, or Richard Burton, or Marlon Brando, is like arguing whether Messi is more talented than Pelé, whether Napoleon Bonaparte edges out Alexander the Great as a military genius.&quot; When Day-Lewis himself was asked what it was like to be &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest actor&quot;, he replied, &quot;It&#x27;s daft isn&#x27;t it? It changes all the time.&quot;

Widely respected among his peers, in June 2017, Michael Simkins of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;In this glittering cesspit we call the acting profession, there are plenty of rival thesps who, through sheer luck or happenstance, seem to have the career we ourselves could have had if only the cards had fallen differently. But Day-Lewis is, by common consent, even in the most sourly disposed green rooms – a class apart. We shall not look upon his like again – at least for a bit. Performers of his mercurial intensity come along once in a generation.&quot;

==Personal life==

Protective of his privacy, Day-Lewis has described his life as a &quot;lifelong study in evasion&quot;. He had a relationship with French actress Isabelle Adjani that lasted six years, eventually ending after a split and reconciliation. Their son was born in 1995 in New York City a few months after the relationship ended.

In 1996, while working on the film version of the stage play &quot;The Crucible&quot;, he visited the home of playwright Arthur Miller, where he was introduced to the writer&#x27;s daughter, Rebecca Miller. They married later that year, on 13 November 1996. The couple have two sons. They divide their time between their homes in Manhattan and Annamoe, Ireland.

Day-Lewis has held dual British and Irish citizenship since 1993. He has maintained his Annamoe home since 1997. He stated: &quot;I do have dual citizenship, but I think of England as my country. I miss London very much, but I couldn&#x27;t live there because there came a time when I needed to be private and was forced to be public by the press. I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.&quot; He is a supporter of south-east London football club Millwall. Day-Lewis is also an Ambassador for The Lir Academy, a new drama school at Trinity College Dublin, founded in 2011.

In 2010, Day-Lewis received an honorary doctorate in letters from the University of Bristol, in part because of his attendance of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in his youth. Day-Lewis has stated that he had &quot;no real religious education&quot;, and that he &quot;suppose[s]&quot; he is &quot;a die-hard agnostic&quot;. In 2012, he donated to the University of Oxford papers belonging to his father, the poet Cecil Day-Lewis, including early drafts of the poet&#x27;s work and letters from actor John Gielgud and literary figures such as W. H. Auden, Robert Graves, and Philip Larkin. In 2015, he became the honorary president of the Poetry Archive. A registered UK charity, the Poetry Archive is a free website containing a growing collection of recordings of English-language poets reading their work. In 2017, Day-Lewis became a patron of the Wilfred Owen Association. Day-Lewis&#x27;s association with Wilfred Owen began with his father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who edited Owen&#x27;s poetry in the 1960s and his mother, Jill Balcon, who was a vice-president of the Wilfred Owen Association until her death in 2009.

In 2008, when he received the Academy Award for Best Actor from Helen Mirren, who was on presenting duty having won the previous year&#x27;s Best Actress Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth II in &quot;The Queen&quot;, Day-Lewis knelt before her, and she tapped him on each shoulder with the Oscar statuette, to which he quipped, &quot;That&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ll come to ever getting a knighthood.&quot; Day-Lewis was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to drama. On 14 November 2014, he was knighted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

<doc id="171005" wikidata="Q114115" url="?curid=171005" title="Henry V (1989 film)">
<text>Henry V is a 1989 British historical drama film written and directed by Kenneth Branagh in his feature directorial debut, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s history play of the same name. It stars Branagh in the title role of King Henry V of England, with Paul Scofield, Derek Jacobi, Ian Holm, Brian Blessed, Emma Thompson, Alec McCowen, Judi Dench, Robbie Coltrane, and Christian Bale in supporting roles.

&quot;Henry V&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and is considered one of the best Shakespeare screen adaptations ever produced. Among its numerous accolades, the film received three nominations at the 62nd Academy Awards, two of which went to Branagh (Best Director and Best Actor). &quot;Henry V&quot; won with its other nomination, Best Costume Design for Phyllis Dalton.

==Plot==
The film begins with Chorus, in this case a person in modern dress, introducing the subject of the play. He is walking through an empty film studio and ends his monologue by opening the doors to begin the main action. Chorus reappears several times during the film, his speeches helping to explain and progress the action.

The following act divisions reflect the original play, not the film.

===Act 1===
Early 15th century in England: The Bishop of Ely and the Archbishop of Canterbury collude to distract young King Henry V from passing a decree that might confiscate property from the church. They agree to talk him into invading France. Canterbury appears in the throne room and explains to the King&#x27;s advisers that Henry is rightful heir to the throne of France on the grounds that the Salic law in France unjustly bars his claim to the throne and should be disregarded. Supported by the noblemen Exeter and Westmoreland, the clergymen manage to persuade Henry to declare war on France if his claim on the French crown is denied.

Henry calls in Montjoy, a representative of the Dauphin. The Dauphin&#x27;s condescending response takes the form of the delivery of a chest of tennis balls. Exeter, who opens the chest, is appalled, but Henry at first takes the insult calmly. He goes on to state his determination to attack France, dismisses the ambassador and starts to plan his campaign.

John Falstaff is taken ill in Mistress Quickly&#x27;s inn. His friends Bardolph, Ancient Pistol, and Corporal Nym remember the good times they had together with Henry before he was king and denounced them all.

===Act 2===
Henry tricks three high-ranked traitors into pronouncing their own sentence by asking advice on the case of a man who drunkenly shouted insults at him in the street. When they recommend that he show no mercy to this minor offender, the King reveals his knowledge of their own sedition. They draw their daggers, but are quickly subdued by Henry&#x27;s loyal nobles. Exeter arrests them for high treason and Henry orders their execution before crossing the English Channel. Falstaff dies and Bardolph, Pistol, Nym, and Falstaff&#x27;s page, Robin, depart for France.
Meanwhile, in France, Charles VI, the King of France and his noblemen discuss King Henry&#x27;s threats. The Dauphin (portrayed as stubborn and cowardly) says he does not fear Henry, but Charles and the Constable of France are worried because of Henry&#x27;s martial ancestors and the successful previous English invasions. Exeter arrives in full plate armour. He informs them that Henry demands the French crown and is prepared to take it by force if it is withheld, and delivers an insulting message to the Dauphin. King Charles tells Exeter he will give him a reply the following day.

===Act 3===
King Henry delivers a morale-boosting speech to his troops and attacks the walled city of Harfleur. When the Dauphin fails to relieve the city in time, the governor surrenders in return for Henry&#x27;s promise to do Harfleur&#x27;s population no harm. Henry orders Exeter to repair its fortifications.

Katherine, a French princess who had been engaged to marry King Henry in an arrangement made before the war, asks her lady-in-waiting Alice to teach the English for some parts of the body. They mispronounce the words for comic effect and joke that &quot;foot&quot; sounds rude in French. In a silent moment, Katherine watches her father and his courtiers and notes how worried they appear. King Charles finally orders his nobles to engage Henry&#x27;s troops, halt their advance, and bring Henry back a prisoner.

The English troops struggle toward Calais through foul weather and sickness. Bardolph is hanged for looting a church. The French herald Montjoy arrives and demands Henry pay a ransom for his person or place himself and his entire army at risk. Henry refuses, replying that even his reduced and sickly army is sufficient to resist a French attack.

===Act 4===
In the boisterous French camp the night before the Battle of Agincourt (1415), the French nobility wait impatiently for the morning, and it is clear that the Dauphin is not popular with the other nobles. In the more sober and silent English camp, following a brief meeting with his brothers, Gloucester and Bedford, together with Sir Thomas Erpingham, Henry decides to look into the state of his troops and wanders his camp in disguise. He meets Pistol, who fails to recognise him. Soon afterwards, he encounters a small group of soldiers, including Bates and Williams, with whom he debates his own culpability for any deaths to follow. He and Williams almost come to blows, and they agree to duel the day after, should they survive. When Williams and his friends leave the King alone, Henry breaks into a monologue about his burdens and prays to God for help.

Next morning, the English Army is outnumbered five to one. Henry encourages his troops with his St Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech and responds angrily when Montjoy renews the Dauphin&#x27;s offer of ransom. The battle begins with the charge of the French cavalry, but the English archery and countercharge cut down a large part of the advancing army before it ever reaches their lines. When the Constable of France is killed, the dismayed French leaders realise the battle is lost and become desperate. Some of them manage to get behind enemy lines and, deprived of any hope to turn the battle, break the code of chivalry by murdering the young and defenseless English pages (including Robin) and setting fire to the English tents. Henry and his officer Fluellen come upon the carnage and are still appalled when Montjoy delivers the French surrender.

Henry returns Williams&#x27; glove, this time out of disguise, and Williams is shocked to learn that the man he was arguing with the night before was King Henry himself.

The act ends with a four-minute long tracking shot, as &quot;Non nobis&quot; is sung and the dead and wounded are carried off the field. Henry himself carries Robin.

===Act 5===
Finally negotiations are made for Henry to be named king of both England and France. While the French and English royal delegations negotiate the Treaty of Troyes, the sides take a brief intermission in which Henry privately speaks with Katherine (Kate). He assures Kate that by marrying a French princess he demonstrates his respect for the people of France, and professes his love for her. The delegation returns and Henry announces a hopeful era of long peace with the joining of the two kingdoms. The film ends with Chorus detailing the history after the events of the film, culminating in the loss of the French throne by Henry VI.

==Production==

===Screenplay===
The text of the play is heavily edited. Additionally, Branagh incorporated flashbacks using extracts from &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; in which Henry interacts with the character of Falstaff, who, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, is never seen, merely announced to be deathly ill in Act 2 scene 1, and dead in Act 2 scene 3. The scenes involve a brief summary of Henry&#x27;s denouncement of Falstaff primarily with lines from Act 2, scene 4 of &quot;Henry IV part 1&quot; and a brief though important utterance of Henry&#x27;s final repudiation of Falstaff in &quot;Part 2&quot;, &quot;I know thee not, old man.&quot; The film also uses Falstaff&#x27;s line &quot;do not, when thou art King, hang a thief&quot; from &quot;Henry IV Part 1&quot; but gives it to Bardolph, in order to highlight the poignancy when Henry later has Bardolph executed.

===Filming===
&quot;Henry V&quot; was made on an estimated budget of $9 million. The film was produced by Bruce Sharman with the British Broadcasting Corporation and Branagh&#x27;s company Renaissance Films. Principal photography commenced on 31 October 1988 and concluded 19 December the same year. Sixty per cent of production was shot on sound stages at Shepperton Studios, while many of the battle sequences were shot on fields adjacent to the Shepperton complex.

===Style===
Branagh&#x27;s film is frequently compared with the 1944 film of the play directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. The visual style of Branagh&#x27;s film is grittier and more realistic than that of Olivier&#x27;s. For example, his film avoids Olivier&#x27;s use of stylised sets, and, where Olivier staged the Battle of Agincourt on a sunlit field, Branagh&#x27;s takes place amid rain-drenched mud and gore. Nearly all of the scenes involving the comic characters were also staged as drama, rather than in the broad, more slapstick way in which Olivier staged them, because Branagh felt that modern audiences would not see the humour in these scenes. There is a historical inaccuracy in that Charles VI of France was played by 67-year-old Paul Scofield, perhaps to enhance the effect of the historical king&#x27;s mental illness that he had already been suffering for twenty years, but Charles VI was only 46 years old at the time of Agincourt. Olivier&#x27;s movie also uses an older actor to play Charles VI (Harcourt Williams, who was 66 years old at the time of filming).

While the text of the Chorus&#x27; monologues are the same, the setting for them has been adapted to reflect the nature of the motion picture adaptation of the play. Unlike the other performers, who are dressed in clothing contemporary to the actual Henry V to reflect their characters, the Chorus is dressed in modern 20th century clothing. The opening monologue, originally written to compensate for the limitations of a theatre-staged production to represent the historical scenes presented, is delivered on an empty motion picture sound stage with unfinished sets. The other chorus monologues are delivered on location where the relevant action is taking place. In all cases, the chorus speaks directly to the camera, addressing the audience.

===Music===

The score to &quot;Henry V&quot; was written by then first-time film composer Patrick Doyle. It was performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Simon Rattle. The soundtrack was released 8 November 1989 through EMI Classics and features fifteen tracks of score at a running time just under an hour. Patrick Doyle also appeared in the film as the first soldier to begin singing &quot;Non Nobis, Domine&quot; following the battle at Agincourt.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Henry V&quot; received near-universal critical acclaim for Branagh&#x27;s Oscar-nominated performance and direction, for the accessibility of its Shakespearean language, and for its score by Patrick Doyle. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot; Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s most fully realised Shakespeare adaptation, Henry V is an energetic, passionate, and wonderfully acted film.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;Universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Henry V&quot; also ranks #1 on the Rotten Tomatoes list of Greatest Shakespeare Movies, beating Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ran&quot; (1985) and Branagh&#x27;s own version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), respectively ranking in second and third place.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, praising Branagh&#x27;s performance and writing, &quot;There is no more stirring summons to arms in all of literature than Henry&#x27;s speech to his troops on St. Day, ending with the lyrical &#x27;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.&#x27; To deliver this speech successfully is to pass the acid test for anyone daring to perform the role of Henry V in public, and as Kenneth Branagh, as Henry, stood up on the dawn of the Battle of Agincourt and delivered the famous words, I was emotionally stirred even though I had heard them many times before. That is one test of a great Shakespearian actor: to take the familiar and make it new.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also gave the film a positive review, calling &quot;Henry V&quot; &quot;A stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.&#x27;s brightest talents.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed over $10 million in the U.S. and at the time of its widest release played on 134 U.S. screens.

<doc id="171011" wikidata="Q1210973" url="?curid=171011" title="Reversal of Fortune">
<text>Reversal of Fortune is a 1990 American drama film directed by Barbet Schroeder that was adapted from the 1985 book &quot;Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case&quot;, written by law professor Alan Dershowitz. It recounts the true story of the unexplained coma of socialite Sunny von Bülow, the subsequent attempted murder trial, and the eventual acquittal of her husband, Claus von Bülow, who had Dershowitz as his defense attorney. The film stars Jeremy Irons as Claus, Glenn Close as Sunny, and Ron Silver as Dershowitz. Screenwriter Nick Kazan originally envisioned Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer in the role of Claus von Bülow but was thrilled with Irons&#x27; performance. Irons earned the 1990 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.

==Plot==
The story is narrated by Sunny von Bülow, who is in a coma after falling into diabetic shock after a Christmas party. Her husband, the dissolute European aristocrat Claus von Bülow, is charged with attempting to murder the hypoglycemic Sunny by giving her an overdose of insulin. Claus&#x27;s strained relationship with his wife and his cold and haughty personal demeanor lead most people to conclude that he is guilty. In need of an innovative defense, Claus turns to law professor Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz is initially convinced of Claus&#x27;s guilt but takes the case because von Bülow agrees to fund Dershowitz&#x27;s defense of two poor black boys accused of capital murder. Employing his law students as workers, Dershowitz proceeds to defend Claus, wrestling with his client&#x27;s unnerving personal style and questions of von Bülow&#x27;s guilt or innocence.

== Cast ==
==Production==
The film was shot in numerous estates in Rhode Island and New Jersey, and the Knole house in Old Westbury, New York. At least one courtroom scene was shot at the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department in Brooklyn, New York.

Despite the fact that the house where the facts happened was Clarendon Court, as also mentioned in dialogue, the establishing shot intentionally avoids the house and ends instead with a view of The Breakers, another grandiose property nearby built for Cornelius Vanderbilt II.

== Reception ==
The film received mostly positive reviews and holds a 92% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.9/10 from 51 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Featuring exceptional performances and a cunning script, &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; doubles as a tantalizing mystery and ruthless satire of the rich.&quot; It has a score of 93 on Metacritic with 18 reviews 

=== Accolades ===
In 2015, the 25th anniversary of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; on its list of the 25 best films of the past 25 years.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:

<doc id="171013" wikidata="Q328590" url="?curid=171013" title="Christopher Durang">
<text>Christopher Ferdinand Durang (January 2, 1949 – April 2, 2024) was an American playwright known for works of outrageous and often absurd comedy. His work was especially popular in the 1980s, though his career seemed to get a second wind in the late 1990s.

&quot;Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You&quot; was Durang&#x27;s watershed play as it brought him to national prominence when it won him the Obie Award for Best Playwright (1980). His play &quot;Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike&quot; won the Tony Award for Best Play in 2013. The production was directed by Nicholas Martin, and featured Sigourney Weaver, David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen, Billy Magnussen, Shalita Grant and Genevieve Angelson. Durang was a past co-director of the Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at Juilliard.

==Early life and education==
Durang was born on January 2, 1949, in Montclair, New Jersey, the son of two WWII veterans, architect Francis Ferdinand Durang Jr. and Patricia Elizabeth Durang (née Mansfield), a secretary. He grew up in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, and attended Catholic schools: Our Lady of Peace School (New Providence) and Delbarton (Morristown). He received a B.A. in English from Harvard College and an M.F.A. in playwriting from Yale School of Drama.

==Work==

His work often deals critically with issues of child abuse, Roman Catholic dogma, culture, and homosexuality. Ben Brantley summarized key themes from Durang&#x27;s plays in a review written in 1994: 1) narcissism; 2) fear of engagement with a danger-filled world; 3) the strangulating nature of family ties; 4) sexual disorientation and the tenuousness of individual identity. To this list the abusive power of authority figures could be added. 

While Durang&#x27;s use of parody and his criticism of many social institutions might appear overly cynical at times, he stated: ... when I say everyone is crazy that means it&#x27;s a very bad day where the amount of crazy people in the world has spread out to the entire universe and it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to cope with anything... I think we&#x27;re all neurotic. And I do think relationships are certainly difficult. Nonetheless, those lines in the play do get a laugh, so there&#x27;s something. It&#x27;s not as despairing as it sounds, but I don&#x27;t not believe it.
Much of Durang&#x27;s style can be attributed to the aesthetic of black comedy, a humor style that offers a fatalistic view of life. Durang discussed the particular frame of mind that requires the viewer to distance himself from the horrific episode of human suffering and pain; he explained:I exaggerate awful things further, and then I present it in a way that is funny, and for those of us who find it funny, it has to do with a very clear suspension of disbelief. It is a play, after all, with acted characters; it allows us a distance we couldn’t have in reality.  To me this distance allows me to find some rather serious topics funny.Durang suggested that his form of humor requires a double-consciousness, an ability to register scenes of cruelty or pain, while simultaneously comprehending the humor.  He credited Arthur Kopit&#x27;s “tragicfarce” &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot; as an early influence on his creative vision, a black comedy in which a woman totes her dead husband&#x27;s corpse on vacation with her. Humor is one way of resolving conflict and anxiety, and black comedy goes a step further to relieve tension regarding subjects that are typically difficult to think about, such as death, family dysfunction, or torture.

His plays have been performed nationwide, including on Broadway and Off-Broadway. His works include those in the bibliography as well as a collection of one-act parodies meant to be performed in one evening entitled &quot;Durang/Durang&quot; that includes &quot;Mrs. Sorken&quot;, &quot;For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; by Tennessee Williams), &quot;A Stye of the Eye&quot;, &quot;Nina in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Wanda&#x27;s Visit&quot;, and &quot;Business Lunch at the Russian Tea Room&quot;.

Together with Marsha Norman, Durang directed The Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at the Juilliard School from 1984 to 2016, teaching playwrights Joshua Harmon and Noah Haidle, as well as Pulitzer-Prize winning David Lindsay-Abaire, who succeeded Durang as co-director.

Durang performed as an actor for both stage and screen. He first came to prominence in his Off-Broadway satirical review &quot;Das Lusitania Songspiel&quot;, which he performed with friend and fellow Yale alum Sigourney Weaver. Later he co-starred in one of his own plays as Matt in &quot;The Marriage of Bette and Boo&quot;, as well as Man in the original production of &quot;Laughing Wild&quot;.

===In film===
Durang denounced the Robert Altman 1987 film adaptation of &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot;, calling it &quot;horrific&quot;. He accused Altman of totally rewriting the script &quot;so that all psychology is thrown out the window, and the characters dash around acting crazy but with literally no behavioral logic underneath.&quot;

Durang appeared as an actor in the 1987 comedy &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Mr. North&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed&quot;, 1990&#x27;s &quot;In the Spirit&quot;, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Housesitter&quot;, and 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot;.

Durang wrote a number of unproduced screenplays, including &quot;The Nun Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;, &quot;The House of Husbands&quot; (which he co-authored with Wendy Wasserstein), and &quot;The Adventures of Lola&quot;.

===On television===
&quot;Wanda&#x27;s Visit&quot;, one of the six one-acts in &quot;Durang/Durang,&quot; was originally written for the PBS series &quot;Trying Times&quot;. Durang played the part of The Waiter in that production.

Durang appeared as himself on the October 11, 1986 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by his longtime friend Sigourney Weaver. In the episode, Durang and Weaver parodied the works of Bertolt Brecht, and both were interviewed in the debut of the recurring sketch &quot;Church Chat&quot;, with Durang as himself.

Durang&#x27;s 1987 sketch &quot;The Funeral&quot;, written for a televised Carol Burnett special, features a grieving widow (Burnett) who is disturbed at her husband&#x27;s wake by an eccentric mourner, played by Robin Williams.

==Personal life and death==
Durang lived in Pipersville, Pennsylvania, with his husband, actor/playwright John Augustine. They began their relationship in 1986 and were legally married in 2014.

Durang was at first reluctant to discuss his homosexuality publicly, concerned that he would be diminished by the label &quot;gay playwright.&quot; But in 1988, he told &quot;The Advocate&quot; that he felt the need to be more public about his gay identity given the intense homophobia surrounding the AIDS crisis and the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;. 

In 2016, Durang was diagnosed with logopenic progressive aphasia, which is thought to be caused by a form of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; as with all forms of aphasia, it primarily impeded his ability to process language, though it subsequently affected his short-term memory. Durang gradually withdrew from public life before his condition was publicly announced in 2022.

Durang died from complications of aphasia at his Pennsylvania home on April 2, 2024, at the age of 75.

<doc id="171016" wikidata="Q2738813" url="?curid=171016" title="The Field (play)">
<text>The Field is a play written by John B. Keane, first performed in 1965. It tells the story of the hardened Irish farmer &quot;Bull&quot; McCabe and his love for the land he rents. The play debuted at Dublin&#x27;s Olympia Theatre in 1965, with Ray McAnally as &quot;The Bull&quot; and Eamon Keane as &quot;The Bird&quot; O&#x27;Donnell. The play was published in 1966 by Mercier Press. A new version with some changes was produced in 1987.

A film adaptation was released in 1990, directed by Jim Sheridan with Richard Harris in the lead role.

John B. Keane based the story on the 1958 murder of Moss Moore, a bachelor farmer living in Reamore, County Kerry. Dan Foley, a neighbour with whom Moore had a long-running dispute, was suspected of the murder, but the charges were denied by Foley&#x27;s family.
The character of William Dee, who has been living in England for many years, may be based on the nephew of William Dee (also called William Dee) who had been born in England in 1959. William Dee senior lived in the nearby village of Lisselton and was a friend and customer of JBK and so JBK would have been familiar with the emigration in the late 1950s to England of William Dee&#x27;s brother Micheál and the birth of his son William there. The return of the character William Dee from England to Ireland in the play may therefore have been inspired by the possibility that the real William Dee might one day &quot;come home&quot; to the land of his parents.

==Plot==
&quot;The Field&quot; is set in a small country village in southwest Ireland.

Rugged individualist Bull McCabe has spent five hard years of labour cultivating a small plot of rented land, nurturing it from barren rock into a fertile field. When the owner of the field decides to auction it, he believes that he has a claim to the land. The McCabes intimidate most of the townspeople out of bidding in the auction, to the chagrin of auctioneer Mick Flanagan, but Galwayman William Dee arrives from England, where he has lived for many years, with a plan to cover the field with concrete and extract gravel from the adjacent river. An encounter between William and the McCabes ends in William&#x27;s death and a cover-up.

==Characters==
* Thady &quot;The Bull&quot; McCabe - The play&#x27;s main character and anti-hero, Bull is as strong as a cow - and just as powerful. Having grazed and rented Maggie Butler&#x27;s field for five years, along with his son Tadhg, Bull believes he is the rightful owner.
* Tadhg McCabe - Bull&#x27;s son and faithful companion, who too shares his father&#x27;s passion of land.
* &quot; The Bird&quot; O&#x27;Donnell - A mischievous calf buyer and a regular at Flanagan&#x27;s pub, Bird is an acquaintance of The McCabes.&#x27; Con Man.
* Mick Flanagan - The local publican and auctioneer, Mick is mendacious and sly and is another acquaintance of the McCabes, who attempts to help them secure the field.
* Maimie Flanagan - Mick&#x27;s younger wife and the mother of his nine children. Maimie is flirtatious and charming and has a bitter, strained relationship with her husband, whilst maintaining a strong relationship with her eldest son Leamy.
* Maggie Butler - An elderly widow, who has rented her late husband&#x27;s field to The McCabes for the past five years. Maggie is frail and destitute and wishes to put the field up for public auction, much to the McCabes&#x27; disgust.
* William Dee - A young Galway man, who has been living in England for twelve years. Considered an &quot;outsider&quot;, William decides to bid against the Bull McCabe for Maggie Butler&#x27;s field.
* Leamy Flanagan - Mick and Maimie&#x27;s eldest son.
* Dandy McCabe - The Bull McCabe&#x27;s first cousin, who, unlike Bull, is honest and jovial.
* Mrs. McCabe - Dandy&#x27;s wife, to whom he has been married for twenty years.
* Tom Leahy - The local sergeant, investigating the death of a donkey.
* Fr Murphy - The local parish priest.

==Film version==
Jim Sheridan directed a film version in 1990. Richard Harris received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal.

Most characters in the film were different from the play but the film only retained The Bull, The Bird and Tadhg. Some events in the play were also changed in the film.

<doc id="171017" wikidata="Q988037" url="?curid=171017" title="Mork &amp; Mindy">
<text>Mork &amp; Mindy is an American television sitcom that aired on ABC from September 14, 1978, to May 27, 1982. A spin-off after a highly successful episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;, it starred Robin Williams as Mork, an extraterrestrial who comes to Earth from the planet Ork, and Pam Dawber as Mindy McConnell, his human friend, roommate, and eventual love interest.

==History and episodes==

===Premise and initial success===
Mork first appears in the &quot;Happy Days&quot; season five episode &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;, which aired in February 1978, and is a take on the 1960s sitcom &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. The show wanted to feature a spaceman to capitalize on the popularity of the recently released &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Williams&#x27;s character, Mork, attempts to take Richie Cunningham to his planet of Ork as a specimen, but he is foiled by Fonzie. In the initial broadcast, it turned out to be a dream of Richie&#x27;s. However, when Mork proved popular, the syndicated version was re-edited with a scene filmed showing Mork erasing the experience from everyone&#x27;s minds.

The character of Mork was played by then-unknown Robin Williams, who impressed producer Garry Marshall with his quirky comedic ability as soon as they met. Dom DeLuise and Roger Rees were offered the role, but both passed. Richard Lewis and Jeff Altman were considered. When Williams was asked to take a seat at the audition, he sat on his head, and Marshall cast him on the spot, later wryly commenting that Williams was the only alien who auditioned.

&quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; is set in Boulder, Colorado, in the then-present-day late 1970s and early 1980s (as opposed to the &quot;Happy Days&quot; setting of Milwaukee in the late 1950s and early 1960s). Mork explains to Richie that he is from the &quot;future&quot;: the 1970s.
===First season===

Mork arrives on Earth in an egg-shaped spacecraft. He has been assigned to observe human behavior by Orson, his mostly unseen and long-suffering superior (voiced by Ralph James). Orson has sent Mork to get him off Ork, where humor is not permitted. Attempting to fit in, Mork dresses in an Earth suit, but wears it backwards. Landing in Boulder, Colorado, he encounters 21-year-old Mindy McConnell (Pam Dawber), who is upset after an argument with her boyfriend, and offers assistance. Because of his odd garb, she mistakes him for a priest and is taken in by his willingness to listen (in fact, simply observing her behavior). When Mindy notices his backward suit and unconventional behavior, she asks who he really is, and he innocently tells her the truth. She promises to keep his identity a secret and allows him to move into her attic. Mindy&#x27;s father, Fred (Conrad Janis), objects to his daughter living with a man (particularly one as bizarre as Mork), but Fred&#x27;s mother-in-law and Mindy&#x27;s grandmother, Cora (Elizabeth Kerr), approves of Mork and the living arrangement. Mindy and Cora work at Fred&#x27;s music store, where Cora gives violin lessons to Eugene (Jeffrey Jacquet), a 10-year-old boy who becomes Mork&#x27;s friend. Also seen occasionally are Mindy&#x27;s snooty old high school friend, Susan (Morgan Fairchild), and the possibly insane Exidor (Robert Donner).

Storylines usually center on Mork&#x27;s attempts to understand human behavior and American culture as Mindy helps him to adjust to life on Earth. It usually ends up frustrating Mindy, as Mork can do things only according to Orkan customs. For example, lying to someone or not informing them it will rain is considered a practical joke (called &quot;splinking&quot;) on Ork. At the end of each episode, Mork reports to Orson what he has learned about Earth. These end-of-show summaries allow Mork to humorously comment on social norms.

Mork&#x27;s greeting is &quot;Na-Nu Na-Nu&quot; (pronounced ), with a hand gesture similar to Mr. Spock&#x27;s Vulcan salute from &quot;Star Trek&quot; combined with a handshake. It became a popular catchphrase at the time, as did &quot;Shazbat&quot; (), an Orkan interjection that Mork uses. Mork says &quot;KO&quot; in place of &quot;OK&quot;.

&quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was Robin Williams&#x27;s first major acting role. Scripts were shorter than on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, with notes specifying, &quot;Robin will do something here&quot;, to let Williams improvise. However, his improvisations often had to be replaced with pre-written &quot;ad libs&quot; scripted by a large team, due to Williams&#x27;s true ad libs being unsuitable for a general television audience.

The series was extremely popular in its first season. The Nielsen ratings were very high, ranking at 3, behind &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (at 1) and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (at 2), both on ABC, which was the highest-rated network in the U.S. in 1978. The show gained higher ratings than &quot;Happy Days&quot;, the series that had spawned it, at number 4. However, network management sought to improve the show in several ways. This was done in conjunction with what is known in the industry as counterprogramming, a technique in which a successful show is moved opposite a ratings hit on another network. The show was moved from Thursdays, where it outrated CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Waltons&quot;, to Sundays, where it replaced the canceled sci-fi series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The show then aired against two highly rated shows: NBC&#x27;s anthology series titled &quot;The Sunday Big Event&quot;, and CBS&#x27;s revamped continuation of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, titled &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;.

===Second season===
The second season saw an attempt to seek younger viewers, and premiered a new disco arrangement of the gentle theme tune.

The characters of Fred and Cora were dropped from the regular cast. It was explained that Fred went on tour as a conductor with an orchestra, taking Cora with him. Fred and Cora made return appearances in later episodes. Recurring characters Susan and Eugene made no further appearances after season one, and were never mentioned again.

New cast members were added. Among the new supporting characters were Remo and Jeanie DaVinci (Jay Thomas and Gina Hecht), a brother and sister from New York City who owned a new neighborhood deli where Mork and Mindy now spent a lot of time. Also added as regulars were their grumpy neighbor, Mr. Bickley (who was occasionally seen in the first season, and ironically worked as a verse writer for a greeting-card company), portrayed by Tom Poston, along with Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl), Mindy&#x27;s snooty cousin who ran for city council.

The show&#x27;s main focus was no longer on Mork&#x27;s slapstick attempts to adjust to the new world that he was in, but on the relationship between Mork and Mindy on a romantic level. Also, some of the focus was on Mork trying to find a steady job.

Because of the abrupt changes to the show and time slot, ratings slipped dramatically (dropping to 27th place). The show was quickly moved back to its previous time slot, and efforts were made to return to the core of the series; however, ratings did not recover.

===Third season===
For the third season, Jeanie, Remo and Nelson were retained as regulars, with Jeanie and Remo having opened a restaurant. Nelson was no longer into politics, and wore more casual clothes.

Mindy&#x27;s father and grandmother returned to the series. The show acknowledged this attempt to restore its original premise, with the third season&#x27;s hourlong opener, titled &quot;Putting the Ork Back in Mork&quot;.

Several supporting characters were added to the lineup. Joining were Lola and Stephanie, two children from the day-care center where Mork worked. Also added was Mindy&#x27;s close friend Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak), a lovely young widow on whom Nelson develops a crush. Wilzak lasted one season as a regular.

When these ideas failed to improve ratings, many wilder ideas were tried in an attempt to capitalize on Williams&#x27;s comedic talents. The season ended at number 49 in the ratings.

===Fourth season===
Despite the show&#x27;s steady decline, ABC agreed to a fourth season of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, but executives wanted changes. The show began to include special guest stars this year.

At the beginning of the fourth season, Mork and Mindy got married. Jonathan Winters, one of Williams&#x27;s idols, was brought in as their child, Mearth. Because of the different Orkan physiology, Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. Winters had previously appeared in a Season 3 episode as Dave McConnell (Mindy&#x27;s uncle and Fred&#x27;s brother). It had previously been explained that Orkans aged &quot;backward&quot;, thus explaining Mearth&#x27;s appearance, and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress Louanne Sirota). After four seasons and 95 episodes, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was canceled in summer 1982. The show ended at 60th place at season&#x27;s end.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Mork (portrayed by Robin Williams) – An alien from the planet Ork sent to observe human behavior. Mork mentions many times that Orkan scientists grew him in a test tube.
* Mindy McConnell (portrayed by Pam Dawber) – A female human who finds Mork and teaches him about human behavior. Eventually falls in love, marries Mork and raises an Orkan &quot;child&quot;.
* Fredrick &quot;Fred&quot; McConnell (portrayed by Conrad Janis) – Mindy&#x27;s father, a widower with conservative values. In the first season, Fred owned a music shop with Cora. In the third season, Fred became the conductor of the Boulder Symphony Orchestra.
* Grandma Cora Hudson (portrayed by Elizabeth Kerr) – Mindy&#x27;s less-conservative, rock-loving grandmother and Fred&#x27;s mother-in-law.
* Franklin Delano Bickley (portrayed by Tom Poston) – Mindy&#x27;s downstairs neighbor. He has a job involving writing greeting cards. At first, Franklin is a total grump and always complains about noise. In time however, he warms up and becomes a friend to Mork and Mindy and the gang.
* Mearth (portrayed by Jonathan Winters) – The &quot;child&quot; of Mork and Mindy and godson of Orson. Because of Orkan physiology, Orkans age backwards starting with elderly adult bodies, but with the mind of a child and regressing to feeble &quot;old&quot; kids.
* Remo DaVinci (portrayed by Jay Thomas) – The co-owner of The New York Delicatessen in season 2 and DaVinci&#x27;s Restaurant in season 3. The character was dropped after season 3.
* Jeanie DaVinci (portrayed by Gina Hecht) – The sister of Remo DaVinci and co-owner of The New York Delicatessen in season 2, and DaVinci&#x27;s Restaurant in season 3. The character was dropped after season 3.
* Nelson Flavor (portrayed by Jim Staahl) – The strait-laced, driven, yet aloof cousin of Mindy with dreams of political power. The character is dropped after season 3.
* Glenda Faye Comstock (portrayed by Crissy Wilzak) – Mindy&#x27;s friend and recent widow who becomes the love interest of Nelson, seen only in Season 3.
* Orson (voiced by Ralph James) – Mork&#x27;s mostly unseen and long-suffering superior who has sent Mork to Earth to get him off-world because humor is not permitted on Ork. Although often perplexed and exasperated with Mork&#x27;s light-hearted demeanor and casual humorous views regarding his mission and life in general, Orson maintains at least a grudging respect for Mork, is patient and thoughtfully curious when receiving Mork&#x27;s weekly reports, and generally allows Mork the freedom to do as he pleases while gathering information on Earth.

===Recurring characters===
* Eugene (portrayed by Jeffrey Jacquet) – A ten-year-old boy who takes violin lessons from Cora, and befriends Mork in Season 1. He and Mork invariably go through elaborate incantations and pantomime when greeting each other, and Mork occasionally consults Eugene regarding social matters; Eugene is always more than willing to assist, although he often feels a bit awkward advising someone so much taller and older than himself.
* Arnold Wanker (portrayed by Logan Ramsey) – The landlord of Fred and Cora&#x27;s music store in Season 1. He dies in Fred&#x27;s music store, but Mork, misinterpreting the comments made to his wife, brings him back to life (a &quot;one-in-a-billion&quot; chance).
* Susan Taylor (portrayed by Morgan Fairchild) – Mindy&#x27;s snooty ex-friend from high school who was seen only in Season 1. In the episode &quot;Mork&#x27;s First Christmas&quot;, a glimpse was shown into why Susan is such a shallow person.
* Exidor (portrayed by Robert Donner) – An odd man (with possible mental illness) who regards himself as a prophet. He often appears wearing a flowing white robe with a brown sash. He recognizes Mork as an alien, but nobody believes him. As the leader of a cult called &quot;The Friends of Venus&quot;, of which he was the only member, Exidor regularly engaged in conversations with imaginary members of his cult (such as &quot;Pepe&quot; and &quot;Rocco&quot;), but was the only person who could see them. Although his behavior is usually wild and absurdly eccentric, he is shown to have a strongly caring and compassionate side; he frequently makes noisy and vigorous attempts to cure maladies or correct wrongdoings (which often turn out to be either imaginary or laughably minor), and he always immediately rushes to Mork&#x27;s aid (&quot;I got here just as soon as I heard, Mork!&quot;) when requested, although his well-meaning efforts to assist Mork seldom produce any actual results. Most times, Exidor is found yelling at his imaginary cult. He makes the comment, &quot;Entourages can be the pits!&quot;. When the Venusians abandon him, Exidor begins to worship O.J. Simpson when Mork encounters him at the Boulder Police Station. He also had a plan to become &quot;Emperor of the Universe&quot; by becoming a rock star; his musical instrument of choice was the accordion. Exidor appears to be something of a squatter, for on at least two occasions, he is present in homes not his own. One time, Mork visits Exidor at a very nice apartment where he supposedly lived with his imaginary girlfriend and her twin sister. Another time, he is &quot;on vacation&quot; in Mindy&#x27;s family home, where he apparently believed there was a beach in the living room closet. Exidor eventually gets married, in a &quot;forest&quot; (Mindy&#x27;s attic). Mindy thought his wife would be imaginary, but she turns out to be a real woman named Ambrosia. Exidor became highly popular with audiences, and prompted wild applause from the studio audience when entering a scene.
* Mr. Miles Sternhagen (portrayed by Foster Brooks) – Mindy&#x27;s boss when she gets a job at a local TV station. He is overbearing and demanding of Mindy when sober, but occasionally turns up drunk and cheerful (per Brooks&#x27;s famous &quot;drunk&quot; act).
* Todd Norman &quot;TNT&quot; Taylor (portrayed by Bill Kirchenbauer) – An obnoxious and arrogant womanizer. He later teaches Mork to drive at the FastLane Driving School.
* Cathy McConnell (portrayed by Shelley Fabares) – Fred&#x27;s new younger wife and Mindy&#x27;s stepmother, seen in Seasons 2–4.
* Lola and Stephanie (portrayed by Amy Tenowich and Stephanie Kayano) – Two children from the daycare center where Mork works later in the series, during Season 3. Lola is a young philosopher and Stephanie is a chubby girl who loves to eat.
* Billy (portrayed by Corey Feldman) – A daycare-center child who appeared during Season 3. He wants to be like his namesake, Billy the Kid. Mork introduces him to the Orkan hero Squellman the Yellow.
* Bebo (vocal effects provided by an uncredited Gregg Berger) – Mork&#x27;s ball-of-fur pet who spoke Orkan gibberish and was introduced and seen only in Season 3. He was occasionally seen around the house and stood by Mork during his reports to Orson. Although Gregg Berger provided the vocal effects of Bebo in the first appearance, the recordings were archived for later use. The credits had Bebo listed as being portrayed by &quot;himself&quot;.

==Connections to other shows==
Actor-director Jerry Paris was inspired to create the character of Mork after directing an episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, titled &quot;It May Look Like a Walnut&quot;, in which Van Dyke&#x27;s Rob Petrie has a dream in which he believes the Earth has been surreptitiously invaded by walnut-eating aliens who steal humans&#x27; thumbs and imaginations. Series creator Carl Reiner had written the episode, which was the 20th in the show&#x27;s second season, and the 50th episode produced. When Paris moved on to direct &quot;Happy Days&quot;, he introduced Mork in a similarly atypical season-five episode, titled &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;. In it, Richie tells everyone that he has seen a flying saucer, but no one believes him. Fonzie tells him that people make up stories about UFOs because their lives are average, or &quot;humdrum&quot;.
While Richie is home alone, Mork walks in. Mork freezes everyone but Richie with his finger, and says he was sent to Earth to find a &quot;humdrum&quot; human to take back to Ork. Richie runs to Fonzie for help. When Mork catches up with him, he freezes everyone, but finds himself unable to freeze Fonzie because of The Fonz&#x27;s powerful will. Mork challenges Fonzie to a duel: finger vs. thumb. After their duel, The Fonz admits defeat, so Mork decides to take Fonzie back to Ork instead of Richie.

Richie wakes up and realizes he was dreaming. There is a knock on the door, and, much to Richie&#x27;s dismay, it is a man who looks exactly like Mork, except in regular clothes, asking for directions.

When production on &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; began, an extra scene was filmed and added to this episode for subsequent reruns. In the scene, Mork explains to Orson that he decided to let Fonzie go, and was going to travel to the year 1978 to continue his mission. In the pilot episode of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, Orson tells Mork that he is assigning him to study the planet Earth. Mork remembers that he has been to Earth before to collect a specimen (Fonzie), and adds that he &quot;had to throw it back, though. Too small.&quot;

Fonzie and Laverne (of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;) appeared in the first episode of the show. In this segment, Mork relays to Mindy his trip to 1950s Milwaukee where Fonzie sets up Mork on a date with Laverne.

Mork returned to &quot;Happy Days&quot; in the episode &quot;Mork Returns&quot;, in which Mork tells Richie that he enjoys coming to the 1950s because life is simpler and more &quot;humdrum&quot; than in the 1970s. Fonzie sees Mork and immediately tries to run away, but Mork freezes him and makes him stay. Mork eventually lets Fonzie go, but not before Fonzie asks Mork to reveal two things about the future: &quot;cars and girls&quot;. Mork&#x27;s response is, &quot;In 1979... both are faster.&quot; The episode is mostly a retrospective in which clips are shown as Richie and Fonzie try to explain the concepts of love and friendship to Mork.

Mork also appears in the first episode of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; episode titled &quot;Random&#x27;s Arrival&quot; as a crossover stunt.

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1, in both individual season sets and a complete series configuration, while the four seasons are available in Regions 2 and 4. The Region 1 DVD of Season 1 was from Paramount alone; subsequent releases in Region 1, as well as international Season 1 releases, have been in conjunction with CBS DVD.

In Australia, only the first three seasons were individually released, followed by a complete series boxset December 17, 2014. In 2020, Via Vision Entertainment obtained the rights to the series, and released a complete series box set December 16, 2020.
==Primetime Emmy Award nominations==
For its first season, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Robin Williams. The program lost to &quot;Taxi&quot;, and Williams lost to Carroll O&#x27;Connor for &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

==Syndication==
&quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was syndicated by Paramount beginning in fall 1982, to low ratings. By 1983, most stations that owned the show rested it in summer, when weaker programming tended to air. Few stations renewed the show a few years later. By 1987, the show aired in only a handful of TV markets. However, the expansion of cable television broadened its reach. Nick at Nite reran the show from March 4, 1991, to November 27, 1995. The show also aired on Fox Family Channel in the late 1990s. From 2008 to 2011, the show aired in marathons on SyFy. It has aired in subsequent years on MeTV, the Hub Network and various other classic television stations airing on various digital subchannels. The show currently airs on Antenna TV and Rewind TV, and streams on Pluto TV.

==Filming locations==

In an interview with Garry Marshall June 30, 2006, Pat O&#x27;Brien mentioned that &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was filmed on Paramount stage 27, the former studio for his infotainment program &quot;The Insider&quot;.

The house from the show is located at 1619 Pine Street, just a few blocks from the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. This was also used in the show as Mindy&#x27;s actual address in Boulder, as shown in the episode &quot;Mork Goes Public&quot;. The same house was used for exterior shots on the series &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, in Episode 21 of Season 5, &quot;This Old House&quot;, in which the show&#x27;s main characters, cousins Larry and Balki, remodel a home for a fix-and-flip with hope of huge profits. It is often mistaken as the house that the cousins moved into with their wives during the final two seasons. In addition, it was used in three episodes of &quot;Family Matters&quot; as Myra&#x27;s house. , the house was valued at $3.1 million, with the date of its last sale as 1974, for US$80,000 ().

==Spin-offs and adaptations==
* In the United Kingdom, a long-running comic strip version was written by Angus P. Allan, illustrated by Bill Titcombe, and printed in children&#x27;s television magazine, &quot;Look-In&quot;. Several British-produced annuals were also released that tied in with the series.
* A subsequent animated series titled &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy/Laverne &amp; Shirley/Fonz Hour&quot; ran on ABC from 1982 to 1983. The &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; segments were a prequel with Mindy as a student in high school. The character of Eugene returned in this spin-off voiced by Shavar Ross.
* In 2005, a made-for-television movie titled &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; aired on NBC. Chris Diamantopoulos portrayed Robin Williams, Erinn Hayes portrayed Pam Dawber and Daniel Roebuck portrayed producer Garry Marshall. The movie depicts Williams&#x27; instant stardom and behind-the-scenes turmoil that the cast and crew would have with the network.
* In 1979, a short-lived Brazilian version of the series appeared as &quot;Superbronco&quot;. It was produced by Rede Globo and starred comedian Ronald Golias and actress Liza Vieira. &quot;Superbronco&quot; had only one season and was canceled despite it being among the ten highest TV audience rated shows in 1979.

<text>Lymantria dispar, also known as the gypsy moth or the spongy moth, is a species of moth in the family Erebidae native to Europe and Asia. &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; is subdivided into several subspecies, with subspecies such as &quot;L. d. dispar&quot; and &quot;L. d. japonica&quot; being clearly identifiable without ambiguity. &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; has been introduced to several continents and is now additionally found as an invasive species in Africa, North America and South America. The polyphagous larvae live on a variety of deciduous and coniferous trees and can cause severe damage in years of mass reproduction. Due to these features, &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; is listed among the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive alien species.

==Etymology==

The etymology of &quot;gypsy moth&quot; is not conclusively known; however, the term is known to have been in use (as &#x27;Gipsey&#x27;) as early as 1832.

Moths of the subfamily Lymantriinae are commonly called tussock moths due to the tussock-like tufts of hair on the caterpillars.

The name &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; is composed of two Latin-derived words. The generic name &quot;Lymantria&quot; means &#x27;destroyer&#x27;. The species epithet &quot;dispar&quot; means &#x27;to separate&#x27; in Latin; it refers to the sexual dimorphism observed in the male and female imagines.

In July 2021 the Entomological Society of America decided to remove the name &quot;gypsy moth&quot; from its Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms List as &quot;hurtful to the Romani people&quot;, since &quot;gypsy&quot; is considered an ethnic slur by some Romany people in North America. In January 2022, the new common name &quot;spongy moth&quot; was proposed, as a translation from the French name &quot;spongieuse&quot; for the species, referring to the sponge-like egg masses laid by &quot;L. dispar&quot;. Since the name Gypsy is widely embraced by Roma people as a self-referenced demonym in Europe, there has been no similar call to change the insect&#x27;s name in its native area.

==Taxonomy==
The European native, and introduced North American, &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; moths are considered to be the same subspecies, &quot;Lymantria dispar dispar&quot;. Confusion over the classification of species and subspecies exists. The U. S. Department of Agriculture defines the Asian subspecies as &quot;any biotype of &quot;L. dispar&quot; possessing female flight capability&quot;, despite &quot;L. d. asiatica&quot; not being the only accepted subspecies that is capable of flight. Traditionally, &quot;L. dispar&quot; has been referred to as &quot;gypsy moth&quot; even when referring to Japanese, Indian and Asiatic populations.

=== Subspecies ===
The European subspecies (&quot;Lymantria dispar dispar&quot;) is native to temperate forests in western Europe. It had been introduced to the United States in 1869, and to Canada in 1912.

The Asian subspecies (&quot;Lymantria dispar asiatica&quot;) is native to temperate Asia east of the Ural mountains. Since the early 1990s it has also been detected along the West Coast of temperate North America. From Southern Europe it is spreading northwards into Germany and other countries, where it hybridizes with the European subspecies, &quot;L. d. dispar&quot;. A colony had been reported from Great Britain in 1995.

==Biological pest control measures==
&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot; was accidentally introduced into North America by artist and astronomer Étienne Léopold Trouvelot in 1869, who imported it from Europe while looking for a source of silk to replace the shortage of cotton caused by the American Civil War. Afterwards, several species of parasitoids and predators have been introduced as biological control agents in attempts to help control this moth. Beginning in the late 1800s, at least ten species were established this way, but for nearly a century, there was little regulation or research on the effectiveness or non-target effects of these introduced natural enemies. Several were generalists that offered little control of &quot;L. dispar&quot; and attacked other native insects. One such species is the tachinid fly &quot;Compsilura concinnata&quot;, which attacked many other host species (over 180 known hosts documented), decimating many of the large moth species previously abundant in the Northeast. Another is the encyrtid wasp &quot;Ooencyrtus kuvanae&quot; which attacks &quot;L. dispar&quot; eggs but is not strictly host specific, and also parasitizes the eggs of other Lepidoptera species. The most effective control agents are microbial pathogens: a virus (LdmNPV), and a fungus (&quot;Entomophaga maimaiga&quot;).

===Current status in the USA===
In June 2024, the severity of the outbreak in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States was reported by Scientific American. Some places in these regions were experiencing one of the most severe outbreaks ever recorded, with some areas reporting densities exceeding 2,500,000 caterpillars per hectare (1,000,000 per acre), and certain regions have been grappling with this issue for five consecutive years.

Since the introduction of the species to North America, &quot;L. dispar&quot; has caused significant ecological damage. Over the past century, its range has expanded at an average rate of per year, resulting in the cumulative defoliation of of forest between 1970 and 2013. The U.S. Forest Service allocates an average annual budget of $30 million toward control efforts. However, climate change has contributed to the prolongation of outbreak cycles, which typically occur every eight to twelve years. This has led to a more frequent and severe impact on the environment.

Defoliation by &quot;L. dispar&quot; triggers chemical defenses in quaking aspen, rendering them unfit host trees for Polyphemus moths, posing an additional threat to their conservation.

<text>Samuel Shepard Rogers III (November 5, 1943 – July 27, 2017) was an American playwright, actor, director, screenwriter, and author whose career spanned half a century. He wrote 58 plays as well as several books of short stories, essays, and memoirs. He won 10 Obie Awards for writing and directing, the most by any writer or director. Shepard received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play &quot;Buried Child&quot; and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pilot Chuck Yeager in the 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. He received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award as a master American dramatist in 2009. &quot;New York&quot; magazine described Shepard as &quot;the greatest American playwright of his generation.&quot;

Shepard&#x27;s plays are known for their bleak, poetic, surrealist elements, black comedy, and rootless characters living on the outskirts of American society. His style evolved from the absurdism of his early off-off-Broadway work to the realism of later plays like &quot;Buried Child&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Starving Class&quot;.

==Early life==
Sam Shepard was born on November 5, 1943, in the Chicago suburb of Fort Sheridan, Illinois. He was named Samuel Shepard Rogers III after his father, Samuel Shepard Rogers Jr. (1917–1984), but was called Steve Rogers. 

His father was a teacher and farmer who served in the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber pilot during World War II. Shepard characterized his father as &quot;a drinking man, a dedicated alcoholic&quot;. His mother, Jane Elaine (née Schook; 1917–1994), was a teacher and a native of Chicago.

Shepard grew up in southern California. He worked on a ranch as a teenager. After graduating from Duarte High School in Duarte, California, in 1961, he briefly studied animal husbandry at nearby Mt. San Antonio College. While at college, Shepard became enamored of Samuel Beckett, jazz, and abstract expressionism. He dropped out to join the Bishop&#x27;s Company, a touring repertory group.

==Career==

===Writing===

Shepard moved to New York City in 1963 and found work as a busboy at the Village Gate nightclub. The following year, the Village Gate&#x27;s head waiter, Ralph Cook, founded the experimental stage company Theater Genesis, housed at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery in Manhattan. Two of Shepard&#x27;s earliest one-act plays, &quot;The Rock Garden&quot; and &quot;Cowboys&quot;, debuted at Theater Genesis in October 1964. It was around this time that he adopted the professional name Sam Shepard.

In 1965, Shepard&#x27;s one-act plays &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;The Rocking Chair&quot; were produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. These were the first of many productions of Shepard&#x27;s work at La MaMa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In 1967, Tom O&#x27;Horgan directed Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Melodrama Play&quot; alongside Leonard Melfi&#x27;s &quot;Times Square&quot; and Rochelle Owens&#x27; &quot;Futz&quot; at La MaMa. In 1969, Jeff Bleckner directed Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;The Unseen Hand&quot; at La MaMa. Bleckner then directed &quot;The Unseen Hand&quot; alongside &quot;Forensic and the Navigators&quot; at the nearby Astor Place Theatre in 1970.

Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;Shaved Splits&quot; was directed at La MaMa in 1970 by Bill Hart. Seth Allen directed &quot;Melodrama Play&quot; at La MaMa the following year. In 1981, Tony Barsha directed &quot;The Unseen Hand&quot; at La MaMa. The production then transferred to the Provincetown Playhouse and ran for over 100 performances. Syracuse Stage co-produced &quot;The Tooth of Crime&quot; at La MaMa in 1983. Also in 1983, the Overtone Theatre and New Writers at the Westside co-produced Shepard&#x27;s plays &quot;Superstitions&quot; and &quot;The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill on the Eve of Killing His Wife&quot; at La MaMa. John Densmore performed in his own play &quot;Skins&quot; and Shepard and Joseph Chaikin&#x27;s play &quot;Tongues&quot;, directed as a double bill by Tony Abatemarco, at La MaMa in 1984. Nicholas Swyrydenko directed a production of &quot;Geography of a Horse Dreamer&quot; at La MaMa in 1985.

Several of Shepard&#x27;s early plays, including &quot;Red Cross&quot; (1966) and &quot;La Turista&quot; (1967), were directed by Jacques Levy. A patron of the Chelsea Hotel scene, he also contributed to Kenneth Tynan&#x27;s &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; (1969) and drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with the band The Holy Modal Rounders, appearing on their albums &quot;Indian War Whoop&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Moray Eels Eat The Holy Modal Rounders&quot; (1968). After winning six Obie Awards between 1966 and 1968, Shepard emerged as a screenwriter with Robert Frank&#x27;s &quot;Me and My Brother&quot; (1968) and Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (1970).

&quot;Cowboy Mouth&quot;, a collaboration with his then-lover Patti Smith, was staged at The American Place Theatre in April 1971, providing early exposure for Smith, who would become a well-known musician. The story and characters in &quot;Cowboy Mouth&quot; were inspired by Shepard and Smith&#x27;s relationship. After opening night, he abandoned the production and fled to New England without a word to anyone involved.

Shortly thereafter, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to London. While in London, he immersed himself in the study of G.I. Gurdjieff&#x27;s Fourth Way, a recurring preoccupation for much of his life. Returning to the United States in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, California, where he raised a young colt named Drum and rode double with his young son on an appaloosa named Cody. Shepard continued to write plays and served for a semester as Regents&#x27; Professor of Drama at the University of California, Davis.

Shepard accompanied Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975 as the screenwriter for &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot; that emerged from the tour. However, because much of the film was improvised, Shepard&#x27;s work was seldom used. &quot;Rolling Thunder Logbook&quot;, his diary of the tour, was published in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute song &quot;Brownsville Girl&quot;, included on Dylan&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Knocked Out Loaded&quot; and on later compilations.

In 1975, Shepard was named playwright-in-residence at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, where he created many of his notable works, including his &quot;Family Trilogy&quot;. One of the plays in the trilogy, &quot;Buried Child&quot; (1978), won the Pulitzer Prize, and was nominated for five Tony Awards. This marked a major turning point in his career, heralding some of his best-known work, including &quot;True West&quot; (1980), &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1983), and &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot; (1985). A comic tale of reunion, in which a young man drops in on his grandfather&#x27;s Illinois farmstead only to be greeted with indifference by his relations, &quot;Buried Child&quot; saw Shepard stake a claim to the psychological terrain of classic American theater. &quot;True West&quot; and &quot;Fool for Love&quot; were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Some critics have expanded the trilogy to a quintet, including &quot;Fool for Love&quot; and &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot;. Shepard won a record-setting ten Obie Awards for writing and directing between 1966 and 1984.

In 2010, &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot; was revived in New York at the same time as Shepard&#x27;s new play &quot;Ages of the Moon&quot; opened there. Reflecting on the two plays, Shepard said that the older play felt &quot;awkward&quot;, adding, &quot;All of the characters are in a fractured place, broken into pieces, and the pieces don&#x27;t really fit together,&quot; while the newer play &quot;is like a Porsche. It&#x27;s sleek, it does exactly what you want it to do, and it can speed up but also shows off great brakes.&quot; The revival and the new play also coincided with the publication of Shepard&#x27;s collection &quot;Day out of Days: Stories&quot;. The book includes &quot;short stories, poems and narrative sketches... that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks [Shepard] carried with him over the years.&quot;

===Acting===
Shepard began his film acting career when cast in a major role as the land baron in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978), opposite Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. This led to other film roles, including that of Cal, Ellen Burstyn&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1980), and, most notably, Shepard&#x27;s portrayal of Chuck Yeager in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983). The latter performance earned Shepard an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. By 1986, &quot;Fool for Love&quot; was adapted by Robert Altman with Shepard in the lead role; &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot; was being performed Off Broadway (with Harvey Keitel and Geraldine Page); and Shepard was working steadily as a film actor. Together, these achievements put him on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Over the years, Shepard taught extensively on playwriting and other aspects of theater. He gave classes and seminars at various theater workshops, festivals, and universities. Shepard was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986, and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 2000, Shepard demonstrated his gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging &quot;The Late Henry Moss&quot; as a benefit for the theater, in San Francisco. The cast included Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, and Cheech Marin. The limited, three-month run was sold out. In 2001, Shepard played General William F. Garrison in the film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. Although he was cast in a supporting role, Shepard enjoyed renewed interest in his talent for screen acting.

Shepard performed Spalding Gray&#x27;s final monologue &quot;Life Interrupted&quot; for the audiobook version, released in 2006. In 2007, Shepard contributed banjo to Patti Smith&#x27;s cover of Nirvana&#x27;s song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on her album &quot;Twelve&quot;. Although many artists had an influence on Shepard&#x27;s work, one of the more significant was Joseph Chaikin, a veteran of The Living Theatre and founder of The Open Theater. The two worked together on various projects, and Shepard has stated that Chaikin was a valuable mentor.

In 2011, Shepard starred in the film &quot;Blackthorn&quot;. His final film appearance is &quot;Never Here&quot;, which premiered in June 2017 but had been filmed in 2014. Shepard also appeared in the television series &quot;Bloodline&quot; from 2014 to 2017.

===Directing===
At the beginning of his career, Shepard did not direct his own plays. His early plays had a number of different directors, but were most frequently directed by Ralph Cook, the founder of Theatre Genesis. Later, while living at the Flying Y Ranch, Shepard formed a successful playwright-director relationship with Robert Woodruff, who directed the premiere of &quot;Buried Child&quot; (1982). During the 1970s, Shepard decided that his vision for his plays required him to direct them himself. He directed many of his own plays from that point onward. With only a few exceptions, he did not direct plays by other playwrights. He also directed two films but reportedly did not see film directing as a major interest.

==Personal life==
When Shepard first arrived in New York City, he roomed with Charlie Mingus III, a friend from Duarte High School and the son of jazz musician Charles Mingus. Shepard then lived with actress Joyce Aaron. 

Between 1967 and 1970 he was part of the New York psychedelic rock group The Holy Modal Rounders as drummer, participating in the recording of two albums of the band Indian War Whoop released in 1967 and The Moray Eels Eat The Holy Modal Rounders in 1968.

From 1969 to 1984, he was married to actress O-Lan Jones, with whom he had one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard (b. 1971). 

From 1970 to 1971, Shepard was involved in an extramarital affair with musician Patti Smith, who remained unaware of his identity as a multiple Obie Award-winning playwright until it was divulged to her by Jackie Curtis. Smith said: &quot;Me and his wife still even liked each other. I mean, it wasn&#x27;t like committing adultery in the suburbs or something.&quot;

Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wrote two songs about her affairs with Shepard during Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue tour of 1975. In &quot;Coyote&quot;, from her eighth studio album &quot;Hejira&quot;, she recounts Shepard&#x27;s seduction of her at a period while he was both married and having an extramarital affair with tour manager Christine O&#x27;Dell with the lines: &quot;He&#x27;s got a woman at home, another woman down the hall, but he seems to want me anyway.&quot; Meanwhile, in &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;, written during the same tour, Mitchell referenced the closeness between their birthdays, calling them &quot;twins of spirit&quot;. 

Shepard met actress Jessica Lange on the set of the 1982 film &quot;Frances&quot;, in which they were both acting. He moved in with her in 1983, and they were together for 27 years; they separated in 2009. They had two children, Hannah Jane Shepard (b. 1986) and Samuel Walker Shepard (b. 1987). In 2003, Shepard&#x27;s elder son, Jesse, wrote a book of short stories, and Shepard appeared with him at a reading at City Lights Bookstore. 

In 2014 and 2015, Shepard dated actress Mia Kirshner.

After a turbulent trip on an airliner returning from Mexico in the 1960s, he apparently vowed never to fly again. Despite this longstanding aversion to flying, Shepard allowed Chuck Yeager to take him up in a jet in 1982 in preparation for playing the pilot in the film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. Shepard cited his fear of flying as a source for a character in his 1966 play &quot;Icarus&#x27;s Mother&quot;. His character went through an airliner crash in the film &quot;Voyager&quot;. 

In the early morning hours of January 3, 2009, Shepard was arrested and charged with speeding and drunk driving in Normal, Illinois. He pleaded guilty to both charges on February 11, 2009, and was sentenced to 24 months probation, alcohol education classes, and 100 hours of community service. On May 25, 2015, Shepard was arrested again in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for aggravated drunk driving. Those charges were later dismissed as having no likelihood of conviction at trial.

His 50-year friendship with Johnny Dark, stepfather to O-Lan Jones, was the subject of the 2013 documentary &quot;Shepard &amp; Dark&quot; by Treva Wurmfeld. A collection of Shepard and Dark&#x27;s correspondence, &quot;Two Prospectors&quot;, was also published that year.

==Death==
Shepard died on July 27, 2017, at his home in Midway, Kentucky, aged 73, from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patti Smith paid homage to their long collaboration in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Fellow actor Matthew McConaughey, who had co-starred with Shepard in &quot;Mud&quot;, learned of Shepard&#x27;s death during a television interview and was shocked by the news, ending the interview saying: &quot;See you in the next one, Sam.&quot;

==Archives==
Sam Shepard&#x27;s papers are split between the Wittliff Collections of Southwestern Writers at Texas State University, comprising 27 boxes (13 linear feet) and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, comprising 30 document boxes (12.6 linear feet).

<doc id="171026" wikidata="Q501995" url="?curid=171026" title="Cape Fear (1991 film)">
<text>Cape Fear is a 1991 American psychological thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a remake of the 1962 film, which was based on the 1957 novel &quot;The Executioners&quot; by John D. MacDonald. The film stars Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Joe Don Baker, and Juliette Lewis. Robert Mitchum has a small role in the film, while Gregory Peck (in his final theatrical film role) and Martin Balsam make cameo appearances, all three having starred in the original film.

The film tells the story of a convicted violent rapist who, by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes, seeks vengeance against a former public defender whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment due to purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.

&quot;Cape Fear&quot; marks the seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro. The film was a commercial success and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for several awards, including the Oscars and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress (Juliette Lewis).

==Plot==

Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Cady, a psychopathic rapist, is released from prison after serving out a sentence for the rape and battery of a 16-year-old girl. During his trial 14 years earlier in Atlanta, his public defender Samuel “Sam” Bowden was so appalled by Cady’s crimes that he hid a report stating that the victim was promiscuous, which might have lightened Cady’s sentence or even acquitted him altogether. Bowden assumed that Cady, who was illiterate at the time of the trial, would never become aware of the report. Cady was ultimately convicted and given the maximum sentence.

Cady tracks down Bowden who is now a private practice attorney living in New Essex, North Carolina, with his wife Leigh and their teenage daughter Danielle (&quot;Danny&quot;). Cady moves to New Essex and quickly makes his presence known to Bowden. He tells Bowden that he learned to read in prison, studied law and attempted several unsuccessful appeals of his case representing himself, implying that he knows about the hidden report. Soon after, he begins to stalk and terrorize the Bowden family. After their dog is mysteriously poisoned, Bowden tries to have Cady arrested, but Police Lieutenant Elgart states that there is no evidence of Cady committing any crime. 

Cady meets Lori Davis, a courthouse clerk who is attracted to Bowden. Cady rapes and nearly beats her to death. Davis refuses to press charges out of fear that her ongoing flirtation with Bowden will become public. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek to follow Cady.

Impersonating her new drama teacher, Cady approaches Danny and kisses her. When Bowden learns of this, he agrees with Kersek to have Cady beaten up to intimidate him and coerce him into leaving town. Before the beating, Bowden gives Cady a final warning to leave him and his family alone and to leave New Essex, threatening physical harm against Cady if the warning is not heeded. Cady uses a hidden tape recorder to capture the threat.

Kersek&#x27;s hired thugs ambush Cady, but Cady manages to fight back and viciously beat them instead. Cady uses his recording of Bowden and exaggerations of his injuries to file for a restraining order against him, which is granted. Cady&#x27;s attorney petitions the ABA Ethics Committee for Bowden&#x27;s disbarment, triggering a two-day emergency meeting in Raleigh.

Thinking that Cady might break into the Bowden home while Bowden is away, Kersek and Bowden fake his departure. They wait to see if Cady will break in at which point they intend to shoot him in self-defense. Cady sneaks in undetected and kills the housekeeper, Graciela. Donning her clothes, he blindsides and kills Kersek before fleeing. After discovering the bodies, the Bowdens flee to their houseboat docked upstate along the Cape Fear River, not knowing that Cady has strapped himself to their car&#x27;s undercarriage and tracks down their houseboat.

While Bowden is on deck and Leigh and Danny are in the cabin, Cady boards the boat and attacks Bowden, choking him unconscious before tying him up. He then severs the rope that was keeping the boat docked, setting it adrift into a violent thunderstorm. He drags Bowden (who has since regained consciousness) into the cabin and prepares to rape Leigh and Danny while forcing Bowden to watch. Danny sets Cady on fire by squirting lighter fluid onto him as he lights a cigar, causing him to jump off the boat to extinguish the flames. Leigh and Danny untie Bowden who attempts to steer the boat back to shore. Cady, however, manages to grab a rope attached to the boat and pulls himself back on board. 

As the boat is rocked by the storm, a badly burned Cady puts Bowden on a mock trial at gunpoint. Beating Bowden and getting him to confess to hiding the report 14 years earlier, Cady scolds him for failing to do his duty as an attorney before sentencing him &quot;to the ninth circle of hell.&quot; The storm knocks Cady off his feet, allowing Bowden to gain the upper hand. As Leigh and Danny jump off the boat and swim to shore, Bowden cuffs Cady to the boat with his own handcuffs. The boat hits a rock and is destroyed, and the storm washes the remains of the boat to shore where Bowden and Cady exchange blows. Bowden, who angrily tells Cady that he intends to kill him, grabs a large rock to bring down on Cady&#x27;s head. Just as he slams down the rock, the current carries the remains of the boat away from the shore with Cady still cuffed to it. As the boat sinks, Cady speaks madly in tongues and sings the hymn &quot;On Jordan&#x27;s Stormy Banks I Stand.&quot; Cady exchanges a final glare with Bowden before being pulled underwater and drowning. Bowden wipes Cady&#x27;s blood from his hands and joins Leigh and Danny on shore. In narration, an adult Danny states that the family was irreparably changed by the experience and never spoke about it again.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film&#x27;s screenplay was adapted by Wesley Strick from the original screenplay by James R. Webb, which was based on the novel &quot;The Executioners&quot; by John D. MacDonald.

Originally developed by Steven Spielberg, he eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Martin Scorsese in exchange for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, which Scorsese had decided not to make. Scorsese agreed to direct &quot;Cape Fear&quot; out of gratitude, as Universal had supported Scorsese during the controversy over &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot;
Although Spielberg stayed on as a producer through his company Amblin Entertainment, he chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.

Although Scorsese had previously worked with Nolte in &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989), he originally envisioned Harrison Ford in the role of Sam Bowden. However, Ford was only interested in playing Max Cady. Nick Nolte, who by contrast was more interested in playing Bowden, convinced Scorsese to cast him instead. Drew Barrymore and Reese Witherspoon both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted Bill Murray to play Cady.

Nolte lost weight for the film while Robert De Niro gained muscle; this ensured that De Niro, who was noticeably shorter than Nolte, still came across as physically threatening on screen.

The work of Alfred Hitchcock was a significant influence on the style of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. As with the 1962 film, where director J. Lee Thompson specifically acknowledged Hitchcock&#x27;s influence and employed Bernard Herrmann to write the score, Scorsese also adopted Hitchcock&#x27;s style, using unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. The opening credits were designed by Saul Bass, a frequent collaborator of Hitchcock, and the link to Hitchcock was further cemented by the reuse of Herrmann&#x27;s original score, albeit reworked by Elmer Bernstein. Portions of Bass&#x27;s title sequences were reused from the unreleased ending to his film &quot;Phase IV&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Cape Fear&quot; collected $10.5 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place at the box office, beating out &quot;Curly Sue&quot;. It would be overtaken by &quot;The Addams Family&quot; a week later, but still made another $10 million while staying ahead of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The film was a box-office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide on a $35-million budget.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 57 reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Smart and stylish, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; is a gleefully mainstream shocker from Martin Scorsese, with a terrifying Robert De Niro performance.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, commenting:

===Awards and honors===
==In popular culture==
The film was parodied in the 1993 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, with Sideshow Bob in the role of Cady stalking Bart Simpson. The episode parodies several scenes from the 1991 film. This parody was itself the basis for Anne Washburn&#x27;s play &quot;Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play&quot;, which imagines post-apocalyptic theatre troupes attempting to recreate the episode, and by extension the two films and the novel.

In the 2003 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;, the Seamus O&#x27;Grady prison introduction scene is a direct reference to Max Cady&#x27;s prison-set intro.

The film was parodied as &quot;Cape Munster&quot; in the premiere episode of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, with Ben Stiller playing an adult Eddie Munster.

The film was the inspiration for professional wrestler Dan Spivey&#x27;s character Waylon Mercy in the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in 1995, and subsequently for professional wrestler Bray Wyatt&#x27;s original The Wyatt Family character in WWE in 2013.

&quot;Seinfeld&quot; also parodied the film with the 1998 episode &quot;The Bookstore&quot;.

==Television adaptation==
On November 21, 2023, a television adaptation was announced, with several networks in a bidding war to air it. Spielberg and Scorsese are signed on as executive producers while the showrunner is Nick Antosca. The series will be released on Apple TV+. On November 18, 2024, it was revealed that Javier Bardem was cast as Max Cady.
On February 11, 2025, it was revealed that Amy Adams was cast as Amanda Bowden. Both Adams and Bardem executive produce the series in addition to starring. On February 25, 2025, Patrick Wilson joined the cast in the series. Wilson’s role has yet to be officially disclosed.

<text>Cape Fear is a 1962 American psychological horror thriller film directed by J. Lee Thompson, from a screenplay by James R. Webb, adapting the 1957 novel &quot;The Executioners&quot; by John D. MacDonald. It stars Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden, an attorney and family man who is stalked by a violent psychopath and ex-con named Max Cady (played by Robert Mitchum), who is bent on revenge for Bowden&#x27;s role in his conviction eight years prior. The film co-stars Polly Bergen and features Lori Martin, Martin Balsam, Jack Kruschen, Telly Savalas, and Barrie Chase in supporting roles.

Produced by Peck&#x27;s company Melville Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film includes several key cast and crew who had previously worked with director Alfred Hitchcock, including editor George Tomasini and composer Bernard Herrmann. J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s direction was also strongly influenced by Hitchcock.

The film was released on June 15, 1962. It received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted Peck and Mitchum&#x27;s performances. A remake of the same name was released in 1991, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro in the lead roles. Peck, Mitchum, and Balsam all appeared as different characters in the remake.

==Plot==
In Southeast Georgia, Max Cady is released from prison after serving an eight-year sentence for rape. He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden, an attorney whom he holds personally responsible for his conviction because Bowden interrupted his attack and testified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden’s family, including his wife, Peggy, and 14-year-old daughter, Nancy. He kills the family dog, though Bowden cannot prove that Cady did it. A friend of Bowden, Police Chief Mark Dutton, attempts to intervene on Bowden&#x27;s behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime.

Bowden hires private detective Charlie Sievers. Cady brutally rapes a young woman, Diane Taylor, when he brings her home, but neither the private detective nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. While Nancy is waiting in a car one day, Cady begins to walk near her, causing her to run and end up almost getting hit by a car. Bowden takes matters into his own hands by hiring three thugs to attack Cady and coerce him to leave town, but the plan backfires when Cady manages to fight back and get the better of all three. Cady&#x27;s attorney vows to have Bowden disbarred.

Fearing for Peggy&#x27;s and Nancy&#x27;s safety, Bowden takes them to their houseboat in the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. In an attempt to trick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to Atlanta. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and he plans to kill Cady to end the battle. On a dark night, Bowden and local deputy Kersek hide in the swamp nearby, but Cady realizes that Kersek is there and drowns him, leaving no evidence of a struggle. Eluding Bowden and setting the houseboat adrift down the current, Cady first attacks Peggy on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her rescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack Nancy. Bowden realizes what has happened, and also swims ashore.

The two men engage in a final fight on the riverbank. Bowden manages to grab his gun, which he had dropped, and shoots Cady, wounding and incapacitating him. Cady tells Bowden, &quot;Finish the job&quot;, but Bowden decides to do the thing that Cady earlier told him would be unbearableput him in prison for the rest of his life, to &quot;count the years, the months, the hours&quot;. In the morning light, the Bowden family are together on a boat, traveling with police back to port.

==Cast==

In addition, Edward Platt, the future &quot;Chief&quot; on the television series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and November 1958 &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate centerfold Joan Staley make brief appearances as a judge and a waitress, respectively.

==Production==
===Development===
Cornel Wilde acquired the rights to John D. MacDonald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Executioners&quot; for $30,000 in 1958. Gregory Peck had his own production company, Melville Productions, in partnership with Sy Bartlett, which had made &quot;The Big Country&quot; and &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; and they later purchased the rights. They planned to make it after &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. Peck was impressed by J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s work on that film and hired him for &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. Peck said his goal was to make &quot;first class professional entertainment intelligently done.&quot; He was responsible for the title of the film, as he found the novel title &quot;kind of a turn-off&quot; and happened to find the Cape Fear region when looking for Atlantic coast locations.

===Casting===
Telly Savalas was screen tested for the role, but later played private eye Charlie Sievers. Robert Mitchum refused to play Max Cady when he was first offered the part, but eventually accepted it after Peck and Thompson delivered him flowers and a case of bourbon.

Thompson wanted Hayley Mills, whom he had cast in &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, to play the daughter, but Mills was unavailable.

Polly Bergen signed in December 1960. It was her first film in eight years.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; began on April 6 and ended in June 1961. Thompson envisioned the film in black and white, believing that shooting the film in color would lessen the atmosphere. As an Alfred Hitchcock fan, he wanted to have Hitchcockian elements in the film, such as unusual lighting angles, an eerie musical score, closeups, and subtle hints rather than graphic depictions of the violence Cady has in mind for the family. Hitchcock collaborators Robert F. Boyle and George Tomasini served as production designer and editor, and his regular composer Bernard Herrmann wrote the score.
The outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Savannah, Georgia; Stockton, California; and the Universal Studios backlot at Universal City, California. The indoor scenes were done at Universal Studios Soundstage. Mitchum had a real-life aversion to Savannah, where as a teenager, he had been charged with vagrancy and put on a chain gang. This resulted in a number of the outdoor scenes being shot at Ladd&#x27;s Marina in Stockton, including the culminating conflict on the houseboat at the end of the movie.

The scene in which Mitchum attacks Polly Bergen&#x27;s character on the houseboat was almost completely improvised. Before the scene was filmed, Thompson suddenly told a crew member: &quot;Bring me a dish of eggs!&quot; Mitchum&#x27;s rubbing the eggs on Bergen was not scripted and Bergen&#x27;s reactions were real. She also suffered back injuries from being knocked around so much. She felt the impact of the &quot;attack&quot; for days. While filming the scene, Mitchum cut open his hand, leading Bergen to recall: &quot;his hand was covered in blood, my back was covered in blood. We just kept going, caught up in the scene. They came over and physically stopped us.&quot;

In the source novel &quot;The Executioners&quot;, by John D. MacDonald, Cady was a soldier court-martialed and convicted on then Lieutenant Bowden&#x27;s testimony for the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl. The censors stepped in, banned the use of the word &quot;rape&quot;, and stated that depicting Cady as a soldier reflected adversely on U.S. military personnel.

===Music===
Bernard Herrmann, as often in his scores, uses a reduced version of the symphony orchestra. Here, other than a 46-piece string section (slightly larger than usual for film scores), he adds four flutes (doubling on two piccolos, two alto flutes in G, and two bass flutes in C) and eight French horns. No use is made of further wind instruments or percussion.

In his 2002 book &quot;A Heart at Fire&#x27;s Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann&quot;, Stephen C. Smith writes:

 &quot;Yet Herrmann was perfect for &quot;Cape Fear&quot; ... Herrmann&#x27;s score reinforces &quot;Cape Fear&#x27;s&quot; savagery. Mainly a synthesis of past devices, its power comes from their imaginative application and another ingenious orchestration ... a rehearsal for his similar orchestration on Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; in 1966. Like similar &#x27;psychological&#x27; Herrmann scores, dissonant string combinations suggest the workings of a killer&#x27;s mind (most startlingly in a queasy device for cello and bass viols as Cadey prepares to attack the prostitute). Hermann&#x27;s prelude searingly establishes the dramatic conflict: descending and ascending chromatic voices move slowly towards each other from their opposite registers, finally crossing–just as Boden and Cadey&#x27;s game of cat-and-mouse will end in deadly confrontation.&quot;
==Release==
===Censorship===
Although the word &quot;rape&quot; was entirely removed from the script before shooting, the film still enraged the censors, who worried that &quot;there was a continuous threat of sexual assault on a child.&quot; To accept the film, British censors required extensive editing and deleting of specific scenes.

After making around 6 minutes of cuts, the film still nearly garnered a British X rating (meaning at the time, &quot;Suitable for those aged 18 and older&quot;, not necessarily meaning there was sexually explicit or violent content). Thompson said he had to make 161 cuts; the censor argued it was fifteen main cuts but admitted they took 5 minutes. The censor said this was primarily because the film involved threat of sexual assault against a child.

===Critical response===
Upon its release, the film received positive but cautious feedback from critics due to the film&#x27;s content. 

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;tough, tight script&quot;, as well as the film&#x27;s &quot;steady and starkly sinister style.&quot; He went on to conclude his review by saying, &quot;this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret.&quot; The entertainment-trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; reviewed the film as &quot;competent and visually polished&quot;, while commenting on Mitchum&#x27;s performance as a &quot;menacing omnipresence.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Cape Fear&quot; was first made available on VHS on March 1, 1992. On May 14, 1992, it was released on laserdisc. It was later re-released on VHS, as well as DVD, on September 18, 2001. The film was released onto Blu-ray on January 8, 2013. It contains production photos and a &quot;making-of&quot; featurette.

== Remake ==
A remake of the same name was released in 1991, attributing both MacDonald&#x27;s novel and Webb&#x27;s 1962 screenplay as source material. Directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Wesley Strick, the film stars Nick Nolte as Bowden, Robert De Niro as Cady, Jessica Lange as Bowden&#x27;s wife (renamed &#x27;Leigh&#x27;) and Juliette Lewis as his daughter (renamed &#x27;Danielle&#x27;).

Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam all make cameo appearances, and Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s original score was adapted and re-orchestrated by Elmer Bernstein.

The film makes several notable changes to the story, namely by changing Sam Bowden to Cady&#x27;s former defense attorney, who secretly and deliberately sabotaged his client&#x27;s case to ensure a conviction. Cady dies during the film&#x27;s climax, after the houseboat sinks. The remake also combines Charlie Sievers and Deputy Kersek into a single character - Claude Kersek (played by Joe Don Baker).

== Legacy ==
Although it makes no acknowledgement of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, the episode &quot;The Force of Evil&quot; from the 1977 NBC television series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; uses virtually the same plot, merely introducing an additional supernatural element to the released prisoner.

The film and its remake serve as the basis for the 1993 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot; in which Sideshow Bob, recently released from prison, stalks the Simpson family in an attempt to kill Bart. The episode, and both films, serve as inspiration for Anne Washburn&#x27;s play &quot;Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play&quot;.

In April 2007, &quot;Newsweek&quot; selected Cady as one of the 10 best villains in cinema history. Specifically, the scene where Cady attacks Sam&#x27;s family was ranked number 36 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; in 2004.

A consumer poll on the Internet Movie Database rates &quot;Cape Fear&quot; as the 65th-best trial film, although the trial scenes are merely incidental to the plot.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – #61
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Max Cady – #28 Villain

<text>Richard Martin Lloyd Walters (born January 14, 1965), better known as Slick Rick, is an English-American rapper and record producer. He rose to prominence as part of Doug E. Fresh &amp; the Get Fresh Crew in the mid-1980s. Their songs &quot;The Show&quot; and &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; are considered early hip hop classics. &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; is one of the most sampled songs in history.

In 1986, Slick Rick became the third artist to sign with Def Jam Recordings. He has released four albums with the label: &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; (1988), &quot;The Ruler&#x27;s Back&quot; (1991), &quot;Behind Bars&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Art of Storytelling&quot; (1999). His music has been sampled and interpolated over 1,000 times, in songs by artists including Eminem, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Beastie Boys, TLC, Nas, Miley Cyrus, Kanye West, MF DOOM, Czarface, Black Star, The Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, MC Ren, Montell Jordan, Tech N9ne, Lloyd, and Color Me Badd. In the process, Slick Rick has become one of the most-sampled hip-hop artists of all time. Many of these songs based on Slick Rick samples went on to become hit singles. He was one of the first hip-hop artists to be covered, when Snoop Dogg (then Snoop Doggy Dogg) rapped Rick&#x27;s lyrics from his record &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; almost in their entirety on the track &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot; on his debut album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in 1993. At the time, it was uncommon for rappers to record covers of each other&#x27;s material.

Slick Rick has been a VH1 &quot;Hip Hop Honors&quot; honoree, and About.com ranked him  12 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time, while &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him No. 15 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.

==Early life==
Walters was born in the South-West London area of Mitcham to Jamaican parents. He was blinded in the right eye by broken glass as an infant. In 1976, at the age of 11 or 12, he and his family immigrated to the United States, settling in the Baychester area of the Bronx. At Fiorello H. Laguardia High School of Music &amp; Art, where he majored in visual art, Rick met Dana Dane. The pair became close friends and formed the Kangol Crew, performing in school contests, parks, and small local clubs.

At a 1984 talent showcase he entered, Rick met Doug E. Fresh. Impressed by Rick&#x27;s talent, Doug made him a member of his Get Fresh Crew (which also included DJs Chill Will and Barry Bee). Doug&#x27;s beatbox and Rick&#x27;s fresh flow turned &quot;The Show&quot;/&quot;La Di Da Di&quot; into international anthems that turned rap music on its head and became the launching pad for &quot;Hip Hop&#x27;s greatest storyteller.&quot;

== Career ==
===Initial fame===
His career began in 1985; Walters first gained success in the rap industry after joining Doug E. Fresh&#x27;s Get Fresh Crew, using the stage name MC Ricky D. He was featured on the single &quot;The Show&quot; and its even more popular B-side, &quot;La Di Da Di&quot;, which featured Walters&#x27; rapping over Doug E. Fresh&#x27;s beatbox. Both tracks gained some mainstream attention, they appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Soul Train&quot; with the Get Fresh Crew. Reflecting on the single in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Roots drummer and &quot;Tonight Show&quot; bandleader Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson said, &quot;Point blank: Slick Rick&#x27;s voice was the most beautiful thing to happen to hip-hop culture [...] Rick is full of punchlines, wit, melody, cool cadence, confidence and style. He is the blueprint.&quot;

In 1986, Slick Rick joined Russell Simmons&#x27;s Rush Artist Management and became the third artist signed to Def Jam Records, the leading rap/hip-hop label at the time. Collaborating with his friend, DJ Vance Wright, Walters produced his solo debut, &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot;, which came out in 1988 on Def Jam. The album was very successful, reaching the No. 1 spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. It also featured four charting singles: &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;Hey Young World&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Love&quot;. The release is known for its storytelling and vocal characterizations. &quot;With the combination of Rick&#x27;s Dick Van Dyke-on-dope accent and his unique narrative style, the record was an instant classic,&quot; wrote critic Matt Weiner. &quot;Each of Rick&#x27;s songs was an amusing, enthralling story that lasted from the first groove to the last.&quot;

===Incarceration and subsequent albums===
In 1989, Walters&#x27; mother, Veronica, hired his first cousin, Mark Plummer, as his bodyguard. By 1990, Plummer had become a liability, having tried numerous times to extort money from the artist. Plummer was fired and, unsatisfied with his severance package, tried to rob Walters on numerous occasions and also threatened to kill the rapper and his mother. When Walters found bullet holes in his front door, he bought guns for protection. On July 3, 1990, Walters spotted Plummer in his neighborhood, and fired at least four shots. One bullet hit Plummer; another caught a passerby in the foot. Neither suffered life-threatening injuries.

He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder and other charges, including assault, use of a firearm, and criminal possession of a weapon. The rapper called it an act of self-defense. He spent five years in prison, two for the then-second-degree attempted-murder charges he received for the shooting, and three for disputes with the Immigration and Naturalization Services over his residency in the U.S. He was released from prison in 1997.

After being bailed out by Russell Simmons, Walters recorded his second album, &quot;The Ruler&#x27;s Back&quot;, released in 1991. Despite peaking at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the album received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as his debut. In the documentary film, &quot;The Show&quot;, Russell Simmons interviewed Walters while he was imprisoned on Rikers Island.

Walters&#x27; third studio album (the fourth for Def Jam) &quot;Behind Bars&quot; was released in 1994, while he was still incarcerated. It was met with lukewarm sales and reviews. &quot;Behind Bars&quot; peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
Walters remained with the Def Jam label, and on May 25, 1999, released a fourth album, &quot;The Art of Storytelling&quot;. &quot;The Art of Storytelling&quot; was a comeback-album that paired him with prolific MCs like Nas, OutKast, Raekwon, and Snoop Dogg. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; announced it as the &quot;triumphant return of rap&#x27;s premier yarn-spinner&quot;, calling the song &quot;2 Way Street&quot; &quot;a much-needed alternative to rap&#x27;s misogynistic slant&quot;. It charted higher than any of Slick Rick&#x27;s prior releases: No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; and No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

After performing on a Caribbean cruise ship in June 2002, Walters was arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as he re-entered the United States through Florida. He was promptly told that he was being deported under a law allowing deportation of foreigners convicted of felonies. Rick was continuously refused bail, but after 17 months in prison he was released on November 7, 2003. In October 2006, the Department of Homeland Security began a new attempt to deport Walters back to the United Kingdom, moving the case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit based in New York to the more conservative Eleventh Circuit. The court is based in Atlanta, Georgia, but the trial was expected to proceed in Florida, where immigration agents originally arrested Walters.

On May 23, 2008, New York Governor David Paterson granted Slick Rick a full and unconditional pardon on the attempted murder charges. The governor was pleased with his behavior since the attempted murders. Slick Rick volunteered his time to mentor kids about violence.

===Later career and life===
Walters married his wife Mandy Aragones in April 1997, four years after the couple met at a Manhattan nightclub. The performer has two children from a previous relationship. He and his wife have donated about a dozen items from his collection to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Slick Rick and the Soul Rebels Brass Band collaborated on June 21, 2012, in Washington, D.C. at the historic Howard Theatre which re-opened in April 2012.

In addition, Rick was a Mixx Cares Humanitarian Award recipient.

On April 15, 2016, Rick was granted U.S. citizenship, remarking, &quot;I am so proud of this moment—and so honored to finally become an American citizen.&quot; He will also retain his UK citizenship.

On November 2, 2018, Rick released the single &quot;Snakes of the World Today&quot;. In 2020, Rick featured on Westside Gunn&#x27;s album &quot;Who Made the Sunshine&quot;. In September 2023, it was announced that Rick is finishing up work on a new solo album, his first since &quot;Art of Storytelling&quot;.

==Honors==

On October 6, 2008, Rick was honored on the VH1 Hip Hop Honors show. In 2018 he was added to the Bronx Walk of Fame. 

==Rapping style==
Slick Rick&#x27;s style is commended by music critics. Music journalist Peter Shapiro wrote, &quot; &#x27;Children&#x27;s Story&#x27; was important because of its narrative structure and Rick&#x27;s understanding of how crucial little sonic details—such as his use of a female voice and his yawning rap—were to hip hop style.&quot;

He is largely known for his story raps, such as &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;La Di Da Di&quot;. Shapiro writes that he &quot;largely introduced the art of narrative into hip hop... none of the spinners of picaresque rhymes who followed did it with the same grace or humor.&quot; AllMusic states that he has the &quot;reputation as hip hop&#x27;s greatest storyteller.&quot; In the book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;, Slick Rick says, &quot;I was never the type to say freestyle raps, I usually tell a story, and to do that well I&#x27;ve always had to work things out beforehand.&quot; Kool Moe Dee comments, &quot;Slick Rick raised the lost art of hip hop storytelling to a level never seen again.&quot; Devin the Dude notes that Slick Rick&#x27;s &quot;Indian Girl&quot; is a good example of the type of humor that existed in hip hop&#x27;s golden era, and Peter Shapiro says that &quot;he was funnier than Rudy Ray Moore or Redd Foxx.&quot;

Slick Rick uses very clear enunciation and retains some English pronunciations, which led Shapiro to say that he raps in the &quot;Queen&#x27;s English&quot;. O.C. states: &quot;&quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; is one of the greatest albums ever... the stuff he was just saying on there, it was so clear.. the [clear] syllable dude was Slick Rick for me&quot;. He is also renowned for his unique &quot;smooth, British-tinged flow&quot; which contains distinct structures. In the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, it is noted that on the song &quot;I Own America&quot;, he &quot;puts a rest on almost every other 1-beat so that each set of two lines begins with a rest.&quot; Kool Moe Dee stated that, &quot;Rick accomplished being totally original at a time when most MCs were using very similar cadences.&quot; He has what is described as &quot;singsong cadences&quot;; Andy Cat of Ugly Duckling mentions that Slick Rick uses a melodic delivery on the track &quot;Hey Young World&quot;. Slick Rick is also known to extensively use punch ins, especially in his story rhymes as different characters; Kool Moe Dee says Rick used &quot;multi-voices to portray multiple characters.&quot;
