<text>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II (September 17, 1825January 23, 1893) was a Confederate soldier, American politician, diplomat, and jurist. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Mississippi in both houses of Congress, served as the United States Secretary of the Interior, and was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He also served as an official in the Confederate States of America.

Born and educated in Georgia, he moved to Oxford, Mississippi, to establish a legal practice. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1856 and served until January 1861, when he helped draft Mississippi&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession. He helped raise the 19th Mississippi Infantry Regiment and worked on the staff of his wife&#x27;s cousin, General James Longstreet. In 1862, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Lamar to the position of Special Confederate Commissioner to Russia. Following the Civil War, Lamar taught at the University of Mississippi and was a delegate to several state constitutional conventions.

Lamar returned to the United States House of Representatives in 1873, becoming the first Mississippi Democrat elected to the House since the end of the Civil War. He remained in the House until 1877, and represented Mississippi in the Senate from 1877 to 1885. He opposed Reconstruction and voting rights for African Americans. In 1885, he accepted appointment as Grover Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior. In 1888, the Senate confirmed Lamar&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, making Lamar the first Southerner appointed to the court since the Civil War. He remained on the court until his death in 1893.

== Family and education ==
Lamar was born on September 17, 1825 in Putnam County, Georgia, near Eatonton, at the family&#x27;s plantation home known as &quot;Fairfield&quot;. His parents were Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar and Sarah Bird; he had five siblings. His paternal grandparents were first cousins. The elder Lamar, a lawyer and state judge in Georgia, suffered from depression and committed suicide when Lamar was nine years old. Contemporary accounts explained the suicide as resulting from either insanity or severe dyspepsia. Several members of Lamar&#x27;s family reached prominence in various levels of government. His uncle, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar, participated in the Texas Revolution and served as the second president of the Republic of Texas. He was a cousin to Associate Justices of the Supreme Court Joseph Rucker Lamar and John A. Campbell and was related to U.S. Representatives Absalom Harris Chappell and William Bailey Lamar.

Lamar was briefly educated in the Milledgeville school system before being enrolled at the Manual Labor School in Covington, Georgia, from 1837 to 1840. The school consolidated with Emory College (now known as Emory University) located in nearby Oxford, Georgia, in 1840, leading to Lamar&#x27;s mother and one of his uncles moving to the town. Lamar was an average student, faring well in subjects he enjoyed and poorly in those he did not. Beyond his studies, he participated in campus debating activities, where he gained experience in public speaking and knowledge of important issues of the time such as slavery. He completed his studies in 1845.

At Emory, Lamar began a relationship with Virginia Longstreet, the daughter of Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, president of the college. The couple married in July 1847, and they had four children: L.Q.C. Lamar III, Virginia, Sarah, and Frances. On December 29, 1884, Virginia died from lung disease that had plagued her since 1880. They were married in the President&#x27;s House at Emory College in Oxford, GA—today the Dean&#x27;s Residence at Oxford College of Emory University.

== Early career ==

===Georgia lawyer and politician===
In 1845, a few months before his twentieth birthday, Lamar moved to Macon, Georgia, where he studied law in his uncle&#x27;s office for two years. He was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1847 in Vienna. Afterwards, Lamar moved back to Covington, where he set up his own legal practice. Using family connections associated with the Longstreet name, Lamar took his first steps into politics when Newton County sent him as a delegate to the state Democratic convention in Milledgeville in 1847 and 1849. When that convention discussed the Wilmot Proviso, Lamar embraced a staunch proslavery position that he never changed throughout the antebellum period.

===Mississippi lawyer, slaveowner and politician===

Lamar moved to Oxford, Mississippi, in 1849 after A.B. Longstreet became president of the University of Mississippi. In June 1850, Lamar received a license to practice law in Mississippi, and in July, he became the university&#x27;s assistant professor of mathematics. In the November, 1850 federal census, Lamar owned 14 slaves near Oxford (almost all women and girls) compared to Longstreet&#x27;s 10 slaves (almost all adults). A decade later, after his brief return to Georgia described below, Lamar owned 31 slaves in Lafayette County, Mississippi, of whom 14 were female and 17 male, including 9 boys and 4 girls under 10.

Lamar&#x27;s political career in Mississippi began in May 1850, when he addressed a Lafayette County convention on the topic of slavery. In March 1851, he helped organize a local branch of the Southern Rights Party in Oxford and soon became its delegate to the statewide party convention in Jackson. Lamar campaigned on behalf of party candidate Jefferson Davis for governor and was the party&#x27;s spokesman in a debate in Oxford with Unionist opponent Henry Foote. Despite Lamar&#x27;s efforts, Foote defeated Davis by 999 votes.

===Return to Georgia as lawyer and legislator===

Homesick and dissatisfied as a politician, in the summer of 1852, Lamar returned to Covington and entered into a legal partnership with a friend. Lamar reentered politics in Georgia by winning a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party in Newton County, which had typically favored Whig candidates. Lamar became chairman of the Committee on the State of the Republic and also served on the Agriculture and Internal Improvements, Judiciary, and Public Printing committees, as well as on two special committees. Throughout the 1853–1854 term, he focused on issues dealing with the Western and Atlantic Railroad, party politics and slavery.

In February 1854, after the legislative term ended, Lamar moved to Macon to open a law office. With support from former congressman A. H. Chappell, Lamar sought the Democratic nomination in 1855 for Georgia&#x27;s 3rd congressional district but failed to gather enough votes at the convention to become his party&#x27;s candidate.

=== Return to Mississippi and Congressman (1857–1860) ===

After losing that Georgia congressional campaign, and facing financial troubles as well as family responsibilities, Lamar left Georgia for the final time and returned to Lafayette County, Mississippi. Along the Tallahatchie River north of Abbeville, Lamar established his &quot;Solitude&quot; cotton plantation that by 1857 had 26 slaves, though the plantation was never fully developed. Lamar also practiced law in nearby Holly Springs with two local prominent lawyers, C. M. Mott and James L. Autrey.
In 1857, Democratic Congressman Daniel Wright decided not to seek reelection in Mississippi&#x27;s 1st congressional district. &quot;The Memphis Daily Appeal&quot; suggested Lamar as a possible candidate under the Democratic ticket, though he faced difficulties due to his prior support of Howell Cobb, a leader of the Union movement. Nevertheless, at this convention, after numerous indecisive ballots, Mississippi Democrats made Lamar their candidate, and Lamar credited his old friend Jacob Thompson for the win. Lamar campaigned against Whig opponent, James Lusk Alcorn by stressing his strong support of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, and won by a comfortable margin, then two years later faced no opponent and thus easily won reelection.

Lamar&#x27;s antebellum congressional career primarily focused on sectionalist issues, especially protecting Southern interests in slavery. Lamar supported the proslavery Lecompton Constitution in Kansas without popular ratification, which was the subject of a debate on the House floor on the morning of February 6, 1858. When a South Carolina congressman attacked a Pennsylvania Republican congressman, a brawl ensued, with Lamar attacking Illinois congressman (and Congregational minister) Owen Lovejoy, who had become a prominent abolitionist after a pro-slavery mob killed his brother. Lamar supported the compromise English Bill created by southerners and President Buchanan. Lamar again defended slavery as an institution verbally in an 1860 speech, during which he argued that not everyone is equal. While Lamar never directly advocated for secession, he mentioned it as possible if the South lost the ability to check the majority abolitionist opinion in the government.

After the victory of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln in the November 1860 presidential election was clear, Lamar left Washington on December 12, 1860, to canvass for a seat in the upcoming Mississippi secession convention. On January 12, 1861, Lamar resigned from Congress, as did all other members of the Mississippi delegation.

== Secession ==

Lamar travelled to Charleston to participate in the 1860 Democratic Convention as an emissary for Jefferson Davis&#x27;s message to focus on defeating northern Democrat Stephen Douglas instead of withdrawing from the convention; however, this appeal had little effect on the Mississippi delegation who had already left the convention hall. He later spoke to a large group of southern sympathizers, denouncing Douglas and stating that the Democratic party had irremediably split. He worked with Davis to convince Mississippi&#x27;s delegates to attend the reconvened national convention in Baltimore. The Mississippi delegates attended, though would later withdraw with other southern delegates because of discontent with the northern Democrat&#x27;s moderate position on slavery; the southern Democrats would instead nominate John C. Breckinridge for the presidency at their own convention. Following the conventions, Lamar accepted a professorship of mental and moral philosophy at the University of Mississippi and planned to retire from Congress at the session&#x27;s end.

With the victory of Abraham Lincoln, Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus convened the state&#x27;s congressional delegation to recommend a policy on secession. While Lamar and Senators Davis and Albert G. Brown favored a moderate approach, urging cooperative secession with other southern states, they were outvoted by the other congressional members; Lamar and the others joined the resolution to make it unanimous. A day after the governor&#x27;s conference, he proposed a plan for the creation of a confederacy at a mass meeting in Brandon, Mississippi, though it attracted little support by other southern leaders.

On January 7, 1861, Mississippi&#x27;s secession convention organized, and Lamar was sent as a delegate from Lafayette County. Lamar swiftly moved to establish a committee to prepare an Ordinance of Secession, and by the next day, he was appointed chairman of it. On January 9, the committee presented the Mississippi Secession Ordinance which Lamar had authored prior to the convention; by a vote of 70 to 29, the document passed. On January 10, Lamar was appointed to the Committee on Southern Confederacy, where he introduced resolutions sympathetic to South Carolina&#x27;s secession and to accept an initiation to meet with other seceding states to form a confederacy. Lamar also worked on a committee to draft a declaration of causes. When the convention reconvened on March 29, 1861, he voted to pass the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States.

==Role in the Confederacy==

During the months preceding the Civil War, he continued teaching students at the University of Mississippi, though by June 1861, the university suspended operations because of too few students. Lamar entered active service as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate army, where he and his law partner C. H. Mott organized the 19th Mississippi Regiment of volunteers in Oxford. The regiment registered to the Confederate War Department on May 14, 1861, and subsequently left for Richmond. Mott was commissioned as a colonel with Lamar as a lieutenant colonel. While in Richmond, Lamar gave a closing address to an event headed by Jefferson Davis, where he proclaimed:&quot;This very night I look forward to the day when this beloved country of ours— for, thank God! we have a country at last— will be a country to live for, to pray for, to fight for, and if necessary, to die for.&quot;

Before his regiment moved to the front, Lamar suffered vertigo, forcing him to return to Oxford to recover in mid-July 1861. He returned to Richmond in November, and once there he acted as an adviser for Davis, in which he assisted him with an attempt to mend relations with General Joseph Johnston. His unit participated in the Battle of Williamsburg, where Mott was killed in action. Lamar assumed control of the regiment and was praised for his leadership. While preparing for another engagement, Lamar suffered a violent seizure, forcing him to quit combat and head to Richmond to recover. At the same time, Lamar was facing personal issues with his younger brother and his cousin dying in combat. Seeking spiritual help, he joined the Methodist Church in July.

Following improvements to his health, on November 19, 1862, he returned to service, with Davis appointing him as a diplomat to the Russian Imperial Government. He reached Europe on March 1, 1863, though he was eventually given advice by Emperor Napoleon III that a mission to Russia would be fruitless. Lamar assisted other confederate officials in France and England, though he failed to convince audiences in either country to recognize the Confederacy. He received a letter from the Secretary of State Judah Benjamin that the Confederate Senate had refused to confirm him as commissioner to Russia. After receiving the letter, Lamar spent several more months in Europe before leaving on November 1, 1863, from Liverpool. He arrived in Richmond in early January 1864. With his return home, Lamar spent much of the last year of the war giving speeches on Davis&#x27; behalf.

On December 3, 1864, he was commissioned as a colonel in the Confederate Army with duty as a judge advocate in Richmond. He acted as an aide to General James Longstreet at the time of the Confederacy&#x27;s surrender in 1865. He was paroled and released after his surrender.

== Post-war period ==

After the war, Lamar returned to Oxford to reunite with his family. The war had claimed two brothers and both of his law partners. Lamar&#x27;s plantation had suffered damage and had its slaves freed; the land was also returned to his father-in-law as he could not maintain payments during the war. Lamar entered into a law partnership with his friend Edward C. Walthall in the Coffeeville hamlet. The successful practice was dissolved following health troubles, leading Lamar to accept a less-demanding professorship position at the University of Mississippi for the fall term of 1866. He taught ethics and metaphysics initially, though by 1867, he was the chair of the law department. He became a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in 1865 and was among the first initiates in that fraternity&#x27;s chapter at the University of Mississippi. He became a director of the Mississippi Central Railroad Company in 1867 and entered into a law partnership with E. D. Clark in Oxford in the fall of 1868. From 1868 to 1872, he provided legal services for the railroad company, but by 1877, he had lost his stake when it was absorbed by the Illinois Central Railroad. In 1870, he resigned from his professorship, fearing radicalization of the university and the possibility of admitting Black students after a new governing board was installed.

Lamar had developed a reputation during the 1870s and 1880s as a leading contributor to the Democratic Party&#x27;s opposition to the predominantly Republican African-American officeholders in Mississippi. Lamar&#x27;s testimony before the 42nd United States Congress&#x27;s Joint Committee to Inquire into the Conditions of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States reveals that he was a passionate defender of the Southern social order and the Ku Klux Klan, a secret society which had developed in response to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments and the events of Reconstruction. On June 21, 1871, several witnesses testified before the committee that Lamar, as a defense attorney in federal court in Oxford, Mississippi, objected to a witness who could identify 27 men appearing on charges for organizing the Klan and terrorizing African Americans, missionary society teachers, and Republican voters. When the witness entered the courtroom, Lamar objected to his presence, then threw a chair at the witness, and the judge, the court and all of its officers, and the United States federal government&quot;, as students of the University of Mississippi cheered from the gallery, then punched a federal marshal who moved to defend the witness. The presiding judge, Samuel J. Gholson, revoked Lamar&#x27;s law license, but only temporarily. He was allowed to continue practicing law after a three-month suspension from the bar.

In 1868, Lamar purchased in Oxford and built a six-room cottage between 1869 and 1870. The house is now known as the L.Q.C. Lamar House Museum and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. The house operates as a museum and the 3-acre grounds as a park.

==Congressional career (1873-1885)==
Lamar returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1873, the first Democrat from Mississippi to be elected to the House since the Civil War. He served there until 1877. Lamar was elected by the state legislature (as was the law at the time) to represent Mississippi in the U.S. Senate from 1877 to 1885. Lamar was a staunch opponent of Reconstruction, and did not consider freedmen and other black Americans fit to vote. He promoted &quot;the supremacy of the unconquered and unconquerable Saxon race.&quot;

==Later career==
=== Secretary of the Interior (1885–1888) ===
With the victory of Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election, Lamar recommended several southerners for his cabinet. Despite the recommendations, Cleveland decided to nominate Lamar for Secretary of the Interior. The two shared similar views on many issues, and Lamar provided geographical balance to Cleveland&#x27;s cabinet. While questions were raised over his involvement in the Confederacy and limited administrative experience, he was confirmed with little difficulty. As part of the first Democratic administration in 24 years, he was beseeched by members of his own party, especially those from the South, seeking political patronage. He engaged these requests, dismissing Republican officials for Democratic ones, though he did so cautiously.

As secretary, he reduced the department&#x27;s fleet of carriages for high officials, as well as opposed efforts to dissolve Indian reservations. He forwarded a new Indian policy, encouraging citizenship and individual land-holding; he endorsed the Dawes Act of 1887. He favored conservationism with public lands to reduce threats of exploitation. He was a staunch defender of the Homestead Act of 1862, as he claimed it prevented mass exploitation of natural resources. Lamar also worked to reclaim over , mostly from railroad corporations.

He served from March 6, 1885, to January 10, 1888.

=== Supreme Court (1888–1893) ===

In May 1887, Republican Justice William B. Woods died while in office, and following the reconvening of Congress, Lamar was nominated by Cleveland on December 12, 1887, without serious competition. Lamar was from the South just like the deceased justice, and he would be the first Southerner nominated to the court since the Civil War. As a result, Lamar&#x27;s nomination &quot;symbolized the road to reconciliation.&quot; The Republican-dominated Senate Judiciary Committee reported against his nomination because of lack of legal experience and old age; he was the second oldest nominee ever at the time. Thanks to the votes of a few western Republicans breaking from party leadership, Lamar was confirmed on January 16, 1888, by a close 32 to 28 vote. He took the judicial oath on January 18, 1888.

Lamar&#x27;s time on the court was spent briefly under the Waite Court, with the rest under the Fuller Court. His service on the court is considered by some as unremarkable, though to others, the quality of his opinions he produced improved as his time on the court went on. Throughout his tenure, he authored 96 opinions, with him issuing 13 dissents from the court; overall, his opinions did not receive much opposition from other members of the court, with generating only four dissents.

== Death and legacy ==
Lamar died on January 23, 1893, in Vineville, Georgia. He was originally interred at Riverside Cemetery in Macon, Georgia, but was reinterred at St. Peter&#x27;s Cemetery in Oxford, Mississippi, in 1894.

Lamar was later featured in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning book, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; (1957), for his eulogy for Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner (R) in 1874, along with his support of the findings of a partisan congressional committee regarding the disputed presidential election of 1876, and for his unpopular vote against the Bland–Allison Act of 1878.

==Memorials and namesakes==

A variety of places have been named in Lamar&#x27;s honor, including three U.S. counties: Lamar County, Alabama; Lamar County, Georgia; and Lamar County, Mississippi. Several communities are named for him, including ones in Arkansas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Colorado, Mississippi, and Missouri. In Oxford, Mississippi, a building on the University of Mississippi&#x27;s campus, Lamar Hall, and the main thoroughfare for the town, Lamar Avenue, are named for him. A road in Memphis is also named for him. The Lamar School in Meridian, MS, a former segregation academy, is named for L.Q.C. Lamar.

The east fork of the Yellowstone River in Yellowstone National Park is called the Lamar River, coined by geologist Arnold Hague during an 1884–85 Geological Survey. Similarly, Lamar Valley, and other park places are named in honor of Lamar as Secretary of the Interior. In Hot Springs National Park, the Lamar Bathhouse is named for him. During World War II, the Liberty Ship was named for him.

Emory University had two named professorships in the School of Law that were named for Lamar. In April 2022, Emory removed Lamar&#x27;s name from the professorships after a review by Emory&#x27;s Committee on Naming Honors recommended that the name be changed due to his staunch defense of slavery.

<text>A hit parade is a ranked list of the most popular recordings at a given point in time, usually determined either by sales or airplay. The term originated in the 1930s; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine published its first music hit parade on January 4, 1936. It has also been used by broadcast programs which featured hit (sheet music and record) tunes such as &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, which aired on radio and television in the United States from 1935 through the 1950s.

<doc id="170316" wikidata="Q2706791" url="?curid=170316" title="CP/M-86">
<text>CP/M-86 is a discontinued version of the CP/M operating system that Digital Research (DR) made for the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088. The system commands are the same as in CP/M-80. Executable files used the relocatable .CMD file format. Digital Research also produced a multi-user multitasking operating system compatible with CP/M-86, MP/M-86, which later evolved into Concurrent CP/M-86. When an emulator was added to provide PC DOS compatibility, the system was renamed Concurrent DOS, which later became Multiuser DOS, of which REAL/32 is the latest incarnation. The FlexOS, DOS Plus, and DR DOS families of operating systems started as derivations of Concurrent DOS as well.

== History ==
Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M-86 was originally announced to be released in November 1979, but was delayed repeatedly. When IBM contacted other companies to obtain components for the IBM PC, the as-yet unreleased CP/M-86 was its first choice for an operating system because CP/M had the most applications at the time. Negotiations between Digital Research and IBM quickly deteriorated over IBM&#x27;s non-disclosure agreement and its insistence on a one-time fee rather than DRI&#x27;s usual royalty licensing plan.
After discussions with Microsoft, IBM decided to use 86-DOS (QDOS), a CP/M-like operating system that Microsoft bought from Seattle Computer Products renaming it MS-DOS. Microsoft adapted it for the PC and licensed it to IBM. It was sold by IBM under the name of PC DOS. After learning about the deal, Digital Research founder Gary Kildall threatened to sue IBM for infringing DRI&#x27;s intellectual property, and IBM agreed to offer CP/M-86 as an alternative operating system on the PC to settle the claim. Most of the BIOS drivers for CP/M-86 for the IBM PC were written by Andy Johnson-Laird.
The IBM PC was announced on 12 August 1981, and the first machines began shipping in October the same year, ahead of schedule. CP/M-86 was one of three operating systems available from IBM, with PC DOS and UCSD p-System. Digital Research&#x27;s adaptation of CP/M-86 for the IBM PC was released six months after PC DOS in spring 1982, and porting applications from CP/M-80 to either operating system was about equally difficult. In November 1981, Digital Research also released a version for the proprietary IBM Displaywriter.

On some dual-processor 8-bit/16-bit computers special versions of CP/M-86 could natively run CP/M-86 and CP/M-80 applications. A version for the DEC Rainbow was named CP/M-86/80, whereas the version for the was named CP/M 8-16 (see also: MP/M 8-16). The version of CP/M-86 for the 8085/8088-based Zenith Z-100 supported running programs for both processors as well.

When PC clones came about, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to other companies as well. Experts found that the two operating systems were technically comparable, with CP/M-86 having better memory management but DOS being faster. &quot;BYTE&quot; speculated that Microsoft reserving multitasking for Xenix &quot;appears to leave a big opening&quot; for Concurrent CP/M-86.

On the IBM PC, however, at per copy for IBM&#x27;s version, CP/M-86 sold poorly compared to the PC DOS; one survey found that 96.3% of IBM PCs were ordered with DOS, compared to 3.4% with CP/M-86 or Concurrent CP/M-86. In mid-1982 Lifeboat Associates, perhaps the largest CP/M software vendor, announced its support for DOS over CP/M-86 on the IBM PC. &quot;BYTE&quot; warned that IBM, Microsoft, and Lifeboat&#x27;s support for DOS &quot;poses a serious threat to&quot; CP/M-86, and Jerry Pournelle stated in the magazine that &quot;it is clear that Digital Research made some terrible mistakes in the marketing&quot;.

By early 1983 DRI began selling CP/M-86 1.1 to end users for . Advertisements called CP/M-86 a &quot;terrific value&quot;, with &quot;instant access to the largest collection of applications software in existence … hundreds of proven, professional software programs for every business and education need&quot;; it also included Graphics System Extension (GSX), formerly . In May 1983 the company announced that it would offer DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities. It stated that &quot;obviously, PC DOS has made great market penetration on the IBM PC; we have to admit that&quot;, but claimed that &quot;the fact that CP/M-86 has not done as well as DRI had hoped has nothing to do with our decision&quot;. By early 1984 DRI gave free copies of Concurrent CP/M-86 to those who purchased two CP/M-86 applications as a limited time offer, and advertisements stated that the applications were self-booting disks, which did not require loading CP/M-86 first. In January 1984, DRI also announced Kanji CP/M-86, a Japanese version of CP/M-86, for nine Japanese companies including Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd., Sord Computer Corp. In December 1984 Fujitsu announced a number of FM-16-based machines using Kanji CP/M-86.

CP/M-86 and DOS had very similar functionality, but were not compatible because the system calls for the same functions and program file formats were different, so two versions of the same software had to be produced and marketed to run under both operating systems. The command interface again had similar functionality but different syntax; where CP/M-86 (and CP/M) copied file codice_1 to codice_2 with the command codice_3, DOS used codice_4.

Initially MS-DOS and CP/M-86 also ran on computers not necessarily hardware-compatible with the IBM PC such as the Apricot and Sirius, the intention being that software would be independent of hardware by making standardised operating system calls to a version of the operating system custom tailored to the particular hardware. However, writers of software which required fast performance accessed the IBM PC hardware directly instead of going through the operating system, resulting in PC-specific software which performed better than other MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions; for example, games would display fast by writing to video memory directly instead of suffering the delay of making a call to the operating system, which would then write to a hardware-dependent memory location. Non-PC-compatible computers were soon replaced by models with hardware which behaved identically to the PC&#x27;s. A consequence of the universal adoption of detailed PC architecture was that no more than 640 kilobytes of memory were supported; early machines running MS-DOS and CP/M-86 did not suffer from this restriction, and some could make use of nearly one megabyte of RAM.

== Reception ==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; wrote that CP/M-86 &quot;in several ways seems better fitted to the PC&quot; than DOS; however, for those who did not plan to program in assembly language, because it cost six times more &quot;CP/M seems a less compelling purchase&quot;. It stated that CP/M-86 was strong in areas where DOS was weak, and vice versa, and that the level of application support for each operating system would be most important, although CP/M-86&#x27;s lack of a run-time version for applications was a weakness.

== Versions ==
A given version of CP/M-86 has two version numbers. One applies to the whole system and is usually displayed at startup; the other applies to the BDOS kernel. Versions known to exist include:

All known Personal CP/M-86 versions contain references to CP/M-86 Plus, suggesting that they are derived from the CP/M-86 Plus codebase.

A number of 16-bit CP/M-86 derivatives existed in the former East-bloc under the names SCP1700 (), CP/K, and K8918-OS. They were produced by the East-German VEB Robotron Dresden and Berlin.

<text>20th Century Studios, Inc., formerly 20th Century Fox, is an American film production and distribution company owned by the Walt Disney Studios, the film studios division of the Disney Entertainment business segment of the Walt Disney Company. It is headquartered at the Fox Studio Lot in the Century City area of Los Angeles, which is leased from Fox Corporation. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the films produced by this studio in theatrical markets.

For over 80 years, 20th Century has been one of the major American film studios. It was formed in 1935 as Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation by the merger of Fox Film Corporation and Twentieth Century Pictures, and one of the original &quot;Big Five&quot; among eight majors of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. In 1985, the studio removed the hyphen in the name (becoming Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) after being acquired by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, which was renamed 21st Century Fox in 2013 after it spun off its publishing assets. Disney purchased most of 21st Century Fox&#x27;s assets, which included 20th Century Fox, on March 20, 2019. The studio adopted its current name on January 17, 2020, in order to avoid confusion with Fox Corporation, and subsequently started to use it for the copyright of 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures productions on December 4. 20th Century is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongside Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and its sister speciality unit, Searchlight Pictures. 20th Century also releases animated films produced by its animation division 20th Century Animation.

The most commercially successful film franchises from 20th Century Studios include the first six &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Ice Age&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, and &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot; Additionally, the studio&#x27;s library includes many individual films such as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, both of which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and became the highest-grossing films of all time during their initial releases.

==History==
=== From founding to 1956 ===


Twentieth Century Pictures&#x27; Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck left United Artists over a stock dispute, and began merger talks with the management of financially struggling Fox Film, under President Sidney Kent.

Spyros Skouras, then manager of the Fox West Coast Theaters, helped make it happen (and later became president of the new company). The company had been struggling since founder William Fox lost control of the company in 1930.

Fox Film Corporation and Twentieth Century Pictures merged in 1935. Initially, it was speculated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the newly merged company would be named &quot;Fox-Twentieth Century&quot;. The new company, Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, began trading on May 31, 1935. Kent remained at the company, joining Schenck and Zanuck. Zanuck replaced Winfield Sheehan as the company&#x27;s production chief.

The company established a special training school. Lynn Bari, Patricia Farr and Anne Nagel were among 14 young women &quot;launched on the trail of film stardom&quot; on August 6, 1935, when they each received a six-month contract with 20th Century-Fox after spending 18 months in the school. The contracts included a studio option for renewal for as long as seven years.

For many years, 20th Century Fox identified themselves as having been founded in 1915, the year Fox Film was founded. For instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary. However, it has considered the 1935 merger as its founding in recent years, even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915. The company&#x27;s films retained the 20th Century Pictures searchlight logo on their opening credits as well as its opening fanfare, but with the name changed to 20th Century-Fox.

After the merger was completed, Zanuck signed young actors to help carry 20th Century-Fox: Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Carmen Miranda, Don Ameche, Henry Fonda, Gene Tierney, Sonja Henie, and Betty Grable. 20th Century-Fox also hired Alice Faye and Shirley Temple, who appeared in several major films for the studio in the 1930s.

Higher attendance during World War II helped 20th Century-Fox overtake RKO and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to become the third most profitable film studio. In 1941, Zanuck was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Signal Corps and assigned to supervise the production of U.S. Army training films. His partner, William Goetz, filled in at 20th Century-Fox.

In 1942, Spyros Skouras succeeded Kent as president of the studio. During the next few years, with pictures like &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946), &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (both 1947), &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948), and &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949), Zanuck established a reputation for provocative, adult films. 20th Century-Fox also specialized in adaptations of best-selling books such as Ben Ames Williams&#x27; &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), starring Gene Tierney, which was the highest-grossing 20th Century-Fox film of the 1940s. The studio also produced film versions of Broadway musicals, including the Rodgers and Hammerstein films, beginning with the musical version of &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945), the only work that the partnership wrote specially for films.

After the war, audiences slowly drifted away. 20th Century-Fox held on to its theaters until a court-mandated &quot;divorce&quot;; they were spun off as Fox National Theaters in 1953. That year, with attendance at half the 1946 level, 20th Century-Fox gambled on an unproven process. Noting that the two film sensations of 1952 had been Cinerama, which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen, and &quot;Natural Vision&quot; 3D, which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses, 20th Century-Fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a French anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses. President Spyros Skouras struck a deal with the inventor Henri Chrétien, leaving the other film studios empty-handed, and in 1953 introduced CinemaScope in the studio&#x27;s groundbreaking feature film &quot;The Robe&quot;.

Zanuck announced in February 1953 that henceforth all 20th Century-Fox pictures would be made in CinemaScope. To convince theater owners to install this new process, 20th Century-Fox agreed to help pay conversion costs (about $25,000 per screen); and to ensure enough product, 20th Century-Fox leased access to CinemaScope to any rival studio choosing to use it. Seeing the box-office for the first two CinemaScope features, &quot;The Robe&quot; and &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (also 1953), Warner Bros., MGM, RKO, Universal-International, Columbia, UA, Allied Artists, and Disney quickly adopted the process. In 1956, 20th Century-Fox engaged Robert Lippert to establish a subsidiary company, Regal Pictures, later Associated Producers Incorporated to film B pictures in CinemaScope (but &quot;branded&quot; RegalScope). 20th Century-Fox produced new musicals using the CinemaScope process including &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot; (both 1956).

CinemaScope brought a brief upturn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide. That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production. Zanuck moved to Paris, setting up as an independent producer, seldom being in the United States for many years.

=== Production and financial problems ===

Zanuck&#x27;s successor, producer Buddy Adler, died a year later. President Spyros Skouras brought in a series of production executives, but none had Zanuck&#x27;s success. By the early 1960s, 20th Century-Fox was in trouble. A new version of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) began production in 1959 with Joan Collins in the lead. As a publicity gimmick, producer Walter Wanger offered $1 million to Elizabeth Taylor if she would star; she accepted and costs for &quot;Cleopatra&quot; began to escalate. Richard Burton&#x27;s on-set romance with Taylor was surrounding the media. However, Skouras&#x27; selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film&#x27;s production did nothing to speed up production on &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.

Meanwhile, another remake—of the Cary Grant hit &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940)—was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep 20th Century-Fox afloat. The romantic comedy entitled &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; paired Marilyn Monroe, 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s most bankable star of the 1950s, with Dean Martin and director George Cukor. The troubled Monroe caused delays daily, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As &quot;Cleopatra&quot;″s budget passed $10 million, eventually costing around $40 million, 20th Century-Fox sold its back lot (now the site of Century City) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise funds. After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress, mostly due to director George Cukor&#x27;s filming methods, in addition to Monroe&#x27;s chronic sinusitis, Monroe was fired from &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; and two months later she was found dead. According to 20th Century-Fox files, she was rehired within weeks for a two-picture deal totaling $1 million, $500,000 to finish &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; (plus a bonus at completion), and another $500,000 for &quot;What a Way to Go&quot;. Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s disruptive reign on the &quot;Cleopatra&quot; set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three 20th Century-Fox executives went to Rome in June 1962 to fire her. They learned that director Joseph L. Mankiewicz had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so 20th Century-Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime during that summer of 1962 Fox released nearly all of its contract stars to offset burgeoning costs, including Jayne Mansfield.

With few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck&#x27;s big-budget war epic &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), an accurate account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s largest shareholder, for whom &quot;The Longest Day&quot; was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years. After it became clear that &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that re-signing her was unavoidable. But days before filming was due to resume, she was found dead at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot;, with Doris Day and James Garner in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit. The unfinished scenes from &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck&#x27;s supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours and was well received.

At the next board meeting, Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor. Zanuck was installed as chairman, and then named his son Richard Zanuck as president. This new management group seized &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and rushed it to completion, shut down the studio, laid off the entire staff to save money, axed the long-running Movietone Newsreel (the archives of which are now owned by Fox News), and made a series of cheap, popular pictures that restored 20th Century-Fox as a major studio. The saving grace for the studio&#x27;s fortunes came from the tremendous success of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), an expensive and handsomely produced film adaptation of the highly acclaimed Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical, which became a significant success at the box office and won five Academy Awards, including Best Director (Robert Wise) and Best Picture of the Year.

20th Century-Fox also had two big science-fiction hits in the decade: &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), and the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), starring Charlton Heston, Kim Hunter, and Roddy McDowall. &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; was the last film made in CinemaScope; the studio had held on to the format while Panavision lenses were being used elsewhere.

Zanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in 20th Century-Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal and replacement by Dennis Stanfill as chairman, and after an uncertain period, new management brought 20th Century-Fox back to health. Under president Gordon T. Stulberg and production head Alan Ladd, Jr., 20th Century-Fox films connected with modern audiences. Board chairman Dennis Stanfill used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, Australian theaters and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.

Foreshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 20th Century-Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), an all-star action blockbuster from producer Irwin Allen. Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios and announced that as 20th Century-Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. Thus the first joint-venture studio deal was struck. In hindsight, while it may be commonplace now, back in the 1970s, it was a risky, but revolutionary, idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world.

20th Century-Fox&#x27;s success reached new heights by backing the most profitable film made up to that time, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film&#x27;s unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after &quot;Star Wars&quot; release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.

=== Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch ===

With financial stability came new owners, when 20th Century-Fox was sold for $720 million on June 8, 1981, to investors Marc Rich and Marvin Davis. 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s assets included Pebble Beach Golf Links, the Aspen Skiing Company and a Century City property upon which Davis built and twice sold Fox Plaza.

In 1982, the company decided to try on capitalizing the video game industry by forming the company&#x27;s first video game division, Fox Video Games, in order to sell cartridges for consoles and computers, under the &quot;Games of the Century&quot; slogan, but the division failed due to the video game crash of 1983.

By 1984, Rich had become a fugitive from justice, having fled to Switzerland after being charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. Rich&#x27;s assets were frozen by U.S. authorities. In 1984 Marvin Davis bought out Marc Rich&#x27;s 50% interest in 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation for an undisclosed amount, reported to be $116 million. Davis sold this interest to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation for $250 million in March 1985. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge&#x27;s Metromedia television stations. Murdoch went ahead alone and bought the stations, and later bought out Davis&#x27; remaining stake in 20th Century-Fox for $325 million. From 1985, the hyphen was permanently deleted from the brand name, with &quot;20th Century-Fox&quot; changing to &quot;20th Century Fox&quot;.

To gain FCC approval of 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s purchase of Metromedia&#x27;s television holdings, once the stations of the long-dissolved DuMont network, Murdoch had to become a U.S. citizen. He did so in 1985, and in 1986 the new Fox Broadcasting Company took to the air. Over the next 20-odd years the network and owned-stations group expanded to become extremely profitable for News Corporation. Then in 1993, 20th Century Fox bought the superhero rights to the X-Men, while the Fantastic Four was bought in 1998. Then Bryan Singer directed the first film and the second film, while Brett Ratner was hired to direct the third film of the original trilogy.

In 1994, 20th Century Fox would establish four new divisions: Fox Searchlight Pictures, Fox Family Films, Fox Animation Studios, and Fox 2000 Pictures. Fox Searchlight would specialize in the specialty and indie film market, with Thomas Rothman, then president of production at The Samuel Goldwyn Company, being brought on to head up the new studio. It was soon given its name with Rothman as its founding president. Fox Family Films was tasked with producing films geared towards families, under John Matoian. Fox Animation Studios was established on August 9, 1994, designed to compete with Walt Disney Feature Animation, whom had found success in the Disney Renaissance. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman of the failing Sullivan Bluth Studios were appointed to head the new $100 million animation studio. Fox 2000 Pictures was formed to specialize in mid-budget-ranging films targeted towards underserved groups of audiences, with Laura Ziskin brought on as president.

In August 1997, Fox&#x27;s Los Angeles-based visual effects company, VIFX, acquired majority interest in Blue Sky Studios to form a new visual effects and animation company, temporarily renamed &quot;Blue Sky/VIFX&quot;. Blue Sky had previously did the character animation of MTV Films&#x27; first film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment. &quot;Following the studio&#x27;s expansion, Blue Sky produced character animation for the films &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, &quot;A Simple Wish&quot;, &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;. VIFX was later sold to another VFX studio Rhythm and Hues Studios in March 1999. According to Blue Sky founder Chris Wedge, Fox considered selling Blue Sky as well by 2000 due to financial difficulties in the visual effects industry in general.

In February 1998, following the success of Fox Animation Studios&#x27; first film &quot;Anastasia&quot;, Fox Family Films changed its name to Fox Animation Studios and dropped its live action production. which would be picked up by other production units. The actual Fox Animation Studios would become a division of the formerly-named Fox Family Films, being referred to as the Phoenix studio. However, Fox Animation Studios in Los Angeles would be renamed to 20th Century Fox Animation between 1998 and 1999. The Phoenix studio would face financial problems, eventually with Fox laying off 300 of the nearly 380 people who worked at the Phoenix studio to &quot;make films more efficiently&quot;. After the box-office failure of &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, Fox Animation Studios would shut down on June 26, 2000. Their last film set to be made would have been an adaptation of Wayne Barlowe&#x27;s illustrated novel &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, and was set to be done entirely with computer animation. Another film they would have made was &quot;The Little Beauty King&quot;, an adult animated film directed by Steve Oedekerk, which would have been a satire of the films from the Disney Renaissance. It would predate &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001).

Chris Wedge, film producer Lori Forte, and Fox Animation executive Chris Meledandri presented Fox with a script for a comedy feature film titled &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Studio management pressured staff to sell their remaining shares and options to Fox on the promise of continued employment on feature-length films. The studio moved to White Plains, New York and started production on &quot;Ice Age&quot;. As the film wrapped, Fox, having little faith in the film, feared that it might bomb at the box office. Fox terminated half of the production staff and tried unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the film and the studio. Instead, &quot;Ice Age&quot; was released by Fox in conjunction with 20th Century Fox Animation on March 15, 2002, to critical and commercial success, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003. &quot;Ice Age&quot; would spawn a franchise and bolster Blue Sky into producing feature films and becoming a in feature animation.
From 2000 to 2010, 20th Century Fox was the international distributor for MGM/UA releases. In the 1980s, 20th Century Fox – through a joint venture with CBS called CBS/Fox Video – had distributed certain UA films on video; thus UA has come full circle by switching to 20th Century Fox for video distribution. 20th Century Fox also makes money distributing films for small independent film companies.

In 2006, 20th Century Fox terminated its production with Bad Hat Harry Productions for 5 years, because Bryan Singer left &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; to direct &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006) for Warner Bros. Pictures, then he returned to produce the first film and direct its sequel in the prequel trilogy, starting in 2011.

In late 2006, Fox Atomic was started up under Fox Searchlight head Peter Rice and COO John Hegeman as a sibling production division under Fox Filmed Entertainment. In early 2008, Atomic&#x27;s marketing unit was transferred to Fox Searchlight and 20th Century Fox, when Hegeman moved to New Regency Productions. Debbie Liebling became president. After two middling successes and falling short with other films, the unit was shut down in April 2009. The remaining films under its Atomic label in production and post-productions were transferred to 20th Century Fox and Fox Spotlight with Liebling overseeing them.

In 2008, 20th Century Fox announced an Asian subsidiary, Fox STAR Studios, a joint venture with STAR TV, also owned by News Corporation. It was reported that Fox STAR would start by producing films for the Bollywood market, then expand to several Asian markets. In the same year, 20th Century Fox started Fox International Productions, but the division was closed in 2017.

Chernin Entertainment was founded by Peter Chernin after he stepped down as president of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s then-parent company News Corporation. in 2009. Chernin Entertainment&#x27;s five-year first-look deal for the film and television was signed with 20th Century Fox and 20th Century Fox TV in 2009.

=== 21st Century Fox era ===
On June 28, 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corporation would be split into two publishing and media-oriented companies: a new News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, which operated the Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox. Murdoch considered the name of the new company a way to maintain the 20th Century Fox heritage.

Fox Stage Productions was formed in June 2013. In August, the same year, 20th Century Fox started a theatrical joint venture with a trio of producers, both film and theater, Kevin McCollum, John Davis and Tom McGrath.

On September 20, 2017, Locksmith Animation formed a multi-year production deal with 20th Century Fox, who would distribute Locksmith&#x27;s films under 20th Century Fox Animation, with Locksmith aiming to release a film every 12–18 months. The deal was to bolster Blue Sky&#x27;s output and replace the loss of distributing DreamWorks Animation films, which are now owned and distributed by Universal Pictures, following NBCUniversal&#x27;s 2016 acquisition. The first film to be released under the production company was &quot;Ron&#x27;s Gone Wrong&quot;, which was released on October 22, 2021, by 20th Century Studios and was the only film to be released by the studio.

Technoprops, a VFX company that worked on &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, was purchased in April 2017 to operate as Fox VFX Lab. Technoprops&#x27; founder Glenn Derry would continue to run the company as vice president of visual effect reporting to Gerard Bevan and John Kilkenny, VFX president.

On October 30, 2017, Vanessa Morrison was named president of a newly created 20th Century Fox division, Fox Family, reporting to the chairman &amp; CEO and Vice Chairman of 20th Century Fox. The family division would develop films that appeal to younger moviegoers and their parents both animated films and films with live-action elements. Also, the division would oversee the studio&#x27;s family animated television business, which produces holiday television specials based on existing film properties, and oversee feature film adaptation of its TV shows. To replace Morrison at Fox Animation, Andrea Miloro and Robert Baird were named co-presidents of 20th Century Fox Animation.

20th Century Fox issued a default notice in regards to its licensing agreement for the under-construction 20th Century Fox World theme park in Malaysia by Genting Malaysia Bhd. In November 2018 Genting Malaysia filed suit in response and included soon to be parent the Walt Disney Company.

=== Disney acquisition and ownership ===

On December 14, 2017, Disney announced plans to purchase most of 21st Century Fox, including 20th Century Fox, for $52.4 billion. After a bid from Comcast (owner of NBCUniversal) for $65 billion, Disney counterbid with $71.3 billion. On July 19, 2018, Comcast dropped out of the bid for 21st Century Fox in favor of Sky plc and Sky UK. Eight days later, Disney and 21st Century Fox shareholders approved the merger between the two companies. Although the deal was completed on March 20, 2019, 20th Century Fox was not planning to relocate to Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, but retained its headquarters at the Fox Studio Lot in the Century City area of Los Angeles, which is currently leased to Disney by 21st Century Fox&#x27;s successor, Fox Corporation, for seven years. Various units were moved out from under 20th Century Fox at acquisition in months after the merger along with several rounds of layoffs. The Fox Research Library was folded into the Walt Disney Archives and Walt Disney Imagineering Archives in January 2020. The last film to use the &quot;20th Century Fox&quot; name was &quot;Underwater&quot;, which was released on January 10, 2020.

After the box office failures of films like &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Stuber,&quot; Disney halted development on several projects, though films such as &quot;Free Guy&quot; and the &quot;Avatar&quot; sequels managed to continue production. Fox&#x27;s slate would be reduced to 10 films per year, half of them being made for the Hulu and then-upcoming Disney+ streaming services. Projects from 20th Century Fox franchises such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot;, and &quot;Ice Age&quot; were later announced for Disney+. These projects would later be fully revealed during Disney&#x27;s Investor Day in December 2020 as feature films for the aforementioned streaming service. The first of these projects was &quot;Home Sweet Home Alone&quot;, which was released on November 12, 2021.

On January 17, 2020, Disney renamed the studio to &quot;20th Century Studios&quot;, which served to help avoid brand confusion with Fox Corporation. Similar to other Disney film units, distribution of 20th Century Studios films is now handled in North America by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and internationally by their sub-division Buena Vista International, while Searchlight Pictures operates their own autonomous distribution and marketing unit. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment distributes the films produced by 20th Century and Searchlight in home media under the 20th Century Home Entertainment label. The first film released by Disney under the studio&#x27;s new name was &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, which was released on February 21, 2020. That same year, &quot;Ford vs. Ferrari&quot; (2019), among its four Academy Award nominations, earned the studio its first Best Picture nomination post-Disney acquisition.

In the same year, held-over production president Emma Watts left the company. On March 12, 2020, Steve Asbell was named president, production of 20th Century Studios, while Morrison was named president, streaming, Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production to oversee live-action development and production of Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios for Disney+.

Randi Hiller will now lead casting as executive VP casting, overseeing both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios. Steuer has served as executive VP of physical production for Walt Disney Studios since 2015, and Hiller has led casting for Walt Disney Studios since 2011. Both will dual-report to Asbell and Sean Bailey.

On September 1, 2020, the Japanese branch of 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Fox Japan, was absorbed into Disney Japan; 20th Century Studios&#x27; previous involvement with Toei Company as the Japanese co-distributor and Asian distributor for &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; films ended and were later taken over by Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures Releasing (via Sony Pictures Releasing International).

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced that Blue Sky Studios was shut down in April 2021, and was succeeded by 20th Century Animation. A spokesperson for the company explained that in light of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic&#x27;s continued economic impact on all of its businesses, it was no longer sustainable for them to run a third feature animation studio. In addition, production on a film adaptation of the webcomic &quot;Nimona&quot;, originally scheduled to be released on January 14, 2022, was cancelled as a result of its closure. The studio&#x27;s film library and intellectual properties are retained by Disney. Although Disney did not give an exact date as to when the studio would be closing down initially, former animator Rick Fournier confirmed on April 10 it was their last day of operation, three days after founder Chris Wedge released a farewell letter on social media. &quot;Nimona&quot; would be picked up by Annapurna Pictures in early 2022 for release on Netflix in 2023.
On November 22, 2021, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and WarnerMedia reached an agreement to allow select 20th Century Studios films be shared between Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max through late 2022. The new agreement negotiated by Gerard Devan and John Gelke is an amendment to the original agreement between 20th Century Fox and HBO that Disney inherited after its acquisition of Fox in 2019, and as such, is not expected to be renewed. Following the end of the 20th Century-HBO deal, Disney plans to retain the 20th Century films on their own streaming platforms going forward after 2022. The first film to this new strategy was &quot;Ron&#x27;s Gone Wrong&quot;. Also in 2021, Disney had launched a video game based-studio 20th Century Games. Similar to its predecessors—FoxNext, Fox Interactive and 20th Century Fox Games—it acts as a distributor and has partnered with other triple-A game studios. Its first title was &quot;&quot;.

On February 8, 2022, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2021 film version of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, among its seven Academy Award nominations, earned 20th Century Studios its first Best Picture nomination post-rebranding.

In March 2023, it was announced that Marvel Comics would be launching a 20th Century Studios imprint, which will release comics based on 20th Century franchises. The first comic under the label would be a &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; comic.

On February 26, 2024, Walt Disney Pictures president Sean Bailey was announced to be stepping down, with Searchlight Pictures president David Greenbaum assuming his position. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century with Steve Asbell as president.

==Television division==

20th Television is the television production division of 20th Century Studios. It was known as 20th Century Fox Television until it adopted the 20th Television name in 2020. The original 20th Television was the studio&#x27;s television syndication division until it was folded into Disney-ABC Domestic Television in 2020.

During the mid-1950s, feature films were released to television in the hope that they would broaden sponsorship and help the distribution of network programs. Blocks of one-hour programming of feature films to national sponsors on 128 stations were organized by 20th Century Fox and National Telefilm Associates. 20th Century Fox received 50% interest in the NTA Film Network after it sold its library to National Telefilm Associates. This gave 90 minutes of cleared time a week and syndicated feature films (under the package title &quot;Premiere Performance&quot;) to 110 non-interconnected stations for sale to national sponsors.

=== Buyout of Four Star ===
Fox bought out the remaining assets of Four Star Television from Ronald Perelman&#x27;s Compact Video in 1996. The majority of Four Star Television&#x27;s library of programs are controlled by 20th Television today. After Murdoch&#x27;s numerous buyouts during the buyout era of the eighties, News Corporation had built up financial debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK), despite the many assets that were held by NewsCorp. The high levels of debt caused Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s.

==Music==

Between 1933 and 1937, a custom record label called &quot;Fox Movietone&quot; was produced starting at F-100 and running through F-136. It featured songs from 20th Century Fox movies, first using material recorded and issued on Victor&#x27;s Bluebird label and halfway through switched to material recorded and issued on ARC&#x27;s dime store labels (Melotone, Perfect, etc.). These scarce records were sold only at Fox Theaters.

The music arm of 20th Century Fox, 20th Century Fox Records, was founded in 1958. It would go defunct in 1981.

Fox Records was the 20th Century Fox&#x27;s music arm since 1992 before being renamed to Fox Music in 2000. It encompasses music publishing and licensing businesses, dealing primarily with Fox Entertainment Group&#x27;s television and film soundtracks under license by Universal Music Group, EMI, PolyGram, Bertelsmann Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group. It would also go defunct on January 17, 2020, and was subsequently folded into Hollywood Records.

===Newman Scoring Stage===
The Newman Scoring Stage, named after composer Alfred Newman, is a large scoring studio located on the Fox Studio Lot, spanning almost 700 square meters, and is one of the largest music recording spaces in the world. It is also equipped with a 96 Channel AMS Neve 88RS-SP mixing console.

== Radio ==
The &quot;Twentieth Century Fox Presents&quot; radio series were broadcast between 1936 and 1942. More often than not, the shows were a radio preview featuring a medley of the songs and soundtracks from the latest movie being released into the theaters, much like the modern-day movie trailers we now see on TV, to encourage folks to head down to their nearest Picture House.

The radio shows featured the original stars, with the announcer narrating a lead-up that encapsulated the performance.

== Motion picture film processing ==
From its earliest ventures into movie production, Fox Film Corporation operated its own processing laboratories. The original lab was located in Fort Lee, New Jersey along with the studios. A lab was included with the new studio built in Los Angeles in 1916. Headed by Alan E. Freedman, the Fort Lee lab was moved into the new Fox Studios building in Manhattan in 1919. In 1932, Freedman bought the labs from Fox for $2,000,000 to bolster what at that time was a failing Fox liquidity. He renamed the operation &quot;DeLuxe Laboratories,&quot; which much later became Deluxe Entertainment Services Group. In the 1940s Freedman sold the labs back to what was then 20th Century Fox and remained as president into the 1960s. Under Freedman&#x27;s leadership, DeLuxe added two more labs in Chicago and Toronto and processed film from studios other than Fox, such as UA and Universal.

==Logo and fanfare==

The 20th Century Fox production logo and fanfare originated as the logo of Twentieth Century Pictures and was adopted by 20th Century-Fox after the merger in 1935. It consists of a stacked block-letter three-dimensional, monolithic logotype (nicknamed &quot;the Monument&quot;) surrounded by Art deco buildings and illuminated by searchlights. In the production logo that appears at the start of films, the searchlights are animated and the sequence is accompanied by a distinctive fanfare that was originally composed in 1933 by Alfred Newman. The original layout of the logo was designed by special effects animator and matte painting artist Emil Kosa Jr.

In 1953, Rocky Longo, an artist at Pacific Title, was hired to recreate the original logo design for the new CinemaScope picture process. Longo tilted the &quot;0&quot; in &quot;20th&quot; to have the logo maintain proportions in the wider CinemaScope format. Alfred Newman also composed an extended version of the logo&#x27;s fanfare to be heard during the CinemaScope logo that would follow after the Fox logo. Although the format had since declined, director George Lucas specifically requested that the CinemaScope version of the fanfare be used for the opening titles of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Additionally, the film&#x27;s main theme was composed by John Williams in the same key as the fanfare (B major), serving as an extension to it of sorts. In 1981, the logo was altered with the re-straightening of the &quot;0&quot; in &quot;20th&quot;.

In 1994, after a few failed attempts, Fox in-house television producer Kevin Burns was hired to produce a new logo for the company, this time using the then-new process of computer-generated imagery (CGI) adding more detail and animation, with the longer 21-second Fox fanfare arranged by Bruce Broughton used as the underscore, and a byline reading &quot;A NEWS CORPORATION COMPANY&quot;. It would later be re-recorded by David Newman in 1997 and again in 1998.

In 2009, an updated logo created by Blue Sky Studios (a prototype version of the 2009 structure exists) debuted with the release of &quot;Avatar&quot;. In 2013, the News Corporation byline was removed.

On September 16, 2014, 20th Century Fox posted a video showcasing all of the various versions of the logo, plus the &quot;William Fox Presents&quot; version of the Fox Film logo and the 20th Century Pictures logo, including some variations, up until the 2009 version of the logo, with the 1998 re-arrangement version of the 1997 version of the fanfare composed by David Newman, to promote the new Fox Movies website.

On January 17, 2020, it was reported that Disney had begun to phase out the &quot;Fox&quot; name from the studio&#x27;s branding as it is no longer tied to the current Fox Corporation, with 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures respectively renamed to 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures. Branding elements associated with the studio, including the searchlights, monolith, and fanfare, will remain in use. The first film that carries the new 20th Century Studios name is &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (coincidentally the original film adaptation was the original Twentieth Century Pictures&#x27; final movie before its merger with Fox Film).
For the 20th Century Studios logo, its print logo debuted on a movie poster of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; while the on-screen logo debuted in a television advertisement for and the full version debuted on February 21, 2020, with the film &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;.

In 2020, 20th Century Studios logo was animated by Picturemill (the prototype version of the 2020 structure and the 2021 structure with the 2009 sky background exists and appeared in some of Picturemill reels), while MOCEAN animated Searchlight Pictures logo, based on Blue Sky Studios&#x27; animation. It features a different sky backdrop, the Los Angeles skyline is larger and more detailed, and the rest of the structure appears darker with more realistic lighting.

<doc id="170320" wikidata="Q2255390" url="?curid=170320" title="Riksdag of the Estates">
<text>Riksdag of the Estates (; informally ) was the name used for the Estates of Sweden when they were assembled. Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the King. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society:

* Nobility
* Clergy
* Burghers
* Peasants

The inclusion of a fourth estate, &quot;Bondeståndet&quot;, is a peculiarity of the Swedish realm, with few parallels in Europe. The English word &quot;peasant&quot; is however an inexact translation, as it did not include the entire peasantry, as it is usually defined in an English context. It did not include unlanded or semi-landed groups such as crofters, lodgers and seasonal labourers and of the three categories of Swedish &quot;bönder&quot;, that is peasants, it included only two. Those were the &quot;skattebönder&quot; (&quot;tax peasants&quot;), yeomen who owned their own land and were taxed, as well as the &quot;kronobönder&quot; (&quot;Crown farmers&quot; or &quot;farmers of the Crown&quot;), who farmed land owned by the Crown. The third group, the &quot;frälsebönder&quot; (&quot;farmers of the nobility/gentry&quot;), who farmed land owned by the nobility, were not represented, as they were considered to be represented by their landowners.

==Important assemblies==
The meeting at Arboga in 1435 is usually considered to be the first Riksdag, but there is no indication that the fourth estate, the farmers, were represented there.

* The actual first meeting is likely the one that took place at Uppsala in 1436 after the death of the rebel leader Engelbrekt.
* At the Riksdag in 1517, regent Sten Sture the Younger and the Privy Council deposed archbishop Gustav Trolle.
* At Västerås in 1527 Lutheranism was adopted as the new state religion instead of Catholicism.
* At Västerås in 1544, an order of royal succession was adopted, abolishing elective monarchy in Sweden.
* At Arboga in 1561, the term &quot;Riksdag&quot; was used for the first time.
* At Söderköping in 1595, duke Charles was elected regent of Sweden instead of king Sigismund, who was a Catholic and the king of both Sweden and Poland.
* In 1612 the Riksdag gave the nobility the privilege and right to hold all higher offices of government, after successful lobbying by the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden Axel Oxenstierna as a reward to this estate in return for their pledge to loyally support the King (Gustavus II Adolfus). 
* The first open conflict between the different estates happened in 1650, when the three lower estates attacked the nobility&#x27;s privileges. Queen Christina used the conflict to overcome opposition to her having named her cousin Carl Gustav as her heir. When she abdicated in 1654, he succeeded her as Carl X Gustav. 
* At the Riksdag in 1680 a large scale reduction (a return of lands to the Crown earlier granted to the nobility) was enacted, and Sweden became an absolute monarchy. The King&#x27;s absolute power was confirmed when the Riksdag of the Estates in 1693 officially proclaimed that the king was the sole ruler of Sweden.
* In 1719, the Riksdag elected Ulrika Eleonora as heir in place of her older sister&#x27;s son, and Ulrika Eleonora accepted a new constitution restoring the powers of the Riksdag.
* In 1771–1772, when Gustavus III after his Revolution of 1772 introduced a new Instrument of Government.
* In 1789, the Riksdag accepted an addition to the instrument of government from 1772. This new law, the Union and Security Act, abolished most noble privileges and commoners, regardless of rank, could hold virtually any office Sweden.
* In 1809, the Riksdag elected Charles XIII king after his nephew Gustav IV Adolf had been deposed, and after the new king had accepted a new constitution that ended Sweden&#x27;s second Autocracy (1789–1809).
* At the sessions in 1634, 1719, 1720, 1772 and 1809 new constitutions were adopted.

== Replaced by the new Riksdag ==
The constitution of 1809 divided the powers of government between the monarch and the Riksdag of the Estates, and after 1866 between the monarch and the new Riksdag. In 1866 all the Estates voted in favor of dissolution and at the same time to constitute a new assembly, &quot;Sveriges Riksdag&quot;. The four former estates were abolished. The House of Nobility () remained as a quasi-official representation of the Swedish nobility until 2003. Although the Nobility remains as a legal entity it is no longer an entity of public law but merely a private association. All Noble privileges have been abolished. However, a number of entailed properties () remain to be commuted (that is, turned into limited liability companies). The modern Centre Party, which grew out of the Swedish farmers&#x27; movement, could be construed as a modern representation with a traditional bond to the Estate of the Farmers.

== Riksdag in Finland ==
Following the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden ceded its eastmost provinces to the Russian Empire. Comprising much of present-day Finland, these became a Grand Duchy under the Emperor, but the political institutions were kept practically intact. The Finnish estates assembled in 1809 at Porvoo to confirm the change in their allegiance. This Diet of Finland followed the forms of the Swedish Riksdag, being the legislative body of the new autonomous region. However, during the reigns of Alexander I and Nicholas I it was not assembled and no new legislation was enacted. The diet was next assembled by tsar Alexander II in 1863, due to the need to modernize the laws. After this the Diet met regularly until 1905, when it passed an act forming a new unicameral parliament. That assembly has been Finland&#x27;s legislative body since then. The Finnish House of Nobility (; ) carries on the tradition of the Estate of Nobility, but no new families have been ennobled since 1906.

<text>Bird feeding is the activity of feeding wild birds, often by means of bird feeders. With a recorded history dating to the 6th century, the feeding of wild birds has been encouraged and celebrated in the United States and United Kingdom, with it being the United States&#x27; second most popular hobby having National Bird-Feeding Month congressionally decreed in 1994. Various types of food are provided by various methods; certain combinations of food and method of feeding are known to attract certain bird species.

The feeding of wild birds has been shown to have possible negative as well as positive effects; while a study in Sheffield, England found that the abundance of garden birds increased with levels of bird feeding, multiple reports suggest that bird feeding may have various negative ecological effects and may be detrimental to the birds being fed, including increased risk of predatory action and malnutrition. It has been estimated that American adults spend approximately US$3.8 billion a year on food, feeders and related accessories.

==History==

The British naturalist James Fisher wrote that the first person recorded as feeding wild birds was the 6th-century monk Saint Serf of Fife who tamed a robin by feeding it.

During the harsh winter of 1890–1891 in the United Kingdom national newspapers asked people to put out food for birds, and in 1910 in the United Kingdom, &quot;Punch&quot; magazine declared that feeding birds had become a national pastime.

Today in the United Kingdom, most people feed year-round, and enough food is provided to support the calorie requirements of the 10 most common garden bird species. Bird feeding has grown into the United States&#x27; second most popular hobby behind gardening. In celebration of the bird feeding hobby, February was named National Bird-Feeding Month by congressional decree in 1994.

== Types ==
Certain foods tend to attract certain birds. Finches and siskin are attracted by niger (&quot;nyger&quot; or &quot;nyjer&quot;), and jays prefer maize. Hummingbirds, sunbirds and other nectivorous birds seek nectar. Mixed seed and black-oil sunflower seed is favoured by many seed-eating species due to its high fat content and thin casing. In Australia, meat, especially raw beef mince (or ground beef), is commonly fed to wild carnivorous birds such as Australian magpies and kookaburras.
 Birds such as white-eyes, barbets, and certain thrushes will consume fresh and cut fruit. Different feeders can be purchased specialized for different species. It is not only small birds that are attracted by bird feeding. In some urban areas of the UK, red kites are fed chicken and table scraps in gardens.

Most common birds can be fed using peanuts, seed, coconut (but never desiccated coconut) or fat (but not oils that are liquid at room temperature) using a variety of feeders.

After a station is established, it can take some weeks for birds to discover and start using it. This is particularly true if the feeding station is the first one in an area or (in cold-winter areas) if the station is being established in spring when natural sources of food are plentiful. Food, particularly unshelled foods, such as thistle seed and suet, left uneaten for too long may spoil. Birds also require a source of drinking water and a birdbath can attract birds as a feeding station.

In North America, suet can be used to attract a variety of birds that may not reliably visit a bird feeder containing seeds. In Texas, all common species of woodpeckers will use a suet feeder year-round. In winter, yellow-rumped and orange-crowned warblers, golden-crowned kinglets and northern flickers could visit. In spring, northern oriole and other warblers may also visit.

== Impact ==

A study conducted in Sheffield, England, found that the abundance of garden birds increased with levels of bird feeding. This effect was only apparent in those species that regularly take supplementary food, raising the possibility that bird feeding was having a direct effect on bird abundance. In contrast, the density of feeding stations had no effect on the number of different bird species present in a neighbourhood.

The use of bird feeders has been claimed to cause environmental problems; some of these were highlighted in a front-page article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Prior to the publication of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Canadian ornithologist Jason Rogers also wrote about the environmental problems associated with the use of bird feeders in the journal &quot;Alberta Naturalist&quot;. In this article, Rogers explains how the practice of feeding wild birds is inherently fraught with negative impacts and risks such as fostering dependency, altering natural distribution, density and migration patterns, interfering with ecological processes, causing malnutrition, facilitating the spread of disease and increasing the risk of death from cats, pesticides, hitting windows and other causes. In the UK, introduced eastern gray squirrels can consume significant volumes of food intended for birds. An experimental study providing supplementary food during the breeding season found that predation levels by corvids and eastern gray squirrels were higher when nests were located in close proximity to filled feeders.

In a paper in the journal &quot;Oecologia&quot;, it was reported that feeding of blue tits and great tits with peanut cake over a long time period significantly reduced brood size. This was driven by smaller clutch sizes in both species and lower hatching success rates for blue tits.
Studies by the University of Freiburg and Environment Canada found that blackcaps migrating to Great Britain from Germany had become adapted to eating food supplied by humans. In contrast blackcaps migrating to Spain had bills adapted to feeding on fruit such as olives.

Providing supplementary food at feeding stations may also change interactions with other species. Aphids and carabid beetles are more likely to be predated by birds near bird feeders.

== Economy ==
Large sums of money are spent by ardent bird feeders, who indulge their wild birds with a variety of bird foods and bird feeders. Over 55 million Americans over the age of 16 feed wild birds and spend more than $3 billion a year on bird food, and $800 million a year on bird feeders, bird baths, bird houses and other bird feeding accessories. The activity has spawned an industry that sells supplies and equipment for the bird feeding hobby.

In some cities or parts of cities (e.g. Trafalgar Square in London) feeding pigeons is activity discouraged by government, either because they compete with vulnerable native species, or because they abound and cause pollution and/or noise.

<doc id="170325" wikidata="Q463999" url="?curid=170325" title="The Cosby Show">
<text>The Cosby Show is an American television sitcom created by (along with Ed. Weinberger and Michael J. Leeson) and starring Bill Cosby that originally aired on NBC from September 20, 1984, to April 30, 1992, with a total of 201 half-hour episodes spanning eight seasons, including an outtakes special. The show focuses on the Huxtables, an upper middle-class Black-American family living in Brooklyn, New York; the series was based on comedy routines in Cosby&#x27;s stand-up comedy act, which in turn were based on his family life. The series was followed by a spin-off, titled &quot;A Different World&quot;, which ran from September 24, 1987 to July 9, 1993, with a total of six seasons consisting of 144 episodes.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; listed the series as &quot;TV&#x27;s biggest hit in the 1980s&quot;, adding it &quot;almost single-handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC&#x27;s ratings fortunes&quot;, while also ranking it 28th on their list of 50 Greatest Shows; with this list, Cliff Huxtable was named as the &quot;Greatest Television Dad&quot; in 2014. In May 1992, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; helped to make possible a larger variety of shows with a predominantly black cast, from &quot;In Living Color&quot; to &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;.

&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; spent five consecutive seasons as the number-one rated show on television and, along with &quot;All in the Family&quot;, is the only sitcom in the history of the Nielsen ratings as the number-one show for five seasons, having spent the series in the top 20 ratings. It also remains the only scripted TV show with a predominantly African-American cast to top the Nielsen ratings, and to do so more than once. Its spinoff, &quot;A Different World&quot;, also became a ratings hit, featuring in the top 5 of the ratings for four of its six seasons. It launched the extended cast into stardom and Cosby, having already had a successful career on TV, films and stand-up, became the highest paid actor on television.

It was also an international hit, garnering a following from across the world being a regular fixture in markets previously considered unattainable for African-American leads, such as Europe, where the show became a ratings and commercial hit and cemented itself as an international icon of 1980s pop culture. Its effects on Black American portrayal and gender politics on television were a major part of its success. The portrayal of Clair Huxtable, the matriarch of the Huxtable family, by Phylicia Rashad sparked an international wave of working mothers on television dubbed the &quot;Clair Huxtable effect&quot;, and Bill Cosby was nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s Dad&quot; for his highly celebrated portrayal of Cliff Huxtable. The colourful sweaters he wore as Cliff became a fashion trend for a time which was temporarily revived in the early 2010s. Another sitcom starring Cosby and Rashad, &quot;Cosby&quot;, aired on CBS from 1996 to 2000, notable for its differences to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, garnering positive reviews. Since 2014, reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; have been pulled from several networks and venues as a result of the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases.

==Premise==
The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle class African-American family, living in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, New York, at 10 Stigwood Avenue. The father is Cliff Huxtable, an obstetrician and son of a prominent jazz trombonist. The mother is his wife, lawyer Clair Huxtable.

They have four daughters and one son: Sondra, Denise, Theo, Vanessa, and Rudy. Despite its comedic tone, the show sometimes involves serious subjects, like Theo&#x27;s experiences dealing with dyslexia, inspired by Cosby&#x27;s dyslexic son, Ennis. and teenage pregnancy when Denise&#x27;s friend Veronica (Lela Rochon) becomes pregnant.

===Episodes===

===Pilot===

&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; pilot episode uses the same title sequence as the rest of the first season, and is widely regarded as the first episode. However, it contains a number of differences from the remainder of the series.

In the pilot, the Huxtables have only four children. Following the pilot, the Huxtables have five children, with the addition of their eldest daughter, Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), who is mentioned in episode four and appears first in episode 11. The character was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child who had graduated from college.

Bill Cosby originally wanted Vanessa Williams to play the part of Sondra due to her college education and background in theater arts. However, Williams had recently been crowned the first Black Miss America and pageant officials would not permit her to play the role while she was representing the Miss America pageant. Whitney Houston was also considered for the role of Denise Huxtable, but was unable to commit to the full-time television production schedule in the NBC contract, as she intended to become a full-time music recording artist.

Most of the story in the pilot presentation is taken from Bill Cosby&#x27;s 1983 comedy film &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot;. Cosby&#x27;s character is called &quot;Clifford&quot; in the early episodes of the first season, but his name was later switched to &quot;Heathcliff&quot;.

Additionally, Vanessa refers to Theo as &quot;Teddy&quot; twice in the dining room scene. The interior of the Huxtables&#x27; home features an entirely different living room from subsequent episodes, and different color schemes in the dining room and the master bedroom. Throughout the remainder of the series, the dining room is reserved for more formal occasions.

==Background and production==

===Conception and development===

In the early 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former executives at ABC, left the network to start their own production company: Carsey-Werner. At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. The two partners decided that to get a sitcom to sell for their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby had performed stand-up comedy with award-winning albums and starred in several genres in TV and film in the 1960s and 70s, but his career had become more static by the early 1980s. According to a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article from July 1985, despite Carsey and Werner&#x27;s connection to the network, Lewis Erlicht, president of ABC Entertainment, passed on the show, prompting a pitch to rival network, NBC.

Outside of his work on his cartoon series &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, Cosby was doing little in film or television, but Carsey and Werner were fans of Cosby&#x27;s stand-up comedy and thought it would be the perfect material for a family sitcom.

Cosby originally proposed that the couple should both have blue-collar jobs, with the father a limousine driver, who owned his own car, and the mother an electrician. With advice from his wife Camille Cosby, though, the concept was changed so that the family was well-off financially, with the mother a lawyer and the father a physician.

Cosby wanted the program to be educational, reflecting his own background in education. He also insisted that the program be taped in New York City instead of Los Angeles, where most television programs were taped. The Huxtable home exterior was filmed at 10 St. Luke&#x27;s Place near 7th Avenue in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village (although in the show, the residence was the fictional &quot;10 Stigwood Avenue&quot;).

===Production notes===

Early episodes were videotaped at NBC&#x27;s Brooklyn studios (subsequently JC Studios). The network later sold that building, and production moved to the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Even though the show was set to take place in Brooklyn, the exterior façade was actually of a brownstone townhouse located in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village at 10 Leroy Street/ 10 St. Luke&#x27;s Place. The pilot was filmed in May 1984, with season one&#x27;s production commencing that July, and the first taping on August 1 (&quot;Goodbye Mr. Goldfish&quot;).

During its original NBC run, it was one of five successful sitcoms on the network that featured predominantly African-American casts. The others were &quot;227&quot; (1985–90), &quot;Amen&quot; (1986–91), &quot;Cosby Show&quot; spin-off &quot;A Different World&quot; (1987–93) and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1990–96).

Although the cast and characters were predominantly African-American, the program was unusual in that issues of race were rarely mentioned when compared to other situation comedies of the time with predominantly African-American casts, such as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. However, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; had African-American themes, such as the Civil rights movement, and it frequently promoted African-American culture and culture of Africa represented by artists and musicians such as Jacob Lawrence, Miles Davis, James Brown, B. B. King, Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis Jr., Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie and Miriam Makeba.

The spin-off, &quot;A Different World&quot;, dealt with racial issues more often. &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;&#x27;s series finale, taped March 6, 1992, aired during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, with Cosby quoted in media at the time pleading for peace.

During the third season, Rashad was pregnant with her daughter Condola. Rather than write this pregnancy in, the producers simply greatly reduced Rashad&#x27;s scenes or filmed in such a way that her pregnancy was not noticeable.

Another main cast member pregnancy, that of Bonet, almost caused the actress to be fired, especially coming in the wake of appearing in the film &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, which contained explicit sexual scenes with actor Mickey Rourke. Cosby strongly disapproved of Bonet&#x27;s role, but allowed her to continue on &quot;World&quot; until returning to &quot;Cosby&quot; after her pregnancy. Tensions remained, however, and Bonet was eventually fired in April 1991.

===Theme song and opening sequence===
The show&#x27;s theme music, &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, was composed by Stu Gardner and Bill Cosby. Seven versions of this theme were used during the run of the series. For season four, the theme song music was performed by musician Bobby McFerrin.

Due to legal complications regarding the background mural, the opening for season seven was filmed on August 17, 1990, at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City, New York was replaced with the one from the previous season. The original season seven opening, with slight modifications, returned to use in the beginning of season eight.

==Cast and characters==


==Reception and legacy==
The show&#x27;s portrayal of a successful, stable black family was praised by some for breaking racial stereotypes and showing another part of the African-American experience. However, it was criticized by others, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., for allowing white audiences to think that racism and poverty were problems of the past. Phylicia Rashad claimed that when she met Nelson Mandela, he told her that he &quot;is eternally grateful for the show and its influence on Apartheid and us Black people. [The inmates in prison] watched the show while in prison.&quot; As a result of the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases, Malcolm-Jamal Warner has stated that the show&#x27;s legacy is &quot;tarnished&quot;.

&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; had generated in television revenue, including from television advertisement, and from syndication.

===Broadcast history and ratings===
&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; aired on Thursdays at 8:00 pm for all eight seasons. In its first season, the show was the beginning of a Thursday NBC schedule that was followed by &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; is one of three television programs (&quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; being the others) that were number one in the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive seasons.

==Syndication==
The Carsey-Werner Company handles domestic distribution, while Paramount Global&#x27;s unit CBS Media Ventures handles international distribution of the series, and has done so since 1997. In the United States, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; began its television syndication run in September 1988 in broadcast syndication, shortly before the show&#x27;s fifth-season premiere, and was at the time distributed by Viacom; many stations that carried the series were Big Three television networks affiliates. As time went on, this moved to lower-profile timeslots, independent station and minor network affiliates.

Fort Worth, Texas–based independent station KTVT carried the series until 1995, when it ceased operating as a regional cable superstation and became an affiliate of CBS. TBS, then a national cable superstation, carried the series for nearly a decade beginning in 1999. Fellow superstation WGN America began carrying the series shortly thereafter, and continued to until September 2010. Viacom&#x27;s Nick at Nite began airing reruns of the series in March 2002, and its sister network TV Land began airing reruns in 2004, making &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; one of the few series that were shown on both Nick at Nite and TV Land at the same time. The series was also available to stream on Hulu.

The French version just called &quot;Cosby Show&quot; aired on M6 in 1988.

In the Italian version of the show, the family name is not Huxtable but Robinson. The whole show is named &quot;I Robinson&quot; (&quot;The Robinsons&quot;) airing on Canale 5 from 1986 until 1993.

=== 2010s removal from syndication ===
Reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; have been pulled from several networks and venues as a result of the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases. In November 2014, TV Land pulled the series from its lineup. &quot;Episodes have been pulled immediately for the foreseeable future ... TV Land even removed references to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; from its website on Wednesday afternoon as the scandal accelerated.&quot; In December 2014, the Magic Johnson–owned network Aspire removed the show from its lineup.

BET&#x27;s Centric (another Viacom unit), along with Bounce TV, ceased airing reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. At the same time, barter syndicator The Program Exchange ceased distributing the show. Bounce TV resumed airing the series in December 2016 but pulled the show on April 26, 2018 — the day Cosby was convicted of sexual assault. TV One began airing reruns of the show in May 2017. It is the only American network to offer the series. The series is available on Amazon Prime Video and Philo.

==Spin-off==

&quot;The Cosby Show&quot;″s producers created a spin-off series called &quot;A Different World&quot; that was built around the &quot;Denise&quot; character (portrayed by actress Lisa Bonet), the second of the Huxtables&#x27; four daughters. Initially, the new program dealt with Denise&#x27;s life at Hillman College, the fictional historically black college from which her father, mother, and paternal grandfather had graduated.

Denise was written out of &quot;A Different World&quot; after its inaugural season, due to Bonet&#x27;s pregnancy, and the following season was revamped, with the addition of director Debbie Allen (Phylicia Rashad&#x27;s sister) and new characters. Denise later became a recurring character on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; for seasons four and five, and a regular again in seasons six and seven.

==Albums==
Two albums were produced that included various theme and background music from the show. The albums were presented by longtime Cosby collaborator Stu Gardner. They were:

* &quot;A House Full of Love: Music from The Cosby Show&quot; (1986)
* &quot;Total Happiness (Music from the Bill Cosby Show, Vol. II)&quot; (1987)

==In popular culture==
* During the series&#x27; run, the character of Cliff Huxtable frequently wore an array of knit sweaters that were often brightly colored and featured abstract, asymmetrical patterns or themes. The sweaters were erroneously thought to be designed by the Australian clothing company Coogi, but were actually designed by Dutchman Koos Van Den Akker.
** They were dubbed &quot;Cosby sweaters&quot;, a term that is used to describe sweaters that are generally deemed garish and unappealing. In May 2008, Cosby&#x27;s daughter Evin auctioned a batch of the sweaters that her father had kept on eBay. The proceeds of the sales went to the Hello Friend/Ennis William Cosby Foundation, a non-profit charity named for Ennis Cosby. Ennis, Cosby&#x27;s only son, was murdered in January 1997.
* The character of Dr. Hibbert, who is featured on the long-running animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, is modeled after Dr. Cliff Huxtable. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writing staff decided to make Dr. Hibbert a parody of Cliff Huxtable after the Fox network moved &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to Thursday nights airing opposite the top-rated &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.
* In the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Oil Drums&quot;, Starfire says &quot;I would like to watch &quot;The Crosby Pudding Half-Hour Show of Sweaters&quot;. Theo, get your glorp-nops off the kitchen table. Rudy!&quot;

==Home media==
All eight seasons of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; have been released on DVD in Region 1. Seasons one and two were released by UrbanWorks which was subsequently acquired by First Look Studios, who then released the remaining six seasons. Seasons One and Two contain special features, including the ninety minute retrospective documentary entitled &quot;The Cosby Show: A Look Back&quot;, which aired on NBC in May 2002.

It contains interviews with cast members, bloopers, deleted scenes and audition footage. In December 2010, First Look Studios filed bankruptcy, and all its assets were subsequently acquired by Millennium Entertainment, who also took over distribution of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; DVD releases. As of 2013, these releases have been discontinued, and are now out of print.

In 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to the series. They subsequently re-released all eight seasons on DVD. On September 1, 2015, Mill Creek released a sixteen disc complete series set entitled &quot;The Cosby Show – The Complete Series&quot;.

In Region 4, Magna Pacific has released all eight seasons on DVD in Australia and New Zealand. The first two seasons have similar artwork to the North American copies, although season two is red rather than blue. Each Australian cover also features the tagline &quot;In a house full of love, there is always room for more&quot;.

Universal Studios Home Entertainment  has released Seasons 1 to 4 in Region 2 (United Kingdom).

Note: The Millennium Entertainment release of season one contains the edited versions of the episodes aired in syndication. However, all subsequent DVD releases (including the complete series set) contain the original, uncut broadcast versions. In 2011, Millennium quietly released season one uncut in Region 1, which featured the special features from &quot;The Complete Series&quot; set.

<text>Universal City Studios LLC, doing business as Universal Pictures (also known as Universal Studios or simply Universal) is an American film production and distribution company headquartered at the Universal Studios complex in Universal City, California, and is the flagship studio of Universal Studios, the film studio arm of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast.

Founded in 1912 by Carl Laemmle, Mark Dintenfass, Charles O. Baumann, Adam Kessel, Pat Powers, William Swanson, David Horsley, Robert H. Cochrane and Jules Brulatour, Universal is the oldest surviving film studio in the United States and the fifth oldest globally after Gaumont, Pathé, Titanus and Nordisk Film, and is one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; film studios.

Universal&#x27;s most commercially successful film franchises include &quot;Fast &amp; Furious, Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Despicable Me&quot;. Additionally, the studio&#x27;s library includes many individual films such as &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, both of which became the highest-grossing films of all time during their initial releases. Universal Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), and was one of the &quot;Little Three&quot; majors during Hollywood&#x27;s golden age.

==History==

===Early years===


Universal was founded by Carl Laemmle, Mark Dintenfass, Charles O. Baumann, Adam Kessel, Pat Powers, William Swanson, David Horsley, Robert H. Cochrane and Jules Brulatour. One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons, and calculating the day&#x27;s takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first several nickelodeons. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Patents Company (or the &quot;Edison Trust&quot;) meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Based on the Latham Loop used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.

Soon, Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures. In June 1909, Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with his brothers-in-law Abe Stern and Julius Stern. That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), with studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many early films in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were produced in the early 20th century. Laemmle broke with Edison&#x27;s custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the star system. In 1910, he promoted Florence Lawrence, formerly known as &quot;The Biograph Girl&quot;, and actor King Baggot, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.

The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated in New York City on April 30, 1912. Laemmle, who emerged as president in July 1912, was the primary figure in the partnership with Dintenfass, Baumann, Kessel, Powers, Swanson, Horsley, and Brulatour. The company was established on June 8, 1912, formed in a merger of Independent Moving Pictures (IMP), the Powers Motion Picture Company, Rex Motion Picture Manufacturing Company, Champion Film Company, Nestor Film Company, and the New York Motion Picture Company. Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle. The new Universal studio was a vertically integrated company, with movie production, distribution, and exhibition venues all linked in the same corporate entity, the central element of the Studio system era.

Following the westward trend of the industry, by the end of 1912, the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area. 


&quot;Universal Weekly&quot; and &quot;Moving Picture Weekly&quot; were the alternating names of Universal&#x27;s internal magazine that began publication in this era; the magazine was intended to market Universal&#x27;s films to exhibitors. Since much of Universal&#x27;s early film output was destroyed in subsequent fires and nitrate degradation, the surviving issues of these magazines are a crucial source for film historians.

On March 15, 1915, Laemmle opened the world&#x27;s largest motion picture production facility, Universal City Studios, on a 230-acre (0.9-km2) converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood. Studio management became the third facet of Universal&#x27;s operations, with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization. Unlike other movie moguls, Laemmle opened his studio to tourists. Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood and remained so for a decade. However, it sought an audience mostly in small towns, producing mostly inexpensive melodramas, westerns, and serials.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
In 1916, Universal formed a three-tier branding system for their releases. Unlike the top-tier studios, Universal did not own any theaters to market its feature films. Universal branding their product gave theater owners and audiences a quick reference guide. Branding would help theater owners judge films they were about to lease and help fans decide which movies they wanted to see. Universal released three different types of feature motion pictures:

* Red Feather Photoplays – low-budget feature films
* Bluebird Photoplays – mainstream feature release and more ambitious productions
* Jewel – prestige motion pictures featuring high budgets using prominent actors
Directors of &quot;Jewel&quot; films included Jack Conway, John Ford, Rex Ingram, Robert Z. Leonard, George Marshall, and Lois Weber, one of the few women directing films in Hollywood.


Starting in the mid-1920s, Universal branded its most expensive and heavily promoted feature films as &quot;Super-Jewel&quot; productions. These included films such as Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; (1922), Clarence Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Acquittal&quot; (1923), Hobart Henley&#x27;s &quot;A Lady of Quality&quot; (1924), Harry A. Pollard&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1927), and Edward Sloman&#x27;s &quot;Surrender&quot; (1927).

Despite Laemmle&#x27;s role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor, William Fox, and Marcus Loew, Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films &quot;Blind Husbands&quot; (1919) and &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers. Character actor Lon Chaney became a drawing card for Universal in the mid-1910s, appearing steadily in dramas. However, Chaney left Universal in 1917 because of a salary dispute, and his two biggest hits for Universal were made as isolated returns to the studio: &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925).

During the early 1920s Laemmle entrusted most of Universal&#x27;s production policy decisions to Irving Thalberg. Thalberg had been Laemmle&#x27;s personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief in 1919, Thalberg made distinct improvements of quality and prestige in Universal&#x27;s output in addition to dealing with star director Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s increasing inability to control the expense and length of his films, eventually firing Stroheim on October 6, 1922, six weeks into the production of &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1923) and replacing him with Rupert Julian. Louis B. Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal in late 1922 to his own growing studio, Louis B. Mayer Productions, as vice-president in charge of production, and when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was formed in 1924 Thalberg continued in the same position for the new company. Without Thalberg&#x27;s guidance, Universal became a second-tier studio and would remain so for several decades. 
In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler&#x27;s increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary&#x27;s films. Still, some of them were exhibited through other independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York City without the benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.

In the early years, Universal had a &quot;clean picture&quot; policy. However, by April 1927, Carl Laemmle considered this a mistake as &quot;unclean pictures&quot; from other studios generated more profit while Universal lost money.

===Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===
In early 1927, Universal had been negotiating deals with cartoon producers since they wanted to get back into producing them. On March 4, Charles Mintz signed a contract with Universal in the presence of its vice president, R. H. Cochrane. Mintz&#x27;s company, Winkler Pictures, was to produce 26 &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons for Universal. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created the character and the Walt Disney Studio provided the animation for the cartoons under Winkler&#x27;s supervision.

The films enjoyed a successful theatrical run, and Mintz would sign a contract with Universal ensuring three more years of Oswald cartoons. However, after Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the films, Mintz took most of Walt&#x27;s animators to work at his own studio. Disney and Iwerks would create Mickey Mouse in secret while they finished the remaining Oswald films they were contractually obligated to finish. Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz, which would later result in the creation of Woody Woodpecker in 1940.

In February 2006, NBCUniversal sold all the Disney-animated Oswald cartoons, along with the rights to the character himself, to The Walt Disney Company. In return, Disney released ABC sportscaster Al Michaels from his contract so he could work on NBC&#x27;s recently acquired Sunday night NFL football package. Universal retained ownership of the remaining Oswald cartoons.

===Keeping leadership of the studio in the family===

In 1928, Laemmle Sr. made his son, Carl Jr., head of Universal Pictures, a 21st birthday present. Universal already had a reputation for nepotism—at one time, 70 of Carl Sr.&#x27;s relatives were supposedly on the payroll. Many of them were nephews, resulting in Carl Sr. being known around the studios as &quot;Uncle Carl&quot;. Ogden Nash famously quipped in rhyme, &quot;Uncle Carl Laemmle/Has a very large faemmle&quot;. Among these relatives was future Academy Award-winning director/producer William Wyler.

&quot;Junior,&quot; Laemmle persuaded his father to bring Universal up to date. He bought and built theaters, converted the studio to sound production, and made several forays into high-quality production. His early efforts included the critically panned part-talkie version of Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1929), the lavish musical &quot;Broadway&quot; (1929) which included Technicolor sequences; and the first all-color musical feature (for Universal), &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930). The more serious &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) won its year&#x27;s Best Picture Oscar.

Laemmle Jr. created a niche for the studio, beginning a series of horror films which extended into the 1940s, affectionately dubbed Universal horror. Among them are &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933). Other Laemmle productions of this period include Tay Garnett&#x27;s &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; (1933), John M. Stahl&#x27;s &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1934) and William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; (1935).

===The Laemmles lose control===
Universal&#x27;s forays into high-quality production spelled the end of the Laemmle era at the studio. Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the Great Depression was risky, and for a time, Universal slipped into receivership. The theater chain was scrapped, but Carl Jr. held fast to distribution, studio, and production operations.
The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936), a remake of its earlier 1929 part-talkie production, and produced as a high-quality, big-budget film rather than as a B-picture. The new film featured several stars from the Broadway stage version, which began production in late 1935, and unlike the 1929 film, was based on the Broadway musical rather than the novel. Carl Jr.&#x27;s spending habits alarmed company stockholders. They would not allow production to start on &quot;Show Boat&quot; unless the Laemmles obtained a loan. Universal was forced to seek a $750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation, pledging the Laemmle family&#x27;s controlling interest in Universal as collateral. It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26-year history. The production went $300,000 over budget; Standard called in the loan, cash-strapped Universal could not pay, and Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April 2, 1936.

Although Universal&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Show Boat&quot; (released a little over a month later) became a critical and financial success, it was not enough to save the Laemmles&#x27; involvement with the studio. They were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded, with studio advertisements referring to &quot;the new Universal&quot;. Because the Laemmles personally oversaw production, &quot;Show Boat&quot; was released (despite the takeover) with Carl Laemmle and Carl Laemmle Jr.&#x27;s names on the credits and in the film&#x27;s advertising campaign. Standard Capital&#x27;s J. Cheever Cowdin had taken over as president and chairman of the board of directors and instituted severe cuts in production budgets. Joining him were British entrepreneurs C.M. Woolf and J. Arthur Rank, who bought a significant stake in the studio. Gone were the big ambitions, and though Universal had a few big names under contract, those it had been cultivating, like William Wyler and Margaret Sullavan, left.

Meanwhile, producer Joe Pasternak, who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for Universal&#x27;s German subsidiary, repeated his formula in the United States. Teenage singer Deanna Durbin starred in Pasternak&#x27;s first American film, &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; (1936). The film was a box-office hit and reputedly resolved the studio&#x27;s financial problems. The film&#x27;s success led Universal to offer her a contract, which for the first five years of her career, produced her most successful pictures.
When Pasternak stopped producing Durbin&#x27;s pictures, and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles, the studio signed 13-year-old Gloria Jean for her own series of Pasternak musicals from 1939; she went on to star with Bing Crosby, W. C. Fields, and Donald O&#x27;Connor. A popular Universal film of the late 1930s was &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939), starring James Stewart as Destry and Marlene Dietrich in her comeback role after leaving Paramount.

By the early 1940s, the company was concentrating on lower-budget productions that were the company&#x27;s main staple: westerns, melodramas, serials, and sequels to the studio&#x27;s horror pictures, the latter now solely B pictures. The studio fostered many series: The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys action features and serials (1938–43); the comic adventures of infant Baby Sandy (1938–41); comedies with Hugh Herbert (1938–42) and The Ritz Brothers (1940–43); musicals with Robert Paige, Jane Frazee, The Andrews Sisters, and The Merry Macs (1938–45); and westerns with Tom Mix (1932–33), Buck Jones (1933–36), Bob Baker (1938–39), Johnny Mack Brown (1938–43); Rod Cameron (1944–45), and Kirby Grant (1946–47).

Universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars and often borrowed talent from other studios or hired freelance actors. In addition to Stewart and Dietrich, Margaret Sullavan and Bing Crosby were two of the major names that made a couple of pictures for Universal during this period. Some stars came from radio, including Edgar Bergen, W. C. Fields, and the comedy team of Abbott and Costello (Bud Abbott and Lou Costello). Abbott and Costello&#x27;s military comedy &quot;Buck Privates&quot; (1941) gave the former burlesque comedians a national and international profile.

During the war years, Universal did have a co-production arrangement with producer Walter Wanger and his partner, director Fritz Lang, lending the studio some amount of prestige productions. Universal&#x27;s core audience base was still found in the neighborhood movie theaters, and the studio continued to please the public with low- to medium-budget films. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in new &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; mysteries (1942–46), teenage musicals with Gloria Jean, Donald O&#x27;Connor, and Peggy Ryan (1942–43), and screen adaptations of radio&#x27;s &quot;Inner Sanctum Mysteries&quot; with Lon Chaney Jr. (1943–45). Alfred Hitchcock was also borrowed for two films from Selznick International Pictures: &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) and &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943).

As Universal&#x27;s main product had always been lower-budgeted films, it was one of the last major studios to contract with Technicolor. The studio did not make use of the three-strip Technicolor process until &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (1942), starring Jon Hall and Maria Montez. Technicolor was also used for the studio&#x27;s remake of their 1925 horror melodrama, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943) with Claude Rains and Nelson Eddy. With the success of their first two pictures, a regular schedule of high-budget Technicolor films followed.

===Universal-International and Decca Records===
In 1945, J. Arthur Rank, who had already owned a stake in the studio almost a decade before, hoping to expand his American presence, bought into a four-way merger with Universal, the independent company International Pictures, and producer Kenneth Young. The new combine, United World Pictures, was a failure and was dissolved within one year. However, Rank and International remained interested in Universal, culminating in the studio&#x27;s reorganization as Universal-International; the merger was announced on July 30, 1946. William Goetz, a founder of International along with Leo Spitz, was made head of production at the renamed Universal-International Pictures, a subsidiary of Universal Pictures Company, Inc. which also served as an import-export subsidiary, and copyright holder for the production arm&#x27;s films. Goetz, a son-in-law of Louis B. Mayer, decided to bring &quot;prestige&quot; to the new company. He stopped the studio&#x27;s low-budget production of B movies, serials and curtailed Universal&#x27;s horror and &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; cycles. He also reduced the studio&#x27;s output from its wartime average of fifty films per year (nearly twice the major studio&#x27;s output) to thirty-five films a year. Distribution and copyright control remained under the name of Universal Pictures Company Inc.
Goetz set out an ambitious schedule. Universal-International became responsible for the American distribution of Rank&#x27;s British productions, including such classics as David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948). Broadening its scope further, Universal-International branched out into the lucrative non-theatrical field, buying a majority stake in home-movie dealer Castle Films in 1947 and taking the company over entirely in 1951. For three decades, Castle would offer &quot;highlights&quot; reels from the Universal film library to home-movie enthusiasts and collectors. Goetz licensed Universal&#x27;s pre–Universal-International film library to Jack Broeder&#x27;s Realart Pictures for cinema re-release, but Realart was not allowed to show the films on television.

The production arm of the studio still struggled. While there were to be a few hits like &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948), both produced by Mark Hellinger, Universal-International&#x27;s new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office. By the late 1940s, Goetz was out. The studio returned to low-budget and series films such as &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; (1949), a spin-off of the studio&#x27;s 1947 hit &quot;The Egg and I&quot; and the inexpensive &quot;Francis&quot; (1950), the first film of a series about a talking mule, became mainstays of the company. Once again, the films of Abbott and Costello, including &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948), were among the studio&#x27;s top-grossing productions. But at this point, Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor Milton Rackmil, whose Decca Records would take full control of Universal in 1952. Besides Abbott and Costello, the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio, whose product was released with Universal-International&#x27;s films.

In the 1950s, Universal-International resumed their series of Arabian Nights films, many starring Tony Curtis. The studio also had success with monster and science fiction films produced by William Alland, with many directed by Jack Arnold and starring John Agar. Other successes were the melodramas directed by Douglas Sirk and produced by Ross Hunter, which were critically reassessed more positively years later. Among Universal-International&#x27;s stable of stars were Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, Jeff Chandler, Audie Murphy, and John Gavin.

Although Decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean, it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business, as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 &quot;U.S. vs. Paramount Pictures, et al.&quot; decision. Leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose, and in 1950 MCA agent Lew Wasserman made a deal with Universal for his client James Stewart that would change the rules of the business. Wasserman&#x27;s deal gave Stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary. When one of those films, &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), proved to be a hit, the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at Universal and eventually at other studios as well.

===MCA takes over===
In the early 1950s, Universal set up its own distribution company in France. In the late 1960s, the company also started a production company in Paris, Universal Productions France S.A., although sometimes credited by the name of the distribution company, Universal Pictures France. Except for the two first films it produced, Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Le scandale&quot; (English title &quot;The Champagne Murders&quot;, 1967) and Romain Gary&#x27;s &quot;Les oiseaux vont mourir au Pérou&quot; (English title &quot;Birds in Peru&quot;), it was only involved in French or other European co-productions, including Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot;, Bertrand Blier&#x27;s &quot;Les Valseuses&quot; (English title &quot;Going Places&quot;, 1974), and Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973). It was only involved in approximately 20 French film productions. In the early 1970s, the unit was incorporated into the French Cinema International Corporation arm.

By the late 1950s, the motion picture business was again changing. The combination of the studio/theater-chain breakup and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions. The Music Corporation of America (MCA), the world&#x27;s largest talent agency, had also become a powerful television producer, renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Productions subsidiary. After a period of complete shutdown, a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360-acre (1.5 km2) studio lot to MCA in 1958 for $11 million, renamed Revue Studios. MCA owned the studio lot, but not Universal Pictures, yet was increasingly influential on Universal&#x27;s products. The studio lot was upgraded and modernized, while MCA clients like Doris Day, Lana Turner, Cary Grant, and director Alfred Hitchcock were signed to Universal contracts.
The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of the formerly Universal Pictures Company and Revue Studios (which was officially renamed as Universal Television). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964.

Television production made up much of the studio&#x27;s output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which much later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie. In 1982, Universal became the studio base for many shows that were produced by Norman Lear&#x27;s Tandem Productions/Embassy Television, including &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; which premiered on NBC that same fall.

At this time, Hal B. Wallis, who had recently worked as a major producer at Paramount, moved over to Universal, where he produced several films, among them a lavish version of Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969) and the equally lavish &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971). Although neither could claim to be a big financial hit, both films received Academy Award nominations, and &quot;Anne&quot; was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Richard Burton), Best Actress (Geneviève Bujold), and Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Quayle). Wallis retired from Universal after making the film &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; (1975), a sequel to &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), which Wallis had produced at Paramount. &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; co-starred John Wayne, reprising his Oscar-winning role from the earlier film, and Katharine Hepburn, their only film together. The film was only a moderate success.

In 1983, Universal Pictures launched an independent film arm designed to release specialty films, Universal Classics, and the division has sights on separation. In 1987, Universal Pictures, MGM/UA Communications Co., and Paramount Pictures teamed up to market feature film and television products to China. Consumer reach was measured in terms of the 25 billion admission tickets that were clocked in China in 1986, and Worldwide Media Sales, a division of the New York-based Worldwide Media Group, had been placed in charge of the undertaking.

In the early 1980s, the company had its own pay television arm Universal Pay Television (a.k.a. Universal Pay TV Programming, Inc.), which spawned in 1987, an 11-picture cable television agreement with then-independent film studio New Line Cinema.

In the early 1970s, Universal teamed up with Paramount to form Cinema International Corporation, which distributed films by Paramount and Universal outside of the US and Canada. Although Universal did produce occasional hits, among them &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (also 1973), &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), and a big box-office success which restored the company&#x27;s fortunes: &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased United Artists in 1981, MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations. However, with future film productions from both names being released through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate, CIC decided to merge UA&#x27;s international units with MGM and reformed as United International Pictures. There would be other film hits like &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (also 1985), &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986), &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988), &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (1989), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Casper&quot; (1995), but the film business was financially unpredictable with some films like &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988) or &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995), which turned out to be big box office disappointments despite their high budget, however, fortunately, these films became cult films in later years. UIP began distributing films by start-up studio DreamWorks in 1997 due to the founders&#x27; connections with Paramount, Universal, and Amblin Entertainment. In 2001, MGM dropped out of the UIP venture and went with 20th Century Fox&#x27;s international arm to handle the distribution of their titles, an ongoing arrangement. UIP nearly lost its connection with Universal Pictures in 1999 when Universal started Universal Pictures International to take over the assets of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and wanted UPI to distribute their films starting in 2001. Only a small handful of films were released theatrically by Universal Pictures International, up until the release of the film &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;. UIP then took over the theatrical distribution inventory of future films planned to be released by Universal Pictures International, such as &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. On October 4, 1999, Universal renewed its commitments to United International Pictures to release its films internationally through 2006.

=== Matsushita and Seagram ===

Anxious to expand the company&#x27;s broadcast and cable presence, longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner. He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric (now known as Panasonic), which agreed to acquire MCA for $6.6 billion in 1990.

On December 9, 1996, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc. and MCA&#x27;s music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group. MCA Records continued to live on as a label within the Universal Music Group. The following year, G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons was sold to the Penguin Group subsidiary of Pearson PLC.

Matsushita provided a cash infusion, but the clash of cultures was too great to overcome, and five years later, Matsushita sold an 80% stake in MCA/Universal to Canadian drinks distributor Seagram for $5.7 billion. Seagram sold off its stake in DuPont to fund this expansion into the entertainment industry. Hoping to build an entertainment empire around Universal, Seagram bought PolyGram from Philips in 1999 and other entertainment properties, but the fluctuating profits characteristic of Hollywood were no substitute for the reliable income stream gained from the previously held shares in DuPont.

=== Extensions ===

Afterward, Universal Pictures acquired the United States distribution rights of several of StudioCanal&#x27;s films, such as David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001) and &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (2001) which became the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States. Universal Pictures and StudioCanal also co-produced several films, such as &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003); a $40 million-budgeted film that eventually grossed $246 million worldwide. In late 2000, the New York Film Academy was permitted to use the Universal Studios backlot for student film projects in an unofficial partnership. 

In late 2005, Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Pictures acquired DreamWorks SKG after acquisition talks between GE and DreamWorks stalled. Universal&#x27;s long-time chairperson, Stacey Snider, left the company in early 2006 to head up DreamWorks. Snider was replaced by then-Vice chairman Marc Shmuger and Focus Features head David Linde. On October 5, 2009, Marc Shmuger and David Linde were ousted, and their co-chairperson jobs were consolidated under former president of worldwide marketing and distribution Adam Fogelson, becoming the single chairperson. Donna Langley was also upped to co-chairperson. In 2009, Stephanie Sperber founded Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing within Universal to license consumer products for Universal.

In September 2013, Adam Fogelson was ousted as co-chairman of Universal Pictures, promoting Donna Langley to the sole chairperson. In addition, NBCUniversal International chairman Jeff Shell would be appointed as chairman of the newly created Filmed Entertainment Group. Longtime studio head Ron Meyer would give up oversight of the film studio and appointed vice chairman of NBCUniversal, providing consultation to CEO Steve Burke on all of the company&#x27;s operations. Meyer retained oversight of Universal Parks and Resorts.

Universal&#x27;s multi-year film financing deal with Elliott Management expired in 2013. In summer 2013, Universal made an agreement with Thomas Tull&#x27;s Legendary Pictures to distribute their films for five years starting in 2014 (the year that Legendary&#x27;s similar agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures ended).

In June 2014, Universal Partnerships took over licensing consumer products for NBC and Sprout with the expectation that all licensing would eventually be centralized within NBCUniversal. 
In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus Features as a genre label concentrating on action, sci-fi, and horror films.

On December 16, 2015, Amblin Partners announced that it entered into a five-year distribution deal with Universal Pictures by which the films will be distributed and marketed by either Universal or Focus Features.

In early 2016, Perfect World Pictures announced a long-term co-financing deal with Universal, representing the first time a Chinese company directly invests in a multi-year slate deal with a major U.S. studio.

On April 28, 2016, Universal&#x27;s parent company, NBCUniversal, announced a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation. On August 22, 2016, the deal was completed. Universal took over the distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation starting in 2019 with the release of &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot;, after DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s distribution deal with 20th Century Fox ended.

On February 15, 2017, Universal Pictures acquired a minority stake in Amblin Partners, strengthening the relationship between Universal and Amblin.

In December 2019, Universal Pictures entered early negotiations to distribute upcoming feature films based on the Lego toys. Although the original &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; characters and projects are still owned by Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures will serve as a distributor of future releases and will develop additional &quot;Lego&quot; films. The first Lego film under Universal Pictures&#x27; run of their film rights is &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (2024).

In June 2020, it was announced longtime Universal International Distribution President Duncan Clark would be stepping down. He would transition to a consulting role with the studio in August and would be replaced by Veronika Kwan Vandenberg.

<text>Robert Hans van Gulik (, 9 August 1910 – 24 September 1967) was a Dutch orientalist, diplomat, musician (of the guqin), and writer, best known for the Judge Dee historical mysteries, the protagonist of which he borrowed from the 18th-century Chinese detective novel &quot;Dee Goong An&quot;.

==Life==

Robert van Gulik was born in Zutphen, the son of a medical officer in the Dutch army of what was then called the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia). He was born in the Netherlands, but from the age of three till twelve he lived in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta), where he was tutored in Mandarin and other languages. He went to Leiden University in 1929. He began his studies under the Sinologist J.J.L. Duyvendak, whose interests were in Ancient China. Perhaps because of his upbringing in the East Indies, Van Gulik&#x27;s interests were in later periods, and he transferred and obtained his PhD in 1935 from Utrecht University. His talents as a linguist suited him for a job in the Dutch Foreign Service, which he joined in 1935; and he was then stationed in various countries, mostly in East Asia (Japan and China).

He was in Tokyo when Japan declared war on the Netherlands in 1941, but he, along with the rest of the Allied diplomatic staff, were evacuated in 1942. He spent most of the rest of World War II as the secretary for the Dutch mission to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government in Chongqing. While in Chongqing, he married a Chinese woman, Shui Shifang () (1912-2005), the daughter of a Qing dynasty Imperial mandarin, and they had four children together. There he freely mingled with prominent figures in traditional and modern Chinese culture, though he had little interest in China&#x27;s modernization and the intellectual changes since the New Culture Movement.

Van Gulik was an accomplished calligrapher. His work is known in China under the name Kao Lo-p&#x27;ei ().

After the war ended, he returned to the Netherlands, then went to the United States as the counsellor of the Dutch Embassy in Washington, D.C. He returned to Japan in 1949 and stayed there for the next four years. While in Tokyo, he published his first two books, the translation &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot; and a privately published book of erotic colored prints from the Ming dynasty. Later postings took him all over the world, from New Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, and Beirut (during the 1958 Civil War) to The Hague. In 1959 Van Gulik became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences; he resigned in 1963. In 1964 he became a full member, and the next year he became a foreign member. From 1965 until his death from cancer at The Hague in 1967, he was the Dutch ambassador to Japan.

==Judge Dee mysteries==

During World War II van Gulik translated the 18th-century detective novel &quot;Dee Goong An&quot; into English under the title &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot; (first published in Tokyo in 1949). The main character of this book, Judge Dee, was based on the real statesman and detective Di Renjie, who lived in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (AD 618–907), though in the novel itself elements of Ming dynasty China (AD 1368–1644) were mixed in.

Thanks to his translation of this largely forgotten work, van Gulik became interested in Chinese detective fiction. To the translation he appended an essay on the genre in which he suggested that it was easy to imagine rewriting some of the old Chinese case histories with an eye toward modern readers. Not long afterward he himself tried his hand at creating a detective story along these lines. This became the book &quot;The Chinese Maze Murders&quot; (completed around 1950). As van Gulik thought the story would have more interest to Japanese and Chinese readers, he had it translated into Japanese by a friend (finished in 1951), and it was sold in Japan under the title &quot;Meiro-no-satsujin&quot;. With the success of the book, van Gulik produced a translation into Chinese, which was published by a Singapore book publisher in 1953. The reviews were good, and van Gulik wrote two more books (&quot;The Chinese Bell Murders&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Lake Murders&quot;) over the next few years, also with an eye toward Japanese and then Chinese editions. Next, van Gulik found a publisher for English versions of the stories, and the first such version was published in 1957. Later books were written and published in English first; the translations came afterwards.

Van Gulik&#x27;s intent in writing his first Judge Dee novel was, as he wrote in remarks on &quot;The Chinese Bell Murders&quot;, &quot;to show modern Chinese and Japanese writers that their own ancient crime-literature has plenty of source material for detective and mystery-stories&quot;. In 1956, he published a translation of the &quot;T&#x27;ang-yin-pi-shih&quot; (&quot;Parallel Cases from Under the Pear Tree&quot;), a 13th-century casebook for district magistrates. He used many of the cases as plots in his novels (as he states in the postscripts of the novels).

Van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee mysteries follow in the long tradition of Chinese detective fiction, intentionally preserving a number of key elements of that writing culture. Most notably, he had Judge Dee solve three different (and sometimes unrelated) cases in each book, a traditional device in Chinese mysteries. The whodunit element is also less important in the Judge Dee stories than it is in the traditional Western detective story, though still more so than in traditional Chinese detective stories. Nevertheless, van Gulik&#x27;s fiction was adapted to a more Western audience, avoiding the supernatural and religious traditions of Buddhism and Daoism in favour of rationality.

Friends and even his daughter, Pauline, said that he identified with Judge Dee. He lived the life of a mandarin who cultivated calligraphy, poems and paintings. When he started writing the stories in 1949, he was in a conservative and nostalgic mood, remarking &quot;Judge Dee, it&#x27;s me&quot;.

==Other works==

Robert van Gulik studied &quot;Indisch Recht&quot; (Dutch Indies law) and &quot;Indologie&quot; (Indonesian culture) at Leiden University from 1929 until 1934, receiving his doctorate for a dissertation on the horse cult in Northeast Asia at Utrecht University. Though he made his career in the Dutch diplomatic service, he kept up his studies. During his life he wrote twenty-odd essays and monographs on various subjects, mainly but not exclusively on aspects of Chinese culture. Typically, much of his scholarly work was first published outside the Netherlands. In his lifetime van Gulik was recognized as a European expert on Imperial Chinese jurisprudence.

Van Gulik was interested in Chinese painting. For example, in his book &quot;The Gibbon in China&quot; (1967), he devotes pages to the gibbon-themed paintings in China and Japan, from the Northern Song dynasty onwards. Analyzing the portrayal of these apes throughout history, he notes how the realism of the pictures deteriorated as the gibbon population in most of China was extirpated. As an art critic, he greatly admired the portrayal of the apes by such renowned painters as Yi Yuanji and Muqi Fachang. Commenting on one of Ming Emperor Xuande&#x27;s works, &quot;Gibbons at Play&quot;, van Gulik says that while it is &quot;not a great work of art&quot;, it is &quot;ably executed&quot;. The lifelike images of the apes make one surmise that the emperor painted from the live models that could have been kept in the palace gardens.

<doc id="170332" wikidata="Q1743661" url="?curid=170332" title="Kirtland Safety Society">
<text>The Kirtland Safety Society (KSS) was first proposed as a bank in 1836, and eventually organized on January 2, 1837, as a joint stock company, by leaders and followers of the then-named Church of the Latter Day Saints. According to KSS&#x27;s 1837 &quot;Articles of Agreement&quot;, it was intended to serve the financial needs of the growing Latter Day Saint community in Kirtland, Ohio. Its preamble stated it was:

... for the promotion of our temporal interests, and for the better management of our different occupations, which consist in agriculture, mechanical arts, and merchandising.

However, by November 1837, KSS failed and its business closed. In the aftermath, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was fined for &quot;running an illegal bank,&quot; though he was employed as the institution&#x27;s Cashier. While Smith appealed the fine and made arrangements to have Oliver Granger settle the affairs of the quasi-bank, many financially harmed Latter Day Saints left the church because they believed Smith had established the institution in order to enrich himself and church leadership.

==Economy in Kirtland==
By late 1836, many recent Latter Day Saint converts had gathered in Missouri and Kirtland, Ohio. The city of Kirtland experienced a significant population increase, growing from approximately 1,000 people in 1830 to 3,000 in 1836, with a similar increase in surrounding agricultural areas. The population growth was at least partially responsible for a rapid increase in land prices between 1832 and 1837. The average price per acre of land sold in Kirtland rose from approximately $7 in 1832 to $44 in 1837, only to fall back to $17.50 in 1839. (Ludlow, p. 283) Generalized inflation during the period accounted for between 25 and 40 percent of the price increase. Although the church held considerable real estate, estimated at approximately $60,000 in equity by historian Larry T. Wimmer, it also needed liquidity to repay outstanding loans. The credit needs of the church, growing population and ongoing land transactions required a local bank. Banks in the United States in the period before the Civil War issued and often backed their own currency.

==KSS organization==

After some discussion by the leadership of the Church, church apostle Orson Hyde went to the Ohio legislature to request a bank charter while Oliver Cowdery went to Philadelphia and acquired plates to print notes for the proposed Kirtland Safety Society bank. On January 2, Hyde returned to Kirtland empty-handed. He had been unable to persuade any legislator to sponsor a bill giving KSS a bank charter. Church president and founder Joseph Smith attributed the lack of sponsorship to disfavor toward the Mormons.

Hyde returned to the Ohio legislature in February with a petition, joined by several non-Mormons, for a bank based on far less capital stock. This time Hyde secured legislative sponsors, and the request was added as an amendment to another bill. However, the bill was defeated by the Ohio legislature. Grandison Newell, a professed antagonist to the Latter Day Saints in general and its president in particular, instigated several lawsuits against the Mormons in Ohio. Newell was close to three legislators who had taken the charter requests under consideration and used his influence to dissuade them.

Although this rejection has been attributed to both political and religious differences, this Ohio legislature was much more restrictive in issuing bank charters than the previous legislative body. The legislature was now dominated by the hard money wing of the Democratic party, the &quot;Jacksonian Democrats&quot;. Due to their influence, the legislature refused all applications for bank charters but one during 1836 and 1837, in part because of endemic nationwide problems with land speculation, wildcat banking and counterfeiting.

Under the advice of non-Mormon legal counsel, the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-Banking Company (KSSABC) was formed under revised articles on January 2, 1837 as a joint stock company to serve as a quasi-banking institution. Quasi-banks operated as banks (sometimes in conjunction with other business activities) although they had no formal bank charter. These corporate institutions were not uncommon in Ohio at the time as banking regulations were limited. Whigs went so far as to encourage businesses to operate as quasi-banks. Even after the national bank failure in 1837, there was no widespread opposition to quasi-banks in Ohio until 1873.

&quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;ing&quot; were engraved before and after &quot;Bank&quot;—in smaller typeface—on the printing plates Cowdery had previously purchased in Philadelphia. Subscribers and organizers of the KSSABC were members of the Kirtland community (merchants, farmers, etc.), many of whom became shareholders of the company. Sidney Rigdon served as the KSSABC&#x27;s chairman and president, Warren Parrish as signatory, secretary and teller; Joseph Smith was cashier. Supporters hoped that they would eventually be able to secure a formal banking charter. In the interim, the KSSABC began issuing notes as a quasi-bank in early January 1837.

The proposed capitalization of the &quot;anti-bank&quot; greatly exceeded the resources that were available from its backers, as noted by historian, Robert Kent Fielding:

As it was projected, there was never the slightest chance that the Kirtland Safety Society anti-Bank-ing Company could succeed. Even though their economy was in jeopardy, it could scarcely have suffered such a devastating blow as that which they were themselves preparing to administer to it. ... The Safety Society proposed no modest project befitting its relative worth and ability to pay. Its organizers launched, instead, a gigantic company capitalized at four million dollars, when the entire capitalization of all the banks in the state of Ohio was only nine and one third million. Such presumption could not have escaped the notice of bankers who would have been led to examine its capital structure more closely. ... according to the articles of incorporation capital stock was to be paid in by subscription but that the amount of payments were left to the discretion of the company managers. Furthermore, total issuance of notes was not prescribed, nor was the relation of notes to capital and assets. The members, to be sure, pledged themselves to redeem the notes and bound themselves individually by their agreement under the penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars. But there was no transfer of property deeds, no power of attorney, no legal pains and penalties. To a banker, the articles fairly shouted: &#x27;this is a wildcat, beware!&#x27;
==Opposition and failure==
On January 20, the &quot;Painesville Telegraph&quot; noted the production of &quot;Mormon money&quot;, accused it of being fraudulent, and noted that it was illegal to issue bank notes without a legal charter from the State.
In February 1837, Samuel D. Rounds swore a writ against Smith and Rigdon for illegal banking and issuing unauthorized bank paper. At a hearing in March, this trial was postponed until autumn. Eventually Rounds voluntarily dropped all of the cases in his suit except those against Smith and Rigdon. Although Smith&#x27;s only official capacity for KSSABC was cashier, other officers and parties with equal or greater responsibility were absolved from the suit. KSSABC continued issuing notes through June, but eventually failed due to insolvency, as most of the KSSABC reserves were tied up in land rather than silver as some erroneously believed.

Smith transferred all of his holdings to Oliver Granger and J. Carter in June and resigned from the KSSABC in July. Parrish and Frederick G. Williams assumed management of the KSSABC until the institution closed its doors in November with about $100,000 in unresolved debt. Smith appointed Granger as his agent to clear up his Kirtland affairs, as Smith was named in seventeen lawsuits with claims totalling $30,206.44 over debts incurred in the failure of the KSSABC. According to LDS Church scholars, &quot;Four of these suits were settled; three were voluntarily discontinued by the plaintiffs; and ten resulted in judgments against Joseph Smith and others. Of these ten judgments, three were satisfied in full, three were satisfied in part, and only four were wholly unsatisfied.&quot; The church also raised and put up $38,000 in bail money for Smith at the Geauga County Court which was to be held to satisfy any judgment that might be rendered against Smith.

On July 28, Smith, Rigdon and Thomas B. Marsh headed to Upper Canada on church business and returned in late August. On September 27, Smith and Rigdon departed Kirtland for Missouri. They arrived about one month later, spent about two weeks in Missouri on Church business and returned to Kirtland on December 10. In their absence, in October, they were fined $1,000 for operating an illegal bank. According to Dale W. Adams, professor of agricultural economics at Ohio State University, other, larger quasi-banks had been operating in Ohio longer than KSSABC and were not being prosecuted.

Among KSSABC&#x27;s misfortunes, Smith also accused Parrish of embezzling $25,000 from KSSABC. In June Smith sought a search warrant to confirm the allegations against Parrish but was denied.

==Response in the Latter Day Saint community==
After Parrish started to stir up the Latter Day Saint community, many church members (including Church leaders) became disillusioned with the failure of the KSSABC and left the Church or were disfellowshipped or excommunicated. In May 1837, disgruntled church members (including Church leaders) and non-members alike began to publicly blame Smith for their losses. Some members, like Parley P. Pratt and Cowdery, were later reconciled to Smith and the church.

Smith warned the community against speculation and counterfeiting. Shortly after his resignation from the KSSABC in July he stated in the August 1837 &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;:

I am disposed to say a word relative to the bills of the Kirtland Safety Society Bank. I hereby warn them to beware of speculators, renegadoes [defectors] and gamblers, who are duping the unsuspecting and the unwary, by palming upon them, those bills, which are of no worth, here. I discountenance and disapprove of any and all such practices. I know them to be detrimental to the best interests of society, as well as to the principles of religion.
Shortly before his resignation, Smith also took out a $1,225 loan from a separate bank to help keep KSSABC solvent. Smith publicly denied claims that the KSSABC was created for the purpose of surreptitiously enriching the church leadership, but many disaffected members felt otherwise.

Regardless of the reasons for the KSSABC&#x27;s failure, much of the blame was laid upon Smith. Half of The Quorum of Twelve Apostles accused Smith of improprieties in the banking scandal, and church Apostle Heber C. Kimball later said that the bank&#x27;s failure was so shattering that afterwards &quot;there were not twenty persons on earth that would declare that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.&quot; Woodruff records that Smith had an alleged revelation on the topic, but declined to share it, saying only that &quot;if we would give heed to the commandments the Lord had given this morning all would be well.&quot; Then Woodruff expresses his own hopes that the KSSABC will &quot;become the greatest of all institutions on EARTH.&quot;

On January 12, 1838, faced with a warrant for his arrest on a charge of illegal banking, Smith fled with Rigdon to Clay County, Missouri just ahead of an armed group intending to capture and hold Smith for trial. Smith and Rigdon were both acquainted with not only conflict and violent mobbing they experienced together in Pennsylvania and New York, but with fleeing from the law. According to Smith, they left &quot;to escape mob violence, which was about to burst upon us under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies.&quot; Brigham Young left Kirtland for Missouri weeks earlier on December 22 to avoid the dissidents who were angry with Young and threatened him because of his persistent public defense of Smith&#x27;s innocence. Most of those who remained committed to the church moved to join the main body of the church in Missouri.

==Kirtland Safety Society notes==
One of the tangible connections from this episode to the present are the notes that were printed at the time. Some church leaders encouraged people to retain these notes as they said that someday they would have value again. While the notes never regained their face value, by the late 19th century they had become collector&#x27;s items. A Kirtland Safety Society note bearing Joseph Smith&#x27;s signature can be quite valuable. For example, in an auction in March 2006, a $100 note sold for $11,500 (about a 3% per year gain).

<text>Case-based reasoning (CBR), broadly construed, is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems.

In everyday life, an auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning. A lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning. So, too, an engineer copying working elements of nature (practicing biomimicry) is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems. Case-based reasoning is a prominent type of analogy solution making.

It has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning, but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving; or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced. This view is related to prototype theory, which is most deeply explored in cognitive science.

== Process ==

Case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process:

# Retrieve: Given a target problem, retrieve cases relevant to solving it from memory. A case consists of a problem, its solution, and, typically, annotations about how the solution was derived. For example, suppose Fred wants to prepare blueberry pancakes. Being a novice cook, the most relevant experience he can recall is one in which he successfully made plain pancakes. The procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes, together with justifications for decisions made along the way, constitutes Fred&#x27;s retrieved case.
# Reuse: Map the solution from the previous case to the target problem. This may involve adapting the solution as needed to fit the new situation. In the pancake example, Fred must adapt his retrieved solution to include the addition of blueberries.
# Revise: Having mapped the previous solution to the target situation, test the new solution in the real world (or a simulation) and, if necessary, revise. Suppose Fred adapted his pancake solution by adding blueberries to the batter. After mixing, he discovers that the batter has turned blue – an undesired effect. This suggests the following revision: delay the addition of blueberries until after the batter has been ladled into the pan.
# Retain: After the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem, store the resulting experience as a new case in memory. Fred, accordingly, records his new-found procedure for making blueberry pancakes, thereby enriching his set of stored experiences, and better preparing him for future pancake-making demands.

== Comparison to other methods ==

At first glance, CBR may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms of machine learning. Like a rule-induction algorithm, CBR starts with a set of cases or training examples; it forms generalizations of these examples, albeit implicit ones, by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem.

If for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes, a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method, thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used. The key difference, however, between the implicit generalization in CBR and the generalization in rule induction lies in when the generalization is made. A rule-induction algorithm draws its generalizations from a set of training examples before the target problem is even known; that is, it performs eager generalization.

For instance, if a rule-induction algorithm were given recipes for plain pancakes, Dutch apple pancakes, and banana pancakes as its training examples, it would have to derive, at training time, a set of general rules for making all types of pancakes. It would not be until testing time that it would be given, say, the task of cooking blueberry pancakes. The difficulty for the rule-induction algorithm is in anticipating the different directions in which it should attempt to generalize its training examples. This is in contrast to CBR, which delays (implicit) generalization of its cases until testing time – a strategy of lazy generalization. In the pancake example, CBR has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation. CBR therefore tends to be a good approach for rich, complex domains in which there are myriad ways to generalize a case.

In law, there is often explicit delegation of CBR to courts, recognizing the limits of rule based reasons: limiting delay, limited knowledge of future context, limit of negotiated agreement, etc. While CBR in law and cognitively inspired CBR have long been associated, the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning, and judgment, while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation. The difference is clear in their attitude toward error and appellate review.

Another name for cased based reasoning in problem solving is symptomatic strategies. It does require à priori domain knowledge that is gleaned from past experience which established connections between symptoms and causes. This knowledge is referred to as shallow, compiled, evidential, history-based as well as case-based knowledge. This is the strategy most associated with diagnosis by experts. Diagnosis of a problem transpires as a rapid recognition process in which symptoms evoke appropriate situation categories. An expert knows the cause by virtue of having previously encountered similar cases. Cased based reasoning is the most powerful strategy, and that used most commonly. However, the strategy won&#x27;t work independently with truly novel problems, or where deeper understanding of whatever is taking place is sought.

An alternative approach to problem solving is the topographic strategy which falls into the category of deep reasoning. With deep reasoning, in-depth knowledge of a system is used. Topography in this context means a description or an analysis of a structured entity, showing the relations among its elements.

Also known as reasoning from first principles, deep reasoning is applied to novel faults when experience-based approaches aren&#x27;t viable. The topographic strategy is therefore linked to à priori domain knowledge that is developed from a more a fundamental understanding of a system, possibly using first-principles knowledge. Such knowledge is referred to as deep, causal or model-based knowledge. 
Hoc and Carlier noted that symptomatic approaches may need to be supported by topographic approaches because symptoms can be defined in diverse terms. The converse is also true – shallow reasoning can be used abductively to generate causal hypotheses, and deductively to evaluate those hypotheses, in a topographical search.

== Criticism ==

Critics of CBR argue that it is an approach that accepts anecdotal evidence as its main operating principle. Without statistically relevant data for backing and implicit generalization, there is no guarantee that the generalization is correct. However, all inductive reasoning where data is too scarce for statistical relevance is inherently based on anecdotal evidence.

== History ==

CBR traces its roots to the work of Roger Schank and his students at Yale University in the early 1980s. Schank&#x27;s model of dynamic memory was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: Janet Kolodner&#x27;s CYRUS and Michael Lebowitz&#x27;s IPP.

Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, which directed at topics such as legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods. In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew internationally, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops.

CBR technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems, the earliest being Lockheed&#x27;s CLAVIER, a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven. CBR has been used extensively in applications such as the Compaq SMART system and has found a major application area in the health sciences, as well as in structural safety management.

There is recent work that develops CBR within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference. Thus, it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence.
One description of the difference between CBR and induction from instances is that statistical inference aims to find what tends to make cases similar while CBR aims to encode what suffices to claim similarly.

<text>A student design competition is a specific form of a student competition relating to design. Design competitions can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical competitions is to introduce students to real-world engineering situations and to teach students project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually require art and design skills.

Both students and industry benefit from intercollegiate design competitions. Each competition allows students to apply the theories and information they have learning in the class room to real situations. Industry gains better prepared and more experienced engineers.

== History ==

Through the 1970s only one competition of significance existed: Mini Baja. Today, almost every field of engineering has several design competitions, which have extended from college down into high school (e.g., FIRST Robotics) and even younger grades (e.g., FIRST Lego League). The Society of Automotive Engineers organizes the largest design competitions, including Baja SAE, Sunryce, and Formula SAE.

<doc id="170335" wikidata="Q368280" url="?curid=170335" title="Lateralus">
<text>Lateralus () is the third studio album by the American rock band Tool. It was released on May 15, 2001, through Volcano Entertainment. The album was recorded at Cello Studios in Hollywood and The Hook, Big Empty Space, and The Lodge, in North Hollywood, between October 2000 and January 2001. David Bottrill, who had produced the band&#x27;s two previous releases &quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;Salival&quot;, produced the album along with the band, and became the last Tool album produced by Bottrill to date. On August 23, 2005, &quot;Lateralus&quot; was released as a limited edition two-picture-disc vinyl LP in a holographic gatefold package.

The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling more than 555,200 copies in its first week of release. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on April 15, 2021. On February 13, 2015, the album was certified Gold by the BPI. It was also certified double platinum in both Australia and Canada. The band won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song &quot;Schism&quot; in 2002. &quot;Lateralus&quot; was ranked No. 123 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list.

== Background ==
&quot;Lateralus&quot; emerged after a four-year legal dispute with Tool&#x27;s label, Volcano Entertainment. In January 2001, the band announced that their new album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Systema Encéphale&quot; and provided a 12-song track list with titles such as &quot;Riverchrist&quot;, &quot;Numbereft&quot;, &quot;Encephatalis&quot;, &quot;Musick&quot;, and &quot;Coeliacus&quot;. File sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles&#x27; names. At the time, Tool&#x27;s members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to the negative impact on artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career. During an interview with &quot;NY Rock&quot; in 2000, lead singer Maynard James Keenan stated:
I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.
A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled &quot;Lateralus&quot; (supposedly a portmanteau of the leg muscle Vastus lateralis and the term lateral thinking) and that the name &quot;Systema Encéphale&quot; and the track list had been a ruse.

&quot;Lateralus&quot; and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward art rock, and progressive rock territory, in contrast to the band&#x27;s earlier material, which has often been labeled as alternative metal. The album has also been described as progressive metal. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that &quot;Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march ... The prolonged running times of most of &quot;Lateralus&quot; thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose.&quot; Joshua Klein of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in turn expressed his opinion that &quot;Lateralus&quot;, with its 79-minute running time and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half minute music video for &quot;Parabola&quot;—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike. Drummer Danny Carey said, &quot;The manufacturer would only guarantee us up to 79 minutes ... We thought we&#x27;d give them two seconds of breathing room.&quot; Carey aspired to create longer songs like those by artists he grew up listening to. The band had segues to place between songs, but had to cut out a lot during the mastering phase. The CD itself was mastered using HDCD technology.

Just as &quot;Salival&quot; was initially released with several errors on the track listing, early pressings of &quot;Lateralus&quot; had the ninth track incorrectly spelled as &quot;Lateralis&quot;. The original title of &quot;Reflection&quot; was &quot;Resolution&quot; before being changed three months prior to the album&#x27;s release.

The track listing is altered on the vinyl edition, with &quot;Disposition&quot; appearing at track 8. Because of the long running time, the double vinyl edition could not be released like the disc since the songs would not fit on each disc side in that order. By moving &quot;Disposition&quot; to an earlier point, the sides were balanced and could fit the material. This edit breaks the segue that occurs between &quot;Disposition&quot; and &quot;Reflection&quot;, however, which, along with &quot;Triad&quot;, are linked together on the tracklist.

Two of the singles from the album, &quot;Parabola&quot; and &quot;Schism&quot;, are featured in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;.

The insert is translucent and flips open to reveal the different layers of the human body. Disguised in the brain matter on the final layer is the word &quot;God&quot;. The artwork was done by artist Alex Grey, who would later design the 3D edition cover for the followup to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, &quot;10,000 Days&quot; and a major part of the artwork for Tool&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;.

== Composition and content ==
Drummer Danny Carey sampled himself breathing through a tube to simulate the chanting of Buddhist monks for &quot;Parabol&quot;, and banged piano strings for samples on &quot;Reflection&quot;. &quot;Faaip de Oiad&quot; samples a recording of a 1997 call on Art Bell&#x27;s radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. &quot;Faaip de Oiad&quot; is Enochian for &quot;The Voice of God&quot;.

&quot;Disposition&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot;, and &quot;Triad&quot; form a sequence that has been performed in succession live with occasional help from various tourmates such as Mike Patton, Dave Lombardo, Buzz Osborne, Tricky, and members of Isis, Meshuggah, and King Crimson.

The title track, &quot;Lateralus&quot;, incorporates the Fibonacci sequence. The theme of the song describes the desire of humans to explore and to expand for more knowledge and a deeper understanding of everything. The lyrics &quot;spiral out&quot; refer to this desire and also to the Fibonacci spiral, which is formed by creating and arranging squares for each number in the sequence&#x27;s 1,1,2,3,5,8... pattern, and drawing a curve that connects to two corners of each square. This would, allowed to continue onwards, theoretically create a never-ending and infinitely expanding spiral. Related to this, the song&#x27;s main theme features successive time signatures 9/8, 8/8, and 7/8. The number 987 is the sixteenth integer of the Fibonacci sequence.

&quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; is an instrumental piece in-between &quot;The Grudge&quot; and &quot;The Patient&quot;. The track &quot;Mantra&quot; is the slowed-down sound of Maynard James Keenan gently squeezing one of his cats.

In an interview with producer David Bottrill, he revealed that the lyrics for &#x27;Schism&#x27; were changed last minute because of Adam Jones thinking they were too close to home. The first version of the lyrics were, according to Bottrill, very explicitly about the building tensions between Maynard and Adam, and the band as a whole. Maynard changed them after a lengthy band meeting, to be more broadly applicable to relationships falling apart.

== Release and reception ==
Overall, &quot;Lateralus&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews by mainstream music critics upon its initial release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 75, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, based on 15 reviews. Many of their responses mentioned the album&#x27;s ambition and ability to confound listeners, such as &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s Ryan Rayhil&#x27;s summarization of it as a &quot;monolithic puzzlebox&quot;. Rob Theakston reviewed the record for AllMusic, where he claimed that &quot;&quot;Lateralus&quot; demands close listening from the first piece onward, as it becomes quickly apparent that this is not going to be an album one can listen to and accept at face value. Complex rhythm changes, haunting vocals, and an onslaught of changes in dynamics make this an album other so-called metal groups could learn from.&quot;

Terry Bezer praised &quot;Lateralus&quot; in a review for &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; by comparing it to the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Ænima&quot;, calling it &quot;a more focused and cunning record than its predecessors that in many ways puts everything the band have formerly produced into perspective.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also measured the album up to earlier works from the band&#x27;s oeuvre; &quot;Tool have everything it takes to beat you senseless; they proved it on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Undertow&quot; and their 1996 Grammy-winning beast, &quot;Ænima&quot;. Here, Tool go to extravagant lengths to drown you in sensation.&quot; In a review for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Dave Everly claimed &quot;It&#x27;s the most perfectly played, perfectly produced record you&#x27;re likely to hear this or any other year&quot; and that it was &quot;one of the greatest albums you&#x27;ll hear in your lifetime.&quot; Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Andy Capper also approved of it; &quot;&quot;Lateralus&quot; has added a little more colour to their palette of chanting, drumming and high drama. Singer Maynard James Keenan has been unaffected by the comparative tunefulness of his side project A Perfect Circle, while the stripped-down nature of the instrumentation means that Tool&#x27;s innate heaviness shines out in a world of production tricks and dodges. There&#x27;s no trickery—Tool&#x27;s progressiveness is all their own work.&quot;

By contrast, in a review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Brent DiCrescenzo claimed that, &quot;With the early new century demanding &#x27;opuses&#x27;, Tool follows suit. The problem is, Tool defines &#x27;opus&#x27; as taking their &#x27;defining element&#x27; (wanking sludge) and stretching it out to the maximum digital capacity of a compact disc.&quot; In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau lambasted the album, calling it &quot;meaning-mongering for the fantasy fiction set.&quot; The review published in &quot;Blender&quot; described the album as sounding like &quot;Black Sabbath jamming with Genesis at the bottom of a coal shaft.&quot;

=== Commercial performance ===
The album was a commercial success in the United States, debuting at No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart with over 555,200 copies sold in its first week of release. On August 5, 2003, the album was certified double platinum by the RIAA. On April 30, 2010, the album was certified gold by the BPI for sales of 100,000 in the U.K. In addition, &quot;Lateralus&quot; was certified double platinum by the ARIA and MC.

=== Accolades ===
Tool received the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song &quot;Schism&quot;. During the band&#x27;s acceptance speech, drummer Danny Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents &quot;for putting up with [him]&quot;, and bassist Justin Chancellor concluded, &quot;I want to thank my dad for doing my mom.&quot;

&quot;Kludge&quot; ranked &quot;Lateralus&quot; at on their list of top 10 albums of 2001. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed the album at on their 2001 &quot;Albums Of The Year&quot; list. &quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Lateralus&quot; as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.

The album continued to gain accolades in the years following its release. In 2016, Loudwire named Lateralus the hard rock/metal album of the 21st century. The magazine also ranked it on their &quot;Top 25 Progressive Metal Albums of All Time.&quot; The album was ranked at on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Louder Sound&quot; placed the album at on their &quot;Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time&quot; list.

Publications have also continued to praise the performances by the band members on the album. NutSie.com ranked the drumming performance by Danny Carey on the song &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; at on their list of Top 100 Rock Drum Performances.

=== Special editions ===
A vinyl edition and two DVD singles from the album were released later. The &quot;double vinyl four-picture disc&quot; edition of &quot;Lateralus&quot; was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. Two music videos were produced; one for &quot;Schism&quot; (with the short ambient segue &quot;Mantra&quot; at the beginning) and one for &quot;Parabol/Parabola&quot;. These were subsequently released as two separate DVD singles on December 20, 2005, featuring remixes of the tracks by Lustmord.

<text>Land of the Lost is a children&#x27;s adventure television series created (though uncredited) by David Gerrold and produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, who co-developed the series with Allan Foshko. It is a live-action show mixed with stop-motion animated dinosaurs, originally aired on Saturday mornings from 1974 to 1976, on the NBC television network. CBS used it as a summer replacement series from June 22 to December 28, 1985, and June 2 to September 5, 1987. It has since become a 1970s American cult classic. Krofft Productions remade the series in 1991, and adapted it into a feature film in 2009.

==Overview==
&quot;Land of the Lost&quot; details the adventures of the Marshall family (father Rick and his children Will and Holly), who are trapped in an alternate universe or time warp inhabited by dinosaurs, a primate-like people called Pakuni, and aggressive humanoid/lizard creatures (described as similar to insects) called Sleestak. The episode storylines focus on the family&#x27;s efforts to survive and find a way back to their own world, but the exploration of the exotic inhabitants of the Land of the Lost is also an ongoing part of the story.

An article on renewed studio interest in feature-film versions of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; and &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; commented that &quot;decision-makers in Hollywood, and some big-name stars, have personal recollections of plopping down on the family-room wall-to-wall shag sometime between 1969 and 1974 to tune in to multiple reruns of the Kroffts&#x27; Saturday morning live-action hits,&quot; and quoting Marty Krofft as saying that the head of Universal Studios, Ronald Meyer, and leaders at Sony Pictures all had been fans of Krofft programs.

A number of well-respected writers in the science-fiction field contributed scripts to the series (mostly in the first and second seasons), including Larry Niven, Theodore Sturgeon, Ben Bova, and Norman Spinrad, and a number of people involved with &quot;Star Trek&quot;, such as D.C. Fontana, Walter Koenig, and David Gerrold. Gerrold, Niven, and Fontana also contributed commentaries to the DVD of the first season.

The prolific Krofft team was influential in live-action children&#x27;s television, producing many shows that were oddly formatted, highly energetic, and filled with special effects, with most of them following a &quot;stranger in a strange land&quot; storyline. Most of these shows were comedic in nature, but &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; was considerably more serious, especially during its first season, though as the series progressed, the dramatic tone diminished.

===Plot and format===
The Marshalls are brought to the mysterious world by means of a dimensional portal, a device used frequently throughout the series and a major part of its internal mythology. This portal opens when they are swept down a gigantic 1,000-foot waterfall. In &quot;Circle&quot;, which explains the time paradox, this portal is actually opened by Rick Marshall himself while in Enik&#x27;s cave, as a way for the current Marshalls to return to Earth, resolving the paradox and allowing Enik to also return to his time.

Outfitted only for a short camping trip, the resourceful family from California takes shelter in a natural cave and improvises the provisions and tools that they need to survive. Their most common and dangerous encounters are with dinosaurs, particularly a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; they nickname &quot;Grumpy&quot;, which frequents the location of their cave. However, many of the dinosaurs are herbivores, posing no threat to the Marshalls, unless unintentionally provoked. One is a particularly tame young brontosaurus that Holly looks on as a pet and nicknames &quot;Dopey&quot;.

They also encounter the mostly hostile Sleestak (a race of reptilian humanoids/insectoid), and the primate-like creatures called Pakuni (one of whom, Cha-Ka, they befriend), as well as a variety of dangerous creatures, strange geography and unfamiliar technology.

The main goal of the three is to find a way to return home. They are occasionally aided in this by the Altrusian castaway Enik.

At the start of the third season, Rick Marshall (played by Spencer Milligan) abruptly disappeared while trying to use one of the pylons to get home, leaving his children behind; his disappearance is explained to having been accidentally returned to Earth alone. Rick is immediately replaced by his brother Jack, who stumbled upon his niece and nephew after having embarked on a search of his own to find them.

Though the term &quot;time doorway&quot; is used throughout the series, &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; is not meant to portray an era in Earth&#x27;s history, but rather an enigmatic zone whose place and time are unknown. Indeed, within the first few minutes of the pilot, the Marshall family father tells his children that he spotted three moons in the sky. The original creators of these time portals were thought to be the ancestors of the Sleestak, called Altrusians, though later episodes raised some questions about this.

Many aspects of the &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, including the time doorways and environmental processes, were controlled by the Pylons, metallic obelisk-shaped booths that were larger on the inside than the outside and housed matrix tables – stone tables studded with a grid of colored crystals. Uncontrolled time doorways result in the arrival of a variety of visitors and castaways in the land.

==Cast==
* Wesley Eure (credited in season 1-2 as “Wesley”) as Will Marshall
* Kathy Coleman as Holly Marshall
* Spencer Milligan as Rick Marshall (seasons 1 and 2) 
* Philip Paley (season 1-2 recurring; season 3 starring) as Cha-Ka 
* Ron Harper (season 3) as Uncle Jack Marshall


==Production==
&quot;Land of the Lost&quot; is notable for its epic-scale concept, which suggested an expansive world with many fantastic forms of life and mysterious technology, all created on a children&#x27;s series&#x27; limited production budget. To support the internal mythology, linguist Victoria Fromkin was commissioned to create a special language for the Pakuni, which she based on the sounds of West African speech and attempted to build into the show in a gradual way that would allow viewers to learn the language over the course of many episodes. The series&#x27; intention was to create a realistic fantasy world, albeit relying heavily on children&#x27;s acceptance of minor inconsistencies.

In a 1999 interview, first-season story editor and writer David Gerrold claimed that he largely created the show based on photographs of various science-fiction topoi that were bound together in a book and given him by Sid Krofft and Allan Foshko.

It was a marked departure from the Krofft team&#x27;s previous work, which mostly featured extremely stylized puppets and sets such as those in &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; and &quot;Lidsville&quot;.

The series for the first two seasons was shot on a modular indoor soundstage at General Service Studios in Hollywood, and made economical use of a small number of sets and scenic props that were rearranged frequently to suggest the ostensibly vast jungles, ancient cities, and cave systems. As is traditional in many effect scenes, miniatures or scale-version settings were used for insertion of live-action scenes. Additional locations were often rendered using scale miniatures and chroma key.

Spencer Milligan departed the show at the beginning of its third season for financial reasons. In addition to a salary increase, he believed the rest of the cast and he should receive compensation for using their images on various merchandise (mostly rack toys by Larami, including a generic pack of toy dinosaurs believed to originate in Taiwan), but also a coloring book from Whitman Publishing, a Little Golden Book, View-Master reels and a Milton Bradley board game. His character, Rick Marshall, was replaced by his brother Jack, played by actor Ron Harper, with a stand-in wearing a wig with his back to the camera portraying Rick for a brief scene being transported home.

Nonhuman characters were portrayed by actors in latex rubber suits or heavy creature makeup. Dinosaurs in the series were created using a combination of stop motion animation miniatures, rear-projection film effects, and occasional hand puppets for close-ups of dinosaur heads. The series marked a rare example of matting filmed stop-motion sequences with videotape live action, so as to avoid the telltale blue &#x27;fringe&#x27; produced in matting with less exacting processes. Though this occasionally worked very well, the difference in lighting between the video and film sequences sometimes brought inadvertent attention to the limitations of the process.

Special-effects footage was frequently reused. Additional visual effects were achieved using manual film overlay techniques, the low-tech ancestor to later motion control photography.

== Release ==
The series was originally shown by NBC on Saturday mornings, along with primarily animated shows for children. It later aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; package. In 1985, it returned to late Saturday mornings on CBS as a replacement for the canceled &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; (also a Krofft production) followed by another brief return to CBS in the summer of 1987. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel in the 1990s. Reruns of this series were aired on Saturday mornings on MeTV and are streamed online at any time on their website.

===Home media===

From 2004 to 2005, Rhino Entertainment held the rights to the show, and released seasons one through three, and a complete series package, with several bonus features, including commentaries, on all of the releases. The DVDs of the series earned a Saturn nomination for best retro TV series release in 2004.

On May 26, 2009, Universal Studios released two complete series releases, one in original packaging, and the other enclosed in a reproduction of the &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; vintage &#x27;70s lunchbox; the only bonus feature was a look at the film starring Will Ferrell. On October 13, 2009, Universal released the three seasons individually; the DVDs are identical to Universal&#x27;s Complete Series Boxes. (However, the Region 4 version of the 2009 box set does include the commentaries and interviews, but not the look at the Ferrell film.) The series is also available in digital media format.

==Remakes==
Despite a relatively short run, the show continued to be aired extensively through syndication. Based on that success, a remake of the series began in 1991 and ran for two seasons.

In 2009, a feature film was released, which parodied the original series for adult audiences. It was directed by Brad Silberling and starred comedian Will Ferrell, with the Krofft brothers serving as co-producers.

In 2015, Sid and Marty Krofft reportedly were working on a reboot to &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; following what they called &quot;that other movie&quot;.
In a 2018 podcast interview with both Sid and Marty Krofft, they reconfirmed that they are still working on an updated remake of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; and that this time it will be an hour-long series.

<text>Sauvignon blanc () is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the city of Bordeaux in France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words &quot;sauvage&quot; (&quot;wild&quot;) and &quot;blanc&quot; (&quot;white&quot;) due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world&#x27;s wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria, the states of Oregon, Washington, and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called &quot;Fumé Blanc&quot;, a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fumé.

Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and &quot;green flavors&quot; of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risks losing much aroma from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.

Wine experts have used the phrase &quot;crisp, elegant, and fresh&quot; as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand. Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly chèvre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi.

Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young and does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.

The first Friday in May is International Sauvignon Blanc Day.

==History==

The Sauvignon blanc grape traces its origins to the Val de Loire region in France according to Jancis Robinson in her book &quot;Wine Grapes&quot;. The earliest recording was in 1534 by Francois Rabelais in his book, Gargantua. As noted above, it is not clear that the vine originated in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.

The first cuttings of Sauvignon blanc were brought to California by Charles Wetmore, founder of Cresta Blanca Winery, in the 1880s. These cuttings came from the Sauternes vineyards of Château d&#x27;Yquem. The plantings produced well in Livermore Valley. Eventually, the wine acquired the alias of Fumé Blanc in California by promotion of Robert Mondavi in 1968. The grape was first introduced to New Zealand in the 1970s as an experimental planting to be blended with Müller-Thurgau.

==Climate and geography==

The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, which allows it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to overwhelming heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than they have in the past.

The grape originated in France, in the regions of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. Plantings in California, Australia, Chile and South Africa are also extensive, and Sauvignon blanc is steadily increasing in popularity as white wine drinkers seek alternatives to Chardonnay. The grape can also be found in Italy and Central Europe.

==Wine regions==
===Australia===
In Australia, particularly the Margaret River region, the grape is often blended with Sémillon. Varietal styles, made from only the Sauvignon blanc grape, from Adelaide Hills and Padthaway have a style distinctive from their New Zealand neighbors that tend to be more ripe in flavor with white peach and lime notes and slightly higher acidity.

===Chile and Brazil===
In the early 1990s, ampelographers began to distinguish Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and more similar to the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes to be picked up to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.

===France===
In France, Sauvignon blanc is grown in the maritime climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) as well as the continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important in the development of the intensity of the wine&#x27;s aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the &quot;terroir&quot; characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the river Loire and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.

Pouilly Fumé originate from the town of Pouilly-sur-Loire, located directly across the Loire River from the commune of Sancerre. The soil here is very flinty with deposits of limestone, which the locals believed imparted a smoky, gunflint flavor to the wine, and hence &quot;Fumé&quot;, the French word for &quot;smoky&quot;, was attached to the wine. Along with Sémillon, Muscadelle and Ugni blanc, Sauvignon blanc is one of only four white grapes allowed in the production of white Bordeaux wine. Mostly used as a blending grape, Sauvignon blanc is the principal grape in Château Margaux&#x27;s &quot;Pavillon Blanc&quot;, In the northern Rhône Valley, Sauvignon Blanc is often blended with Tressallier to form a tart white wine.

In the Sauternes region, the grape is blended with Sémillon to make the late harvest wine, &quot;Sauternes&quot;. The composition of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the &quot;Premier Cru Supérieur&quot; Château d&#x27;Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc&#x27;s propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.

Near the edge of the Chablis commune is an AOC called Saint-Bris that is gaining attention for its Sauvignon blanc production.

===New Zealand===
In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc wines from the maritime climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough wine region, sandy soils over slate shingles have become the most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, and the types of harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.

The long narrow geography of the South Island ensures that no vineyard is more than from the coast. The cool, maritime climate of the area allows for a long and steady growing season in which the grapes can ripen and develop a natural balance of acids and sugars. This brings out the flavors and intensity that distinguish New Zealand Sauvignon blancs. More recently, Waipara in the South Island and Gisborne and Hawkes Bay in the North Island have been attracting attention for their Sauvignon blanc releases, which often exhibit subtle differences to those from Marlborough. The asparagus, gooseberry and green flavor commonly associated with New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is derived from flavor compounds known as methoxypyrazines that becomes more pronounced and concentrated in wines from cooler climate regions. Riper flavors such as passion fruit, along with other notes such as boxwood, may be driven by thiol concentrations.

===North America===

In North America, California is the leading producer of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in the Washington state and on the Short Hills Bench of the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape is also known as Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley&#x27;s Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more grassy undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.

===Other regions===
Sauvignon blanc is also beginning to gain prominence in areas like South Africa&#x27;s Stellenbosch and Durbanville and Italy&#x27;s Collio Goriziano areas. It is also one of the main ingredients in Muffato della Sala, one of Italy&#x27;s most celebrated sweet wines.

==Winemaking==

Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile harvest the grapes at various intervals for the different blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red &amp; green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals &quot;methoxypyrazines&quot;. Grapes grown in Marlborough&#x27;s Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.

Sauvignon blanc can be greatly influenced by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision is the amount of contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In the early years of the New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries in the South Island, which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.
Another important decision is the temperature of fermentation. French winemakers prefer warmer fermentations (around 16–18 °C) that bring out the mineral flavors in the wine while New World winemakers prefer slightly cooler temperatures to bring out more fruit and tropical flavors. A small minority of Loire winemakers will put the wine through malolactic fermentation, a practice more often associated with New Zealand wines. Oak aging can have a pronounced effect on the wine, with the oak rounding out the flavors and softening the naturally high acidity of the grape. Some winemakers, like those in New Zealand and Sancerre, prefer stainless steel fermentation tanks over barrels with the intention of maintaining the sharp focus and flavor intensity.

Sauvignon blanc can be combined with a variety of dishes as it is an easy approachable wine. If we are looking for light meat, it can be suitable for chicken or turkey. Sauvignon blanc is also excellent for seafood such as lobster, squid, and so on. It is a perfect complement to soft cheeses such as feta, chevre or buffalo mozzarella. Also for vegetable dishes that contain eggplant or zucchini and spices such as thyme or bay leaves.

<text>A master&#x27;s degree (from Latin ) is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master&#x27;s degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor&#x27;s level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master&#x27;s graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.

==Historical development==
===Medieval era to 18th century===
The master&#x27;s degree dates back to the origin of European universities, with a Papal bull of 1233 decreeing that anyone admitted to the mastership in the University of Toulouse should be allowed to teach freely in any other university. The original meaning of the master&#x27;s degree was thus that someone who had been admitted to the rank (degree) of master (i.e. teacher) in one university should be admitted to the same rank in other universities. This gradually became formalised as the (licence to teach). Originally, masters and doctors were not distinguished, but by the 15th century it had become customary in the English universities to refer to the teachers in the lower faculties (arts and grammar) as masters and those in the higher faculties as doctors. Initially, the Bachelor of Arts (BA) was awarded for the study of the trivium and the Master of Arts (MA) for the study of the quadrivium.

From the late Middle Ages until the 19th century, the pattern of degrees was therefore to have a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in the lower faculties and to have bachelor&#x27;s and doctorates in the higher faculties. In the United States, the first master&#x27;s degrees (, or Master of Arts) were awarded at Harvard University soon after its foundation. In Scotland, the pre-Reformation universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen) developed so that the Scottish MA became their first degree, while in Oxford, Cambridge and Trinity College Dublin, the MA was awarded to BA graduates of a certain standing without further examination from the late 17th century, its main purpose being to confer full membership of the university. At Harvard the 1700 regulations required that candidates for the master&#x27;s degree had to pass a public examination, but by 1835 this was awarded Oxbridge-style three years after the BA.

===19th century===
The 19th century saw a great expansion in the variety of master&#x27;s degrees offered. At the start of the century, the only master&#x27;s degree was the MA, and this was normally awarded without any further study or examination. The Master in Surgery degree was introduced by the University of Glasgow in 1815. By 1861 this had been adopted throughout Scotland as well as by Cambridge and Durham in England and the University of Dublin in Ireland. When the Philadelphia College of Surgeons was established in 1870, it too conferred the Master of Surgery, &quot;the same as that in Europe&quot;.

In Scotland, Edinburgh maintained separate BA and MA degrees until the mid-19th century, although there were major doubts as to the quality of the Scottish degrees of this period. In 1832 Lord Brougham, the Lord Chancellor and an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh, told the House of Lords that &quot;In England the Universities conferred degrees after a considerable period of residence, after much labour performed, and if they were not in all respects so rigorous as the statutes of the Universities required, nevertheless it could not be said, that Masters of Arts were created at Oxford and Cambridge as they were in Scotland, without any residence, or without some kind of examination. In Scotland, all the statutes of the Universities which enforced conditions on the grant of degrees were a dead letter.&quot;

It 1837, separate examinations were reintroduced for the MA in England, at the newly established Durham University (even though, as in the ancient English universities, this was to confer full membership), to be followed in 1840 by the similarly new University of London, which was only empowered by its charter to grant degrees by examination. However, by the middle of the century the MA as an examined second degree was again under threat, with Durham moving to awarding it automatically to those who gained honours in the BA in 1857, along the lines of the Oxbridge MA, and Edinburgh following the other Scottish universities in awarding the MA as its first degree, in place of the BA, from 1858. At the same time, new universities were being established around the then British Empire along the lines of London, including examinations for the MA: the University of Sydney in Australia and the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland in 1850, and the Universities of Bombay (now the University of Mumbai), Madras and Calcutta in India in 1857.

In the US, the revival of master&#x27;s degrees as an examined qualification began in 1856 at the University of North Carolina, followed by the University of Michigan in 1859, although the idea of a master&#x27;s degree as an earned second degree was not well established until the 1870s, alongside the PhD as the terminal degree. Sometimes it was possible to earn an MA either by examination or by seniority in the same institution; for example, in Michigan the &quot;in course&quot; MA was introduced in 1848 and was last awarded in 1882, while the &quot;on examination&quot; MA was introduced in 1859.

Probably the most important master&#x27;s degree introduced in the 19th century was the Master of Science (MS in the US, MSc in the UK). At the University of Michigan this was introduced in two forms in 1858: &quot;in course&quot;, first awarded in 1859, and &quot;on examination&quot;, first awarded in 1862. The &quot;in course&quot; MS was last awarded in 1876. In Britain, however, the degree took a while longer to arrive. When London introduced its Faculty of Sciences in 1858, the university was granted a new charter giving it the power &quot;to confer the several Degrees of Bachelor, Master, and Doctor, in Arts, Laws, Science, Medicine, Music&quot;, but the degrees it awarded in science were the Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Science. The same two degrees, again omitting the master&#x27;s, were awarded at Edinburgh, despite the MA being the standard undergraduate degree for Arts in Scotland. In 1862, a royal commission suggested that Durham should award master&#x27;s degrees in theology and science (with the suggested abbreviations MT and MS, contrary to later British practice of using MTh or MTheol and MSc for these degrees), but its recommendations were not enacted. In 1877, Oxford introduced the Master of Natural Science, along with the Bachelor of Natural Science, to stand alongside the MA and BA degrees and be awarded to students who took their degrees in the honours school of natural sciences. In 1879 a statute to actually establish the faculty of Natural Sciences at Oxford was promulgated, but in 1880 a proposal to rename the degree as a Master of Science was rejected along with a proposal to grant Masters of Natural Sciences a Master of Arts degree, in order to make them full members of the university. This scheme would appear to have then been quietly dropped, with Oxford going on to award BAs and MAs in science.

The Master of Science (MSc) degree was finally introduced in Britain in 1878 at Durham, followed by the new Victoria University in 1881. At the Victoria University both the MA and MSc followed the lead of Durham&#x27;s MA in requiring a further examination for those with an ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree but not for those with honours.

===20th century===
At the start of the 20th century, there were four different sorts of master&#x27;s degree in the UK: the Scottish MA, granted as a first degree; the Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin), granted to all BA graduates a certain period after their first degree without further study; master&#x27;s degrees that could be gained either by further study or by gaining an honours degree (which, at the time in the UK involved further study beyond the ordinary degree, as it still does in Scotland and some Commonwealth countries); and master&#x27;s degrees that could only be obtained by further study (including all London master&#x27;s degrees). In 1903, the &quot;London Daily News&quot; criticised the practice of Oxford and Cambridge, calling their MAs &quot;the most stupendous of academic frauds&quot; and &quot;bogus degrees&quot;. Ensuing correspondence pointed out that &quot;A Scotch M.A., at the most, is only the equivalent of an English B.A.&quot; and called for common standards for degrees, while defenders of the ancient universities said that &quot;the Cambridge M.A. does not pretend to be a reward of learning&quot; and that &quot;it is rather absurd to describe one of their degrees as a bogus one because other modern Universities grant the same degree for different reasons&quot;.

In 1900, Dartmouth College introduced the Master of Commercial Science (MCS), first awarded in 1902. This was the first master&#x27;s degree in business, the forerunner of the modern MBA. The idea quickly crossed the Atlantic, with Manchester establishing a Faculty of Commerce, awarding Bachelor and Master of Commerce degrees, in 1903. Over the first half of the century the automatic master&#x27;s degrees for honours graduates vanished as honours degrees became the standard undergraduate qualification in the UK. In the 1960s, new Scottish universities (except for Dundee, which inherited the undergraduate MA from St Andrews) reintroduced the BA as their undergraduate degree in arts, restoring the MA to its position as a postgraduate qualification. Oxford and Cambridge retained their MAs, but renamed many of their postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the higher faculties as master&#x27;s degrees, e.g. the Cambridge LLB became the LLM in 1982, and the Oxford BLitt, BPhil (except in philosophy) and BSc became the MLitt, MPhil and MSc.

In 1983, the Engineering Council issued a &quot;&#x27;Statement on enhanced and extended undergraduate engineering degree courses&quot;, proposing the establishment of a four-year first degree (Master of Engineering). These were up and running by the mid-1980s and were followed in the early 1990s by the MPhys for physicists and since then integrated master&#x27;s degrees in other sciences such as MChem, MMath, and MGeol, and in some institutions general or specific MSci (Master in Science) and MArts (Master in Arts) degrees. This development was noted by the Dearing Report into UK Higher Education in 1997, which called for the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and identified five different routes to master&#x27;s degrees:
* Four year (five in Scotland) first degrees in certain subjects, such as the MEng
* Conversion degrees, sometimes below the standard of undergraduate degrees in the same subject
* The honours arts undergraduate degree awarded by the four ancient universities of Scotland
* Postgraduate programmes, such as the MA, MSt and MSc
* The Oxford and Cambridge MA, and MA from Trinity College Dublin, awarded without additional study several years after the award of a BA.
This led to the establishment of the Quality Assurance Agency, which was charged with drawing up the framework.

===21st century===
In 2000, renewed pressure was put on Oxbridge MAs in the UK Parliament, with Labour MP Jackie Lawrence introducing an early day motion calling for them to be scrapped and telling the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; it was a &quot;discriminatory practice&quot; and that it &quot;devalues and undermines the efforts of students at other universities&quot;. The following month the Quality Assurance Agency announced the results of a survey of 150 major employers showing nearly two thirds mistakenly thought the Cambridge MA was a postgraduate qualification and just over half made the same error regarding the Edinburgh MA, with QAA chief executive John Randall calling the Oxbridge MA &quot;misleading and anachronistic&quot;.

The QAA released the first &quot;framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland&quot; in January 2001. This specified learning outcomes for M-level (master&#x27;s) degrees and advised that the title &quot;Master&quot; should only be used for qualifications that met those learning outcomes in full. It addressed many of the Dearing Report&#x27;s concerns, specifying that shorter courses at H-level (honours), e.g. conversion courses, should be styled Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate rather than as master&#x27;s degrees, but confirmed that the extended undergraduate degrees were master&#x27;s degrees, saying that &quot;Some Masters degrees in science and engineering are awarded after extended undergraduate programmes that last, typically, a year longer than Honours degree programmes&quot;. It also addressed the Oxbridge MA issue, noting that &quot;the MAs granted by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are not academic qualifications&quot;. The first &quot;framework for qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland&quot;, also published in January 2001, used the same qualifications descriptors, adding in credit values that specified that a stand-alone master should be 180 credits and a &quot;Masters (following an integrated programme from undergraduate to Masters level study)&quot; should be 600 credits with a minimum of 120 at M-level. It was specified that the title &quot;Master&quot; should only be used for qualifications that met the learning outcomes and credit definitions, although it was noted that &quot;A small number of universities in Scotland have a long tradition of labelling certain first degrees as &#x27;MA&#x27;. Reports of Agency reviews of such provision will relate to undergraduate benchmarks and will make it clear that the title reflects Scottish custom and practice, and that any positive judgement on standards should not be taken as implying that the outcomes of the programme were at postgraduate level.&quot;

The Bologna declaration in 1999 started the Bologna Process, leading to the creation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This established a three-cycle bachelor&#x27;s—master&#x27;s—doctorate classification of degrees, leading to the adoption of master&#x27;s degrees across the continent, often replacing older long-cycle qualifications such as the (arts), (sciences) and state registration (professional) awards in Germany. As the process continued, descriptors were introduced for all three levels in 2004, and ECTS credit guidelines were developed. This led to questions as to the status of the integrated master&#x27;s degrees and one-year master&#x27;s degrees in the UK. However, the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland have both been aligned with the overarching framework for the EHEA with these being accepted as masters-level qualifications.

==Titles==
Master&#x27;s degrees are commonly titled using the form &#x27;Master of ...&#x27;, where either a faculty (typically Arts or Science) or a field (Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Business Administration, etc.) is specified. The two most common titles of master&#x27;s degrees are the Master of Arts (MA/AM) and Master of Science (MSc//MS/SM) degrees, which normally consist of a mixture of research and taught material.

The title of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) indicates (in the same manner as Doctor of Philosophy) an extended degree with a large research component. Other generically named master&#x27;s programs include the Master of Studies (MSt)/Master of Advanced Study (MASt)/Master of Advanced Studies (M.A.S.), and Professional Master&#x27;s (MProf). Integrated master&#x27;s degrees and postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees oriented towards professional practice are often more specifically named for their field of study (&quot;tagged degrees&quot;), including, for example, Master of Business Administration, Master of Divinity, Master of Engineering, Master of Physics, and Master of Public Health.

The form &quot;Master in ...&quot; is also sometimes used, particularly where a faculty title is used for an integrated master&#x27;s degree in addition to its use in a traditional postgraduate master&#x27;s degree, e.g. Master in Science (MSci) and Master in Arts (MArts). This form is also sometimes used with other integrated master&#x27;s degrees and occasionally for postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees (e.g. Master&#x27;s in Accounting). Some universities use Latin degree names; because of the flexibility of syntax in Latin, the Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees may be known in these institutions as and or reversed from the English order to and . Examples of the reversed usage include Harvard University and the University of Chicago, leading to the abbreviations AM and SM for these degrees. The forms &quot;Master of Science&quot; and &quot;Master in Science&quot; are indistinguishable in Latin.

In the UK, full stops (periods) are not commonly used in degree abbreviations. In the US, The Gregg Reference Manual recommends placing periods in degrees (e.g. B.S., Ph.D.), while The Chicago Manual of Style recommends writing degrees without periods (e.g. BS, PhD).

Master of Science is generally abbreviated MS in countries following United States usage and MSc in countries following British usage, where MS would refer to the degree of Master of Surgery. In Australia, some extended master&#x27;s degrees use the title &quot;doctor&quot;: Juris doctor and Doctors of Medical Practice, Physiotherapy, Dentistry, Optometry and Veterinary Practice. Despite their titles these are still master&#x27;s degree and may not be referred to as doctoral degrees, nor may graduates use the title &quot;doctor&quot;.

===Types===
* Postgraduate/graduate master&#x27;s degrees (MA/AM, MPhil, MSc/MS/SM, MBA, LLM, MAsc, etc.) are the traditional formal form of master&#x27;s degree, where the student already holds an undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s) degree on entry. Courses normally last one year in the UK and two years in the US.
* Integrated master&#x27;s degrees (MChem, MEng, MMath, MPharm, MPhys, MPsych, MSci, etc.) are UK degrees that combine an undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degree course with an extra year at master&#x27;s level (i.e. a total of four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and five years in Scotland). A 2011 survey of UK Higher Education Institutes found that 64% offered integrated master&#x27;s course, mostly in STEM disciplines, with the most common degrees being MEng, MSci and MChem. 82% of respondents conferred only a master&#x27;s degree for the course, while 9% conferred a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the end of the bachelor&#x27;s-level stage and a master&#x27;s degree at the end of the course and a further 9% conferred both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees at the end of the course.
*Non-master&#x27;s level master&#x27;s degrees The ancient universities of the UK and Ireland have traditionally awarded MAs in a different manner to that usual today. The Scottish MA is a bachelor&#x27;s-level qualification offered by the four ancient universities of Scotland. The Oxbridge MA is not an academic qualification; it is granted without further examination to those who have gained a BA from Oxford or Cambridge Universities in England, and the MA of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland is granted to its graduates in a similar manner.

The UK Quality Assurance Agency defines three categories of master&#x27;s degrees:

* Research master&#x27;s degrees are primarily research based, although may contain taught elements, particularly on research methods. Examples are the MLitt (usually, but not always a research degree), the Master&#x27;s by Research, and the MPhil. The Master&#x27;s &quot;by&quot; Research (MbyRes, ResM), which is a research degree, is distinct from the Master &quot;of&quot; Research (MRes), which is a taught degree concentrating on research methods.
* Specialised or advanced study master&#x27;s degrees are primarily taught degrees, although commonly at least a third of the course is devoted to a research project assessed by dissertation. These may be stand-alone master&#x27;s courses, leading to, e.g., MSc, MA or MRes degrees, or integrated master&#x27;s degrees. 
* Professional or practice master&#x27;s degrees (see also professional degree) are designed to prepare students for a particular professional career and are primarily taught, although they may include work placements and independent study projects. Some may require professional experience for entry. Examples include MBA, MDiv, LLM and MSW as well as some integrated master&#x27;s degrees. The name of the degree normally includes the subject name.

The United States Department of Education classifies master&#x27;s degrees as research or professional. Research master&#x27;s degrees in the US (e.g., MA/AM or MS) require the completion of taught courses and examinations in a major and one or more minor subjects, as well as (normally) a research thesis. Professional master&#x27;s degrees may be structured like research master&#x27;s (e.g., ME/MEng) or may concentrate on a specific discipline (e.g., MBA) and often substitute a project for the thesis.

The Australian Qualifications Framework classifies master&#x27;s degrees as research, coursework or extended. Research master&#x27;s degrees typically take one to two years, and at least two-thirds of their content consists of research, research training and independent study. Coursework master&#x27;s degrees typically also last one to two years, and consist mainly of structured learning with some independent research and project work or practice-related learning. Extended master&#x27;s degrees typically take three to four years and contain significant practice-related learning that must be developed in collaboration with relevant professional, statutory or regulatory bodies.

In Ireland, master&#x27;s degrees may be either Taught or Research. Taught master&#x27;s degrees are normally one to two year courses, rated at 60 - 120 ECTS credits, while research master&#x27;s degrees are normally two year courses, either rated at 120 ECTS credits or not credit rated.

==Structure==
There is a range of pathways to the degree with entry based on evidence of a capacity to undertake higher level studies in a proposed field. A dissertation may or may not be required depending on the program. In general, structure and duration of a program of study leading to a master&#x27;s degree will differ by country and university.

===Duration===
Master&#x27;s programs in the US and Canada are normally two years (full-time) in length. In some fields/programs, work on a doctorate begins immediately after the bachelor&#x27;s degree, but a master&#x27;s degree may be granted along the way as an intermediate qualification if the student petitions for it. Some universities offer evening options so that students can work during the day and earn a master&#x27;s degree in the evenings.

In the UK, postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees typically take one to two years full-time or two to four years part-time. Master&#x27;s degrees may be classified as either &quot;research&quot; or &quot;taught&quot;, with taught degrees (those where research makes up less than half of the volume of work) being further subdivided into &quot;specialist or advanced study&quot; or &quot;professional or practice&quot;. Taught degrees (of both forms) typically take a full calendar year (180 UK credits, compared to 120 for an academic year), while research degrees are not typically credit rated but may take up to two years to complete. An MPhil normally takes two calendar years (360 credits). An &quot;integrated master&#x27;s degree&quot; (which is always a taught degree) combines a bachelor&#x27;s degree course with an additional year of study (120 credits) at master&#x27;s level for a four (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) or five (Scotland) academic year total period.

In Australia, master&#x27;s degrees vary from one year for a &quot;research&quot; or &quot;coursework&quot; master&#x27;s following on from an Australian honours degree in a related field, with an extra six months if following on straight from an ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree and another extra six months if following on from a degree in a different field, to four years for an &quot;extended&quot; master&#x27;s degree. At some Australian universities, the master&#x27;s degree may take up to two years.

In the Overarching Framework of Qualifications for the European Higher Education Area defined as part of the Bologna process, a &quot;second cycle&quot; (i.e. master&#x27;s degree) programme is typically 90–120 ECTS credits, with a minimum requirement of at least 60 ECTS credits at second-cycle level. The definition of ECTS credits is that &quot;60 ECTS credits are allocated to the learning outcomes and associated workload of a full-time academic year or its equivalent&quot;, thus European master&#x27;s degrees should last for between one calendar year and two academic years, with at least one academic year of study at master&#x27;s level. The Framework for Higher Education Qualification (FHEQ) in England Wales and Northern Ireland level 7 qualifications and the Framework for Qualification of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS) level 11 qualifications (postgraduate and integrated master&#x27;s degrees, except for MAs from the ancient universities of Scotland and Oxbridge MAs) have been certified as meeting this requirement.

Irish master&#x27;s degrees are one to two years (60–120 ECTS credits) for taught degrees and two years (not credit rated) for taught and research degrees. These have also been certified as compatible with the FQ-EHEA.

===Admission===
Admission to a master&#x27;s degree normally requires successful completion of study at bachelor&#x27;s degree level either (for postgraduate degrees) as a stand-alone degree or (for integrated degrees) as part of an integrated scheme of study. In countries where the bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours is the standard undergraduate degree, this is often the normal entry qualification. In addition, students will normally have to write a personal statement and, in the arts and humanities, will often have to submit a portfolio of work.

In the UK, students will normally need to have a 2:1. Students may also have to provide evidence of their ability to successfully pursue a postgraduate degree to be accepted into a taught master&#x27;s course, and possibly higher for a research master&#x27;s. Graduate schools in the US similarly require strong undergraduate performance, and may require students to take one or more standardised tests, such as the GRE, GMAT or LSAT.

In some European countries, a &quot;magister&quot; is a first degree and may be considered equivalent to a modern (standardized) master&#x27;s degree (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the German, Austrian and Polish university &quot;Diplom/Magister&quot;, or the similar five-year Diploma awarded in several subjects in Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, and other universities and polytechnics).

Under the Bologna Process, countries in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are moving to a three-cycle (bachelor&#x27;s - master&#x27;s - doctorate) system of degrees. Two-thirds of EHEA countries have standardised on 120 ECTS credits for their second-cycle (master&#x27;s) degrees, but 90 ECTS credits is the main form in Cyprus, Ireland and Scotland and 60-75 credits in Montenegro, Serbia and Spain. The combined length of the first and second cycle varies from &quot;3 + 1&quot; years (240 
ECTS credits), through &quot;3 + 2&quot; or &quot;4 + 1&quot; years (300 ECTS credits), to &quot;4 + 2&quot; years (360 ECTS credits). As of 2015, 31 EHEA countries have integrated programmes that combine the first and second cycle and lead to a second-cycle qualification (e.g. the UK integrated master&#x27;s degree), particularly in STEM subjects and subjects allied to medicine. These typically have a duration of 300 – 360 ECTS credits (five to six years), with the integrated master&#x27;s degrees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland being the shortest at 240 ECTS credits (four years).
* In Denmark there are two forms of master&#x27;s degree. The Master&#x27;s Degree or &quot;candidatus&quot; is a FQ-EHEA second-cycle qualification worth 120 ECTS credits. These degrees are research-based and offered through universities (e.g. University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School). The second form is the Master Degree (no possessive) within the adult continuing education system, which is worth 60 ECTS credits and is taught part-time. The candidatus degree is abbreviated cand. and upon completion of, for instance, an engineering master&#x27;s degree, a person becomes cand.polyt. (polytechnical). Similar abbreviations, inspired by Latin, apply to a large number of fields, e.g.: sociology (cand.scient.soc), economics (cand.merc., cand.polit. or cand.oecon), law (cand.jur), humanities (cand.mag) etc. Use of a cand. title requires a master&#x27;s degree. Holders of a cand. degree are also entitled to use MSc or MA titles, depending on the field of study. In Finland and Sweden, the title of &quot;kandidaatti/kandidat&quot; (abbreviated kand.) equates to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. 
* In France, the master&#x27;s degree (&quot;diplôme de master&quot;) takes two years and is worth 120 ECTS credits. The two years are often called the master 1 (M1) and master 2 (M2), following the Bologna Process. Depending on the goal of the student (a doctorate or a professional career) the master can also be called a &quot;Master Recherche&quot; (research master) or a &quot;Master Professionnel&quot; (professional master), each with different requirements.A French &quot;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; (postgraduate degree in engineering of &quot;grandes écoles&quot;) is also the equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree, provided the diploma is recognised by the Commission des titres d&#x27;ingénieur, as are qualifications recognised at Level 7 of the &quot;répertoire national des certifications professionnelles&quot; (national register of professional certificates).
* In Italy the master&#x27;s degree is equivalent to the two-year &quot;Laurea magistrale&quot;, which can be earned after a &quot;Laurea&quot; (a three-year undergraduate degree, equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree). In particular fields, namely law, pharmacy and medicine, this distinction is not made. University courses are therefore single and last five to six years, after which the master&#x27;s degree is awarded (in this case referred to as &quot;Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico&quot;). The old &quot;Laurea&quot; degree (Vecchio Ordinamento, Old Regulations), which was the only awarded in Italy before the Bologna process, is equivalent to the current Laurea Magistrale.
* In the Netherlands the titles &quot;ingenieur&quot; (ir.), &quot;meester&quot; (mr.) and &quot;doctorandus&quot; (drs.) may be rendered, if obtained in the Netherlands from a university, after the application of the Bologna process, as: MSc instead of ir., LLM instead of mr. and MA or MSc instead of drs. This is because a single program that led to these degree was in effect before 2002, which comprised the same course load as the bachelor and master programs put together. Those who had already started the program could, upon completing it, bear the appropriate title (MSc, LLM or MA), but alternatively still use the old-style title (ir., mr. or drs.), corresponding to their field of study. Since these graduates do not have a separate bachelor&#x27;s degree (which is – in retrospect – incorporated into the program), the master&#x27;s degree is their first academic degree. Bearers of foreign master&#x27;s degree can use the titles ir., mr. and drs. only after obtaining a permission to bear such titles from the Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs. Those who received their mr., ir. or drs. title after the application of the Bologna process have the option of signing as A. Jansen, MA or A. Jansen, MSc, depending on the field in which the degree was obtained, since the ir., mr. and drs. titles are similar to a master&#x27;s degree, and the shortcut MA or MSc may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title.
* In Belgium, the higher education system is governed by the communities and have separately implemented the Bologna Process. In Flanders, a master&#x27;s degree can be obtained when completing a two-year study at university (120 ECTS), although there also exist some master&#x27;s studies which only require 1 year of education (60 ECTS). This discrepancy has various reasons, but the main cause is the transition from the pre-Bologna Process degrees. Degrees like industrial engineering were previously not obtained through university and only took one year, but got transferred to universities, hence why the master&#x27;s degree for industrial engineering only takes one year at university currently. Similar situations arose for other one-year degrees obtained before 2013 and are therefore now converted to master&#x27;s degrees through a special certificate. Other master&#x27;s degrees, such as the degrees from the faculty of Arts and Literature are historically only one year, just like they were before the Bologna Process ratification. Master&#x27;s degrees for medicine take 3 years to be completed. The situation for the French Community of Belgium is similar in many ways, but has implemented it differently.
* In Switzerland, the old Licence or Diplom (4 to 5 years in duration) is considered equivalent to the master&#x27;s degree.
* In Slovenia and Croatia, during the pre-Bologna process education, all academic degrees were awarded after a minimum of four years of university studies and a successful defence of a written thesis and are considered equivalent to the master&#x27;s degree. After the completion of that first cycle of the pre-Bologna higher education, the students obtained professional degrees with the titles of Professor (abbreviation &quot;prof.&quot;) for educational studies, Engineer (abbreviation &quot;ing.&quot;) for technical studies, or Licensed professional of their field of expertise (abbreviation &quot;dipl.&quot; with a reference to the profession) for other studies. The title of Magister Scientiae (abbreviation &quot;mr. sc.&quot;) was awarded to students who completed a postgraduate university programme (and therefore qualified for a doctorate programme), while the title of Scientiae Doctor (abbreviation &quot;dr. sc.&quot;) was awarded to students who completed a postgraduate doctoral programme. Slovenia is a full member of the Bologna Process since 1999 and Croatia since 2001.
* In Baltic countries there is a two-year education program that offers a chance to gain a master&#x27;s degree in interdisciplinary issues. The system offers an education in different areas, such as humanities, environmental and social issues, whilst paying specific consideration to the Baltic Sea area. It is a joint-degree program, which is part of a team effort with four universities. There is for example the University of Tartu in Estonia, Vytautas Magnus University in Lithuania and the University of Latvia. The educational programmes allow students to be mobile within the system, for example one semester may be taken in a confederate school without paying additional membership or tuition fees. Subsequently, after passing the qualifications provided, people may procure teaching qualifications and continue their scholastic research around doctoral studies, or carry on studying within their career in the private or public sector. Graduates of the program, within the Baltic Sea area are also given the chance to continue onwards with their studies within the postgraduate system if they have studied the social sciences or humanities field.
* In Greece, the &quot;metaptychiako&quot; (μεταπτυχιακό) which literally translates as &quot;post-degree&quot; (...&quot;programme&quot; or &quot;title&quot;), lasts normally from one to, more often, two years, and can be studied after a, at least, four-years undergraduate &quot;ptychio&quot;, which means &quot;degree&quot;.Also, the five-year &quot;diploma&quot; (δίπλωμα) awarded in all Polytechnics (schools of engineering) and the Athens School of Fine Arts is considered equal to a graduate degree plus a master&#x27;s degree.
* In Russia master (&quot;магистр&quot;) degree can be obtained after a two-year master course (&quot;магистратура&quot;) which is available after a four-year bachelor or a five-year specialist course. A graduate may choose a master course completely different from his/her previous one. During these two years master students attend specialized lectures in chosen profile, choose a faculty advisor and prepare their master thesis which is eventually defended before certifying commission consisting mostly of professors, leading by the professor from another university.
* In the United Kingdom, first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science are considered equivalent to master&#x27;s degrees despite, for historical reasons, often having the titles of bachelor&#x27;s degrees.
* The old Spanish degrees of &quot;Licenciado&quot; (Licenciate), &quot;Arquitecto&quot; (Architect) and &quot;Ingeniero&quot; (Engineer) are also equivalent to master&#x27;s degrees. They were integrated programmes of study that combined first and second cycles and led to a second cycle qualification. The Spanish government issued a royal decree in 2014 establishing the official equivalences between the Spanish pre-Bologna degrees and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) levels. Most (if not all) &quot;Licenciado&quot;, &quot;Arquitecto&quot; and &quot;Ingeniero&quot; degrees were placed in level 7 (Master) of the EQF. These programmes have been phased out and replaced with the new Bologna programmes of &quot;Máster&quot;, to be completed after completion of a programme of &quot;Grado&quot; (Bachelor&#x27;s).

==Brazil==
After acquiring a Bachelor&#x27;s, Technologist or Licenciate Degree, students are qualified to continue their academic career through Master&#x27;s Degree (&quot;mestrado&quot;, in Portuguese, a.k.a. &quot;stricto sensu&quot; post-graduation) or Specialization Degree (&quot;especialização&quot;, in Portuguese, a.k.a. &quot;lato sensu&quot; post-graduation) programs. At the Master&#x27;s program there are 2–3 years of graduate-level studies. Usually focused on academic research, the Master&#x27;s Degree requires, on any specific knowledge area, the development of a thesis to be presented and defended before a board of professors after the period of research. Conversely, the Specialization Degree, also comprehends a 1–2 years studies, but does not require a new thesis to be proposed and defended, being usually attended by professionals looking for complementary training on a specific area of their knowledge.

In addition, many Brazilian universities offer an MBA program. However, those are not the equivalent to a United States MBA degree, as it does not formally certify the student with a Master&#x27;s degree (&quot;stricto sensu&quot;) but with a Specialization Degree (&quot;lato sensu&quot;) instead. A regular post-graduation course has to comply with a minimum of 360 class-hours, while an MBA degree has to comply with a minimum of 400 class-hours. Master&#x27;s degree (&quot;stricto sensu&quot;) does not require a set minimum of class-hours, but it is practically impossible to finish it in less than 18 months due to the workload and research required; an average time for the degree is 2.5 years. Specialization (&quot;lato sensu&quot;) and MBA degrees can be also offered as distance education courses, while the master&#x27;s degree (&quot;stricto-sensu&quot;) requires physical attendance. In Brazil, the degree often serves as additional qualification for those seeking to differentiate themselves in the job market, or for those who want to pursue a PhD It corresponds to the European (Bologna Process) 2nd Cycle or the North American master&#x27;s.

==Asia==
===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong requires one or two years of full-time coursework to achieve a master&#x27;s degree. For part-time study, two or three years of study are normally required to achieve a postgraduate degree.

As in the United Kingdom, the MPhil is the most advanced master&#x27;s degree and usually includes both a taught portion and a research portion which requires candidates to complete an extensive original research for their thesis. Regardless of subject, students in all faculties (including sciences, arts, humanities and social sciences) may be awarded the Master of Philosophy.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistani education system, there are two different master&#x27;s degree programmes. Master’s degrees are earned after having received a bachelor’s pass degree and one year after the honours degree. The master&#x27;s program generally lasts for two years.
* 2 years master&#x27;s programmes: these are mostly Master of Arts (MA) leading to MPhil/PhM
* 4 years master&#x27;s programmes: these are mostly Master of Science (MS) leading to PhD

Both MA and MS are offered in all major subjects.

===India===
In the Indian system, a master&#x27;s degree is a postgraduate degree following a Bachelor&#x27;s degree and preceding a Doctorate, usually requiring two years to complete. The available degrees include but are not limited to the following:

===Israel===
Postgraduate studies in Israel require the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree and is dependent upon this title&#x27;s grades; see Education in Israel#Higher education.
Degrees awarded are the MA, MSc, MBA and LLM; the Technion awards a non-thesis MEng.
There also exists &quot;a direct track&quot; doctorate degree, which lasts four to five years. Taking this route, students prepare a preliminary research paper during their first year, after which they must pass an exam before being allowed to proceed, at which point they are awarded a master&#x27;s degree.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, after completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree, students must spend at least three or four years studying full-time in college and university, with an entrance test for those who wish to pursue master&#x27;s, PhD, and doctorate degrees. All doctoral and PhD degrees, as well as third cycle degrees, are research and experience oriented, with a focus on results.

After completing a successful bachelor&#x27;s degree, students pursue master&#x27;s degrees in engineering, education, and arts, as well as all law and medicine-related courses.

MBBS is only a medical degree with six and a half years of study resulting in a medical doctor and must finish its study in four years after master&#x27;s degree with minimum education of 15 or 16 years of university bachelor&#x27;s degree education.

The following are the most professional and internationalized programs in Nepal: 
* Master of Business Administration (MBA)
* Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
* Master of Engineering (MEng)
* Master of Science (MSc)
* Master of Science in Information Technology (MScIT)
* Master of Business Studies (MBS)
* Master of Education (MEd)
* Master of Arts (MA)
* Master of Science in Agriculture (MScAg)
* Master of Laws (LLM)
* Master of Management (MM)

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, bachelor&#x27;s degree courses are about four years in length, while an entrance examination is required for people who want to study for master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates. The courses leading to these higher degrees are normally research-based.

Tuition is less expensive than would be the case in North America, costing as little as US$5000 for an MBA. As an incentive designed to increase foreign student numbers, the government and universities of Taiwan have redoubled their efforts to make a range of high-quality scholarships available in the form of university-specific scholarships that include tuition waivers of up to NT$20,000 per month. The government offers the Taiwan Scholarship amounting to NT$20,000–30,000 per month (US$654–981) for a two-year program.

<text>Poetry analysis is the process of investigating the form of a poem, content, structural semiotics, and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one&#x27;s own and others&#x27; understanding and appreciation of the work.

The words &quot;&quot; and &quot;poetry&quot; derive from the Greek &quot;poiēma&quot; (to make) and &quot;poieo&quot; (to create). One might think of a poem as, in the words of William Carlos Williams, a &quot;machine made of words.&quot; A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works.

There are many different reasons to analyze poetry. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to their students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen their own mastery. A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem. Finally, the full context of the poem might be analyzed in order to shed further light on the text, looking at such aspects as the author&#x27;s biography and declared intentions, as well as the historical and geographical contexts of the text (though Formalism would deny any significant analytical value for context).

==Overview==
===Meter and Rhyme===
One can derive pleasure from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet&#x27;s toolbox—meter and rhyme—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology. Consider, for example, the first stanza of Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot;:

:The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
:And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
:And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
:When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Byron&#x27;s use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud. The lines have a powerful, rolling, and very evident rhythm, and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore. In other words, the &quot;physicality&quot; of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem&#x27;s effect. The poem does not have a deep, hidden, symbolic meaning. Rather, it is simply pleasurable to read, say, and hear.

Critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for &quot;why&quot; the language is pleasurable, and &quot;how&quot; Byron achieved this effect. The lines are not simply rhythmic: the rhythm is regular within a line, and is the same for each line. A poem having a regular rhythm (not all poems do) is said to follow a certain meter. In &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib,&quot; each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable, with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line. Those basic patterns are called feet, and this particular pattern (weak weak STRONG) is called an anapest. A line with four feet is said to be in tetrameter (&quot;&quot;, from the Greek for four). Therefore, this poem is written in &quot;anapestic tetrameter&quot;. (This process of analyzing a poem&#x27;s rhythms is called scansion.) The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem&#x27;s language derives in part from Byron&#x27;s choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or rhyme scheme): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called couplets. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by alliteration, as in the repetition of &quot;s&quot; sounds in the third line: &quot;And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea&quot;.

==Tools==

===Poetic forms===
Poems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the sonnet (mostly made of a 14-line poem with a defined rhyme scheme) or limerick (usually a 5-line free rhyme poem with an AABBA rhyme scheme). Such poems exhibit closed form, meaning they have strict rules regarding their structure and length. Others (which exhibit open form) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem&#x27;s effect on the reading mind.

====Closed forms====
A poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the English language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets (sonnets, sestinas, limericks, and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside (Frost&#x27;s &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; is a good example).

Of all closed forms in English prosody, none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than blank verse, which is verse that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme. In English, iambic pentameter is by far the most frequently employed meter. Among the many exemplary works of blank verse in English are Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and most of the verse passages from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from Hamlet:

:To be, or not to be—that is the question.
:Whether &#x27;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
:Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
:And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep —
:No more, and by a sleep to say we end
:The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
:That flesh is heir to. &#x27;Tis a consummation
:Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
:To sleep—perchance to dream. Aye, there&#x27;s the rub.

Note that Shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line. Rather, most lines have five strong syllables, and most are preceded by a weak syllable. The meter provides a rhythm that informs the line: it is not an invariable formula.

Rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet. Two masters of the form are Alexander Pope and John Dryden. The form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot;.

:’Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
:Appear in writing or in judging ill;
:But, of the two, less dang’rous is th’ offence,
:To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
:Some few in that, but numbers err in this,
:Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
:A fool might once himself alone expose,
:Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

Fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a sonnet. There are two major variants. The form originated in Italy, and the word derives from &quot;sonetto&quot;, which is Italian for &quot;little song&quot;. The Italian sonnet or Petrarchan sonnet follows a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CD CD CD, ABBA ABBA CCE DDE, or ABBA ABBA CDD CEE. In each of these, a group of eight lines (the octave) is followed by a group of six (the sextet). Typically, the octave introduces a situation, idea, or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution. For example, consider Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of the Sea&quot;:

:The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,
:And round the pebbly beaches far and wide
:I heard the first wave of the rising tide
:Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep;
:A voice out of the silence of the deep,
:A sound mysteriously multiplied
:As of a cataract from the mountain&#x27;s side,
:Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.
:So comes to us at times, from the unknown
:And inaccessible solitudes of being,
:The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul;
:And inspirations, that we deem our own,
:Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing
:Of things beyond our reason or control.

The octave presents the speaker&#x27;s experience of the sound of the sea, coming to him from some distance. In the sestet, this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man&#x27;s connection to creation and his experience of the numinous.

English has (proportionally) far fewer rhyming words than Italian. Recognizing this, Shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to English by creating an alternate rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The poet using this, the English sonnet or Shakespearean sonnet form, may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought (as in &quot;The Silken Tent&quot; above), or treat the groups of four rhyming lines (the quatrains) as organizational units, as in Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 73:

:That time of year thou mayst in me behold
:When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
:Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
:Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.
:In me thou seest the twilight of such day
:As after sunset fadeth in the west,
:Which by and by black night doth steal away,
:Death&#x27;s second self, which seals up all in rest.
:In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
:That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
:As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
:Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
:This thou perceiv&#x27;st, which makes thy love more strong,
:To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

In lines 1–4, the speaker compares his time of life to autumn. In lines 5–8, the comparison is to twilight; in lines 9–12, the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire. Each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time, creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end, the death implied in the final couplet.

At the &quot;high end&quot; of closed forms are the sestina and villanelle. At the &quot;low end&quot; are forms such as the limerick, which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter (three anapests per line), followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter (two anapests per line), followed by one line of anapestic trimeter. (The beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line.) Any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick, however most also follow an AABBA rhyme scheme. Most limericks are humorous, and many are ribald, or outright obscene (possible rhymes that could follow an opening like &quot;There once was a man from Nantucket&quot; are left as an exercise for the reader). Nonetheless, the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression:

:Titian was mixing rose madder.
:His model posed nude on a ladder.
::Her position to Titian
::Suggested coition
:So he nipped up the ladder and had her.

==== Open forms ====
In contrast, a poet using free verse (sometimes called &quot;open form&quot;) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem, letting the structure grow out of the poem&#x27;s subject matter or inspiration. A common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form (Frost likened it to &quot;playing tennis with the net down&quot;, but such is not necessarily the case (skeptics should &quot;try&quot; playing tennis without a net): success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding. In the best open form poems, the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form. As X. J. Kennedy has said, &quot;Should the poet succeed, then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying&quot; (582). The metre of ‘classical’ poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm, line indentation, with pauses implied by the syntax, thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry, essential to an oral art form, composed to be read aloud.

Walt Whitman was an important innovator of open form, and he demonstrates its merits in &quot;A Noiseless Patient Spider.&quot;

:A noiseless patient spider,
:I marked where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
:Marked how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
:It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
:Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

:And you O my soul where you stand,
:Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
:Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
:Till the bridge you will need to be formed, till the ductile anchor hold,
:Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.

The long, rolling lines—unified, held together like strong cords, by alliteration and assonance—partake of the same nature as the spider&#x27;s filaments and the soul&#x27;s threads. Two balanced stanzas, one describing a spider, the other the speaker&#x27;s soul, perfectly frame the implicit comparison, with neither being privileged over the other. Just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance, the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words: isolated/detached, launched/fling, tirelessly/ceaselessly, surrounding/surrounded.

In this poem, Whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas, much like (but not exactly like) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems. The poem has form, but the form was not imposed by previous conventions. It has open form.

===Imagery and symbolism===
Most poetry can be read on several levels. The surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases (notably, the works of William McGonagall) there is little beyond the immediate. Allegory, connotation and metaphor are some of the subtler ways in which a poet communicates with the reader.

Before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance, however, the reader should establish the theme of the poem. What is the &#x27;story&#x27; that is being told? Not the literal story but the heart of the poem. For example: &quot;Another&quot; tells of a buried child; &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot; tells of the annihilation of an Assyrian army by divine intervention; &quot;The Silken Tent&quot; compares a woman to a tent. Part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem (who is speaking), and the rest of Kipling&#x27;s &quot;six honest serving men&quot;: the events in the poem; when these occur; where is the &#x27;speaker&#x27; and where do the events occur; why does the speaker speak? William Harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with: &quot;This poem dramatizes the conflict between ...&quot; is a key technique.

George Herbert in his poem &quot;Jordan (I)&quot; asks if poetry must be about the imaginary. The poem opens:

:Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair
:Become a verse? Is there in truth no beautie?
:Is all good structure in a winding stair?
:May no lines passe, except they do their dutie
:Not to a true, but painted chair?

He was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for pastoral poetry above all other forms (as becomes apparent in subsequent verses). Curiously, this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject. False hair and a painted chair are decorations of the mundane. The winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning. Herbert is criticising the overuse of allegory, symbolism or elaborate language.

For most poets—even the plain-speaking Herbert—metaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly. Some metaphors become so widely used that they are widely recognised symbols and these can be identified by using a specialist dictionary.

Allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work. It was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century English but a more recent example is Charles Williams&#x27; &quot;The Masque of the Manuscript&quot;, in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth. Allegories are usually readily apparent because of the heavy use of metaphor within them.

The symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor. Often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations. For example, the word &quot;sheen&quot; in &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot; has stronger connotations of polishing, of human industry, than does the similar &quot;shine&quot;. The Assyrians did not simply choose shiny metal; they worked to make it so. The word hints at a military machine.

Other tropes that may be used to increase the level of allusion include irony, litotes, simile, and metonymy (particularly synecdoche).

===Meter and rhythm===
English language poetic meter depends on stress, rather than the number of syllables. It thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages, such as French, where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount. This often makes scansion (the analysis of metrical patterns) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to English students of the craft.

In the final analysis, the terms of scansion are blunt instruments, clumsy ways of describing the infinitely nuanced rhythms of language. Nonetheless, they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems (especially those employing closed form).

The terms fall into two groups: the names of the different feet, and the names of the varying line lengths.

The most common feet in poetry written in English are the iamb (weak STRONG), the anapest (weak weak STRONG), the trochee (STRONG weak), and the dactyl (STRONG weak weak). The iamb and anapest are known as &quot;rising meters&quot; (they move &quot;up&quot; from weak to strong syllables); the trochee and dactyl are &quot;falling meters&quot; (they move &quot;down&quot; from strong to weak). Less common, but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line, are the monosyllabic foot (weak) and the spondee (STRONG STRONG).

The terms for line length follow a regular pattern: a Greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root &quot;meter&quot; (for &quot;measure&quot;): monometer, dimeter, trimeter, tetrameter, pentameter, hexameter, heptameter, and octameter (lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare).

Another useful term is caesura, for a natural pause within a line.

Meter and line length are not formulas for successful lines of poetry. They are rough forms of notation for the many satisfying and variable rhythms of language. Slavish adherence to meter produces doggerel. Skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length, and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect, as Robert Browning does in the first line of &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;:

:That&#x27;s my last Duchess painted on the wall.

The opening spondees, which throw the iambic line out of pattern, gives the Duke&#x27;s words a certain virulent energy: he&#x27;s spitting the words out.

Gerard Manley Hopkins took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme, with his theory and practice of sprung rhythm, an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind&#x27;s expectation of a regular meter.

===Sound, tone, diction, and connotation===
Analyzing diction and connotation—the meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry—is a good place to start for any poem. The use of specific words in the poem serve to create a tone—an attitude taken towards the subject. For example, consider the words &quot;slither&quot; and &quot;sneak.&quot; When used in a poem, the words conjure up images of a snake. The sibilant &quot;s&quot; sound reinforces the image. The connotations of the words suggest something surreptitious and undercover. From the tone, one can infer that the author is suspicious or fearful of the subject.

A detached tone, or an opposite tone than the reader would expect, are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response. In the opening lines of &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, T. S. Eliot quickly sets a certain tone, and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone:

:Let us go then, you and I,
:When the evening is spread out against the sky
:Like a patient etherized upon a table

===Visual and concrete poetry===

Poets such as E. E. Cummings experiment with punctuation and the words&#x27; layout on a page. In doing so, they venture into a realm of poetry that really cannot be read aloud: it can only be experienced through the eye.

:l(a

:le
:af
:fa

:ll

:s)
:one
:l

:iness

Cummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements. To analyze the poem, the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units: a brief, evocative image—&quot;a leaf falls&quot;—appearing, like an unbidden thought, in the middle of a word, &quot;loneliness&quot;. A single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness, but in order to fully experience the poem, the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which Cummings arranged them: a vertical line (like a leaf falling to the ground), followed by a horizontal series of letters (like a leaf laying flat on the ground). The vertical line is dominated by the word &quot;one&quot; (an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness) and by the letter &quot;l&quot; (which, on the page, looks like the numeral 1... it looks like &quot;one&quot;).

Numerous other poets, including George Herbert, Lewis Carroll, William Blake, Wyndham Lewis, and John Hollander have used the layout of words, letters, and images on the page to create effect in their poems. An analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind.

==Approaches==

===Schools of poetry===

There are many different &#x27;schools&#x27; of poetry: oral, classical, romantic, modernist, etc. and they each vary in their use of the elements described above.

Schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them (such as Imagism) or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet (for example The Movement). To be a &#x27;school&#x27; a group of poets must share a common style or a common ethos. A commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school; for example, Edward Lear, George du Maurier and Ogden Nash do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks.

===Schools of criticism===

Poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself, with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as Plato. At various times and places, groups of like-minded readers and scholars have developed, shared, and promoted specific approaches to poetry analysis.

The New Criticism dominated English and American literary criticism from the 1920s to the early 1960s. The New Critical approach insists on the value of close reading and rejects extra-textual sources. The New Critics also rejected the idea that the work of a critic or analyst is to determine an author&#x27;s intended meaning (a view formalized by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley as the intentional fallacy). The New Critics prized ambiguity, and tended to favor works that lend themselves to multiple interpretations.

Reader-response criticism developed in Germany and the United States as a reaction to New Criticism. It emphasises the reader&#x27;s role in the development of meaning.

Reception theory is a development of reader-response criticism that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response.

===Reading poetry aloud===
All poetry was originally oral, it was sung or chanted; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances, but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes.
Poems may be read silently to oneself, or may be read aloud solo or to other people. Although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles, few people find it surprising in the case of poetry.

In fact, many poems reveal themselves fully only when they are read aloud. The characteristics of such poems include (but are not limited to) a strong narrative, regular poetic meter, simple content and simple form. At the same time, many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;, for example. Poems that read aloud well include:

*&quot;The Frog&quot;, by Jean Dao

<text>The desert climate or arid climate (in the Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot; and &quot;BWk&quot;) is a dry climate sub-type in which there is a severe excess of evaporation over precipitation. The typically bald, rocky, or sandy surfaces in desert climates are dry and hold little moisture, quickly evaporating the already little rainfall they receive. Covering 14.2% of Earth&#x27;s land area, hot deserts are the second-most common type of climate on Earth after the Polar climate.

There are two variations of a desert climate according to the Köppen climate classification: a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), and a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;). To delineate &quot;hot desert climates&quot; from &quot;cold desert climates&quot;, a mean annual temperature of is used as an isotherm so that a location with a &quot;BW&quot; type climate with the appropriate temperature above this isotherm is classified as &quot;hot arid subtype&quot; (&quot;BWh), and a location with the appropriate temperature below the isotherm is classified as &quot;cold arid subtype&quot; (&quot;BWk).

Most desert/arid climates receive between of rainfall annually, although some of the most consistently hot areas of Central Australia, the Sahel and Guajira Peninsula can be, due to extreme potential evapotranspiration, classed as arid with the annual rainfall as high as .

==Precipitation==
Although no part of Earth is known for certain to be rainless, in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, the average annual rainfall over 17 years was only . Some locations in the Sahara Desert such as Kufra, Libya, record an even drier of rainfall annually. The official weather station in Death Valley, United States reports annually, but in 40 months between 1931 and 1934 a total of just of rainfall was measured.

To determine whether a location has an arid climate, the precipitation threshold is determined. The precipitation threshold (in millimetres) involves first multiplying the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then adding 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun summer half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or 140 if 30–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received there. If the area&#x27;s annual precipitation is less than half the threshold (50%), it is classified as a &quot;BW&quot; (desert climate), while 50–100% of the threshold results in a semi-arid climate.

==Hot desert climates==
Hot desert climates (&quot;BWh&quot;) are typically found under the subtropical ridge in the lower middle latitudes or the subtropics, often between 20° and 33° north and south latitudes. In these locations, stable descending air and high pressure aloft clear clouds and create hot, arid conditions with intense sunshine. Hot desert climates are found across vast areas of North Africa, West Asia, northwestern parts of the Indian Subcontinent, southwestern Africa, interior Australia, the Southwestern United States, northern Mexico, sections of southeastern Spain, the coast of Peru, and Chile. This makes hot deserts present in every continent except Antarctica.

At the time of high sun (summer), scorching, desiccating heat prevails. Hot-month average temperatures are normally between , and midday readings of are common. The world&#x27;s absolute heat records, over , are generally in the hot deserts, where the heat potential can be the highest on the planet. This includes the record of in Death Valley, which is currently considered the highest temperature recorded on Earth. Some deserts in the tropics consistently experience very high temperatures all year long, even during wintertime. These locations feature some of the highest annual average temperatures recorded on Earth, exceeding , up to nearly in Dallol, Ethiopia. This last feature is seen in sections of Africa and Arabia. During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, temperatures rarely drop far below freezing under the hot subtype.

Hot desert climates can be found in the deserts of North Africa such as the wide Sahara Desert, the Libyan Desert or the Nubian Desert; deserts of the Horn of Africa such as the Danakil Desert or the Grand Bara Desert; deserts of Southern Africa such as the Namib Desert or the Kalahari Desert; deserts of West Asia such as the Arabian Desert, or the Syrian Desert; deserts of South Asia such as Dasht-e Lut and Dasht-e Kavir of Iran or the Thar Desert of India and Pakistan; deserts of the United States and Mexico such as the Mojave Desert, the Sonoran Desert or the Chihuahuan Desert; deserts of Australia such as the Simpson Desert or the Great Victoria Desert and many other regions. In Europe, the hot desert climate can only be found on southeastern coast of Spain as well as small inland parts of southeastern, especially parts of the Tabernas Desert.
Hot deserts are lands of extremes: most of them are among the hottest, the driest, and the sunniest places on Earth because of nearly constant high pressure; the almost permanent removal of low-pressure systems, dynamic fronts, and atmospheric disturbances; sinking air motion; dry atmosphere near the surface and aloft; the exacerbated exposure to the sun where solar angles are always high makes this desert inhospitable to most species.

==Cold desert climates==
Cold desert climates (&quot;BWk&quot;) usually feature hot (or warm in a few instances), dry summers, though summers are not typically as hot as hot desert climates. Unlike hot desert climates, cold desert climates tend to feature cold, dry winters. Snow tends to be rare in regions with this climate. The Gobi Desert in northern China and Mongolia is one example of a cold desert. Though hot in the summer, it shares the freezing winters of the rest of Inner Asia. Summers in South America&#x27;s Atacama Desert are mild, with only slight temperature variations between seasons. Cold desert climates are typically found at higher altitudes than hot desert climates and are usually drier than hot desert climates.


Cold desert climates are typically located in temperate zones in the 30s and 40s latitudes, usually in the leeward rain shadow of high mountains, restricting precipitation from the westerly winds. An example of this is the Patagonian Desert in Argentina, bounded by the Andes ranges to its west. In the case of Central Asia, mountains restrict precipitation from the eastern monsoon. The Kyzyl Kum, Taklamakan and Katpana Desert deserts of Central Asia are other significant examples of &quot;BWk&quot; climates. The Ladakh region and the city of Leh in the Great Himalayas in India also have a cold desert climate. In North America, the cold desert climate occurs in the drier parts of the Great Basin Desert and the Bighorn Basin in Big Horn and Washakie County in Wyoming. The Hautes Plaines, located in the northeastern section of Morocco and in Algeria, is another prominent example of a cold desert climate. In Europe, this climate only occurs in some inland parts of southeastern Spain, such as in Lorca.

Polar climate desert areas in the Arctic and Antarctic regions receive very little precipitation during the year owing to the cold, dry air freezing most precipitation. Polar desert climates have desert-like features that occur in cold desert climates, including intermittent streams, hypersaline lakes, and extremely barren terrain in unglaciated areas such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. These areas are generally classified as having polar climates because they have average summer temperatures below even if they have some characteristics of extreme non-polar deserts.

<text>In statistics, the Gauss–Markov theorem (or simply Gauss theorem for some authors) states that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has the lowest sampling variance within the class of linear unbiased estimators, if the errors in the linear regression model are uncorrelated, have equal variances and expectation value of zero. The errors do not need to be normal, nor do they need to be independent and identically distributed (only uncorrelated with mean zero and homoscedastic with finite variance). The requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. See, for example, the James–Stein estimator (which also drops linearity), ridge regression, or simply any degenerate estimator.

The theorem was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov, although Gauss&#x27; work significantly predates Markov&#x27;s. But while Gauss derived the result under the assumption of independence and normality, Markov reduced the assumptions to the form stated above. A further generalization to non-spherical errors was given by Alexander Aitken.

==Scalar Case Statement==
Suppose we are given two random variable vectors, formula_1 and that we want to find the best linear estimator of formula_2 given formula_3, using the best linear estimator
formula_4 
Where the parameters formula_5 and formula_6 are both real numbers.

Such an estimator formula_7 would have the same mean and standard deviation as formula_8, that is, formula_9.

Therefore, if the vector formula_10 has respective mean and standard deviation formula_11, the best linear estimator would be

formula_12 

since formula_7 has the same mean and standard deviation as formula_2.

==Statement==
Suppose we have, in matrix notation, the linear relationship
:formula_15
expanding to,
:formula_16

where formula_17 are non-random but unobservable parameters, formula_18 are non-random and observable (called the &quot;explanatory variables&quot;), formula_19 are random, and so formula_20 are random. The random variables formula_19 are called the &quot;disturbance&quot;, &quot;noise&quot; or simply &quot;error&quot; (will be contrasted with &quot;residual&quot; later in the article; see errors and residuals in statistics). Note that to include a constant in the model above, one can choose to introduce the constant as a variable formula_22 with a newly introduced last column of X being unity i.e., formula_23 for all formula_24. Note that though formula_25 as sample responses, are observable, the following statements and arguments including assumptions, proofs and the others assume under the only condition of knowing formula_26 but not formula_27

The Gauss–Markov assumptions concern the set of error random variables, formula_19:

*They have mean zero: formula_29
*They are homoscedastic, that is all have the same finite variance: formula_30 for all formula_31 and
*Distinct error terms are uncorrelated: formula_32

A linear estimator of formula_33 is a linear combination

:formula_34

in which the coefficients formula_35 are not allowed to depend on the underlying coefficients formula_17, since those are not observable, but are allowed to depend on the values formula_37, since these data are observable. (The dependence of the coefficients on each formula_18 is typically nonlinear; the estimator is linear in each formula_39 and hence in each random formula_40 which is why this is &quot;linear&quot; regression.) The estimator is said to be unbiased if and only if

:formula_41

regardless of the values of formula_37. Now, let formula_43 be some linear combination of the coefficients. Then the mean squared error of the corresponding estimation is

:formula_44

in other words, it is the expectation of the square of the weighted sum (across parameters) of the differences between the estimators and the corresponding parameters to be estimated. (Since we are considering the case in which all the parameter estimates are unbiased, this mean squared error is the same as the variance of the linear combination.) The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the vector formula_45 of parameters formula_46 is one with the smallest mean squared error for every vector formula_47 of linear combination parameters. This is equivalent to the condition that

:formula_48

is a positive semi-definite matrix for every other linear unbiased estimator formula_49.

The ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) is the function

:formula_50

of formula_51 and formula_3 (where formula_53 denotes the transpose of formula_10) that minimizes the sum of squares of residuals (misprediction amounts):

:formula_55

The theorem now states that the OLS estimator is a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). 

The main idea of the proof is that the least-squares estimator is uncorrelated with every linear unbiased estimator of zero, i.e., with every linear combination formula_56 whose coefficients do not depend upon the unobservable formula_45 but whose expected value is always zero.

=== Remark ===
Proof that the OLS indeed &quot;minimizes&quot; the sum of squares of residuals may proceed as follows with a calculation of the Hessian matrix and showing that it is positive definite. 

The MSE function we want to minimize is 
formula_58
for a multiple regression model with &quot;p&quot; variables. The first derivative is 
formula_59
where formula_53 is the design matrix 
formula_61

The Hessian matrix of second derivatives is 
formula_62

Assuming the columns of formula_3 are linearly independent so that formula_64 is invertible, let formula_65, then 
formula_66

Now let formula_67 be an eigenvector of formula_68. 

formula_69

In terms of vector multiplication, this means 
formula_70
where formula_71 is the eigenvalue corresponding to formula_72. Moreover, 
formula_73

Finally, as eigenvector formula_72 was arbitrary, it means all eigenvalues of formula_68 are positive, therefore formula_68 is positive definite. Thus, 
formula_77
is indeed a global minimum.

Or, just see that for all vectors formula_78. So the Hessian is positive definite if full rank.

==Proof==
Let formula_79 be another linear estimator of formula_45 with formula_81 where formula_82 is a formula_83 non-zero matrix. As we&#x27;re restricting to &quot;unbiased&quot; estimators, minimum mean squared error implies minimum variance. The goal is therefore to show that such an estimator has a variance no smaller than that of formula_84 the OLS estimator. We calculate:

:formula_85

Therefore, since formula_86 is unobservable, formula_87 is unbiased if and only if formula_88. Then:

:formula_89

Since formula_90 is a positive semidefinite matrix, formula_91 exceeds formula_92 by a positive semidefinite matrix.

===Remarks on the proof===
As it has been stated before, the condition of formula_93 is a positive semidefinite matrix is equivalent to the property that the best linear unbiased estimator of formula_94 is formula_95 (best in the sense that it has minimum variance). To see this, let formula_96 another linear unbiased estimator of formula_94.

:formula_98

Moreover, equality holds if and only if formula_99. We calculate

:formula_100

This proves that the equality holds if and only if formula_101 which gives the uniqueness of the OLS estimator as a BLUE.

==Generalized least squares estimator==
The generalized least squares (GLS), developed by Aitken, extends the Gauss–Markov theorem to the case where the error vector has a non-scalar covariance matrix. The Aitken estimator is also a BLUE.

==Gauss–Markov theorem as stated in econometrics==

In most treatments of OLS, the regressors (parameters of interest) in the design matrix formula_102 are assumed to be fixed in repeated samples. This assumption is considered inappropriate for a predominantly nonexperimental science like econometrics. Instead, the assumptions of the Gauss–Markov theorem are stated conditional on formula_102.

===Linearity===

The dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the variables specified in the model. The specification must be linear in its parameters. This does not mean that there must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The independent variables can take non-linear forms as long as the parameters are linear. The equation formula_104 qualifies as linear while formula_105 can be transformed to be linear by replacing formula_106 by another parameter, say formula_107. An equation with a parameter dependent on an independent variable does not qualify as linear, for example formula_108, where formula_109 is a function of formula_110.

Data transformations are often used to convert an equation into a linear form. For example, the Cobb–Douglas function—often used in economics—is nonlinear:
:formula_111

But it can be expressed in linear form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

: formula_112

This assumption also covers specification issues: assuming that the proper functional form has been selected and there are no omitted variables.

One should be aware, however, that the parameters that minimize the residuals of the transformed equation do not necessarily minimize the residuals of the original equation.

===Strict exogeneity===
For all formula_113 observations, the expectation—conditional on the regressors—of the error term is zero:
:formula_114
where formula_115 is the data vector of regressors for the &quot;i&quot;th observation, and consequently formula_116 is the data matrix or design matrix.

Geometrically, this assumption implies that formula_117 and formula_118 are orthogonal to each other, so that their inner product (i.e., their cross moment) is zero.
:formula_119
This assumption is violated if the explanatory variables are measured with error, or are endogenous. Endogeneity can be the result of , where causality flows back and forth between both the dependent and independent variable. Instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem.

===Full rank===
The sample data matrix formula_102 must have full column rank.
:formula_121
Otherwise formula_122 is not invertible and the OLS estimator cannot be computed.

A violation of this assumption is perfect multicollinearity, i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent. One scenario in which this will occur is called &quot;dummy variable trap,&quot; when a base dummy variable is not omitted resulting in perfect correlation between the dummy variables and the constant term.

Multicollinearity (as long as it is not &quot;perfect&quot;) can be present resulting in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate. The estimates will be less precise and highly sensitive to particular sets of data. Multicollinearity can be detected from condition number or the variance inflation factor, among other tests.

===Spherical errors===
The outer product of the error vector must be spherical.
:formula_123
This implies the error term has uniform variance (homoscedasticity) and no serial correlation. If this assumption is violated, OLS is still unbiased, but inefficient. The term &quot;spherical errors&quot; will describe the multivariate normal distribution: if formula_124 in the multivariate normal density, then the equation formula_125 is the formula for a ball centered at μ with radius σ in n-dimensional space.

Heteroskedasticity occurs when the amount of error is correlated with an independent variable. For example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income. Low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. Heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. For example, as statistical offices improve their data, measurement error decreases, so the error term declines over time.

This assumption is violated when there is autocorrelation. Autocorrelation can be visualized on a data plot when a given observation is more likely to lie above a fitted line if adjacent observations also lie above the fitted regression line. Autocorrelation is common in time series data where a data series may experience &quot;inertia.&quot; If a dependent variable takes a while to fully absorb a shock. Spatial autocorrelation can also occur geographic areas are likely to have similar errors. Autocorrelation may be the result of misspecification such as choosing the wrong functional form. In these cases, correcting the specification is one possible way to deal with autocorrelation.

When the spherical errors assumption may be violated, the generalized least squares estimator can be shown to be BLUE.

<text>Sprite comics are webcomics that consist primarily of computer sprites from video games. Art assets are ripped from various classic games such as &quot;Mega Man&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, are edited and combined by amateur cartoonists, and are posted on the internet. Popularized by &quot;Bob and George&quot; in the early 2000s, the style is considered relatively easy for beginning cartoonists to get involved in, but sprite comics are generally looked down upon for being of low quality. The format has not seen mainstream attention since &quot;8-bit Theater&quot; concluded in 2010.

==History==
The 1998 webcomic &quot;Neglected Mario Characters&quot; was the first sprite comic to appear on the internet, though &quot;Bob and George&quot; was the first sprite comic to gain widespread popularity. Starting its run in 2000, &quot;Bob and George&quot; utilizes sprites from the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series of games, with most of the characters being taken directly from the games. &quot;Bob and George&quot; played a significant role in the popularity of sprite comics, as well as webcomics in general.

Art assets were ripped from Super NES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance games and were collected in online databases such as The Spriters Resource. A platform game such as &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; may contain hundreds of sprites of its protagonist running, jumping, and falling, though cartoonists frequently recolored characters or edited them to convey a broader range of emotion. Over time, sprite comic creators collaborated with projects such as the World Spriters Tournament, in which cartoonists let their sprite comic characters fight one another.

Few sprite comics have gained mainstream attention since &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; ended in 2010. Though sprite comics are still popular among amateur cartoonists, Larry Cruz from &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; noted that the aesthetic is played out.

== Style==
Sprite comics mainly use graphics from 1980s video games, such as &quot;Mega Man&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Lore Sjöberg from &quot;Wired&quot; stated that sprite comics &quot;re-create the feel of [such games] with a minimum of artistic effort.&quot; &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;″s Mike Krahulik pointed out that sprite comics are a good way for people who can&#x27;t draw well to create comics. Cruz pointed out that the aesthetic has &quot;evolved and flourished in a variety of media&quot; since. However, the style is also commonly criticized. Cruz described sprite comics as &quot;the favorite style for the laziest webcomic creators,&quot; while Sjöberg pointed out that sprite comics are often seen as substandard by comic fans. Both Chris Dlugosz and Michael Zole (&quot;Death to the Extremist&quot;) have criticized the style, Zole stating that creators of sprite comics &quot;seem to think that they&#x27;re scoring humor points just by reusing old pixelated characters,&quot; and Dlugosz devoting his webcomic &quot;Pixel&quot; explicitly to making fun of the practice.

In a review of the webcomic &quot;Kid Radd&quot;, Dani Atkinson of &quot;Sequential Tart&quot; noted that people without a gamer background may find that &quot;much of the irony and humour in [sprite comics] goes swooshing over [their] head.&quot; However, she also praised &quot;Kid Radd&quot; specifically for using original sprites, unique to the webcomic, allowing for a broader audience. She described this as a &quot;fake&quot; sprite comic.

==Legal situation==
Sprite comics are threatened by legal action, as the graphical sprites used in them are generally protected by copyright. Many sprite comics present themselves as parodies of the works they are based on, and as such they might be protected under fair use. However, seeing as many sprite comics have developed substantial plot-driven stories featuring the copyrighted characters and environments, it is quite possible that a sprite comic creator would lose a lawsuit if a game developer decided to sue. Thus far, no sprite comic has been subject to legal action. Capcom has stated that they will never &quot;officially endorse&quot; sprite comics, but no take-down request has ever taken place.

<text>Carol Lani Guinier ( ; April 19, 1950 – January 7, 2022) was an American educator, legal scholar, and civil rights theorist. She was the Bennett Boskey Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, and the first woman of color appointed to a tenured professorship there. Before coming to Harvard in 1998, Guinier taught at the University of Pennsylvania Law School for ten years. Her scholarship covered the professional responsibilities of public lawyers, the relationship between democracy and the law, the role of race and gender in the political process, college admissions, and affirmative action. In 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Guinier to be United States Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, but withdrew the nomination.

==Early life and career==
Carol Lani Guinier was born on April 19, 1950, in New York City, to Eugenia &quot;Genii&quot; Paprin and Ewart Guinier. Ewart, who was born in Panama to Jamaican parents and raised in Panama and Boston, was one of two black students admitted to Harvard College in 1929. He was forced to drop out in 1931, unable to afford school after he was excluded from financial aid and campus housing, but he ultimately returned to Harvard as a professor and the first chair of the Afro-American Studies Department in 1969. Paprin, an Ashkenazi-Jewish civil-rights activist, graduated from Hunter College in 1939.
Guinier&#x27;s parents met in Hawaii Territory, where each was a member of the Communist Party of Hawaii and of the Hawaii Civil Rights Congress. Guinier&#x27;s father was also a national officer for the United Public Workers of America, a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) union. Her uncle was real estate developer and social activist Maurice Paprin. Guinier moved with her family to Hollis, Queens, in 1956.

Guinier said that she wanted to be a civil rights lawyer since she was twelve years old, after she watched on television as Constance Baker Motley helped escort James Meredith, the first black American to enroll in the University of Mississippi. After graduating third in her class from Andrew Jackson High School, Guinier earned her B.A. from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1971 and her J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1974. She clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, then served as special assistant to Assistant Attorney General Drew S. Days in the Civil Rights Division during the Carter Administration. She was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1981, and after Ronald Reagan took office, she joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF) as an assistant counsel, eventually becoming head of its Voting Rights project. She was a highly successful litigator for LDF, winning 31 of the 32 cases she argued. She also worked on the successful extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982.

==Nomination for Assistant Attorney General==
Guinier was President Bill Clinton&#x27;s nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in April 1993. Conservative journalists and Republican senators mounted a campaign against Guinier&#x27;s nomination. Guinier was dubbed a &quot;quota queen,&quot; a phrase first used in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed by Clint Bolick, a Reagan-era U.S. Justice Department official. The term was perceived by some to be racially loaded, combining the &quot;welfare queen&quot; stereotype with &quot;quota,&quot; a buzzword used to challenge affirmative action. In fact, Guinier opposed racial quotas, as she attempted to make clear, responding to the misrepresentation of her views by invoking her father&#x27;s experience at Harvard: &quot;He was a victim of a racial quota, a quota of one. I have never been in favor of quotas. I could not be, knowing my father&#x27;s experience.&quot; As one reviewer of her work wrote: &quot;The remedies Guinier advocates for diluted minority voting rights do not include laws that guarantee election outcomes for disadvantaged groups.&quot;

Some journalists also alleged that Guinier&#x27;s writings indicated that she supported the shaping of electoral districts to ensure a black majority, a process known as &quot;race-conscious districting.&quot; Political science and law professor Carol M. Swain argued that Guinier was in favor of &quot;segregating black voters in black-majority districts.&quot; Guinier was portrayed as a racial polarizer who believed—in the words of George Will—that &quot;only blacks can properly represent blacks.&quot;

In the face of the negative media attention, many Democratic senators, including David Pryor of Arkansas, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois (the only African American serving in the Senate at that time), informed Clinton that Guinier&#x27;s interviews with senators were going poorly and urged him to withdraw Guinier&#x27;s nomination.

Clinton withdrew Guinier&#x27;s nomination on June 4, 1993. He stated that Guinier&#x27;s writings &quot;clearly lend themselves to interpretations that do not represent the views I expressed on civil rights during the [presidential] campaign.&quot; Guinier, for her part, acknowledged that her writings were often &quot;unclear and subject to vastly different interpretations,&quot; but believed that the political attacks had distorted and caricatured her academic philosophies. William T. Coleman Jr., who had served as Secretary of Transportation under President Gerald Ford, wrote that the withdrawal was &quot;a grave [loss], both for President Clinton and the country. The President&#x27;s yanking of the nomination, caving in to shrill, unsubstantiated attacks, was not only unfair, but some would say political cowardice.&quot;

==Civil rights theories==
===Alternative voting systems===
In her publications, Guinier suggested various strategies for strengthening minority groups&#x27; voting power, and rectifying what she characterized as an unfair voting system, not just for racial minorities, but for all numerical minority groups, including fundamentalist Christians, the Amish, or, in states such as Alabama, Democrats. Guinier also stated that she did not advocate for any single procedural rule, but rather that all alternatives should be considered in the context of litigation &quot;&quot;after&quot; the court finds a legal violation.&quot;

Some of the ideas she considered are:
*cumulative voting, a system in which each voter has &quot;the same number of votes as there are seats or options to vote for, and they can then distribute their votes in any combination to reflect their preferences&quot;—a system often used on corporate boards in 30 states, as well as by school boards and county commissions
*multi-member &quot;superdistricts,&quot; a strategy that &quot;modifies winner-take-all majority rule to require that something more than a bare majority of voters must approve or concur before action is taken.&quot;

Guinier&#x27;s idea of cumulative voting was taken up by Roslyn Fuller as a potential way of protecting minority rights without compromising One Man, One Vote principles.

===Revising affirmative action===
From 2001 until her death, Guinier was active in civil rights in higher education, coining the term &quot;confirmative action&quot; to reconceptualize issues of diversity, fairness, and affirmative action. The process of confirmative action, she said, &quot;ties diversity to the admissions criteria for all students, whatever their race, gender, or ethnic background—including people of color, working-class whites, and even children of privilege.&quot;

Because public and private institutions of higher learning are almost all to some extent publicly funded (i.e., federal student loans and research grants), Guinier argued that the nation has a vested interest in seeing that all students have access to higher education and that these graduates &quot;contribute as leaders in our democratic polity.&quot; By linking diversity to merit, Guinier argued that preferential treatment of minority students &quot;confirms the public character and democratic missions of higher-education institutions. Diversity becomes relevant not only to the college&#x27;s admissions process but also to its students&#x27; educational experiences and to what its graduates actually contribute to American society.&quot;

===&quot;Political race&quot;===
Developing a concept of &quot;political race,&quot; Guinier argued that if viewed as a resource from which to develop social critique, attention to exclusions based on race had the potential to produce broad and democratizing effects. In &quot;The Miner&#x27;s Canary: Enlisting Race, Resisting Power, Transforming Democracy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2002), Guinier and co-author Gerald Torres used the analogy of racial minorities as the canary in the coal mine, alerting others to risks in the environment. As one &quot;New York Times&quot; review put it, they argue for &quot;reforms based on initiatives that are begun by minority groups but move beyond racial issues because they address the needs of other disadvantaged groups.&quot; One examplar Torres and Guinier cite is the way that &quot;Hopwood v. Texas&quot;, an anti-affirmative action lawsuit, ultimately inspired reform that enlarged college access for all Texas students following minority activists&#x27; research on admissions. They found that the majority of admissions to the state&#x27;s top colleges came from a handful of the state&#x27;s high schools, prompting a reform that required the colleges to admit the top 10 percent of all high schools. The &quot;Times&quot; review concluded, &quot;The goal of reaching such truly evenhanded solutions is what this book generously holds out.&quot;

==Academic career==
===Teaching===
Guinier began her career in academics in 1989 as a Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. It was there that she took her experience with the Voting Rights Project of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and began theorizing on reforming the voting system. She spent 10 years at University of Pennsylvania Law School before joining Harvard Law School in 1998 as the school&#x27;s first woman of color to be granted tenure. She regularly lectured at various other law schools and universities including Yale, Stanford, New York University (NYU), UT Austin, Berkeley, UCLA, Rice, and University of Chicago. In 2007 she was a visiting professor at Columbia Law School, and in 2009 she was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.

Guinier took emerita status at Harvard in 2017.

===Publications===
Guinier authored over two dozen law review articles, as well as five books:

==Personal life and death==
Guinier married Nolan Bowie in 1986. They had one son, Nikolas Bowie, who is also a Harvard law professor.

Guinier died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at a care facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 7, 2022, at the age of 71.

==Honors==
During her lifetime, Guinier was honored with the Champion of Democracy Award from the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus; the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award from the American Bar Association (ABA) Commission on Women in the Profession (1995); and the Rosa Parks Award from the American Association of Affirmative Action. She was also awarded the 1994 Harvey Levin Teaching Award at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the 2002 Sacks-Freund Award for Teaching Excellence from Harvard Law School. In 2015 she was awarded the &quot;Deborah W. Meier Hero in Education Award&quot; from Fairtest. In 2017, she was awarded a Champion of Democracy Award from Fair Vote. In 2021, she received Yale Law School’s highest honor, the Award of Merit.

She received eleven honorary degrees, from schools including Hunter College, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Smith College, Spelman College, Swarthmore College, and Bard College. In 2007 she delivered the Yale Law School Fowler Harper Lecture, entitled &quot;The Political Representative as Powerful Stranger: Challenges for Democracy.&quot;

<doc id="170362" wikidata="Q93717" url="?curid=170362" title="Cold reading">
<text>Cold reading is a set of techniques used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, and mediums. Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader can quickly obtain a great deal of information by analyzing the person&#x27;s body language, age, clothing or fashion, hairstyle, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, level of education, manner of speech, place of origin, etc. during a line of questioning. Cold readings commonly employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not. The reader then emphasizes and reinforces any accurate connections while quickly moving on from missed guesses. Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the Barnum effect and due to confirmation biases within people.

== Basic procedure ==
Before starting the actual reading, the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject, saying something such as, &quot;I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you.&quot; One of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions. While the reader will do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning.

After determining that the subject is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem to come from the reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.

Subtle cues such as changes in facial expression or body language can indicate whether a particular line of questioning is effective or not. Combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly (also called &quot;hot reading&quot;) can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject. Because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the &quot;hits&quot; the reader obtains, while the time spent recognizing &quot;misses&quot; is minimized, the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could.

James Underdown from Center for Inquiry and Independent Investigations Group said, &quot;In the context of a studio audience full of people, cold reading is not very impressive.&quot; Underdown explains cold reading from a mathematical viewpoint. A typical studio audience consists of approximately 200 people, divided up into three sections. A conservative estimate assumes each person knows 150 people. Underdown says:

Mentalist Mark Edward relates from personal experience as a &quot;psychic performer&quot; how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience &quot;claims&quot; a phrase such as a &quot;clown in a graveyard&quot; statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, &quot;Does that mean anything to someone?&quot; whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that &quot;she&quot; knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing to get her to understand that he was &quot;not&quot; directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal, and the situation so odd, she felt that he was talking to her directly.

== Specific techniques ==
=== Shotgunning ===
&quot;Shotgunning&quot; is a commonly used cold reading technique. This technique is named after the manner in which a shotgun fires a cluster of small projectiles in the hope that one or more of them will strike the target.

The cold reader slowly offers a huge quantity of very general information, often to an entire audience (some of which is very likely to be correct, near correct or, at the very least, provocative or evocative to someone present), observes their subjects&#x27; reactions (especially their body language), and then narrows the scope, acknowledging particular people or concepts and refining the original statements according to those reactions to promote an emotional response. A majority of people in a room will, at some point for example, have lost an older relative or known at least one person with a common name like &quot;Mike&quot; or &quot;John&quot;.

Shotgunning might include a series of vague statements such as:
;&quot;I see a heart problem with a father-figure in your family.&quot;
:A vast variety of medical problems have chest pain as a symptom, and heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. &quot;Father-figure&quot; can refer to somebody&#x27;s father, grandfather, uncle, cousin, or any male relative who is also a parent or has served in a parental role to the person.
;&quot;I see a woman with blackness in the chest, lung cancer, heart disease, breast cancer...&quot;
:Most people will know a woman who was diagnosed with one of these problems, which are among the leading causes of illness and death.
;&quot;I sense an older male figure in your life, who wants you to know while you may have had disagreements in your life, he still loved you.&quot;
:Nearly all people will have had such a person in their lives, and nearly all of them will have had a disagreement.

=== The Forer effect (Barnum statements) ===
The Forer effect relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives, often searching their entire life&#x27;s history to find some connection, or reinterpreting statements in a number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves.

&quot;Barnum statements&quot;, named after P. T. Barnum, the American showman, are statements that seem personal, yet apply to many people. And while seemingly specific, such statements are often open-ended or give the reader the maximum amount of &quot;wiggle room&quot; in a reading. They are designed to elicit identifying responses from people. The statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person. A talented and charismatic reader can sometimes even bully a subject into admitting a connection, demanding over and over that they acknowledge a particular statement as having some relevance and maintaining that they are just not thinking hard enough, or are repressing some important memory.

Statements of this type might include:
* &quot;I sense that you are sometimes insecure, especially with people you don&#x27;t know very well.&quot;
* &quot;You have a box of old unsorted photographs in your house.&quot;
* &quot;You had an accident when you were a child involving water.&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re having problems with a friend or relative.&quot;
* &quot;Your father passed on due to problems in his chest or abdomen.&quot;

Regarding the last statement, if the subject is old enough, their father is quite likely to have died, and this statement would easily apply to a large number of medical conditions including heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, emphysema, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney failure, most types of cancer, as well as any cause of death in which cardiac arrest precedes death, or damage to the brainstem responsible for cardiopulmonary function.

==== Warm reading ====

Warm reading is a performance tool used by professional mentalists and psychic scam artists. While hot reading is the use of foreknowledge and cold reading works on reacting to the subject&#x27;s responses, warm reading refers to the judicious use of Barnum effect statements.

When these psychological tricks are used properly, the statements give the impression that the mentalist, or psychic scam artist, is intuitively perceptive and psychically gifted. In reality, the statements fit nearly all of humanity, regardless of gender, personal opinions, age, epoch, culture, or nationality.

Michael Shermer gives the example of jewelry worn by those in mourning. Most people in this situation will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost, but if asked directly in the context of a psychic reading whether they have such an item, the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one. Robert Todd Carroll notes in &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; that some would consider this to be cold reading.

=== The rainbow ruse ===
The rainbow ruse is a crafted statement which simultaneously awards the subject a specific personality trait, as well as the opposite of that trait. With such a phrase, a cold reader can &quot;cover all possibilities&quot; and appear to have made an accurate deduction in the mind of the subject, despite the fact that a rainbow ruse statement is vague and contradictory. This technique is used since personality traits are not quantifiable, and also because nearly everybody has experienced both sides of a particular emotion at some time in their lives.

Statements of this type include:
* &quot;Most of the time you are positive and cheerful, but there has been a time in the past when you were very upset.&quot;
* &quot;You are a very kind and considerate person, but when somebody does something to break your trust, you feel deep-seated anger.&quot;
* &quot;I would say that you are mostly shy and quiet, but when the mood strikes you, you can easily become the center of attention.&quot;

A cold reader can choose from a variety of personality traits, think of its opposite, and then bind the two together in a phrase, vaguely linked by factors such as mood, time, or potential.

== Contrasting claims of performers ==
The mentalist branch of the stage-magician community approves of &quot;reading&quot; as long as it is presented strictly as an artistic entertainment and one is not pretending to be psychic.

Some performers who use cold reading are honest about their use of the technique. Lynne Kelly, Kari Coleman, Ian Rowland, and Derren Brown have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum &quot;talking with the dead&quot; sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine mediums. Only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance, only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading.

In an episode of his &quot;Trick of the Mind&quot; series broadcast in March 2006, Derren Brown showed how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating Bertram Forer&#x27;s famous demonstration of the &quot;personal validation fallacy&quot;, or &quot;Forer effect&quot;.
==Sitter misremembering==
In a detailed review of four sittings conducted by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all statements made by him on the TV show &quot;Hollywood Medium&quot;. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter felt that their reading was highly successful. In interviews with each sitter after their sitting, all four claimed specific statements made by Henry, but, after reviewing the show, it was shown that he had not made those statements. Each sitter had misremembered what Henry said. One of many examples of this was when Henry, during a session with celebrity Ross Mathews, stated &quot;Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi?&quot; Mathews stated that his father, who was a hunter, would not shoot deer because of the movie &quot;Bambi&quot;. In the post-interview, Mathews stated that &quot;It was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi&quot;, demonstrating that Mathews did not remember that he, not Henry, had supplied the connection to his father.

Gerbic has pointed out the broader issue of the human brain attempting to make connections that then make it appear that the psychic was correct. She lists this among a number of techniques or situations that psychics take advantage of.

== Subconscious cold reading ==
Former New Age practitioner Karla McLaren has spoken of the importance of reducing the appearance of unusual expertise that might create a power differential; posing observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to &quot;lean into the reading&quot; and give her more pertinent information.

After some people have performed hundreds of readings, their skills may improve to the point where they may start believing they can read minds. They may ask themselves if their success is because of psychology, intuition or a psychic ability. This point of thought is known by some skeptics of the paranormal as the &quot;transcendental temptation&quot;. Magic historian and occult investigator Milbourne Christopher has warned that the transcendental choice may lead one unknowingly into a belief in the occult and a deterioration of reason.

==In media==

* &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan) utilizes both cold reading and hot reading techniques on Dorothy (Judy Garland) in an effort to urge her to return home.
* &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (1947). Depicted ex-carny and aspiring cult leader Stanton Carlisle (Tyrone Power) using cold reading and other mentalist techniques to convince people he can communicate with the dead. The film was based on the William Lindsay Gresham novel of the same name. The novel was again adapted into a movie in 2021 and depicts many aspects of cold reading delineated in the above article.
* In &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; (1989), Irwin Fletcher uses a very heavy-handed version of cold reading to pass himself off as a faith healer during a televangelist praise meeting.
* &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (1992). Early in the film, revival tent evangelist and phony faith healer Jonas Nightengale (Steve Martin) uses cold reading on a police officer who has pulled over his tour bus, to dissuade him from writing a ticket.
* &quot;The Biggest Douche in the Universe&quot; (&quot;South Park&quot; episode, 2002). Stan Marsh, one of the main characters in the animated comedy series, has an encounter with self-proclaimed psychic John Edward after attending a taping of Edward&#x27;s TV show &quot;Crossing Over&quot;. Stan then uses cold reading on some passers-by in an attempt to convince his friend Kyle Broflovski that Edward is a fake, only to be mistaken for a child psychic and given his own competing TV show. This leads to a &quot;psychic showdown&quot; between Stan and Edward. Eventually, aliens arrive and declare Edward &quot;The Biggest Douche in the Universe&quot; for exploiting people&#x27;s grief to gain TV ratings.
* &quot;High Spirits with Shirley Ghostman&quot; (2005). BBC TV show in which character comedian Marc Wootton portrays a spoof psychic who parodies the typical cold reading techniques used on an unsuspecting audience.
* &quot;Psych&quot; (2006). Shawn Spencer, the main character in the show, uses cold reading to convince detectives that he has psychic abilities while actually using logic, reason, keen observation skills, and an eidetic memory to solve cases.
* &quot;The Mentalist&quot; (2008). The main character is someone who formerly used cold readings to pretend to be psychic, and now uses cold reading to assist him in solving criminal cases, especially when interviewing witnesses and possible suspects. His interactions with past clients are sometimes the subjects of episodes and he often tutors his colleagues and other individuals in the tools of his trade to teach them that &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as psychics.&quot;
* &quot;Leverage&quot; (2010). In Series 2 Episode 13 &quot;The Future Job&quot;, Dalton Rand (Luke Perry) is a con artist who uses both hot reading (information gathering) and cold reading to convince an audience that he can communicate with the dead. The cold reading methods he uses are exposed by the team.
* &quot;Now You See Me&quot; (2013). One of the Four Horsemen, Merritt McKinley (Woody Harrelson), is a mentalist who uses cold reading (along with hypnotism) to assist in extortion and his illusion act.
* Comedian John Oliver addressed the topic during an episode of his talk show &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; on February 24, 2019. In the segment, Oliver criticized the media for enabling psychics who prey on grieving families, and explained the techniques of cold reading and hot reading. On cold reading, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s like asking a room full of praying mantises: Has anybody here lost a loved one because you ate them after having sex?. You know that all those little green hands are going up. (...) The broader the generality, the higher the chance it resonates with someone – basically, it&#x27;s a magic trick, and yet prominent, smart people are willing to cosign on psychics&#x27; abilities.&quot;

<text>Tristan da Cunha is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha and has a history going back to the beginning of the 16th century. It was settled by men from military garrisons and ships, who married native women from Saint Helena and the Cape Colony. Its people are multi-racial, descended from European male founders and mixed-race (African, Asian and European) and African women founders.

== Discovery ==

The uninhabited islands of Tristan da Cunha were first sighted in May 1506 during a voyage to India by the Portuguese admiral Tristão da Cunha, although rough seas prevented a landing. He named the main island after himself, &quot;Ilha de Tristão da Cunha&quot;, which was later anglicised to Tristan da Cunha Island. His discovery appeared on nautical maps from 1509 and on Mercator&#x27;s world map of 1541. Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing on Tristan in 1520, when the &quot;Lás Rafael&quot; captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called for water.

== 17th century ==
Though far west of the Cape of Good Hope, the islands were on the preferred route from Europe to the Indian Ocean in the 17th century; ships first crossed the Atlantic to Brazil on the Northeasterly Trades, followed the Brazil Current south to pass the Doldrums, and then picked up the Westerlies to cross the Atlantic again, where they could encounter Tristan da Cunha. The Dutch East India Company required their ships to follow this route, and on 17 February 1643 the crew of the &quot;Heemstede&quot;, captained by Claes Gerritszoon Bierenbroodspot, made the first confirmed landing. The &quot;Heemstede&quot; replenished their supplies with fresh water, fish, seals and penguins and left a wooden tablet with the inscription &quot;Today, 17 February 1643, from the Dutch fluyt Heemstede, Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot from Hoorn and Jan Coertsen van den Broec landed here.&quot;.

Thereafter, the Dutch East India Company returned to the area four more times to explore whether the islands could function as a supply base for their ships. The first stop was on 5 September 1646 on a voyage to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and the second was an expedition by the galliot &quot;Nachtglas&quot; (Nightglass), which left from Cape Town on 22 November 1655. The crew of the &quot;Nachtglas&quot; noticed the tablet left by the &quot;Heemstede&quot; on 10 January 1656 near a watering place. They left a wooden tablet themselves as well, like they also did on &quot;Nachtglas Eijland&quot; (now Inaccessible Island). The &quot;Nachtglas&quot;, commanded by Jan Jacobszoon van Amsterdam, examined Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island and made rough charts for the Dutch East India Company. Dutch sailors also stayed on the island for four weeks in 1658, and made their last stop in April 1669, when their idea of utilizing the islands as a supply base was abandoned, probably due to the absence of a safe harbour.

In the 17th century ships were also sent from Saint Helena by the English East India Company to Tristan to report on a proposed settlement there, but that project also came to nothing.

== 18th century ==
The first survey of the archipelago was made by the French corvette &quot;Heure du Berger&quot; in 1767. Soundings were taken and a rough survey of the coastline was made. The presence of water at the large waterfall of Big Watron and in a lake on the north coast were noted, and the results of the survey were published by a Royal Navy hydrographer in 1781.

A British naval officer who visited the group in 1760 gave his name to Nightingale Island. John Patten, the master of an English merchant ship, and part of his crew lived on Tristan from August 1790 to April 1791, during which time they captured 3600 seals.

The first known attempt to climb Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak was in 1793 by the French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, but this was without success. He did collect and catalogue hundreds of plants from this expedition.

== 19th century ==

During this time American whalers frequented the neighboring waters, and in December 1810 an American named Jonathan Lambert &quot;late of Salem, mariner and citizen thereof,&quot; along with an Italian named Thomas Currie (anglicized version) and another named Williams, made Tristan their home, establishing the first permanent settlement on the island. Lambert declared himself sovereign and sole possessor of the group (which he renamed Islands of Refreshment) &quot;grounding my right and claim on the rational and sure ground of absolute occupancy&quot;. Lambert&#x27;s sovereignty was short lived, as he and Williams were drowned while out fishing in May 1812. Currie was joined, however, by two other men and they began to cultivate vegetables, wheat and oats, and breed pigs.

War having broken out in 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom, the islands were largely used as a base by American cruisers sent to prey on British merchant ships. This and other considerations urged by Lord Charles Somerset, then governor of Cape Colony, led the British government to authorize taking &quot;possession&quot; of the islands as dependencies of the Cape. The formal proclamation of annexation was made on 14 August 1816. The British wanted to ensure that the French, their repeated enemies, would not be able to use the islands as a base for a rescue operation to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his prison on Saint Helena. Attempts to colonize Inaccessible Island failed.

The islands were occupied by a garrison of British Marines, and a civilian population was gradually built up. Whalers also set up on the islands as a base for operations in the Southern Atlantic.

In January 1817 the first successful climb was made to the peak of Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak.

A small garrison was maintained on Tristan until November 1817. At their own request William Glass (d. 1853), a Scottish corporal from Kelso in the Royal Artillery, was left behind with his wife, two children and, two masons. Thus was begun the present settlement. From time to time additional settlers arrived or shipwrecked mariners decided to remain. In 1827 they persuaded five coloured women (these were of mixed race: African, Asian and European) from Saint Helena to migrate to Tristan to become the wives of the five desperate bachelors then on the island. Later, African women from Cape Colony married residents in the island. Other male settlers were of Dutch and Italian origin. As a consequence of this history, the inhabitants are of mixed race. DNA studies have shown that the founding men were primarily of European ancestry.

Glass ruled over the little community from 1817 to 1853 in patriarchal fashion. Besides raising crops, the settlers possessed numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs. Their most lucrative occupation was seal-fishing. The island was still frequented by American whalers. In 1856, 25 people emigrated to the United States, out of a total island population of about 100. The next year 45 of the inhabitants removed to Cape Colony. Since then other younger or more restless members of the community have emigrated there; some took to a seafaring life.

The inhabitants settled on the plain on the north-west of Tristan, as it was the only level land. Here a number of substantial stone cottages and a church were built. 
After the death of Glass, the head of the community for some time was a man named Cotton, who had served on a man of war ship, and for three years had been guard over Napoleon at Saint Helena. Cotton was succeeded by Peter William Green (anglicised from Pieter Willemszoon Groen), a native of Katwijk aan Zee, who had settled in the island in 1836. During Green&#x27;s &quot;reign,&quot; the economic condition of Tristan suffered by the loss of ship traffic of the whalers. This was largely due to the outbreak of the American Civil War diverting resources. In addition, the Confederate cruisers CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, captured and burned many Union whaling ships. As a result, the number of ships calling at Tristan considerably diminished and trade languished.

With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, together with the gradual transition from sailing ships to coal-fired steam ships, the isolation of the islands increased. They were no longer needed as a stopping port for sailing journeys from Europe to the Far East. Most ships went through the canal for a shorter route.

In 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands. The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, was named in honour of his visit.

In October 1873 the islands were carefully surveyed by the celebrated expedition of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;. Captain George Nares recorded that upon the ship&#x27;s arrival, the men of Tristan came forward offering potatoes, albatross eggs, and other provisions to his crew. The Captain recorded a total of 15 families and 86 individuals living on the island. This expedition also aided two German brothers named Stoltenhoff, in moving to the mainland at Cape Town. They had been living on Inaccessible Island since November 1871. They were the only ones to have attempted colonization of any island except the main one.

In 1880 the population appears to have attained its maximum. In 1885 the islanders encountered disaster. A poor winter had left them short of food, and a boat sent to barter with a ship offshore was lost with all hands—fifteen men. Only four adult males were left on the island. At the same time a plague of rats—survivors of a shipwrecked vessel—wrought much havoc among the crops. The British government planned to remove all the inhabitants to the Cape, but the majority preferred to remain. Stores and provisions were sent out to them by the British government.

The ravages of the rats rendered the growing of wheat impossible; the wealth of the islanders now consisted of their cattle, sheep, potatoes, and apple and peach trees, and the only form of currency was the potato. The population in 1897 was only 64; in 1901 it was 74, and in 1909, 95.

Tristan da Cunha&#x27;s residents managed their own affairs without any written laws. The inhabitants have been described as moral, religious, hospitable to strangers, well-mannered and industrious, healthy and long-lived. They lack intoxicating liquors and were said to commit no crimes. , there have been no divorces. They were daring sailors, and in small canvas boats of their own building voyage to Nightingale and Inaccessible islands. They knit garments from the wool of their sheep, are good carpenters, and make serviceable carts.

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel recruited the first missionary to the island, Rev. William F. Taylor, who served from 1851 to 1856. After his departure, the Bishop of St. Helena attempted to establish an Anglican mission on the island from 1866 onward, and this post was finally filled by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s youngest brother, the Reverend Edwin Heron Dodgson, who arrived on the island 25 February 1881. Shortly after his arrival he recorded 16 families and 107 individuals living on the island. Reverend Dodgson returned to England in February 1885 and attempted to arrange for the evacuation of the Tristan, meeting with Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, citing dangerous isolation, but the evacuation was deemed impracticable. Following a disaster at sea that killed fifteen islanders, a large proportion of the working men, Dodgson returned to Tristan in 1886 and remained until December 1889.

== 20th century ==
In 1906 the islanders passed through a period of distress owing to great mortality among the cattle and the almost total failure of the potato crop. The majority again refused, however, to desert the island, though offered allotments of land in Cape Colony. Similar proposals were made and declined several times since the question was first mooted in 1886.

A series of Anglican missionaries served the island parish: Rev. J. G. Barrow and his wife Katherine (1906–1909), Rev. H. M. Rogers and his wife Rose Annie (1922–1925), Rev. R. A. C. Pooley (1927–1929), Rev. A. G. Partridge (1929–1932), Rev. Harold Wilde (1934–1940).
On 12 January 1938, by Letters Patent, the islands were declared a dependency of Saint Helena. Prior to this, passing ships stopped irregularly at the island for a period of mere hours.

During World War II, the islands were used as a top secret Royal Navy weather and radio station codenamed HMS &quot;Atlantic Isle&quot;, to monitor U Boats (which needed to surface to maintain radio contact) and German shipping movements in the South Atlantic Ocean. The only currency in use on the island at this time was the potato, and islanders labouring to construct the station were paid in kind with naval supplies for their own use, such as wood, paint and tea. Money was introduced the following year, as was the island&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Tristan Times&quot;. The first Administrator, Surgeon Lieutenant Commander E.J.S. Woolley, was appointed by the British government during this time.

The second Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, visited the islands in 1957 as part of a world tour on board the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;.

In 1958 as part of an experiment, Operation Argus, the United States Navy detonated an atomic bomb high in the upper atmosphere about southeast of the main island.

The 1961 eruption of Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak forced the evacuation of the entire population via Cape Town to wooden huts in the disused &quot;Pendell Army Camp&quot; in Merstham, Surrey, England, before moving to a more permanent site at a former Royal Air Force station in Calshot near Southampton, England, living mainly in a road called &quot;Tristan Close&quot;. In 1962, a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage, and reported that the settlement Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected. Most families returned in 1963 led by Willie Repetto (head of the ten-person island council) and Allan Crawford (the former island welfare officer).

==21st century==
On 23 May 2001, the islands experienced an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to . A number of structures were severely damaged and a large number of cattle were killed, prompting emergency aid from the British government.

In 2005, the islands were given a United Kingdom post code (TDCU 1ZZ) to make it easier for the residents to order goods online.

The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 was made by Her Majesty the Queen and the Privy Council on 8 July and came into operation on 1 September 2009. The new Constitution replaced the 1988 version and among other changes limited the Governor&#x27;s powers, included a Bill of Rights, established independence of the judiciary and the public service and formally designated the Governor of St Helena as, concurrently, the Governor for Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It also ended the &quot;dependency&quot; status of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha on St Helena.

On 4 December 2007 an outbreak of an acute virus-induced flu was reported. This outbreak was compounded by Tristan&#x27;s lack of suitable and sufficient medical supplies. The British coastguard in Falmouth co-ordinated international efforts to get appropriate medicines to Tristan to treat the virus. Tristan&#x27;s elderly population and the very young were most at risk; however, only four elderly people were hospitalised. Royal Fleet Auxiliary Vessel RFA &quot;Gold Rover&quot; upon reaching the island with the required medical supplies found no emergency and the islanders in good general health.

On 13 February 2008, fire destroyed the fishing factory and the four generators that supplied power to the island. Backup generators were used to power the hospital and give power for part of the day to the rest of the island. Power was on during the day and early evening and candlelight was used the rest of the time. On 14 March 2008, new generators were installed and uninterrupted power was restored. This fire was devastating to the island because fishing is a mainstay of the economy. Royal Engineers from the British Army worked on the harbour to help maintain it, as everything comes and goes by sea. This was supported by a LSDA vessel &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The concrete topping put in place has subsequently been badly damaged and on-going repairs will be required to keep the harbour from breaking apart in winter storms.

On 16 March 2011, the Maltese-registered freighter MS &quot;Oliva&quot; ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling tons of heavy fuel oil into the ocean. The crew were rescued, but the ship broke up, leaving an oil slick that surrounded the island, threatening its population of rockhopper penguins. Nightingale Island has no fresh water, so the penguins were transported to Tristan da Cunha for cleaning. The Greek captain and his 21 Filipino crew stayed in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas and assisted the islanders in their work.

In November 2011 the Volvo Ocean Race boat &quot;Puma&#x27;s Mar Mostro&quot; headed to the island after the mast came down to meet a supporting vessel in the first leg between Alicante (Spain) and Cape Town (South Africa). This event put the archipelago in the world press that were reporting the race, making it known to a larger public.

<text>In mathematics, a complex square matrix is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose :
:formula_1

The concept of normal matrices can be extended to normal operators on infinite-dimensional normed spaces and to normal elements in C*-algebras. As in the matrix case, normality means commutativity is preserved, to the extent possible, in the noncommutative setting. This makes normal operators, and normal elements of C*-algebras, more amenable to analysis.

The spectral theorem states that a matrix is normal if and only if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, and therefore any matrix satisfying the equation is diagonalizable. (The converse does not hold because diagonalizable matrices may have non-orthogonal eigenspaces.) Thus formula_2 and formula_3where formula_4 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal values are in general complex.

The left and right singular vectors in the singular value decomposition of a normal matrix formula_5 differ only in complex phase from each other and from the corresponding eigenvectors, since the phase must be factored out of the eigenvalues to form singular values. 

==Special cases==
Among complex matrices, all unitary, Hermitian, and skew-Hermitian matrices are normal, with all eigenvalues being unit modulus, real, and imaginary, respectively. Likewise, among real matrices, all orthogonal, symmetric, and skew-symmetric matrices are normal, with all eigenvalues being complex conjugate pairs on the unit circle, real, and imaginary, respectively. However, it is &quot;not&quot; the case that all normal matrices are either unitary or (skew-)Hermitian, as their eigenvalues can be any complex number, in general. For example,
formula_6
is neither unitary, Hermitian, nor skew-Hermitian, because its eigenvalues are formula_7; yet it is normal because 
formula_8

== Consequences ==

The concept of normality is important because normal matrices are precisely those to which the spectral theorem applies: 

The diagonal entries of are the eigenvalues of , and the columns of are the eigenvectors of . The matching eigenvalues in come in the same order as the eigenvectors are ordered as columns of .

Another way of stating the spectral theorem is to say that normal matrices are precisely those matrices that can be represented by a diagonal matrix with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal basis of . Phrased differently: a matrix is normal if and only if its eigenspaces span and are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product of .

The spectral theorem for normal matrices is a special case of the more general Schur decomposition which holds for all square matrices. Let be a square matrix. Then by Schur decomposition it is unitary similar to an upper-triangular matrix, say, . If is normal, so is . But then must be diagonal, for, as noted above, a normal upper-triangular matrix is diagonal.

The spectral theorem permits the classification of normal matrices in terms of their spectra, for example: 

In general, the sum or product of two normal matrices need not be normal. However, the following holds: 

In this special case, the columns of are eigenvectors of both and and form an orthonormal basis in . This follows by combining the theorems that, over an algebraically closed field, commuting matrices are simultaneously triangularizable and a normal matrix is diagonalizable – the added result is that these can both be done simultaneously.

== Equivalent definitions ==
It is possible to give a fairly long list of equivalent definitions of a normal matrix. Let be a complex matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
# is normal.
# is diagonalizable by a unitary matrix. 
# There exists a set of eigenvectors of which forms an orthonormal basis for . 
# formula_9 for every .
# The Frobenius norm of can be computed by the eigenvalues of : formula_10.
# The Hermitian part and skew-Hermitian part of commute.
# is a polynomial (of degree ) in .
# for some unitary matrix .
# and commute, where we have the polar decomposition with a unitary matrix and some positive semidefinite matrix .
# commutes with some normal matrix with distinct eigenvalues.
# for all where has singular values and has eigenvalues that are indexed with ordering .

Some but not all of the above generalize to normal operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. For example, a bounded operator satisfying (9) is only quasinormal.

==Normal matrix analogy==

It is occasionally useful (but sometimes misleading) to think of the relationships of special kinds of normal matrices as analogous to the relationships of the corresponding type of complex numbers of which their eigenvalues are composed. This is because any function of a non-defective matrix acts directly on each of its eigenvalues, and the conjugate transpose of its spectral decomposition formula_11 is formula_12, where formula_4 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Likewise, if two normal matrices commute and are therefore simultaneously diagonalizable, any operation between these matrices also acts on each corresponding pair of eigenvalues.
* The conjugate transpose is analogous to the complex conjugate.
* Unitary matrices are analogous to complex numbers on the unit circle.
* Hermitian matrices are analogous to real numbers.
* Hermitian positive definite matrices are analogous to positive real numbers.
* Skew Hermitian matrices are analogous to purely imaginary numbers.
* Invertible matrices are analogous to non-zero complex numbers.
* The inverse of a matrix has each eigenvalue inverted.
* A uniform scaling matrix is analogous to a constant number.
* In particular, the zero is analogous to 0, and
* the identity matrix is analogous to 1.
* An idempotent matrix is an orthogonal projection with each eigenvalue either 0 or 1.
* A normal involution has eigenvalues formula_14.

As a special case, the complex numbers may be embedded in the normal 2×2 real matrices by the mapping 
formula_15
which preserves addition and multiplication. It is easy to check that this embedding respects all of the above analogies.

<text>Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character is portrayed by Seth Green. Green also portrays the character in one episode of the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;.

In &quot;Buffy&quot;, Oz is a taciturn, guitar-playing teen who becomes Willow&#x27;s (Alyson Hannigan) boyfriend. He is a recurring character in the second season who first appears in the episode &quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot;. He discovers he is a werewolf in the episode &quot;Phases&quot;. Green gets elevated to main cast for the third season, and departs from the series in season 4. Green portrays the character for a final time in the season 4 finale &quot;Restless&quot; as part of a dream sequence. The character made a canonical return in the 2007 &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; storyline &quot;Retreat&quot;.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Oz&#x27;s most outstanding trait is his detached, ironic approach to life, masking a deeply philosophical interior and a very calm, devoted, gentle nature. He is also the lead guitarist for the band Dingoes Ate My Baby (a reference to the death of Azaria Chamberlain), which performs frequently at The Bronze. A high school senior, one year above Willow and the rest of the group, he is highly intelligent and &quot;tests well&quot;, but his only real ambition lies in music.

He notices Willow in her Eskimo costume at a dance at The Bronze, and seems to be interested in her at first sight; but does not meet her directly until several episodes later. They have several dates, on one of which he witnesses a vampire being dusted by Buffy for the first time, and is unsurprised upon learning vampires exist and merely remarks that &quot;it explains a lot&quot;. After this he becomes a member of the Scooby Gang, helping with research and fighting.

In the episode &quot;Phases&quot; Oz learns he has become a werewolf, turning into a monster on the three nights around a full moon, having been bitten on his finger by his cousin Jordy. On his third night as a wolf, Oz is nearly killed by werewolf hunter Gib Cain for his pelt, but is saved by Buffy and the Scooby Gang, with whose help he quickly finds a way to minimize the danger posed by the wolf: he locks himself into a cage for the appropriate nights, watched over by the Scoobies in shifts. The revelation that Oz is a werewolf does not dissuade Willow from dating him, and they become a couple.

Even though he is intelligent, several incompletes in his senior year require that he repeat it, putting him in the same graduating year as the rest of the gang. During this year, his relationship with Willow goes through rough water as he and Cordelia catch Xander and Willow kissing. They break up, but get back together again after Oz confesses he misses her (&quot;Amends&quot;). In the episode &quot;Graduation Day, Part One,&quot; Oz and Willow make love before the impending confrontation with the evil Mayor Wilkins.

After graduation, he attends UC Sunnydale together with Buffy and Willow, and is seen taking &#x27;Introduction to Psychology&#x27; by Professor Walsh along with them. Unlike the other two, he does not have a dorm room, but stays in a house off campus along with the rest of the band, and now locks himself up into a cage in a crypt at a local cemetery. Oz makes one appearance on &quot;Angel&quot; to deliver the Ring of Amarra, and plays a crucial role in the plot of that episode (&quot;In the Dark&quot;). He was rumored to be a recurring character in the unproduced sixth season before the show&#x27;s cancellation at the end of season 5.

While appearing to the outside world to have come to terms with his lycanthropy rather easily, evidence arises he indeed is fearful of his werewolf side (&quot;Fear, Itself&quot;), and especially of hurting others with it. Moreover, he starts to see that he and his wolf side may not be as separate as he&#x27;d like to think. When he meets a female werewolf, Veruca, a seductive UC Sunnydale student who sings in a band, they are immediately drawn to each other, and unbeknownst to him, they meet as wolves in the woods and have sex on the first night of the full moon. Veruca, who, unlike Oz, is conscious of her state and believes they are &quot;the wolf all the time,&quot; tries to convince Oz that they belong together. Unlike Oz, Veruca sees nothing wrong with killing humans when she is a werewolf as she feels that that is her true identity. Instead of telling the others about Veruca, he convinces her to join him in his cage on the next night they are due to turn into werewolves. They have sex again and are found the next morning lying together naked by Willow, who is devastated. Willow considers using magic to hurt Veruca, but changes her mind at the last minute. Veruca, who watched Willow, then attacks her. During the attack, Veruca transforms into a werewolf and tries to kill Willow, but Oz, also in werewolf form, protects Willow and kills Veruca. After he kills Veruca, he nearly attacks Willow, but Buffy stops him in time. Oz realizes that Veruca was correct, and tells Willow that he is, indeed, &quot;the wolf all the time&quot; and needs to leave in order to try to better understand his own nature.

Some months later, Oz returns to Sunnydale, having made progress with his lycanthropy through techniques learned in Tibet. He no longer uncontrollably changes into a werewolf during a full moon, and can now control his transformations, and shows Willow this when he takes her outside and shows her that the moon is full and he has not changed. However, when experiencing the powerful negative emotion of jealousy evoked by the discovery that Tara Maclay has replaced him in Willow&#x27;s affections, he does change, and is seized by The Initiative and locked in their cells until Buffy, helped by Riley Finn, sets him free.

The knowledge that Willow now loves Tara makes Oz leave Sunnydale for good, though he and Willow each affirm the depth and permanence of their connection. He is last seen in Willow&#x27;s dream in the episode &quot;Restless.&quot;

===Literature===
In 2007, Joss Whedon launched a canonical &quot;Buffy&quot; continuation in comic format, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;. The series follows Buffy and her allies some time after the events of the television series finale. Oz initially features in a minor dream sequence in Whedon&#x27;s premiere story arc, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; arc amid a collage of friends and family, but is not featured in any principal role until the 2009 story arc &quot;Retreat&quot;, written by Jane Espenson. The story sees Buffy and her army of Slayers magically transport themselves to Oz&#x27;s sanctuary in Tibet to escape the pursuit of her masked enemy, the mysterious &quot;Twilight&quot;. There, they hope to learn from Oz how to suppress their magical abilities, as he did, and therefore to avoid Twilight&#x27;s detection. Oz introduces Buffy, Willow and friends to his wife Bayarmaa, who is also a werewolf, and his young son, Kelden. Oz and a number of other werewolves assist the rendered-powerless Slayers when Twilight&#x27;s armed forces attack, though Oz subsequently remains with his family when Buffy and her company depart once again.

Oz also appears in &quot;Buffy&quot; Expanded Universe materials; the details offered in these appearances would later be contradicted by canonical stories, such as Espenson&#x27;s arc for &quot;Season Eight&quot;. In addition to supporting roles in a number of novels and comic books, Oz is central to the comic book trade paperback &quot;Oz&quot; (2001) and the novel &quot;&quot; (2002). Both of these appearances are written by Christopher Golden. &quot;Into the Wild&quot; is set during Oz&#x27;s quest to control his wolf-side, set after the television episode &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. Golden&#x27;s frequent writing partner Nancy Holder also wrote the 2005 novel &quot;Queen of the Slayers&quot;, set after the events of the season 7 finale. In &quot;Queen of the Slayers&quot;, forces conspire to kill Buffy for destroying the Hellmouth in Sunnydale. When Buffy encounters Oz, he is the leader of a pack of werewolves who can completely control their wolf forms; Oz assists in the final battle of the book, set during a full moon.

==Dingoes Ate My Baby==
Oz plays guitar in a rock band named Dingoes Ate My Baby. The name alludes to the widespread news coverage of the death of nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain in Australia in 1980.

The only band member mentioned by name, other than Oz, is lead singer Devon MacLeish (played by Jason Hall). Devon is a friend of Oz and he also briefly dated both Cordelia Chase and Harmony Kendall.

Willow has the band&#x27;s poster on her dorm room wall beginning in season 4 episode 2.

=== Buffyverse appearances ===
The band is first mentioned in the unaired Buffy pilot with a title card date of 05/03/96. Xander says, &quot;They don’t know any actual chords yet, but they have really big amps.&quot; They did not appear on the show until the second season, in &quot;Inca Mummy Girl,&quot; October 6, 1997. Dingoes continued to appear throughout Seasons 3 and 4 until Oz left Sunnydale. A poster of theirs is seen once afterward, in the episode Superstar. Most of their performances took place at The Bronze, Sunnydale&#x27;s local nightclub.

=== Music ===
The music of Dingoes Ate My Baby was actually composed and performed by Four Star Mary. Most of the songs that were used on the show featured on their 1998 album, &quot;Thrown to the Wolves&quot;. The band is featured on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album&quot;. They also made a one-time appearance as themselves in &quot;Restless&quot;. They provided the music along with Christophe Beck to the Joss Whedon-written song, &quot;Giles&#x27; Epiphany&quot;.

==Concept and creation==

Oz originated as a temporary cast member for the show. He was based on a student with whom Buffy-creator Joss Whedon attended college, as Whedon mentions in his commentary on &quot;Innocence&quot; in the Season Two DVD boxed set. In the writers&#x27; original plans Oz was to be killed early in season 2 by a vampire, presumably Angelus, before this dubious honor went to Jenny Calendar. The plan changed, as shown in &quot;Phases&quot; when Oz&#x27;s plot is expanded as he becomes a werewolf. On the season 4 featurette: &quot;Oz Revelations: A Full Moon&quot;, the writers related Oz&#x27;s inner werewolf to the dark urges every person encompasses. Even Oz, being a stoic and calm persona, still had a strong and violent force inside, which became increasingly harder to control.

In several episodes during season 4, Oz can be seen wearing a sheepskin jacket, alluding to the Aesopian fable, origin of the well-known phrase &quot;a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;.

<doc id="170369" wikidata="Q1363362" url="?curid=170369" title="Cumulative voting">
<text>Cumulative voting (sometimes called the single divisible vote) is an election system where a voter casts multiple votes but can lump votes on a specific candidate or can split their votes across multiple candidates. The candidates elected are those receiving the largest number of votes cast in the election, up to the number of representatives to be elected.

Cumulative voting can simplify strategic voting, by allowing larger groups of voters to elect multiple representatives by splitting their vote between multiple candidates. This removes the complexity associated with randomized or coordinated strategies.

It may be thought of as a variant of block voting. Under both cumulative voting and block voting, a voter casts multiple votes but in the case of cumulative voting, can lump them all on one candidate (the equivalent of engaging in plumping). When voters do this, the result is similar to SNTV. When supporters of a minority candidate do this, they may be of sufficient strength to elect that minority representative, not a likely occurrence under either first past the post voting or block voting. Thus, cumulative voting generally produces similar results to SNTV (especially if voters are informed and rational, in which case they will tend to engage in plumping. Plumping though reduces cumulative voting&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing need for strategic voting by allowing the voter to cast a split vote.).

Cumulative voting can also be thought of as a form of cardinal voting: a variant on score voting where the total scores for each candidate must add up to a fixed value (e.g. 100%). If instead the sum of squares must add up to a fixed value, the method becomes quadratic voting.

Cumulative voting is semi-proportional, allowing for more representative government than winner-take-all elections using block plurality voting or block instant-runoff voting. Cumulative voting is commonly-used in corporate governance, where it is mandated by 7 U.S. states.

The method can also be used in participatory budgeting.

== History ==
Cumulative voting was used to elect the Illinois House of Representatives from 1870 until its repeal in 1980 and used in England and Scotland in the late 19th century to elect some school boards. As of March 2012, more than fifty communities in the United States use cumulative voting, all resulting from cases brought under the National Voting Rights Act of 1965. Among them are Peoria, Illinois for half of its city council, Chilton County, Alabama for its county council and school board, and Amarillo, Texas, for its school board and College Board of Regents. Courts sometimes mandate its use as a remedy in lawsuits brought under the Voting Rights Act in the United States; an example of this occurred in 2009 in Port Chester, New York which had its first cumulative voting elections for its board of trustees in 2010.

Cumulative voting was also used to elect city boards in Toronto, Canada starting in 1904. The &quot;Proportional Representation Review&quot; (September 1903) described it like this:
A form of cumulative voting has been used by group facilitators as a method to collectively prioritize options, for example ideas generated from a brainstorming session within a workshop. This approach is described as &quot;multi-voting&quot; and was likely derived from the nominal group technique and is one of many tools suggested within the Six Sigma business management strategy.

== Voting ==
Cumulative voting is used in elections where more than one seat is filled. It permits voters to cast multiple votes, as many as the number of seats to be filled, allows each voter to put more than one vote on a preferred candidate. When voters in the minority concentrate their votes in this way for just one candidate, it increases their chances of obtaining representation in a legislative body. This is different from bloc voting, where a voter may not vote more than once for any candidate and the largest single block, even if less than 50 percent, can control all the representation elected in the district.

=== Permissible splits ===
Cumulative voting systems differ both in the ways voters mark their selections and in the degree to which voters are permitted to split their votes.

==== Equal-and-even ====
Possibly the simplest ballot is called satisfaction approval voting or the equal-and-even method. On this ballot, a voter simply marks all candidates they approve of, as in approval voting, and their vote is automatically distributed evenly among those preferred candidates. Voters are unable to specify a differing level of support for a more preferred candidate, giving them less flexibility but simplifying ballot completion.

==== Dot voting ====
A more common and slightly more complex cumulative voting system is called dot voting or multi-voting. Under this method, voters are given an explicit number of points, which they can distribute among one or more candidates on the ballot. Typically, this is done by having a voter make one mark for each point they wish to assign to the desired candidate. In dot-voting participants vote on their chosen options using a limited number of stickers or marks with pens — dot stickers being the most common. This sticker voting approach is a form of cumulative voting. Dot-voting is now widely used for making quick collaborative decisions by teams adopting agile and lean methodologies. For example, it is one of the methods endorsed by the 18F digital services agency of the United States&#x27; General Services Administration, and is part of the Design Sprint methodology.

Generally, the number of points given to each voter is equal to the number of winning candidates (seats to be filled), which is typically a holdover after a transition from block plurality voting.

==== Fractional voting ====
A similar method is to have the voter write in a desired number of points next to each candidate. Then, the scores on the ballot are divided by the total number of points the voter has assigned, to make sure the allocation adds up to 100%. The need to normalize votes complicates counting by hand, but simplifies the process of voting and gives each voter maximum flexibility.

== Properties ==
Advocates of cumulative voting often argue that political and racial minorities deserve better representation. By concentrating their votes on a small number of candidates of their choice, voters in the minority can win some representation—for example, a like-minded grouping of voters that is 20% of a city would be well-positioned to elect one out of five seats. All forms of cumulative voting achieve this objective (although if two or more candidates of that minority run in the same election, vote splitting may deny the group its possible representation).

In a corporate setting, challengers of cumulative voting argue that the board of directors gets divided and this hurts the company&#x27;s long term profit. Using a staggered board of directors can diminish the ability of minority factions to obtain representation by reducing the number of seats up for election at any given time.

Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised states that groups may adopt cumulative voting in its by-laws, and notes that &quot;A minority group, by coordinating its effort in voting for only one candidate who is a member of the group, may be able to secure the election of that candidate as a minority member of the board.&quot;

== Use ==
The Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly on Norfolk Island was elected using a form of cumulative voting where voters cannot give all their votes to one candidate. It is also used heavily in corporate governance, where it is mandated by seven U.S. states, and it was used to elect the Illinois House of Representatives from 1870 until 1980. It was used in England between 1870 and 1902, under the Elementary Education Act 1870, to elect school boards. Starting in the late 1980s, it has been adopted in a growing number of jurisdictions in the United States. Generally, this has been in an attempt to resolve lawsuits brought against bloc voting methods.

With strategic voting, one can calculate how many shares are needed to elect a certain number of candidates, and to determine how many candidates a person holding a certain number of shares can elect.

Some Bugzilla installations allow the use of cumulative voting to decide which software bugs most urgently need correcting.

== Tactical voting ==
Voters in a cumulative election can employ different strategies for allocating their vote.

===Plumping===
Plump voting occurs when a voter assigns all their points to the same candidate. The issue of &quot;Plumper Votes&quot; was heavily discussed in the early 18th century, when Sir Richard Child was returned for Essex in 1710 with 90% of his votes having been &quot;Plumpers&quot;.

=== Quota ===
The formula to determine the number of votes needed to elect one seat is called the Droop quota and has value:
:formula_1

<doc id="170370" wikidata="Q81116" url="?curid=170370" title="Tristão da Cunha">
<text>Tristão da Cunha (sometimes misspelled Tristão d&#x27;Acunha; ; c. 1460 – c. 1540) was a Portuguese explorer and naval commander. In 1514, he served as ambassador from King Manuel I of Portugal to Pope Leo X, leading a luxurious embassy presenting in Rome the new conquests of Portugal. He later became a member of the Portuguese privy council.

==Italian Wars==
Da Cunha was born in Portugal, c. 1460. He served in the Third Italian War under Castilian general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, participating in the Battle of Cerignola and being entasked with hosting the funeral of the fallen French general, Louis d&#x27;Armagnac, Duke of Nemours. He was also in command of Roca Guillerma, between Gaeta and Salerno, where he was briefly captured by the French army in a betrayal of the local nobility. Da Cunha was later freed. After returning to Portugal, he was nominated as first viceroy of Portuguese India in 1504, but could not take up this post owing to a temporary blindness.

==1506 voyage==
In 1506 he was appointed commander of a fleet of 15 ships sent to the east coast of Africa and off India. His cousin, Afonso de Albuquerque, was in charge of a squadron of five vessels in this fleet that subsequently detached. Their mission was to conquer Socotra Island and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea. They sailed together until they reached Mozambique. In the Mozambique Channel they found his friend Captain João da Nova stranded while returning from India. They rescued him and the ship Flor de la mar, both joining the fleet. After a series of successful attacks on Arab cities on the east coast of Africa, they headed to Socotra.
===Discovery of Tristan da Cunha Archipelago===
On this voyage Tristão da Cunha discovered a group of remote islands in the south Atlantic Ocean, from South Africa. Although rough seas prevented a landing then, he named the main island after himself, Ilha de Tristão da Cunha, which was later anglicized to Tristan da Cunha. 

===Battle of Barawa===

He then set his eyes on Ajuran Empire territory, where the Battle of Barawa was fought. The Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it. The inhabitants who had fled to the interior would eventually return and rebuild the city. Tristão da Cunha was wounded in this battle. After that battle, he captured Socotra.

===Capture of Socotra===

In 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed at the then capital of Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to India and to liberate the presumed friendly Christians from Islamic rule. The architect Tomás Fernandes started to build a fortress at Suq, the &quot;Forte de São Miguel de Socotorá&quot;. The lack of a proper harbour for wintering led to the loss of many moored Portuguese ships, the most important of which was the &quot;Santo António&quot; galleon under the command of captain Manuel Pais da Veiga. The infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison, and the Portuguese abandoned the island in 1511.

===Actions in India===
After a while, he distinguished himself in India in various actions, such as the Siege of Cannanore: the Portuguese garrison was on the verge of being overwhelmed, when on 27 August the fleet of 11 ships under Tristão da Cunha coming from Socotra appeared and relieved them with 300 men.

==Embassy to Pope Leo X==
After returning to Europe, Tristão da Cunha was sent as ambassador from King Manuel I to Pope Leo X in 1514 to present the new conquests of the Portuguese Empire, having Garcia de Resende as his secretary.

The huge, luxurious embassy of one hundred and forty persons made its way through Alicante and Majorca, arriving on the outskirts of Rome in February. They walked the streets of Rome on 12 March 1514 in an extravagant procession of exotic wildlife and wealth of the Indies, with many dressed in &quot;Indian style&quot;. The procession featured an elephant named Hanno, as a gift to the pope, and forty-two other beasts, including two leopards, a panther, some parrots, turkeys and rare Indian horses. Hanno carried a platform of silver on its back, shaped as a castle containing a safe with royal gifts, including vests embroidered with pearls and gems, and coins of gold minted for the occasion.
The pope received the procession in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. The elephant knelt down thrice in reverence and then, following a wave of his Indian &quot;mahout&quot; (keeper), used its trunk to suck water from a bucket and sprayed it over the crowd and the Cardinals.

By 29 April 1515, the Portuguese had depleted their funds, but they sought a bull signed by the pope, who sent back rich gifts to King Manuel. The king responded with a ship full of spices and, later, an Indian rhinoceros sent to him from the sultan Muzaffar Shah II of Gujarat. The boat that transported it was wrecked off Genoa on early February 1516, and the rhinoceros was portrayed by Albrecht Dürer in his very famous Rhinoceros woodcuts in June of 1516 after sketches of it traveled to Nuremberg.

Although Tristão da Cunha had never assumed the post of Viceroy of India, his son Nuno da Cunha was the 9th Governor of Portuguese India in 1529. The tomb of Tristão da Cunha is located at the convent of Nossa Senhora da Encarnação in Olhalvo (in the municipality of Alenquer).

<text>Chengdu is the capital city of the Chinese province of Sichuan. With a population of 20,937,757 at the 2020 census, it is the fourth most populous city in China, and it is the only city with a population of over 20 million apart from direct-administered municipalities. It is traditionally the hub of Western China.

Chengdu is in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the &quot;Country of Heaven&quot; and the &quot;Land of Abundance&quot;. Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city. Chengdu&#x27;s culture reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol that inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

Founded by the Kingdom of Shu in the 4th century BC, Chengdu is unique as the only major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras for more than two thousand years. It was the capital of Liu Bei&#x27;s Shu Han Empire during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu was briefly the capital of the Nationalist republican government until it withdrew to Taipei on the island of Taiwan. Under the PRC, Chengdu&#x27;s importance as a link between Eastern China and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterward. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important defense industry hub.

Chengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, research, and communication centers in China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu is a leading financial hub, ranking 35th globally on the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index. Chengdu also hosts many international companies; more than 300 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the third Chinese city with two international airports after Beijing and Shanghai. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, and the newly built Tianfu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu is considered a &quot;Beta + (global second-tier)&quot; city classification (along with Barcelona and Washington, D.C.) according to the GaWC. As of 2023, the city also hosts 23 foreign consulates, the fourth most in China behind Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theater Command region of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. In 2023, Chengdu became the third Chinese city to host the 31st FISU Summer World University Games, after Beijing 2001 and Shenzhen 2011. The city will also host the 2025 World Games. It is considered one of the best cities in China to live in, and also a national central city of China.

Chengdu is one of the world&#x27;s top 25 cities by scientific research output. The city is home to the greatest number of universities and research institutes in Western China. Notably, these include: Sichuan University, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu University of Technology, Sichuan Normal University, and Xihua University.

==Name==
The name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. However, it also had other names; for example, it was briefly known as &quot;Xijing&quot; (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although not generally accepted by modern scholars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work &quot;Universal Geography of the Taiping Era&quot;, which states that the ninth king of Shu&#x27;s Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed &quot;one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis.&quot; (The character for &quot;cheng&quot; may mean &quot;turned into&quot; while &quot;du&quot; can mean either a metropolis or a capital).

The present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was &quot;Chengtu&quot;. Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo&#x27;s spellings &quot;Sindafu&quot;, &quot;Sin-din-fu&quot;, &amp;c. and the Protestant missionaries&#x27; romanization &quot;Ching-too Foo&quot;.

Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including &quot;Yizhou&quot;. Chinese nicknames for the city include the , variously derived from the old city walls&#x27; shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle&#x27;s tracks; the (see Sichuan brocade), a contraction of the earlier &quot;City of the Brocade Official&quot;, after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the (Rongcheng, 城), from the hibiscus which King Meng Chang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.

According to Étienne de la Vaissière, &quot;Baghshūr&quot; () may be the Sogdian name for the region of Chengdu. This toponym is attested near Merv, but
not far from Chengdu are found the large salt water wells of the Yangtze basin.

==Logo==
The city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Site.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha Site have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in the 18th–10th centuryBC. At the time of China&#x27;s Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture that, following its partial sinification, became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316BC, and the settlement was re-founded by Qin general Zhang Yi.

==== Pre-Qin to Qin and Han dynasties ====
In the early stage of the Xia dynasty or even earlier, the ancient Shu Kingdom located on the Chengdu Plain has formed a relatively developed bronze civilization, becoming an important source of Chinese civilization and one of the birthplaces of the Chinese nation. According to records, there were five dynasties in the ancient Shu Kingdom, and their capitals were Qushang (now Wenjiang District, Chengdu), Piyi (now Pidu District), Xindu, and Guangdu. At the end of the Spring and Autumn period (around the 4th century BC), the fifth King Kaiming moved the capital to Chengdu. According to &quot;Taiping Huanyu Ji&quot;, the name of the city is borrowed from the history of the establishment of the capital in the Western Zhou dynasty. The allusions of Zhou Wang Qianqi&#x27;s &quot;one year, he lived in a cluster, two years became a city, and three years Chengdu,&quot; because of the name Chengdu, it has been used to this day. Therefore, Chengdu has become a rare city in China and the world that has not changed its name since its establishment. Some people think that Chengdu is a transliteration of ancient Shu place names. There is a saying that &quot;Guangdu, Xindu and Chengdu&quot; are collectively referred to as the &quot;Three Capitals of Ancient Shu&quot;. Nowadays, there are many cultural relics of ancient Shu Kingdom in Chengdu Plain, such as Sanxingdui Ruins, Jinsha Ruins, Yufu Ancient City Ruins, Wangcong Temple, etc. Jinsha Ruins located in the urban area of Chengdu is a peak of the development of ancient Shu culture.

The ancient state of Shu was the first target to be conquered by the Qin state in the process of unifying the world. King Huiwen of Qin had prepared for this for many years, and opened up the Shiniu Road (that is, the Jinniu Road) from Qin to Shu. In 316 BC, King Huiwen of Qin took advantage of the mutual attack between Ba and Shu and sent Sima Cuo to lead his army into Shu along the Shiniu Road, capturing the land in a few months. After that, the king of Qin established three abolitions of Shu Hou, and finally established Shu County, and the county seat of Chengdu County was established in Chengdu, the former capital of Shu. In 311 BC, Zhang Yi of the Qin dynasty built the Chengdu city wall according to the system of the capital Xianyang, building a large city and a small city. In 256 BC, King Zhao of Qin appointed Li Bing as the governor of Shu County. During his tenure, he presided over the construction of the world-famous Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project. The Chengdu Plain has been fertile and wild for thousands of miles since then. After decades of operation, Chengdu replaced Guanzhong Plain in the late Qin dynasty and was called the &quot;Land of Abundance&quot;, and this reputation has continued to this day.

During the Han dynasty, the Chengdu economy, especially its brocade industry, prospered, becoming an important source of tribute to the court. The imperial court invested in Chengdu and specially set up Jinguan management and built &quot;Jinguan City&quot; in the southwest of Chengdu, &quot;Jinguan City&quot; and &quot;Jincheng&quot; becoming nicknames for Chengdu. In the second year of Emperor Ping of the Yuan dynasty, the population of Chengdu reached 76,000 households, or about 354,000 people, making it one of the most populous cities at that time. Towards the six major cities. In the third year of the reign of Emperor Jing of the Han dynasty (141 BC), the Wen Dang, the prefect of Shu County, established the world&#x27;s earliest local government-run school, &quot;Wenweng Shishi&quot;, in Chengdu. In the Han dynasty, Chengdu&#x27;s literature and art also reached a high level. All the most famous literary masters in the Han dynasty were from Chengdu, including Sima Xiangru, Yang Xiong, and Wang Bao.

In the former Han dynasty, the whole country was divided into 14 prefectural governors&#x27; departments, among which the Yizhou governor was established in Luoxian (now Guanghan City, Sichuan), and the governor later moved to Chengdu. In the first year of Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s reign (25 years) in the Eastern Han dynasty, Gongsun Shu established himself as the emperor in Chengdu, and the country&#x27;s name was &quot;married family&quot;. In the twelfth year of Jianwu in the Later Han dynasty (36 years), the Great Sima Wuhan of the Eastern Han dynasty finally captured Chengdu after five years of war, and his family perished. In the fifth year of Zhongping (188), Emperor Ling of Han, the court accepted Liu Yan&#x27;s suggestion and changed the provincial governors to state shepherds with actual recruitment and command power. In the fifth year of Chuping (194), it moved to Chengdu. At that time, the Yizhou Provincial Governor&#x27;s Department was the place where the Hu people in the Western Regions were operating.

===Imperial era===

Under the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A &quot;Brocade Official&quot; () was established to oversee its production and transaction. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu Han, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the &quot;Land of Abundance&quot;. Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as &quot;lying above the empyrean.&quot; The city&#x27;s present Caotang (&quot;Grass Hall&quot;) was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (&quot;Green Goat Temple&quot;) was built in the 9th century.

Chengdu was the capital of Wang Jian&#x27;s Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Tang. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its second and last king, Meng Chang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.

The Song conquered the city in 965, introducing the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as &quot;the southwestern metropolis&quot;. At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (, &quot;Dàshǔ&quot;). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city&#x27;s population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan&#x27;s residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.

At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom () with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan. In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China&#x27;s principal sources of tobacco. Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country&#x27;s cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.

===Modern era===

In 1911, Chengdu&#x27;s branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.

During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under &quot;Generalissimo&quot; Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.

Chengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M &quot;Nell&quot; medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.

Slow and vulnerable obsolescent Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel were still sufficiently dangerous in the hands of capable pilots against the Japanese &quot;schnellbomber&quot;-terror bombing raiders; on 4 November 1939 for instance, Capt. Cen Zeliu (&quot;Wade-Giles: Shen Tse-Liu&quot;) led his 17th Fighter Squadron, 5th Fighter Group of seven cannon-equipped Dewoitine D.510 fighters in a level head-on attack against an incoming coming raid of 72 IJANF G3M bombers (Capt. Cen chose this tactic knowing that the operation of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20mm autocannon in his D.510 is likely to fail under the g-loads of a high-deflection diving attack), with Capt. Cen pummeling the lead G3M of the IJN&#x27;s &quot;13th Kōkūtai&#x27;s CO&quot; Captain Kikushi Okuda with cannon fire, sending the G3M crashing down in flames over Chengdu, along with three other G3M bombers destroyed in the Chengdu raid that day. With the death of Captain Okuda in the air battle over Chengdu, the IJN became the highest-ranking IJN Air officer to be &quot;killed-in-action&quot; in the &quot;War of Resistance/World War II&quot; thus far.

In mid-late 1940, unknown to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world&#x27;s most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M &quot;Zero&quot; fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and original volunteer fighter pilot for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Huang Xinrui (nicknamed &quot;Buffalo&quot; by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters along with his squadronmates Cen Zeliu and Lin Heng (younger brother of renowned architect Lin Huiyin) defending Chengdu on 14 March 1941.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor at the end of 1941, the United States began setting up stations at airbases in China. In 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.
During the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from the Chengdu Central Military Academy () until 1949, when Communist forces took the city on 27 December. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.

The Chengdu Tianfu New Area is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.

====The Great City====
In 2019, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China&#x27;s technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.

Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city &#x27;a city within a park&#x27; rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu &#x27;park city&#x27; initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.

The goal of the &#x27;park city&#x27; project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes.

==Geography==

The vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from .

Northwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds and includes Miao Jiling () and Xiling Snow Mountain (). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as &quot;the Abundant Land&quot; owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

Chengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30° 05&#x27; to 31° 26&#x27; N, while its longitude ranges from 102° 54&#x27; to 104° 53&#x27; E, stretching for from east to west and south to north, administering of land. Neighboring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya&#x27;an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of , features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains () and the Penzhong Hills (); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to in Dayi County. The highest point in Chengdu is Daxuetang (also known as Miaojiling) in Xiling Snow Mountain in Dayi County, with an altitude of 5,364 meters. The lowest point is the river bank at the exit of Tuojiang River in Jianyang City, with an altitude of 359 meters.

===Climate===
Chengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is , and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the &quot;Three Furnaces&quot; cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around , with afternoon highs sometimes reaching ; sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall occurs most frequently and is concentrated in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 15 percent in December to 32 percent in August, the city receives 1006 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November). The annual mean is , and extremes have ranged from to .

==Administrative divisions==
Chengdu is a sub-provincial city, serves as the capital of Sichuan. It has direct jurisdiction over 12 districts, 5 county-level cities and 3 counties:

* Tianfu New Area
* Chengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone
* Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone
** Chengdu Tianfu Software Park
** Chengdu Export Processing Zone

==Cityscape==

As of July 2013, the world&#x27;s largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Center, is located in the city. The structure is in size with of floor area, housing retail outlets, a movie theaters, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 Chinese census, the municipality had 20,937,757 inhabitants; the metropolitan area itself was home to 16,045,577 inhabitants including those of the 12 urban districts plus Guanghan City (&quot;in Deyang&quot;). Chengdu is the largest city in Sichuan and the fourth largest in China. 21,192,000 for 2021, adding more residents than any other city in the country.

As of 2015, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) estimated the Chengdu metropolitan area&#x27;s population to be 18.1 million.

==Culture==

In 2006, &quot;China Daily&quot; named Chengdu China&#x27;s fourth-most-livable city.

===Literature===
Some of China&#x27;s most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen&#x27;an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China&#x27;s history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, &quot;A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.&quot;

In 2023, Chengdu hosted the 81st World Science Fiction Convention, having beat out Winnipeg, Canada, in site-selection voting in 2021.

===Fine art===
During the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting School with other painters. At that time, &quot;Hanlin Painting Academy&quot; was the earliest royal academy in China.

===Religion===
Chengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.

The Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan (now known as Roman Catholic Diocese of Chengdu) was established on 15 October 1696. Artus de Lionne, a French missionary of Paris Foreign Missions Society, was appointed as the first Apostolic Vicar.

In 1890, the Canadian Methodist Mission was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. , who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy&#x27;s and Girl&#x27;s schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 – 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.

On 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu&#x27;s first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu&#x27;s East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city&#x27;s first Methodist church (Sï-Shen-Tsï Methodist Church) and hospital were built. These were later razed by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida). During the Cultural Revolution, the Sï-Shen-Tsï Methodist Church building was no longer in use and the building was entrusted to the nearby Chengdu City Second People&#x27;s Hospital for management. The hospital used the chapel as a kindergarten and the office of the hospital equipment department. In 1984, the hospital returned the chapel building to the church.

In December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church, the Early Rain Covenant Church, led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church&#x27;s kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church&#x27;s media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: &quot;Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. […] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord.&quot; Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of . Jiang&#x27;s detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church&#x27;s leaders with &quot;inciting subversion of state power,&quot; which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.

<text>ReplayTV was a former DVR company that from 1999 until 2005, produced a brand of digital video recorders (DVR), a term synonymous with &quot;personal video recorder&quot; (PVR). It is a consumer video device which allows users to capture television programming to internal hard disk storage for later viewing (and &quot;time shifting&quot;). ReplayTV was founded in September 1997 by future Roku founder Anthony Wood, who was president and CEO of ReplayTV until August 2001. 

The first ReplayTV model was introduced in January 1999 during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, at the same time as a competing DVR model from rival company TiVo. After the sale of assets to DirecTV, ReplayTV&#x27;s only ongoing activity was maintenance of the electronic program guide service by D&amp;M Holdings, which was to be discontinued on July 31, 2011. However, on July 29, 2011, a notice was placed on the ReplayTV website stating that service would be continued without interruption for lifetime subscribers and monthly subscribers may have a short interruption in service. On September 2, 2011, programming contact through the ReplayTV dialup system was terminated without any update message being sent to subscribers or posted on replaytv.com. DNNA filed for bankruptcy on July 20, 2015. EPG data from their servers ran out on July 15, 2015. Even with the end of support from DNNA, third-party solutions are available to provide Electronic Program Guide data to ReplayTV units.

==History==
ReplayTV was founded in September 1997 by businessman Anthony Wood, who later founded Roku in October 2002. Initial sales to consumers were launched in April 1999, while volume production and sales did not begin until later in 2000. ReplayTV was purchased by SONICblue in 2001.

On March 23, 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and on April 16 sold most of its assets, including ReplayTV, to the Japanese electronics giant D&amp;M Holdings. SONICblue was fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV&#x27;s ability to skip commercials when it filed for bankruptcy.

On December 19, 2005, Digital Networks North America announced that it was exiting the hardware business as soon as current inventory was sold out. ReplayTV would then concentrate on PC software sales of its DVR technology in a partnership with Hauppauge Computer Works, a manufacturer of television cards for PCs.

On December 13, 2007, D&amp;M Holdings sold most of the assets of ReplayTV to DirecTV. It still provided electronic program guide service to existing customers, using content from Tribune Media Services. The domains replay.com, replaytv.com, and replaytv.net used by the ReplayTV units to access the electronic program guide are or were owned by DirecTV.

On June 15, 2011, D&amp;M Holdings announced it was permanently discontinuing the ReplayTV electronic program guide service:&quot;The ReplayTV Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) Service will be permanently discontinued on July 31, 2011. After this date, owners of ReplayTV DVR units will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. Effective immediately, monthly billing for the ReplayTV service to remaining customers has been suspended.&quot;

On July 29, 2011, D&amp;M announced they would continue providing guide service. The following was appearing on the ReplayTV website:Important Announcement. After the announced shutdown of the ReplayTV programming guide service, we have had many positive, enthusiastic comments about the ReplayTV DVR products and services. In light of this response, ReplayTV and its parent company Digital Networks North America, Inc. have decided to continue the electronic programming guide service pursuant to the terms of your service activation agreement. We thank you very much for all of your support and enthusiasm over the many years these products have been sold.

Around July 4, 2015, new guide data was not being sent to ReplayTV units. The last day of guide data was July 15. ReplayTV said they were working on the problem, although it was never fixed. It is assumed this problem is a result of the bankruptcy.

==Bankruptcy==
On July 20, 2015, ReplayTV.com posted the following information:
Digital Networks North America, Inc. filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on July 20, 2015 and has ceased all business operations. A chapter 7 trustee will be appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to oversee the administration and liquidation of the bankruptcy estate for Digital Networks North America, Inc. Creditors will receive a notice of the bankruptcy filing by mail.

Parent company of ReplayTV, Digital Networks North America filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Following the announcement, ReplayTV ended services.

==Legal battle==
On October 31, 2001, numerous TV companies, including the three major networks, filed a lawsuit against SONICblue, which at the time marketed the ReplayTV device. They alleged that the ReplayTV 4000 series was part of an “unlawful scheme” that “attacks the fundamental economic underpinnings of free television and basic nonbroadcast services” according to the lawsuit.

The TV industry attacked ReplayTV for two reasons:

#The machines enabled people to record television programs and then watch them without commercials via the optional &quot;Commercial Advance&quot; feature. This had the potential to undercut advertising revenues which the lawsuit called &quot;the lifeblood of most television channels&quot;.
#The machines allowed users to share programs they have recorded with others via the &quot;Send Show&quot; feature, which transmits digital copies of shows not only on a local network, but also over the Internet to other ReplayTV owners, thereby enabling people who had not paid for premium channels to watch premium content for free.

Both the “Commercial Advance” and the “Send Show” features were alleged to violate U.S. copyright and other federal and state laws, according to the TV industry plaintiffs, who wanted sales of the ReplayTV 4000 devices—slated for shipment on Nov. 15, 2001—stopped.

The lawsuit against SONICblue was stayed when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2003. In August 2003, the ReplayTV 5500 series went on sale without the &quot;Autoskip&quot; and &quot;Send Show&quot; features though the features continued to be enabled on the earlier models.

==Operation==
ReplayTV service is only available in the United States via its subscription program. The hardware is no longer sold and the subscription service was ended in June 2011. The subscriptions service&#x27;s feature of searchable program guides will end effective July 31, 2011. After this date, owners of ReplayTV DVR units will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. Older units were only able to accomplish this download via a dial-up connection. Later models were also capable of downloading program guides via the user&#x27;s existing internet connection (broadband or DSL), as well as via the dialup connection.

Like other DVRs, ReplayTV allows users to record television programs. The subscription service was operated on a monthly fee, or one time payment, lifetime subscription. Each individual unit required a separate subscription. Older units, like the 2000 and 3000 series, did not require monthly subscription fees, and those units that were still in operation and continue to receive programming data without a subscription until July 31, 2011. The price of the original ReplayTV units was higher than comparable TiVo units by approximately the same amount as TiVo&#x27;s lifetime subscription, so a lifetime subscription was essentially priced into the units.

Some ReplayTV models allow automatic commercial skipping with no user intervention. It scanned for the black frames local television stations used to insert commercials.

==Hardware and features==
The &quot;4000 Series&quot; and &quot;5000 Series&quot; ReplayTV units have Ethernet connections that allow the user to stream shows to another similar ReplayTV unit within the same local network, transfer shows to another similar ReplayTV unit (either on the local network or across the Internet) or to a personal computer. This capability enables users to move recorded programs to PCs using third-party programs. These units also have the capability to automatically skip commercial advertisements during playback (known as &quot;Commercial Advance&quot;, which was trademarked by the original company). This commercial advance feature used several heuristics to detect commercials and had an accuracy of about 90 to 95 percent. Recording of television programs could be accomplished either manually, or through use of the program guide using various criteria. Shows to be recorded could also be described via thematic categories. Shows could be recorded or lightly managed through MyReplayTV at my.replaytv.com

The most recent &quot;5500 Series&quot; ReplayTV units had the ability to stream shows to another similar ReplayTV unit within the same local network, but when loaded with up-to-date system software they can no longer transfer shows to other ReplayTV units across the Internet. The &quot;5500 Series&quot; units have also had the automatic commercial advance feature removed in favor of a manual &quot;Show|Nav&quot; feature. The units are otherwise identical to the &quot;5000 Series&quot; units. System software releases prior to version 5.1 build 144 retain the original features even in 5500-series hardware devices, but the software is automatically updated to 5.1 build 144 via through-the-web software updates.

The &quot;4000 Series&quot;, &quot;5000 Series&quot; and &quot;5500 Series&quot; ReplayTV units stored the content using MPEG2.
:*Video: mpeg2video, yuv420p, 720x480, 29.97 frame/s, 7413 kbit/s
:*Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbit/s

The operating system used on the &quot;4000 Series&quot;, &quot;5000 Series&quot; and &quot;5500 Series&quot; was Vxworks. Several versions of the software were released, some older versions supported commercial advance even on newer units.

==Other features==
Beginning with the earliest models, ReplayTV units had an undocumented &quot;random access skip&quot; feature. While playing a recorded program, the user could enter a number from the remote control, then press the QuickSkip button to advance that number of minutes forward in the program, or press the &quot;Skip Back&quot; button to go back that number of minutes. If no number was entered, the skip buttons would advance 30 seconds or retreat ten seconds, respectively. This feature spanned several models of ReplayTV. Users could also type a number followed by pressing Jump to go to that exact minute in the recording.

==Models==
The first models released were the 2000 series from ReplayTV (the company name at that time). In 1999, the price of the ReplayTV 2001 was $995 and it
provided 6 hours of video storage. The ReplayTV model 2004 was $1,995 and provided 26 hours. Each of these models included a lifetime offer of
program guide service. The ReplayTV 2020 model, offering 20 hours of recording storage, was also released in 1999 at a cost of $699. It replaced the previously released models.

In the year 2000 the 3000-series models were released, as well as an equivalent &quot;ShowStopper&quot; model branded by Panasonic.
This was followed by the 4000 line in the fall of 2001. The 4000-series models were the first to include an Ethernet port, and to support the
sharing of shows between different units either locally (using video streaming) or over the Internet (by duplicating the content).

In 2002 the 4500-series was released. These had hardware that was much like the 4000-series, but they could be purchased without lifetime program guide service for a substantially reduced price. All subsequent models also unbundled the guide service from the hardware. Units without lifetime activation become
almost completely unusable if the monthly activation is terminated.

2005 products with list prices (no longer available):
* ReplayTV RTV5504 40-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($149.99)
* ReplayTV RTV5508 80-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($299.99)
* ReplayTV RTV5516 160-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($449.99)
* ReplayTV RTV5532 320-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($799.99)

The ReplayTV 5000 series included a JP1 remote which could be reprogrammed or upgraded using free software.

==Subscription==
The ReplayTV subscription has two different options, a monthly recurring charge of $12.95, or one-time lifetime activation fee of $299. Subscriptions for additional units were $6.95 a month. PC edition customers are charged $20 per year and come with one year of service.

On June 15, 2011, ReplayTV announced that it would be permanently discontinuing its Electronic Programming Guide Service (the channel guide) on July 31, 2011. &quot;After this day, your ReplayTV DVR will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. All billing for your service has been suspended.&quot;

Their website states the reasoning as being that the industry conversion to HDTV is complete, and customers should contact their local providers for options.

However, there may be options to keep service alive after official support ends using the WiRNS application as all units should be permanently activated if they contact ReplayTV servers before July 31, 2011.

On July 29, 2011, D&amp;M Holdings reversed their previous decision and will continue the ReplayTV electronic program guide service. &quot;For monthly subscribers of the ReplayTV service, we are exploring options by which you may continue paying for and receiving such service going forward. We apologize in advance should there be any minor disruptions in the ReplayTV service while we implement the continuation of the programming guide. Thank you. ReplayTV&quot;

On or around July 4, 2015, DirectTV apparently turned off their guide servers at production.replaytv.net. On July 15, 2015, the last guide data disappeared from ReplayTV units; it is doubtful that the guide data will return. However, alternatives exist which can provide ReplayTVs with guide data for as long as they (the ReplayTV units themselves) are functional. Three such options are LaHO, WiRNS and Perc Data.

<doc id="170384" wikidata="Q909436" url="?curid=170384" title="Copal">
<text>Copal is a tree resin, particularly the aromatic resins from the copal tree &quot;Protium copal&quot; (Burseraceae) used by the cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica as ceremonially burned incense and for other purposes. More generally, copal includes resinous substances in an intermediate stage of polymerization and hardening between &quot;gummier&quot; resins and amber. Copal that is partly mineralized is known as copaline.

It is available in different forms; the hard, amber-like yellow copal is a less expensive version, while the milky-white copal is more expensive.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;copal&quot; is derived from the Nahuatl language word , meaning &quot;incense&quot;.

== History and uses ==
Subfossil copal is well known from New Zealand (kauri gum from &quot;Agathis australis&quot; (Araucariaceae)), Japan, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Madagascar. It often has inclusions and is sometimes sold as &quot;young amber&quot;. When it is treated or enhanced in an autoclave (as is sometimes done to industrialized Baltic amber) it is used for jewelry. In its natural condition copal can be easily distinguished from old amber by its lighter citrine colour and its surface getting tacky with a drop of acetone or chloroform. Copal resin from &quot;Hymenaea verrucosa&quot; (Fabaceae) is found in East Africa and is used in incense. East Africa apparently had a higher amount of subfossil copal, which is found one or two meters below living copal trees, from roots of trees that may have lived thousands of years earlier. This subfossil copal produces a harder varnish.

By the 18th century, Europeans found it to be a valuable ingredient in making a good wood varnish. It became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and carriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish. By the late 19th and early 20th century, varnish manufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly swelling its demand. In 1859, Americans consumed 68% of the East African trade, which was controlled through the Sultan of Zanzibar, with Germany receiving 24%. The American Civil War and the creation of the Suez Canal led to Germany, India, and Hong Kong taking the majority by the end of that century.

Copal is still used by a number of indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America as an incense, during sweat lodge ceremonies and sacred mushroom ceremonies.

<text>The family saga is a genre of literature which chronicles the lives and doings of a family or a number of related or interconnected families over a period of time. In novels (or sometimes sequences of novels) with a serious intent, this is often a thematic device used to portray particular historical events, changes of social circumstances, or the ebb and flow of fortunes from a multitude of perspectives.

The word &quot;saga&quot; comes from Old Norse, where it meant &quot;what is said, utterance, oral account, notification&quot; and &quot;(structured) narrative, story (about somebody)&quot;, and was originally borrowed into English from Old Norse by scholars in the eighteenth century to refer to the Old Norse prose narratives known as &quot;sagas&quot;.

The typical family saga follows generations of a family through a period of history in a series of novels. A number of subgenres of the form exist such as the AGA saga.

Successful writers of popular family sagas include Susan Howatch, R. F. Delderfield and Philippa Carr.

<doc id="170388" wikidata="Q123542" url="?curid=170388" title="Ash Wednesday">
<text>Ash Wednesday is a holy day of prayer and fasting in many Western Christian denominations. It is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and marks the first day of Lent, the six weeks of penitence before Easter.

Ash Wednesday is observed by Catholics, Lutherans, Moravians, Anglicans, and United Protestants, as well as by some churches in the Reformed, (including certain Congregationalist, Continental Reformed, and Presbyterian churches), Baptist, Methodist and Nazarene traditions.

Ash Wednesday is traditionally observed with fasting and abstinence from meat in several Christian denominations. As it is the first day of Lent, many Christians begin Ash Wednesday by marking a Lenten calendar, praying a Lenten daily devotional, and making a Lenten sacrifice that they will not partake of until the arrival of Eastertide.

Many Christians attend special Ash Wednesday church services at which churchgoers receive ash on their foreheads or the top of their heads, as the wearing of ashes was a sign of repentance in biblical times. Ash Wednesday derives its name from this practice, in which the placement of ashes is accompanied by the words, &quot;Repent, and believe in the Gospel&quot; or the dictum &quot;Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&quot; The ashes are prepared by burning palm leaves from the previous year&#x27;s Palm Sunday celebrations.

==Observing and non-observing denominations==
Ash Wednesday is observed by numerous denominations within Western Christianity. Latin Church Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Moravians observe it. Churches in the United Protestant tradition, such as the Church of North India and United Church of Canada honour Ash Wednesday too.

Some Baptists, many Methodists (including denominations aligned with the holiness movement such as Nazarenes and Wesleyans), many Radical Pietists such as the Evangelical Covenant Church, and some Conservative Anabaptists, including some Mennonites, observe Ash Wednesday. The Metropolitan Community Churches observe Ash Wednesday. Many Independent Catholics, and the Community of Christ also observe it.

The Reformed churches have historically not observed Ash Wednesday, nor Lent in general, due to the Reformed regulative principle of worship. Since the mid-twentieth century, many churches in the Reformed tradition (including certain Congregationalist, Continental Reformed, and Presbyterian churches) do observe both Ash Wednesday and Lent such as the Church of Scotland, the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, the Swiss Reformed Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Church of Christ. The Reformed Church in America, for example, describes Ash Wednesday as a day &quot;focused on prayer, fasting, and repentance.&quot; The liturgy for Ash Wednesday thus contains the following &quot;Invitation to Observe a Lenten Discipline&quot; read by the presider:
The Eastern Orthodox Church does not, in general, observe Ash Wednesday. Instead, Orthodox Great Lent begins on Clean Monday. There are a relatively small number of Orthodox Christians who follow the Western Rite. These do observe Ash Wednesday, although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations, as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of Pascha, which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter.

==Observances==
===Fasting and abstinence===


Many Lent-observing denominations emphasize making a Lenten sacrifice, as well as fasting and abstinence during the season of Lent, particularly on Ash Wednesday. The First Council of Nicaea spoke of Lent as a period of fasting for forty days in advance of Easter, although it is unclear whether the prescribed fast applied to all Christians, or specifically to new Christians preparing to be baptized. Whatever the council&#x27;s original intent, this forty-day fast came into wide practice throughout the church.

While starting a Lenten sacrifice on Ash Wednesday (e.g. giving up watching television), it is customary to pray for strength to keep it through the whole season of Lent; many often wish others to do so as well, e.g. &quot;May God bless your Lenten sacrifice.&quot; In many places, Christians historically abstained from food for a whole day until the evening, and at sunset, Western Christians traditionally broke the Lenten fast, which is often known as the Black Fast. In India and Pakistan, many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent. In India, Ash Wednesday is called व्रत विभूति (&quot;Vrat Vibhuti&quot; - meaning, &quot;the sacred ash of the Holy Fast&quot;). After attending a worship service, often on Wednesday evenings, it is common for Christians of various denominations that celebrate Lent to break that day&#x27;s Lenten fast together through a communal Lenten supper, which is held in the church&#x27;s parish hall.

Among Catholics, Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting, abstinence from meat (which begins at age 14 according to canon law 1252), and repentance. On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, Roman Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59, whose health enables them to fast, are permitted to consume one full meal, along with two smaller meals, which together should not equal the full meal. Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations put forth by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast until sunset. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat (mammals and fowl), as are all Fridays during Lent. Some Roman Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent, as was the Church&#x27;s traditional requirement, concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil. Where the Ambrosian Rite is observed, the day of fasting and abstinence is postponed to the first Friday in the Ambrosian Lent, nine days later.

Several Lutheran parishes teach communicants to fast on Ash Wednesday, with some parishioners choosing to continue doing so throughout the entire season of Lent, especially on Good Friday. &quot;A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent&quot;, a Lutheran liturgical manual, recommends that the faithful &quot;Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day, usually without meat&quot;.

In the Church of England, and throughout much of the Worldwide Anglican Communion, the entire forty days of Lent are designated days of fasting. Fridays are designated as days of abstinence in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. &quot;Saint Augustine&#x27;s Prayer Book&quot;, a resource for Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, defines &quot;Fasting&quot; as &quot;usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one-half meal, on the forty days of Lent.&quot; The same text defines abstinence as refraining from flesh meat on all Fridays of the Church Year, except for those during Christmastide.

In the Methodist tradition, John Wesley&#x27;s sermons on the topic of the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast, which begins on Ash Wednesday. The United Methodist Church therefore states that:

Rev. Jacqui King, the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as &quot;I&#x27;m not skipping a meal because in place of that meal, I&#x27;m dining with God&quot;.

Members of the Moravian Church may voluntarily fast during the season of Lent, along with making a Lenten sacrifice for the season as a form of penitence.

===Date of Ash Wednesday===
Ash Wednesday is always 46 days before Easter. Easter is determined as the Sunday following the first full moon that happens on or after the March equinox (which is always 21 March).

Lent is 40 days long, not including Sundays. According to the calendar, that means the season is 46 days long overall. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Saturday (in the Moravian Church, Lutheran Church, Anglican Church, Methodist Church, Reformed Churches {Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist}, Western Rite Orthodox Church, and United Protestant Churches) or at the start of the Easter Triduum on the evening of Maundy Thursday in the Catholic Church (though the Lenten fasting discipline ends on the evening of Holy Saturday, as with the Lutheran Churches).

===Ashes===


Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday, either by being sprinkled over their heads or, in English-speaking countries, more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross. The words (based on Genesis 3:19) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are, &quot;Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.&quot; (&quot;Remember, man, that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return.&quot;) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great (c. 540–604), although this is probably incorrect since Ash Wednesday was not part of Lent in his time.

In the 1969 missal of the Roman Rite, an alternative formula (based on Mark 1:15) was introduced and given first place &quot;Repent, and believe in the Gospel&quot; and the older formula was translated as &quot;Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&quot; The old formula, based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin, reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus, implicitly, of their need to repent in time.

Various manners of placing the ashes on worshippers&#x27; heads are in use within the Latin Church, the two most common being to use the ashes to make a cross on the forehead and sprinkle the ashes over the crown of the head. Originally, the ashes were strewn over men&#x27;s heads, but, probably because women had their heads covered in church (based on 1 Corinthians 11), were placed on the foreheads of women. In the Catholic Church the manner of imposing ashes depends largely on local custom since no fixed rule has been laid down. In the Lutheran Churches, ashes are normatively placed on the forehead in the shape of a cross. 

Although the account of Ælfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were &quot;strewn&quot; on the head, the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English-speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the &quot;Occasional Offices&quot; of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, a publication described as &quot;noticeably Anglo-Catholic in character&quot;. In its ritual of &quot;Blessing of Ashes&quot;, this states that &quot;the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist. After they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people.&quot;

The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, contains &quot;The Imposition of Ashes&quot; in its Ash Wednesday liturgy. On Ash Wednesday, the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina, where, by the custom in Italy and many other countries, ashes are sprinkled on his head, not smudged on his forehead, and he places ashes on the heads of others in the same way.

The Anglican ritual, used in Papua New Guinea states that, after the blessing of the ashes, &quot;the priest marks his forehead and then the foreheads of the servers and congregation who come and kneel, or stand, where they normally receive the Blessed Sacrament.&quot; The corresponding Catholic ritual in the Roman Missal for celebration within Mass merely states: &quot;Then the Priest places ashes on the head of those present who come to him, and says to each one ...&quot; Pre-1970 editions had much more elaborate instructions about the order in which the participants were to receive the ashes, but again without any indication of the form of placing the ashes on the head.

The 1969 revision of the Roman Rite inserted into the Mass the solemn ceremony of blessing ashes and placing them on heads, but also explicitly envisaged a similar solemn ceremony outside of Mass. The Book of Blessings contains a simple rite. While the solemn rite would normally be carried out within a church building, the simple rite could appropriately be used almost anywhere. While only a priest or deacon may bless the ashes, laypeople may do the placing of the ashes on a person&#x27;s head. Even in the solemn rite, laymen or women may assist the priest in distributing the ashes. In addition, laypeople take blessed ashes left over after the collective ceremony and place them on the heads of the sick or of others who are unable to attend the blessing. (In 2014, Anglican Liverpool Cathedral likewise offered to impose ashes within the church without a solemn ceremony.)

In addition, those who attend such Catholic services, whether in a church or elsewhere, traditionally take blessed ashes home with them to place on the heads of other members of the family, and it is recommended to have envelopes available to facilitate this practice. At home the ashes are then placed with little or no ceremony.

Unlike its discipline regarding sacraments, the Catholic Church does not exclude anyone from receiving sacramentals, such as the placing of ashes on the head, even those who are not Catholics and perhaps not even baptized. Even those who have been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to &quot;celebrate&quot; sacramentals are not forbidden to &quot;receive&quot; them. After describing the blessing, the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes (within Mass) states: &quot;Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him.&quot; The Catholic Church does not limit the distribution of blessed ashes to church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centers, nursing homes, and factories. Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture (at least one) and prayers, and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed.

The Catholic Church and the Methodist Church say that the ashes should be those of palm branches blessed at the previous year&#x27;s Palm Sunday service, while a Church of England publication says they &quot;may be made&quot; from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year. These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than, for the Catholic liturgy, a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them. An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes with a small amount of holy water or olive oil as a fixative.

Where ashes are placed on the head by smudging the forehead with a sign of the cross, many Christians choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day. The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule, and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them; but some Christian leaders, such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry, recommend keeping the ashes on the forehead for the rest of the day as a public profession of the Christian faith. Morgan Guyton, a Methodist pastor, and leader in the Red-Letter Christian movement, encourages Christians to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom.

====Ashes to Go====

Since 2007, some members of major Christian Churches in the United States, including Anglicans, Lutherans, United Church of Christ, and Methodists, have participated in &#x27;Ashes to Go&#x27; activities, in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places, such as city centres, sidewalks and railroad stations, to distribute ashes to passers-by, even to people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change. The Anglican priest Emily Mellott of Calvary Church in Lombard took up the idea and turned it into a movement, stated that the practice was also an act of evangelism.

Anglicans and Catholics in parts of the United Kingdom such as Sunderland, are offering Ashes to Go together: Marc Lyden-Smith, the priest of Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, stated that the ecumenical effort is a &quot;tremendous witness in our city, with Catholics and Anglicans working together to start the season of Lent, perhaps reminding those who have fallen away from the Church, or have never been before, that the Christian faith is alive and active in Sunderland.&quot; The Catholic Student Association of Kent State University, based at the University Parish Newman Center, offered ashes to university students who were going through the Student Center of that institution in 2012, and Douglas Clark of St. Matthew&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Statesboro, among others, have participated in Ashes to Go.

On Ash Wednesday 2017, Father Paddy Mooney, the priest of St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in the Irish town of Glenamaddy, set up an Ashes to Go station through which commuters could drive and receive ashes from their car; the parish church also had &quot;drive-through prayers during Lent with people submitting requests into a box left in the church grounds without having to leave their car&quot;. Reverend Trey Hall, pastor of Urban Village United Methodist Church, stated that when his local church offered ashes in Chicago &quot;nearly 300 people received ashesincluding two people who were waiting in their car for a stoplight to change.&quot;

In 2013, churches not only in the United States but also at least one church each in the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa, participated in Ashes to Go. Outside of their church building, Saint Stephen Martyr Lutheran Church in Canton offered Ashes to Go for &quot;believers whose schedules make it difficult to attend a traditional service&quot; in 2016. In the United States itself 34 states and the District of Columbia had at least one church taking part. Most of these churches (parishes) were Episcopal, but there were also several Methodist churches, as well as Presbyterian and Catholic churches.

===Commination Office===

Robin Knowles Wallace states that the traditional Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 (the &quot;Miserere&quot;), prayers of confession, and the sign of ashes. No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements. The Anglican church&#x27;s traditional Ash Wednesday service, titled &quot;A Commination&quot;, contains the first two elements, but not the third. On the other hand, the Catholic Church&#x27;s traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but, while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 (the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days, including Ash Wednesday) are a part of its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy, they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes.

The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditionally weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970 when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass, at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm. Where the traditional Gregorian Chants are still used, the psalm continues to enjoy a prominent place in the ceremony.

In the mid-16th century, the first Book of Common Prayer removed the ceremony of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England and replaced it with what would later be called the Commination Office. In that 1549 edition, the rite was headed: &quot;The First Day of Lent: Commonly Called Ash-Wednesday&quot;. The ashes ceremony was not forbidden, but was not included in the church&#x27;s official liturgy. Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners, to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen.

The text of the &quot;Commination or Denouncing of God&#x27;s Anger and Judgments against Sinners&quot; begins: &quot;In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored, (which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time (in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences of God&#x27;s cursing against impenitent sinners&quot;. In line with this, Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of &quot;The Commination&quot; was due to a desire of the reformers &quot;to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church&quot;. He further stated that &quot;the sentences of the greater excommunication&quot; within &quot;The Commination&quot; corresponded to those used in the ancient Church.

The Anglican Church&#x27;s Ash Wednesday liturgy, he wrote, also traditionally included the &quot;Miserere&quot;, which, along with &quot;what follows&quot; in the rest of the service (lesser Litany, Lord&#x27;s Prayer, three prayers for pardon and final blessing), &quot;was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday&quot;. From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes. In the Sarum Rite, the &quot;Miserere&quot; psalm was one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony. In the 20th century, the Episcopal Church introduced three prayers from the Sarum Rite and omitted the Commination Office from its liturgy.

===Low church ceremonies===
In some of the low church traditions, other practices are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned.

===Regional customs===
In the Victorian era, theatres refrained from presenting costumed shows on Ash Wednesday, so they provided other entertainment, as mandated by the Church of England (Anglican Church).

In Iceland, children &quot;pin small bags of ashes on the back of some unsuspecting person&quot;, dress up in costumes, and sing songs for candy.

In Hungary if someone in the village didn&#x27;t receive ash, they &quot;shared their blessing&quot; by rubbing their foreheads together, and the Csángó people of Moldova even cover the pots with ashes to bring good luck. Ash Wednesday also marks the start of Lent. An interesting related tradition is that since dancing was forbidden, children played dancing games (like ulicskázás and hajujvárazás) and ball games (as mancsozás, csülgözés, kutyasatú and sajbózás), all specific to Hungary. 

==Biblical significance of ashes==
Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief. When Tamar was raped by her half-brother, &quot;she sprinkled ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying&quot; (). The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults. Ashes could be symbolic of the old sinful self dying and returning to the dust. In Job , Job says to God: &quot;I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.&quot;

The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying: &quot;O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, roll in the ashes&quot; (Jer 6:26). The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God: &quot;I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes&quot; (Daniel 9:3). Just before the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the Maccabees, prepared for battle using ashes: &quot;That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes&quot; (1 Maccabees 3:47; see also 4:39).

Examples of the practice among Jews are found in several other books of the Bible, including Numbers , , Jonah , Book of Esther , and Hebrews . Jesus is quoted as speaking of the practice in Matthew and Luke : &quot;If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago (sitting) in sackcloth and ashes.&quot;

==Christian use of ashes==

Christians continued the practice of using ashes as an external sign of repentance. Tertullian (c. 225) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in sackcloth and ashes. The historian Eusebius (c. 260/265339/340) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion.

John W. Fenton writes that &quot;by the end of the 10th century, it was customary in Western Europe (but not yet in Rome) for all the faithful to receive ashes on the first day of the Lenten fast. In 1091, this custom was then ordered by Pope Urban II at the council of Benevento to be extended to the church in Rome. Not long after that, the name of the day was referred to in the liturgical books as &quot;Feria Quarta Cinerum&quot; (i.e., Ash Wednesday).&quot;

The public penance that grave sinners underwent before being admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent, on the first day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in sackcloth. When, towards the end of the first millennium, the discipline of public penance was dropped, the beginning of Lent, seen as a general penitential season, was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all. This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century. About two centuries later, Ælfric of Eynsham, an Anglo-Saxon abbot, wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent.
The article on Ash Wednesday in the &quot; Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition states that, after the Protestant Reformation, the ashes ceremony was not forbidden in the Church of England; liturgical scholar Blair Meeks notes that the Lutheran and Anglican denominations &quot;never lapsed in this observance&quot;. It was even prescribed under King Henry VIII in 1538 and under King Edward VI in 1550, but it fell out of use in many areas after 1600. In 1536, the Ten Articles issued by authority of Henry VIII commended &quot;the observance of various rites and ceremonies as good and laudable, such as clerical vestments, a sprinkling of holy water, bearing of candles on Candlemas-day, giving of ashes on Ash-Wednesday&quot;.

After Henry&#x27;s death in January 1547, Thomas Cranmer, within the same year, &quot;procured an order from the Council to forbid the carrying of candles on Candlemas-day, and the use of ashes on Ash-Wednesday, and of palms on Palm-Sunday, as superstitious ceremonies&quot;, an order that was issued only for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury, of which Cranmer was archbishop. &quot;The Church Cyclopædia&quot; states that the &quot;English office had adapted the very old Salisbury service for Ash-Wednesday, prefacing it with an address and a recital of the curses of Mount Ebal, and then with an exhortation uses the older service very nearly as it stood.&quot;

The new Commination Office had no blessing of ashes and therefore, in England as a whole, &quot;soon after the Reformation, the use of ashes was discontinued as a &#x27;vain show&#x27; and Ash Wednesday then became only a day of marked solemnity, with a memorial of its original character in a reading of the curses denounced against impenitent sinners&quot;. The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in the 19th century, observed Ash Wednesday: &quot;as a day of fasting and humiliation, wherein we are publicly to confess our sins, meekly to implore God&#x27;s mercy and forgiveness, and humbly to intercede for the continuance of his favour&quot;. In the 20th century, the Book of Common Prayer provided prayers for the imposition of ashes.

Monte Canfield and Blair Meeks state that after the Protestant Reformation, Lutherans and Anglicans kept the rite of blessing and distributing ashes to the faithful on Ash Wednesday, and that the Protestant denominations that did not keep it, such as the Methodists, encouraged its use &quot;during and after the ecumenical era that resulted in the Vatican II proclamations&quot;. Jack Kingsbury and Russell F. Anderson likewise state that the practice was continued among some Lutherans and Anglicans.

As part of the liturgical revival ushered in by the ecumenical movement, the practice was encouraged in Protestant churches, including the Methodist Church. It has also been adopted by Anabaptist and Reformed churches and some less liturgical denominations.

The Eastern Orthodox churches generally do not observe Ash Wednesday, although in recent times, the creation of the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate has led to the observance of Ash Wednesday among Western Orthodox parishes. In this tradition, ashes &quot;may be distributed outside of the mass or any liturgical service&quot; although &quot;commonly the faithful receive their ashes immediately before the Ash Wednesday mass&quot;. In Orthodoxy, historically, &quot;serious public sinners in the East also donned sackcloth, including those who made the Great Fast a major theme of their entire lives such as hermits and desert-dwellers.&quot; Byzantine Rite Catholics, although in the United States use &quot;the same Gregorian calendar as the Roman Catholic rite&quot;, do not practice the distribution of ashes as it is &quot;not part of their ancient tradition&quot;.

In the Ambrosian Rite, ashes are blessed and placed on the heads of the faithful not on the day that elsewhere is called Ash Wednesday, but at the end of Mass on the following Sunday, which in that rite inaugurates Lent, with the fast traditionally beginning on Monday, the first weekday of the Ambrosian Lent.

==Dates==
Ash Wednesday is exactly 46 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 4 February (which is only possible during a common year with Easter Sunday on 22 March), which happened in 1598, 1693, 1761, and 1818 and will next occur in 2285. The latest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 10 March (when Easter Sunday falls on 25 April) which occurred in 1666, 1734, 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038.

Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, Ash Wednesday has never occurred on a Leap Year Day (29 February) but it will do so for the first time in 2096. The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on 29 February are 2468, 2688, 2840, and 2992. (Ash Wednesday falls on 29 February if and only if Easter is on 15 April in a leap year.) Also, there are certain times that Ash Wednesday coincides with Valentine&#x27;s Day (14 February), which occurred in 1923, 1934, 1945, 2018, 2024, and will next occur in 2029.
Ash Wednesday marks the start of a 40-day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to fast and pray. During this time he was tempted. , , and . While not specifically instituted in the Bible text, the 40 days of fast and pray is also analogous to the 40 days during which Moses repented and fasted in response to the making of the Golden calf (Exo. 34:27–28). (Jews today follow 40 days of repenting in preparation for and during the High Holy Days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur.)

==National No Smoking Day==
In the Republic of Ireland, Ash Wednesday is National No Smoking Day. The date was chosen because quitting smoking ties in with giving up a luxury for Lent, and because of the link between ash and smoking. In the United Kingdom, No Smoking Day was held for the first time on Ash Wednesday in 1984 but is now fixed as the second Wednesday in March.
