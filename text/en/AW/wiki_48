<text>August Wilson (né Frederick August Kittel Jr.; April 27, 1945 – October 2, 2005) was an American playwright. He has been referred to as the &quot;theater&#x27;s poet of Black America&quot;. He is best known for a series of 10 plays, collectively called &quot;&quot; (or &quot;The Century Cycle&quot;)&quot;,&quot; which chronicle the experiences and heritage of the African-American community in the 20th century. Plays in the series include &quot;Fences&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; (1990), each of which won Wilson the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, as well as &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1984) and &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot; (1988). In 2006, Wilson was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Other themes range from the systemic and historical exploitation of African Americans, race relations, identity, migration, and racial discrimination. Viola Davis said that Wilson&#x27;s writing &quot;captures our humor, our vulnerabilities, our tragedies, our trauma. And he humanizes us. And he allows us to talk.&quot; Since Wilson&#x27;s death, three of his plays have been adapted or re-adapted into films: &quot;Fences&quot; (2016), &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (2020) and &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; (2024). Denzel Washington has shepherded the films and has vowed to continue Wilson&#x27;s legacy by adapting the rest of his plays into films for a wider audience. Washington said, &quot;the greatest part of what&#x27;s left of my career is making sure that August is taken care of&quot;.

==Early life==
Wilson was born Frederick August Kittel Jr. in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the fourth of six children. His father, Frederick August Kittel Sr., was a Sudeten German immigrant, who was a baker/pastry cook. His mother, Daisy Wilson, was an African-American woman from North Carolina who cleaned homes for a living. Wilson&#x27;s anecdotal history reports that his maternal grandmother walked from North Carolina to Pennsylvania in search of a better life. Wilson&#x27;s mother raised the children alone until he was five in a two-room apartment behind a grocery store at 1727 Bedford Avenue; his father was mostly absent from his childhood. Wilson later wrote under his mother&#x27;s surname.

The economically depressed neighborhood where he was raised was inhabited predominantly by Black Americans and Jewish and Italian immigrants. Life was tough for the Kittel siblings as they were biracial. August struggled with finding a sense of belonging to a particular culture and did not feel that he truly fit into African-American culture or White culture until later in life. Wilson&#x27;s mother divorced his father and married David Bedford in the 1950s, and the family moved from the Hill District to the then predominantly White working-class neighborhood of Hazelwood, where they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home. They were soon forced out of their house and on to their next home.

The Hill District went on to become the setting of numerous plays in the &quot;Pittsburgh Cycle&quot;. His experiences growing up there with a strong matriarch shaped the way his plays would be written.
In 1959, Wilson was one of 14 African-American students at Central Catholic High School but dropped out after one year. He then attended Connelley Vocational High School, but found the curriculum unchallenging. He dropped out of Gladstone High School in the 10th grade in 1960 after his teacher accused him of plagiarizing a 20-page paper he wrote on Napoleon I of France. Wilson hid his decision from his mother because he did not want to disappoint her. At the age of 16 he began working menial jobs, where he met a wide variety of people on whom some of his later characters were based, such as Sam in &quot;The Janitor&quot; (1985).

Wilson&#x27;s extensive use of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh resulted in its later awarding him an honorary high school diploma. Wilson, who said he had learned to read at the age of four, began reading Black writers at the library when he was 12 and spent the remainder of his teen years educating himself through the books of Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps, and others.

==Career==
=== 1960s ===
Wilson knew that he wanted to be a writer, but this created tension with his mother, who wanted him to become a lawyer. She forced him to leave the family home and he enlisted in the United States Army for a three-year stint in 1962, but he was discharged after a year and went back to working various odd jobs as a porter, short-order cook, gardener, and dishwasher.

Frederick August Kittel Jr. changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother after his father&#x27;s death in 1965. That same year, he discovered the blues as sung by Bessie Smith, and he bought a stolen typewriter for $10, which he often pawned when money was tight. At 20, he decided he was a poet and submitted work to such magazines as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. He began to write in bars, the local cigar store, and cafes—longhand on table napkins and on yellow notepads, absorbing the voices and characters around him. He liked to write on cafe napkins because, he said, it freed him up and made him less self-conscious as a writer. He would then gather the notes and type them up at home. Gifted with a talent for catching dialect and accents, Wilson had an &quot;astonishing memory&quot;, which he put to full use during his career. He slowly learned not to censor the language he heard when incorporating it into his work.
Malcolm X&#x27;s voice influenced Wilson&#x27;s life and work (such as &quot;The Ground on Which I Stand,&quot; 1996). Both the Nation of Islam (NOI) and the Black Power movement spoke to him regarding self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-determination, and he appreciated the origin myths that Elijah Muhammad supported. In 1969 Wilson married Brenda Burton, a Muslim, and became associated with the NOI, though he reportedly did not convert. He and Brenda had one daughter, Sakina Ansari-Wilson. The couple divorced in 1972.

In 1968, along with his friend Rob Penny, Wilson co-founded the Black Horizon Theater in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. Wilson&#x27;s first play, &quot;Recycling&quot;, was performed for audiences in small theaters, schools and public housing community centers for 50 cents a ticket. Among these early efforts was &quot;Jitney&quot;, which he revised more than two decades later as part of his 10-play cycle on 20th-century Pittsburgh. He had no directing experience. He recalled: &quot;Someone had looked around and said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s going to be the director?&#x27; I said, &#x27;I will.&#x27; I said that because I knew my way around the library. So I went to look for a book on how to direct a play. I found one called &quot;The Fundamentals of Play Directing&quot; and checked it out.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
In 1976, Vernell Lillie, who had founded the Kuntu Repertory Theatre at the University of Pittsburgh two years earlier, directed Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot;. That same year Wilson saw Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Sizwe Banzi is Dead&quot;, staged at the Pittsburgh Public Theater, the first time he attended professionally produced drama. Wilson, Penny, and poet Maisha Baton then founded the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring African-American writers together and to assist them in publication and production. Both organizations remain active.

In 1978, Wilson moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, at the suggestion of his friend, director Claude Purdy, who helped him secure a job writing educational scripts for the Science Museum of Minnesota. In 1980 he received a fellowship for The Playwrights&#x27; Center in Minneapolis. He quit the museum in 1981, but continued writing plays. For three years, he was a part-time cook for the Little Brothers of the Poor. Wilson had a long association with the Penumbra Theatre Company of St. Paul, which was initially funded by a federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) grant and which premiered some of his plays. He wrote &quot;Fullerton Street&quot;, which has been unproduced and unpublished, in 1980. It follows the Joe Louis/Billy Conn fight in 1941 and the loss of values attendant on the Great Migration to the urban North.

=== 1980s ===
Throughout the 1980s, Wilson wrote the majority of his work including &quot;Jitney&quot; (1982), &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1984), &quot;Fences&quot; (1985), &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; (1987).

In 1987, St. Paul&#x27;s mayor George Latimer named May 27 &quot;August Wilson Day&quot;. He was honored because he is the only person from Minnesota to win a Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Wilson left St. Paul after getting divorced and moved to Seattle. There he developed a relationship with Seattle Repertory Theatre, which produced his entire 10-play cycle and his one-man show &quot;How I Learned What I Learned.&quot;

Though he was a writer dedicated to writing for theater, a Hollywood studio proposed filming Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Fences&quot;. He insisted that a Black director be hired for the film, saying: &quot;I declined a White director not on the basis of race but on the basis of culture. White directors are not qualified for the job. The job requires someone who shares the specifics of the culture of Black Americans.&quot; The film remained unmade until 2016, when Denzel Washington directed the film &quot;Fences&quot;, starring Washington and Viola Davis. It earned Wilson a posthumous Oscar nomination.

Wilson received many honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the University of Pittsburgh, of which he was a trustee from 1992 until 1995.

Wilson maintained a strong voice in the progress and development of the (then) contemporary Black theater, undoubtedly taking influences from the examples of his youth, such as those displayed during the Black Arts Movement. One of the most notable examples of Wilson&#x27;s strong opinions and critiques of what was Black theater&#x27;s state in the 1990s, was the &quot;On Cultural Power: The August Wilson/Robert Brustein Discussion&quot; where Wilson argued for a completely Black theater with all positions filled by Blacks. Conversely, he argued that Black actors should not play roles not specifically Black (e.g., no Black Hamlet). Brustein heatedly took an opposing view.

=== 2000s ===
In 2005, Wilson&#x27;s final installment in his ten-part series &quot;The Century Cycle&quot;, titled &quot;Radio Golf&quot;, opened. It was first performed in 2005 by the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut and had its Broadway premiere in 2007 at the Cort Theatre. It would become known as Wilson&#x27;s final work.

==Post–Black Arts Movement==
Although Wilson&#x27;s work is not formally recognized within the literary canon of the Black Arts Movement, he was certainly a product of its mission, helping to co-found the Black Horizon Theatre in his hometown of Pittsburgh in 1968. Situated in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District, a historically and predominantly Black neighborhood, the Black Horizon Theatre became a cultural hub of Black creativity and community building. As a playwright of what is considered the Post–Black Arts Movement, Wilson inherited the spirit of BAM, producing plays that celebrated the history and poetic sensibilities of Black people. His iconic Century Cycle successfully tracked and synthesized the experiences of Black America in the 20th century, using each historical decade, from 1904 to 1997, to document the physical, emotional, mental, and political strivings of Black life in the wake of emancipation.

Wilson&#x27;s best-known plays are &quot;Fences&quot; (1985) (which won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award), &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; (1990) (a Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award), &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;, and &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot;.

Wilson stated that he was most influenced by &quot;the four Bs&quot;: blues music, the Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges, the playwright Amiri Baraka and the painter Romare Bearden. He went on to add writers Ed Bullins and James Baldwin to the list. He noted:

He valued Bullins and Baldwin for their honest representations of everyday life.

Like Bearden, Wilson worked with collage techniques in writing: &quot;I try to make my plays the equal of his canvases. In creating plays I often use the image of a stewing pot in which I toss various things that I&#x27;m going to make use of—a black cat, a garden, a bicycle, a man with a scar on his face, a pregnant woman, a man with a gun.&quot; On the meaning of his work, Wilson stated:

===The &quot;Pittsburgh Cycle&quot;===

Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Pittsburgh Cycle&quot;, also often referred to as his &quot;Century Cycle&quot;, consists of ten plays—nine of which are set in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District (the other being set in Chicago), an African-American neighborhood that takes on a mythic literary significance like Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex, William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha County, or Irish playwright Brian Friel&#x27;s Ballybeg. The plays are each set in a different decade and aim to sketch the Black experience in the 20th century and &quot;raise consciousness through theater&quot; and echo &quot;the poetry in the everyday language of Black America&quot;. His writing of the Black experience always featured strong female characters and sometimes included elements of the supernatural. In his book, he wrote &quot;My mother&#x27;s a very strong, principled woman. My female characters . . . come in a large part from my mother.&quot;

As for the elements of the supernatural, Wilson often featured some form of superstition or old tradition in plays that came down to supernatural roots. One of his plays well known for featuring this is &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;. In the play, the piano is used and releases spirits of the ancestors. Wilson wanted to create such an event in the play that the audience was left to decide what was real or not. He was fascinated by the power of theater as a medium where a community at large could come together to bear witness to events and currents unfolding.

Wilson told &quot;The Paris Review&quot;:

Although the plays of the cycle are not strictly connected to the degree of a serial story, some characters appear (at various ages) in more than one of the cycle&#x27;s plays. Children of characters in earlier plays may appear in later plays. The character most frequently mentioned in the cycle is Aunt Ester, a &quot;washer of souls&quot;. She is reported to be 285 years old in &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;, which takes place in her home at 1839 Wylie Avenue, and 349 in &quot;Two Trains Running&quot;. She dies in 1985, during the events of &quot;King Hedley II&quot;. Much of the action of &quot;Radio Golf&quot; revolves around the plan to demolish and redevelop that house, some years after her death. Aunt Ester is a symbolic and recurring figure that represents the African-American struggle. She is &quot;not literally three centuries old but a succession of folk priestesses... [s]he embodies a weighty history of tragedy and triumph&quot;. The plays often include an &quot;apparently&quot; mentally impaired oracular character (different in each play)—for example, Hedley Sr. in &quot;Seven Guitars&quot;, Gabriel in &quot;Fences&quot;, Stool Pigeon in &quot;King Hedley II&quot;, or Hambone in &quot;Two Trains Running&quot;.

Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre was the first theater in the world to produce the entire 10-play cycle, in productions which spanned from 1986 to 2007. Two of the Goodman&#x27;s productions—&quot;Seven Guitars&quot; and &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;—were world premieres. Israel Hicks produced the entire 10-play cycle from 1990 to 2009 for the Denver Center Theatre Company. Geva Theatre Center produced all 10 plays in decade order from 2007 to 2011 as &quot;August Wilson&#x27;s American Century&quot;. The Huntington Theatre Company of Boston has produced all 10 plays, finishing in 2012. During Wilson&#x27;s life he worked closely with The Huntington to produce the later plays. Pittsburgh Public Theater was the first theater company in Pittsburgh to produce the entire Century Cycle, including the world premiere of &quot;King Hedley II&quot; to open the O&#x27;Reilly Theater in Downtown Pittsburgh.

TAG – The Actors&#x27; Group, in Honolulu, Hawaii, produced all 10 plays in the cycle starting in 2004 with &quot;Two Trains Running&quot; and culminating in 2015 with &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;. All shows were Hawaii premieres, all were extremely successful at the box office and garnered many local theatre awards for the actors and the organization. The Black Rep in St. Louis and the Anthony Bean Community Theater in New Orleans have also presented the complete cycle.

In the years after Wilson&#x27;s death the 10-play cycle has been referred to as &quot;The August Wilson Century Cycle&quot; and as &quot;The American Century Cycle&quot;.

Two years before his death in 2005, Wilson wrote and performed an unpublished one-man play entitled &quot;How I Learned What I Learned&quot; about the power of art and the power of possibility. This was produced at New York&#x27;s Signature Theatre and directed by Todd Kreidler, Wilson&#x27;s friend and protégé. &quot;How I Learned&quot; explores his days as a struggling young writer in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District and how the neighborhood and its people inspired his cycle of plays about the African-American experience.

==Personal life==
Wilson was married three times. His first marriage was to Brenda Burton from 1969 to 1972. They had one daughter, Sakina Ansari, born 1970. In 1981, he married Judy Oliver, a social worker; they divorced in 1990. He married again in 1994 and was survived by his third wife, costume designer Constanza Romero, whom he met on the set of &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;. They had a daughter, Azula Carmen Wilson. Wilson also was survived by siblings Freda Ellis, Linda Jean Kittel, Richard Kittel, Donna Conley and Edwin Kittel.

==Death==
Wilson reported that he had been diagnosed with liver cancer in June 2005 and been given three to five months to live. He died at age 60 on October 2 of that year at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, and was interred at Greenwood Cemetery, Pittsburgh, on October 8. He reportedly requested a &quot;Black funeral&quot; at Saint Paul Cathedral, but permission for a non-Catholic funeral was not granted by the diocese. A memorial service was instead held at the University of Pittsburgh.

==Legacy and honors==

The childhood home of Wilson and his six siblings, at 1727 Bedford Avenue in Pittsburgh, was declared a historic landmark by the State of Pennsylvania on May 30, 2007. On February 26, 2008, Pittsburgh City Council placed the house on the List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations. On April 30, 2013, the August Wilson House was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In Pittsburgh, there is an August Wilson Center for African American Culture. The center includes a permanent exhibition on Wilson&#x27;s life in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District, &quot;August Wilson: A Writer&#x27;s Landscape.&quot;

On October 16, 2005, fourteen days after Wilson&#x27;s death, the Virginia Theatre in New York City&#x27;s Broadway Theater District was renamed the August Wilson Theatre. It is the first Broadway theatre to bear the name of an African-American. The theatre has run many shows, including &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, and &quot;Mean Girls&quot;.

In 2007, the August Wilson Monologue Competition was founded by Kenny Leon and Todd Kreidler. High school students, supported by professional actors, mentors, local drama teachers and others learn a monologue from one of Wilson&#x27;s plays, and perform it in front of a professional jury. This tribute to Wilson&#x27;s work is an official contest in many American cities including, as of 2020, Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Greensboro, Los Angeles, New Haven, New York, Norfolk, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Diego, and Seattle. The national winner of the contest gets the chance to perform on Broadway.

In Seattle, Washington, along the south side of the Seattle Repertory Theatre, the vacated Republican Street between Warren Avenue N. and 2nd Avenue N. on the Seattle Center grounds has been renamed August Wilson Way.

In September 2016, an existing community park near his childhood home was renovated and renamed August Wilson Park.

In 2020, the University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh acquired Wilson&#x27;s literary papers and materials to establish the August Wilson Archive.

In 2021, the United States Postal Service honored Wilson with a Forever stamp featuring him as part of the Black Heritage series of stamps. It was designed by Ethel Kessler with art from Tim O&#x27;Brien.

On January 7, 2025, Wilson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<doc id="171036" wikidata="Q438472" url="?curid=171036" title="Irving Thalberg">
<text>Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 – September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called &quot;The Boy Wonder&quot; for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, &quot;China Seas&quot;, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;Camille&quot; and &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. His films carved out an international market, &quot;projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom&quot;, states biographer Roland Flamini.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and as a child was afflicted by a congenital heart disease that doctors said would kill him before he reached the age of thirty. After graduating from high school he worked as a store clerk during the day and to gain some job skills took a night class in typing. He then found work as a secretary with Universal Studios&#x27; New York office, and was later made studio manager for its Los Angeles facility. There, he oversaw production of a hundred films during his three years with the company. Among the films he produced was &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923).

In Los Angeles, he partnered with Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s new studio and, after it merged with two other studios, helped create Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). He was made head of production of MGM in 1925, at the age of twenty-six, helping MGM become the most successful studio in Hollywood. During his twelve years with MGM, until his early death at the age of 37, he produced four hundred films, most of which bore his imprint and innovations, including story conferences with writers, sneak previews to gain early feedback, and extensive re-shooting of scenes to improve the film. In addition, he introduced horror films to audiences and coauthored the &quot;Production Code&quot;, guidelines for morality followed by all studios. During the 1920s and 1930s, he synthesized and merged the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.

Thalberg created numerous stars and groomed their screen images. Among them were Lon Chaney, Ramon Novarro, Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, Spencer Tracy, Luise Rainer, and Norma Shearer, who became his wife. He had the ability to merge quality with commercial success, and was credited with bringing his artistic aspirations in line with the demand of audiences. After his death, Hollywood producers said he had been the world&#x27;s &quot;foremost figure in motion-picture history&quot;. President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote, &quot;The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces.&quot; The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, given out periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1937, is awarded to producers whose films reflect consistently high quality.

== Early years ==
Thalberg was born in Brooklyn, to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann). Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with &quot;blue baby syndrome&quot;, caused by a congenital disease that limited the oxygen supply to his heart. The prognosis from the family&#x27;s doctor and specialists was that he might live to the age of twenty, or at most, to thirty.

During his high school years in Brooklyn, he began having attacks of chest pains, dizziness and fatigue. This affected his ability to study, though until that time he was a good student. When he was 17 he contracted rheumatic fever, and was confined to bed for a year. His mother, in order to prevent him falling too far behind other students, brought him homework from school, books, and tutors to teach him at home. She also hoped that the schoolwork and reading would distract him from the &quot;tantalizing sounds&quot; of children playing outside his window.

With little to entertain him, he read books as a main activity. He devoured popular novels, classics, plays, and biographies. His books, of necessity, replaced the streets of New York, and led to his interest in classical philosophy and philosophers, such as William James.

When Thalberg returned to school, he finished high school but lacked the stamina for college, which he felt would have required constant late-night studying and cramming for exams. Instead, he took part-time jobs as a store clerk, and in the evenings, to gain some job skills, taught himself typing, shorthand and Spanish at a night vocational school. When he turned 18, he placed an advertisement in the local newspaper hoping to find better work:

== Career as producer ==
=== Universal Studios ===
He found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures&#x27; New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio&#x27;s founder and president, Carl Laemmle. Among Thalberg&#x27;s duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned $25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle.

Laemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and &quot;keep an eye on things for me.&quot; Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he had been given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, and thus impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems.

Thalberg suggested, &quot;The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.&quot; Laemmle immediately agreed: &quot;All right. You&#x27;re it.&quot; In shock, Thalberg replied, &quot;I&#x27;m what?&quot; Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. When aged 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development.

In describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian David Thomson writes that his new job &quot;owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.&quot; He reasons that despite &quot;Thalberg&#x27;s youth, modest education, and frail appearance ... it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.&quot;

Thalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as Conrad Nagel, did not like the five-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did Marion Davies, who was not used to such &quot;big wide spaces&quot;. Samuel Marx, a close friend of Thalberg&#x27;s from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. &quot;We were all young&quot;, said comedian Buster Keaton. &quot;The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young—and growing like nothing ever seen before.&quot;

==== Confrontation with Erich von Stroheim ====
He quickly established his tenacity as he battled with well-known director Erich von Stroheim over the length of &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; (1922). Biographer Roland Flamini notes that the film was Universal&#x27;s most expensive &quot;jewel&quot; ever in production, and its director and star, von Stroheim, was taking the film far over budget. Thalberg, now Universal&#x27;s general manager, was forced to have the director quickly finalize production before the studio&#x27;s working capital was used up. Flamini describes the situation:

Thalberg had von Stroheim come to his office, which he did still wearing his film costume as a Russian Imperial Guard and escorted by members of his production team. Thalberg calmly told him, &quot;I have seen all the film and you have all you need for the picture. I want you to stop shooting&quot;, to which von Stroheim replied, &quot;But I have not finished as yet.&quot; &quot;Yes, you have&quot;, said Thalberg. &quot;You have spent all the money this company can afford. I cannot allow you to spend any more.&quot;

Thalberg quietly explained that the director worked under the producer, and it was his responsibility to control costs. Von Stroheim, surrounded by his assistants, then confronted Thalberg: &quot;If you were not my superior, I would smash you in the face.&quot; Thalberg, unflinching, said &quot;Don&#x27;t let that stop you.&quot; The result was that Thalberg soon afterward removed the cameras from von Stroheim&#x27;s studio and took over editing. The uncut footage was pared down from five-and-a-half hours to three hours, to von Stroheim&#x27;s deep dissatisfaction.

A similar problem developed with von Stroheim&#x27;s next film, &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1923). Although he had promised Thalberg to remain within budget this time, he continued production until it went to twice the agreed length and was not yet near completion. Flamini speculates why this happened:

Thalberg again called von Stroheim to his office, handed him a long letter written and signed by himself, describing the problems, and summarily fired von Stroheim as of that moment. Thalberg&#x27;s letter stated among the reasons,

 totally inexcusable and repeated acts of insubordination ... extravagant ideas which you have been unwilling to sacrifice ... unnecessary delays ... and your apparent idea that you are greater and more powerful than the organization that employs you.

His dismissal of von Stroheim was considered an &quot;earthquake in movie circles&quot;, notes Flamini. Producer David O. Selznick said that &quot;it was the first time a director had been fired. It took great guts and courage ... Von Stroheim was utterly indifferent over money and could have gone on and spent millions, with nobody to stop him&quot;. The opinion was shared by director Rouben Mamoulian, who said that the &quot;little fellow at Universal&quot;, in one bold stroke, had &quot;asserted the primacy of the studio over the director&quot; and forever altered the balance of power in the movie industry.

==== Effects of his young age ====

According to Flamini, his youth was a subject of conversation within the movie community. Executives from other studios, actors, and film crew, often mistook him to be a junior employee. Movie columnist Louella Parsons, upon first being introduced to him, asked, &quot;What&#x27;s the joke? Where&#x27;s the new general manager?&quot; After five minutes of talking to Thalberg, however, she later wrote about &quot;Universal&#x27;s Boy Wonder&quot;: &quot;He might be a boy in looks and age, but it was no child&#x27;s mind that was being asked to cope with the intricate politics of Universal City.&quot; Novelist Edna Ferber responded the same way, writing that &quot;I had fancied motion-picture producers as large gentlemen smoking oversized cigars. But this young man whose word seemed so final at Universal City ... impressed me deeply.&quot;

The male actors in the studio had a similar reaction. Lionel Barrymore, who was nearly twice his age, recalled their meetings:
Thalberg likewise gained the respect of leading playwrights, some of whom also looked down on him due to his youth. George S. Kaufman, co-author of &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, several Marx Brothers films, and two George Gershwin plays, came from New York to meet with Thalberg. Afterward he confided to his friend, Groucho Marx: &quot;That man has never written a word, yet he can tell me exactly what to do with a story. I didn&#x27;t know you had people like that out here.&quot;

Actress Norma Shearer, whom he later married, was surprised after he greeted her at the door, then walked her to his office for her first job interview: &quot;Then you&#x27;re not the office boy?&quot; she asked. He smiled, as he sat himself behind his desk: &quot;No, Miss Shearer, I&#x27;m Irving Thalberg, vice-president of the Mayer Company. I&#x27;m the man who sent for you.&quot;

His younger-than-normal age for a studio executive was usually mentioned even after he left Universal to help start up MGM. Screenwriter Agnes Christine Johnson, who worked with Thalberg for years, described his contribution during meetings:
The same quality was observed by director and screenwriter Hobart Henley: &quot;If something that read well in conference turns out not so good on the screen, I go to him and, like that—Henley snaps his fingers—he has a remedy. He&#x27;s brilliant.&quot; Another assistant producer to Thalberg explains:
His youth also contributed to his open-mindedness to the ideas of others. Conrad Nagel, who starred in numerous Thalberg films, reported that Thalberg was generally empathetic to those he worked alongside: &quot;Thalberg never raised his voice. He just looked into your eyes, spoke softly, and after a few minutes he cast a spell on you.&quot; Studio attorney Edwin Loeb, who also worked to create AMPAS, explained that &quot;the real foundation of Irving&#x27;s success was his ability to look at life through the eyes of any given person. He had a gift of empathy, and almost complete perspective.&quot; Those opinions were also shared by producer Walter Wanger: &quot;You thought that you were talking to an Indian savant. He could cast a spell on anybody.&quot;

His talent as a producer was enhanced by his &quot;near-miraculous&quot; powers of concentration, notes film critic J. Hoberman. As a result, he was never bored or tired, and supplemented his spare time with reading for his own amusement, recalls screenwriter Bayard Veiller, with some of his favorite authors being Francis Bacon, Epictetus, and Immanuel Kant.

==== Film projects at Universal ====

Biographer Bob Thomas writes that after three years at the studio, Thalberg continually proved his value. Universal&#x27;s pictures improved noticeably, primarily due to Thalberg&#x27;s &quot;uncanny sense of story.&quot; He took tight control over many key aspects of production, including his requirement that from then on scripts were tightly constructed before filming began, rather than during production. Thomas adds that he also &quot;showed a remarkable capacity for working with actors, casting them aptly and advising them on their careers.&quot;

After producing two films that were in production when he began work at Universal, he presented Laemmle with his idea for a film based on one of his favorite classic stories, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Rather than just a horror picture, Thalberg suggested turning it into a spectacle which would include a replica of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. He had Lon Chaney play the hunchback. The film became Universal&#x27;s most profitable silent film and established Chaney&#x27;s career as a top-flight star.

After nearly three years with Universal, Thalberg had supervised over a hundred movies, reorganized the studio to give more control to the managers, and had &quot;stopped the defection&quot; of many of their leading stars by offering them better, higher-paying contracts. He also produced a number of Universal&#x27;s prestige films, which made the company profitable. However, he decided it was time to find a studio in Los Angeles more suitable to his skills, and spread word that he was available.

=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) ===

Cecil B. DeMille was the first who wanted to hire him, telling his partner Jesse Lasky, &quot;The boy is a genius. I can see it. I know it.&quot; Lasky opposed the hire, stating, &quot;Geniuses we have all we need.&quot; Thalberg then received an offer from Hal Roach, but the offer was withdrawn because Thalberg lacked experience with slapstick comedy films. In late 1922, Thalberg was introduced to Louis B. Mayer, president of a small but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg &quot;made a deep, immediate impression on Mayer&quot;, writes Flamini. After Thalberg had left, Mayer said to studio attorney Edwin Loeb: &quot;Tell him if he comes to work for me, I&#x27;ll look after him as though he were my son.&quot;

Although their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man&#x27;s age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at Louis B. Mayer Productions. Years later, Mayer&#x27;s daughter Irene Mayer Selznick recalled that &quot;it was hard to believe anyone that boyish could be so important.&quot; According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, &quot;what he lacked was Thalberg&#x27;s almost unerring ability to combine quality with commercial success, to bring artistic aspiration in line with the demands of the box office.&quot; Mayer&#x27;s company subsequently merged with two others to become Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), with the 24-year-old Thalberg made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production. Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.

During his twelve years at MGM, Thalberg supervised the production of over four hundred films. Although Thalberg and his colleagues at MGM knew he was &quot;doomed&quot; to not live much past the age of 30 due to heart disease, he loved producing films. He continued developing innovative ideas and overseeing most of MGM&#x27;s pictures. Under Thalberg&#x27;s management, MGM released over 40% more films yearly than Warner Brothers, and more than double Paramount&#x27;s releases. From 1924 until 1936, when Thalberg died at the age of 37, &quot;almost every film bore Thalberg&#x27;s imprint&quot;, wrote Mark Vieira.

In the 1934 California gubernatorial election Democratic Upton Sinclair ran against Republican Frank Merriam, the latter of whom MGM supported. Thalberg was to lead MGM&#x27;s anti-Sinclair campaign and the studio recruited Carey Wilson to create a series of anti-Sinclair propaganda films. These films, directed by Felix E. Feist, included fake newsreels of Sinclair supporters who were portrayed as bums and criminals. They were shown in Californian movie theaters, with one episode featuring hired actors as Sinclair supporters speaking with foreign accents. Supposedly when one actor objected to the films Thalberg replied &quot;Nothing is unfair in politics&quot;.

==== Production innovations ====

Thalberg&#x27;s production techniques &quot;broke new ground in filmmaking&quot;, adds Vieira. Among his contributions at MGM was his innovation of story conferences, sneak previews and scene retakes. He introduced the first horror films and coauthored the Production Code, the set of moral guidelines that all film studios agreed to follow. Thalberg helped synthesize and merge the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.

MGM thereby became the only movie studio to consistently show a profit during the Great Depression. Flamini explains that the equation for MGM&#x27;s success depended on combining stars, a Broadway hit or popular classic, and high standards of production. This combination at the time was considered a &quot;revolutionary approach&quot; in the film industry, which until then assumed a star was all that was needed for success, regardless of the story or production quality. The other studios began following MGM&#x27;s lead with that same formula.

==== Production techniques ====
Thalberg generally followed a system in managing his productions. According to one of his assistants, Lawrence Weingarten, who later became a producer, &quot;Thalberg directed the film on paper, and then the director directed the film on film.&quot;

Thalberg was generally opposed to location shooting overseas where he could not oversee production and control costs, as happened with &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. Thus, he kept hundreds of back-lot carpenters at work creating realistic sets, as he did for fifteenth-century &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936), or with &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935), to replicate the harbors of Hong Kong.

Vieira points out that Thalberg&#x27;s &quot;fascination with Broadway plays&quot; often had him create and present stories visually. For &quot;China Seas&quot;, for instance, he described for the screenwriters, director and others, exactly how he wanted the film to appear on screen:
To be certain of achieving the desired effects, Thalberg made sure his cinematographers were careful in their use of light and shadow. Vieira observes that &quot;more than any other producer or any other studio, Thalberg and MGM manipulated lenses, filters, and lighting instruments to affect the viewer.&quot; As a result, he notes, &quot;most of Thalberg&#x27;s films contain moments such as these, in which cinematic technique transcends mere exposition and gives the viewer something to treasure.&quot;

Thalberg was supported by most of the studio in these kinds of creative decisions. &quot;It was a big family,&quot; notes Weingarten. &quot;If we had a success, everybody—and I mean every cutter, every painter, every plasterer—was excited about it, was abuzz, was in a tizzy about the whole idea of picture making.&quot;

==== Taking risks with new subjects and stars ====
In 1929, MGM released fifty films, and all but five showed a profit. Of those that failed, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was also a gamble by Thalberg. When King Vidor, the film&#x27;s producer and director, proposed the idea to Thalberg of a major film cast, for the first time, exclusively with African Americans, he told Thalberg directly, &quot;I doubt that it will make a dollar at the box office.&quot; Thalberg replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about that. I&#x27;ve told you that MGM can afford an occasional experiment.&quot;

By the early 1930s, a number of stars began failing at the box office, partly due to the Great Depression that was now undermining the economy, along with the public&#x27;s ability to spend on entertainment. Thalberg began using two stars in a film, rather than one, as had been the tradition at all the studios, such as pairing Greta Garbo with John Gilbert, Clark Gable with Jean Harlow, and William Powell with Myrna Loy. After experimenting with a few such films, including &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1931), which were profitable, he decided on a multi-star production of another Broadway play, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932). It had five major stars, including Garbo, Joan Crawford, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery. &quot;Before Thalberg,&quot; writes Vieira, &quot;there was no &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; in the American consciousness.&quot; The film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1932.

Thalberg went against consensus and took another risk with &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936), costarring Luise Rainer. Although Louis B. Mayer did not want her in the role, which he felt was too minor for a new star, Thalberg felt that &quot;only she could play the part&quot;, wrote biographer Charles Higham. Shortly after shooting began in late 1935, doubts of Rainer&#x27;s acting ability emerged in the press. However, despite her limited appearances in the film, Rainer &quot;so impressed audiences with one highly emotional scene&quot; that she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

After her winning role in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, Thalberg wanted her to play a role that was the opposite of her previous character, for &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937). For the part as a Chinese peasant, she was required to act totally subservient to her husband, being perpetually huddled in submission, and barely spoke a word of dialogue during the entire film. Rainer recalls that Mayer did not approve of the film being produced or her part in it: &quot;He was horrified at Irving Thalberg&#x27;s insistence for me to play O-lan, the poor uncomely little Chinese peasant.&quot; However, she again won the Oscar for Best Actress, becoming the first actress to win two consecutive Oscars, a feat not matched until Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s two Oscar wins thirty years later.

==== Grooming new stars ====
Besides bringing a distinctive high quality &quot;look&quot; to MGM films and often recreating well-known stories or plays, Thalberg&#x27;s actors themselves took on a characteristic quality. Thalberg wanted his female actors to appear &quot;cool, classy and beautiful,&quot; notes Flamini. And he strove to make the male actors appear &quot;worldly and in control.&quot; In general, Thalberg movies and actors came to be &quot;luxurious,&quot; &quot;glossy,&quot; and &quot;technically flawless.&quot; By doing so, he made stars or boosted the careers of actors such as Lon Chaney, Ramon Novarro, John Gilbert, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Helen Hayes, Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore and Luise Rainer.

==== Greta Garbo ====
In 1925, a young Greta Garbo, then twenty, and unable to speak any English, was brought over from Sweden at Mayer&#x27;s request, as he saw how she looked in still photos. A Swedish friend thought he would help her by contacting Thalberg, who then agreed to give her a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, &quot;the result of the test was electrifying.&quot; Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the new starlet the following day: &quot;the studio arranged to fix her teeth, made sure she lost weight, and gave her an English tutor.&quot;

==== Joan Crawford ====
Joan Crawford&#x27;s first role was a Thalberg production at MGM and she became one of their leading stars for the next thirty years. Crawford was somewhat jealous of Norma Shearer as she thought she was given the better material by her husband Thalberg out of nepotism. Nevertheless, she felt that his contribution to MGM was vital to the film industry. Not long after his early death, she recalls her concerns: &quot;Thalberg was dead and the concept of the quality &#x27;big&#x27; picture pretty much went out the window.&quot;

==== Marie Dressler ====
Thalberg also realized that old stars few had heard of could be made into new ones. Marie Dressler, a fifty-nine-year-old early vaudeville and movie star, who had played the top-billed lead, above Charles Chaplin and Mabel Normand), in the first feature-length comedy, &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; (1914), was unable to get any roles in films after leaving show business for some years, finally working as a maid. MGM screenwriter Frances Marion suggested to Thalberg that she might fit well in a starring role for a new film, and was surprised that he knew of her prior successes. Thalberg approved of using her without a screen test and offered his rationale:
By 1932, shortly before she died, Dressler was the country&#x27;s number one box office star. 

==== Wallace Beery ====
Marie Dressler was paired twice, in &quot;Min and Bill&quot; (1930) and &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (1933), with Wallace Beery, another major silent star who had been struggling to get work in sound pictures until Thalberg cast him. Beery had enjoyed a hugely successful silent film career dating back to 1913, but had been fired by Paramount shortly after sound pictures appeared. Thalberg cast him in the role of &quot;Machine Gun Butch,&quot; which had been meant for recently deceased Lon Chaney, in &quot;The Big House&quot; (1930), an energetic prison picture that became a huge hit. Beery was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, and his burgeoning career at MGM had transformed him into the studio&#x27;s highest paid actor within two more years, during which time he won the Oscar for &quot;The Champ&quot; and had become a phenomenal box office draw as a result of Thalberg&#x27;s foresight.

==== Getting audience feedback and reshooting ====
According to Vieira, MGM had few failures during this period, and numerous blockbusters. Among the reasons was Thalberg&#x27;s unique system of developing a script during story conferences with writers before filming began, and later giving &quot;sneak previews&quot; followed by audience feedback through written questionnaires. Often, where he felt improvement was needed, he arranged for scenes to be reshot. As Thalberg once stated, &quot;The difference between something good and something superior is often very small.&quot;

==== Bad decisions and missed opportunities ====
Thalberg felt he had his &quot;finger on the pulse of America. I know what people will do and what they won&#x27;t do,&quot; he said. His judgment was not always accurate, however. Thalberg&#x27;s bringing Broadway productions to the screen to develop higher picture standards sometimes resulted in &quot;studied&quot; acting or &quot;stagey&quot; sets, notes Flamini. In 1927, after the successful release of the first full-length talking picture, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), he nevertheless felt that talking pictures were a fad. Thalberg likewise did not think that color would replace black-and-white in movies.

When an assistant protested against a script that envisioned a love scene in Paris with an ocean background, Thalberg refused to make changes, saying &quot;We can&#x27;t cater to a handful of people who know Paris.&quot; A more serious distraction to Thalberg&#x27;s efforts was his obsession with making his wife Norma Shearer a prominent star, efforts which sometimes led to &quot;overblown and overglamorous&quot; productions. Thalberg himself admitted to his obsession years later when he told a fellow producer: &quot;You&#x27;re behaving like I did with Norma. I knew positively that she could play anything. It&#x27;s a kind of romantic astigmatism that attacks producers when they fall for an actress.&quot;

==== Important films at MGM ====
===== &quot;Ben Hur&quot; (1925) =====

One of the first pictures he took charge of, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, was inherited and already in production by another studio when MGM was formed. The film was turning into a disastrous expense with cost overruns already in the millions due to its lavish sets and location shooting in Rome. Most studio executives chose to terminate the film to cut their losses. Thalberg, however, felt differently, and thought the film would affect movie audiences, due to its classic literary source, and would highlight MGM as a major new studio.

He therefore discarded much of the original footage shot in Italy and recreated the set on MGM&#x27;s back lots in Culver City, which added more millions to the production, yet gave him more control over production. The new set also included a replica of Circus Maximus for the dramatic chariot race scenes. Flamini notes that Thalberg&#x27;s &quot;gamble paid off,&quot; drawing international attention to MGM, and to Thalberg within the movie industry for his bold action.

===== &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935) =====
&quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; was the studio&#x27;s next most expensive film after &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, with some now calling it &quot;Thalberg&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot; He initially had difficulty convincing Mayer that he could make the film without making heroes of the mutineers. He achieved that by instead making a hero of the British Royal Navy, whereby the officers and shipmates would from then on display their mutual respect. Thalberg also had to convince Clark Gable to accept the role against his will. He pleaded with Gable, eventually promising him that &quot;If it isn&#x27;t one of your greatest successes, I&#x27;ll never ask you again to play a part you don&#x27;t want.&quot; The film&#x27;s other main stars were Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor, and winning it for Best Picture. Thalberg accepted the award as producer from Frank Capra.

==== Thalberg and Mayer partnership ====
At first, Thalberg and studio chief Louis B. Mayer got along splendidly; however, they had different production philosophies. Thalberg preferred literary works, while Mayer preferred glitzy crowd-pleasing films. A clash was inevitable, and their relationship grew decidedly frosty. When Thalberg fell ill in the final weeks of 1932, Mayer took advantage of the situation and replaced him with David O. Selznick and Walter Wanger. Thalberg&#x27;s reputation by that time for working long hours was widely known, and rumors about the related strain on his fragile health had become front-page news in entertainment trade publications. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in January 1933 updated its readership about his condition and addressed growing concerns that he might be forced, despite his young age, to quit the business:
Once Thalberg recovered sufficiently from his bout with the &quot;flu&quot; and was able to return to work later in 1933, it was as one of MGM&#x27;s unit producers, albeit one who had first choice on projects as well as preferential access to all the studio&#x27;s resources, including over casting its stars. Thalberg&#x27;s good relationship with Nicholas Schenck, then president of Loew&#x27;s Incorporated, proved to be an ongoing advantage for him. Loew&#x27;s was the corporate parent of MGM, so Schenck was the true power and ultimate arbiter at the studio; and he usually supported Thalberg&#x27;s decisions and continued to do so whenever disagreements about projects or production needs arose. As a result, Thalberg also continued to produce or coproduce some of MGM&#x27;s most prestigious and critically acclaimed ventures in this period, such as &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; (1934) starring his wife Norma Shearer, &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935), &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935), &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936), and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936).

== Personal life ==
During his few years with Universal while living in New York, Thalberg had become romantically involved with Carl Laemmle&#x27;s daughter, Rosabelle. Still in his early twenties and later spending most of his time in Los Angeles, his feelings toward her were no longer as strong. Flamini suspects that this may have affected his position at Universal and partly caused his decision to leave the company. &quot;The Laemmles prayed that Irving would marry Rosabelle&quot;, notes Flamini. &quot;They wanted their sons to be educated and their daughters to marry nice Jewish boys.&quot;
Less than a year after he and Mayer took charge of the newly created MGM studios, and still only twenty-five years old, Thalberg suffered a serious heart attack due to overwork. Mayer also became aware of Thalberg&#x27;s congenital heart problems and now worried about the prospect of running MGM without him. Mayer also became concerned that one of his daughters might become romantically involved, and told them so:

Thalberg, aware of Mayer&#x27;s feelings, made it a point of never giving too much attention to his daughters at social events.

One of Thalberg&#x27;s traits was his ability to work long hours into the night with little sign of fatigue. According to Vieira, Thalberg believed that as long as his mind was active in his work and he was not bored, he would not feel tired. Thalberg, who often got by with only five hours of sleep, felt that most people could get by with less than they realized. To keep his mental faculties at peak, he would read philosophical books by Bacon, Epictetus, or Kant. &quot;They stimulate me. I&#x27;d drop out of sight in no time if I didn&#x27;t read and keep up with current thought—and the philosophers are brain sharpeners.&quot;

During the early 1930s, Thalberg was ambivalent about political events in Europe. While he feared Nazism and the rise of Hitler, he also feared Communism. At the time, notes Vieira, &quot;given a choice between communism and fascism, many Americans—including Thalberg—would prefer the latter.&quot; Thalberg stated his opinion:

When others suggested that many Jews could die in Germany as a result of Nazi anti-Semitism, he replied that in his opinion &quot;Hitler and Hitlerism will pass.&quot; On one occasion, Catholic Prince Löwenstein of Germany, who himself had almost been captured before fleeing Germany, told him: &quot;Mr. Thalberg, your own people are being systematically hunted down and rooted out of Germany.&quot; Thalberg suggested that world Jewry should nevertheless not interfere, that the Jewish race would survive Hitler. Within a few years, American film distribution was &quot;choked off&quot; in Germany. Led by Warner Brothers, all American studios eventually closed their German offices.
Thalberg began dating actress Norma Shearer a few years after he joined MGM. Following her conversion to Judaism, they married on Thursday, September 29, 1927, in a private ceremony in the garden of his rented house in Beverly Hills. Rabbi Edgar F. Magnin officiated at the event, with Shearer&#x27;s brother Douglas Shearer giving the bride away, and Louis B. Mayer serving as best man. The couple drove to Monterey for their honeymoon and then moved into their newly constructed home in Beverly Hills.

After their second child was born, Shearer considered retiring from films, but Thalberg convinced her to continue acting, saying he could find her good roles. She went on to be one of MGM&#x27;s biggest stars of the 1930s. Their two children were Irving Jr. (1930–1987) and Katharine (1935–2006).

== Death ==
Thalberg and Shearer took a much-needed Labor Day weekend vacation in Monterey, California, in 1936 (Labor Day fell on September 7 that year), staying at the same beachfront hotel where they spent their honeymoon. A few weeks earlier, Thalberg&#x27;s leading screenwriter, Albert Lewin, had proposed doing a film based on a soon-to-be published book, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Although Thalberg said it would be a &quot;sensational&quot; role for Gable, and a &quot;terrific picture,&quot; he decided not to do it:

Besides, Thalberg told Mayer, &quot;[n]o Civil War picture ever made a nickel&quot;. Shortly after returning from Monterey, Thalberg was diagnosed with pneumonia while on the set of &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. His condition worsened steadily, and he eventually required an oxygen tent at home. He died on September 14, at the age of 37.

Sam Wood, while directing &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, was given the news by phone. He returned to the set with tears in his eyes and told the others. As the news spread, &quot;the studio was paralyzed with shock&quot;, notes Thomas. &quot;Work stopped and hundreds of people wept&quot;, with stars, writers, directors, and studio employees &quot;all sharing a sense of loss at the death of a man who had been a part of their working lives&quot;, states Flamini.

His funeral took place two days later, and when the services began the other studios throughout Hollywood observed five minutes of silence. Producer Sam Goldwyn &quot;wept uncontrollably for two days&quot; and was unable to regain his composure enough to attend. The MGM studio closed for that day.

Services were held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple that Thalberg had occasionally attended. The funeral attracted thousands of spectators who came to view the arrival of countless stars from MGM and other studios, including Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, the Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, Al Jolson, Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, among the screen luminaries. The ushers who led them to their seats included Clark Gable, Fredric March, and playwright Moss Hart. Erich von Stroheim, who had been fired by Thalberg, came to pay his respects. Producers Louis B. Mayer, the Warner brothers, Adolph Zukor, and Nicholas Schenck sat together solemnly as Rabbi Magnin gave the eulogy.

Thalberg is buried in a private marble tomb in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, lying at rest beside his wife, Norma Shearer Thalberg Arrouge (Thalberg&#x27;s crypt was engraved &quot;My Sweetheart Forever&quot; by Shearer).

Over the following days, tributes were published by the national press. Louis B. Mayer, his co-founding partner at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said he had lost &quot;the finest friend a man could ever have&quot;, while MGM president Nicholas Schenck stated that &quot;Thalberg was the most important man in the production end of the motion-picture industry.&quot; Leading producers from the other studios also expressed their feelings in published tributes to Thalberg:

David O. Selznick described him as &quot;beyond any question the greatest individual force for fine pictures.&quot; Samuel Goldwyn called him &quot;the foremost figure in the motion-picture industry ... and an inspiration.&quot; M. H. Aylesworth, Chairman of RKO, wrote that &quot;his integrity, vision and ability made him the spearhead of all motion-picture production throughout the world.&quot; Harry Warner, president of Warner Bros., described him as &quot;gifted with one of the finest minds ever placed at the service of motion-picture production.&quot; Sidney R. Kent, president of Twentieth Century Fox, said that &quot;he made the whole world richer by giving it the highest type of entertainment. He was a true genius.&quot; Columbia president Harry Cohn said the &quot;motion picture industry has suffered a loss from which it will not soon recover...&quot;. Darryl F. Zanuck noted, &quot;More than any other man he raised the industry to its present world prestige.&quot; Adolph Zukor, chairman of Paramount, stated, &quot;Irving Thalberg was the most brilliant young man in the motion picture business.&quot; Jesse Lasky said, &quot;It will be utterly impossible to replace him.&quot;

Among the condolences that came from world political leaders, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote, &quot;The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces.&quot;

Among the pictures that were unfinished or not yet released at the time of his death were &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, &quot;Camille&quot;, &quot;Maytime&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Groucho Marx, star of &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, wrote, &quot;After Thalberg&#x27;s death, my interest in the movies waned. I continued to appear in them, but ... The fun had gone out of picture making.&quot; Thalberg&#x27;s widow, Norma Shearer, recalled, &quot;Grief does very strange things to you. I didn&#x27;t seem to feel the shock for two weeks afterwards. ... then, at the end of those two weeks, I collapsed.&quot;

== Legacy in the movie industry ==
Thalberg&#x27;s legacy to the movie industry is &quot;incalculable&quot;, states biographer Bob Thomas. He notes that with his numerous production innovations and grand stories, often turning classic literature and Broadway stage productions into big-screen pictures, he managed to keep &quot;American movies supreme throughout the world for a generation&quot;. Darryl F. Zanuck, founder of 20th Century-Fox said that during Thalberg&#x27;s brief career, he had become the &quot;most creative producer in the history of films&quot;. Thomas describes some of his contributions:

Most of MGM&#x27;s major films in the 1930s were, according to Flamini, &quot;in a very real sense&quot;, made by Thalberg. He closely supervised the making of &quot;more pictures than any other producer in Hollywood&#x27;s history&quot;, and was considered the &quot;archetype of the creative producer&quot;, adds Flamini. Upon his early death, aged 37, an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;the most important force&quot; in the motion picture industry. The paper added that for the film industry, he &quot;set the pace and others followed ... because his way combined style, glamour, and profit.&quot; He is described by Flamini as having been &quot;a revolutionary in a gray flannel suit&quot;.

Thalberg refused to take credit as producer, and as a result, his name never appeared on the screen while he was alive. Thalberg claimed that &quot;credit you give yourself is not worth having&quot;. He also said &quot;If a picture is good, they&#x27;ll know who produced it. If it&#x27;s bad, nobody cares.&quot; His final film, released after he died, was &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937), which won numerous Academy Awards. Its opening screen credit was dedicated to Thalberg:

In 1938, the new multimillion-dollar MGM administration building in Culver City was named for Thalberg. The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, also named for him, awards producers for consistently high production achievements.

== Cultural legacy ==
=== &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; ===
In October 1939, American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald began writing &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, a fictionalized biography of Thalberg, naming the protagonist Monroe Stahr to represent Thalberg. &quot;Thalberg has always fascinated me&quot;, he wrote to an editor. &quot;His peculiar charm, his extraordinary good looks, his bountiful success, the tragic end of his great adventure. The events I have built around him are fiction, but all of them are things which might very well have happened. ... I&#x27;ve long chosen him for a hero (this has been in my mind for three years) because he is one of the half-dozen men I have known who were built on a grand scale.&quot;

Thomas notes that among the reasons Fitzgerald chose to write a book about a Thalberg-like character, was that &quot;throughout his literary career, Fitzgerald borrowed his heroes from friends he admired, and inevitably a bit of Fitzgerald entered the characterizations.&quot; Fitzgerald himself writes that &quot;When I like men, I want to be like them ...&quot; Fitzgerald and Thalberg had real-life similarities: both were prodigies, both had heart ailments, and they both died at early ages.

According to biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, Fitzgerald believed that Thalberg, with his &quot;taste and courage, represented the best of Hollywood. ... [and] saw Thalberg as a model for what could be done in the movies.&quot; Fitzgerald died before the novel was completed, however. Bruccoli writes of Fitzgerald&#x27;s book:

Although parallels between Monroe Stahr in the novel and Thalberg were evident, many who knew Thalberg intimately stated that they did not see similarities in their personalities. Norma Shearer said that the Stahr character was not at all like her late husband.

In the 1976 film version, directed by Elia Kazan, Monroe Stahr was played by Robert De Niro. Kazan, in his pre-production notes, described the Stahr character as he saw him:

In the 2016 television series based on the novel, Monroe Stahr is played by Matt Bomer.

=== Others ===
Fitzgerald also based his short story &quot;Crazy Sunday&quot;, originally published in the October 1932 issue of &quot;American Mercury&quot;, on an incident at a party thrown by Thalberg and Shearer. The story is included in Fitzgerald&#x27;s collection &quot;Taps at Reveille&quot; (1935).

Thalberg was portrayed in the movie &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; (1957) by Robert Evans, who went on to become a studio head himself.

Thalberg is parodied as &quot;Irving C. Saltzberg Jnr.&quot; in the sketch &quot;20th Century Vole&quot; in episode 6 of Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus. Unlike the real-life publicity-shy Thalberg, Saltzberg is obsessed with controlling (and being credited for) every single bit of a production, including writing, directing and producing, and this is likewise reflected in the closing credits (which immediately follow the sketch) for the episode. The episode is also announced as &quot;An Irving C. Saltzberg Productions Ltd. and Saltzberg Art Films, Oil, Real Estate, Banking and Prostitution Inc. Co-Production.&quot;

Thalberg was portrayed by Bill Cusack in &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies&quot; (1994), a TV film based on &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, in which Indiana Jones is depicted as taking part in Thalberg&#x27;s conflict with Erich von Stroheim over &quot;Foolish Wives&quot;.

In 2020, Thalberg is played by Ferdinand Kingsley in the David Fincher film &quot;Mank&quot;. Max Minghella portrays him in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;.

<text>Glen Travis Campbell (April 22, 1936 – August 8, 2017) was an American country singer, guitarist, songwriter, and actor. He was best known for a series of hit songs in the 1960s and 1970s, and for hosting &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; on CBS television from 1969 until 1972. He released 64 albums in a career that spanned five decades, selling over 45 million records worldwide, including twelve gold albums, four platinum albums, and one double-platinum album.

Born in Billstown, Arkansas, Campbell began his professional career as a studio musician in Los Angeles, spending several years playing with the group of instrumentalists later known as &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;. After becoming a solo artist, he placed a total of 80 different songs on either the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Chart, &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, or Adult Contemporary Chart, of which 29 made the top 10 and of which nine reached number one on at least one of those charts. Among Campbell&#x27;s hits are &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, his first hit from 1965, along with &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; (1967), &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; (1967), &quot;Dreams of the Everyday Housewife&quot; (1968), &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; (1968), &quot;Galveston&quot; (1969), &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; (1975), and &quot;Southern Nights&quot; (1977).

In 1967, Campbell won four Grammys in the country and pop categories. For &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, he received two awards in country and western; &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; did the same in pop. Three of his early hits later won Grammy Hall of Fame Awards (2000, 2004, 2008), while Campbell himself won the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He owned trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM), and took the CMA&#x27;s top award as 1968 Entertainer of the Year. Campbell played a supporting role in the film &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. He also sang the title song, which was nominated for an Academy Award.

==Early life==
Glen Travis Campbell was born on April 22, 1936, in Billstown, a tiny community near Delight in Pike County, Arkansas, to John Wesley Campbell (a sharecropper) and Carrie Dell (née Stone) Campbell. Campbell was of Scottish descent and was the seventh son of 12 children. As a child he almost died from drowning. His family went to the Church of Christ, and Campbell&#x27;s brother Lindell became a Church of Christ minister. In 2011, Campbell said his mother was Irish; although his mother was born in the United States, her family had emigrated from County Tipperary. The family lived on a farm, where they barely managed, by growing cotton, corn, watermelons and potatoes. &quot;We had no electricity,&quot; he said, and money was scarce. &quot;A dollar in those days looked as big as a saddle blanket.&quot; To supplement income the family picked cotton for other farmers. &quot;I picked cotton for $1.25 a hundred pounds,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;If you worked your tail off, you could pick 80 or 90 pounds a day.&quot;

Campbell started playing guitar at age 4 after his father gave him a Sears-bought five-dollar guitar as a gift, with his uncle Boo teaching him the basics of how to play. Most of his family was musical, he said. &quot;Back home, everybody plays and sings.&quot; By the time he was 6 he was performing on local radio stations.

Campbell continued playing guitar in his youth, with no formal training, and practiced when he was not working in the cotton fields. He developed his talent by listening to radio and records and considered Django Reinhardt among his most admired guitarists, later calling him &quot;the most awesome player I ever heard.&quot; He dropped out of school in the 10th grade at 14 to work in Houston alongside his brothers, installing insulation and later working at a gas station.

Not satisfied with that kind of work, Campbell started playing music at fairs and church picnics and singing gospel hymns in the church choir. He was able to find spots performing on local radio stations, and after his parents moved to Houston, he made some appearances at a local nightclub.

In 1954, at age 17, Campbell moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to join his uncle&#x27;s band, known as Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys. He also appeared there on his uncle&#x27;s radio show and on &quot;K Circle B Time&quot;, the local children&#x27;s program on KOB television. It was there that he met his first wife, whom he married when he was 18 and she was 16.

In 1958, Campbell formed his own band, the Western Wranglers. &quot;We worked hard,&quot; he said. &quot;Six, sometimes seven nights a week. I didn&#x27;t have my eye set on any specific goals or big dreams.&quot;

==Career==
===1960–1966: Early career===
In 1960, Campbell moved to Los Angeles to become a session musician. That October, he joined the Champs. By January 1961, Campbell had found a daytime job at publishing company American Music, writing songs and recording demos. Because of these demos Campbell soon was in demand as a session musician and became part of a group of studio musicians later known as the Wrecking Crew.

Campbell played on recordings by the Beach Boys, Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, the Monkees, Nancy Sinatra, Merle Haggard, Jan and Dean, Bing Crosby, Phil Spector, Sammy Davis Jr., Doris Day, Bobby Vee, The Everly Brothers, Shelley Fabares, The Cascades, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, Wayne Newton, The First Edition, The Kingston Trio, Roger Miller, Gene Clark, Lou Rawls, Claude King, Lorne Greene, Ronnie Dove, and Elvis Presley. He befriended Presley when he helped record the soundtrack for &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; in 1964. He later said, &quot;Elvis and I were brought up the same humble way – picking cotton and looking at the south end of a north-bound mule.&quot;

In May 1961, he left the Champs and was subsequently signed by Crest Records, a subsidiary of American Music. His first solo release, &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me&quot;, a moderate success, peaked at number 62 on the Hot 100 in 1961 but reached number 7 on the Hot 100 in a 1968 Vogues cover. Campbell also formed the Gee Cees with former bandmembers from the Champs, performing at the Crossbow Inn in Van Nuys. The Gee Cees, too, released a single on Crest, the instrumental &quot;Buzz Saw&quot;, which did not chart.

In 1962, Campbell signed with Capitol Records. After minor initial success with &quot;Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry&quot;, his first single for the label, and &quot;Kentucky Means Paradise&quot;, released by the Green River Boys featuring Glen Campbell, a string of unsuccessful singles and albums followed. By 1963 his playing and singing were heard on 586 recorded songs. He never learned to read music, but besides guitar, he could play the banjo, mandolin and bass. Fellow Wrecking Crew member Leon Russell said Campbell &quot;was the best guitar player I&#x27;d heard before or since. Occasionally we&#x27;d play with 50- or 60-piece orchestras. His deal was he didn&#x27;t read [music], so they would play it one time for him, and he had it&quot;.

From 1964 on, Campbell began to appear on television as a regular on &quot;Star Route&quot;, a syndicated series hosted by Rod Cameron, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Jamboree&quot;.

From December 1964 to early March 1965, Campbell was a touring member of the Beach Boys, filling in for Brian Wilson, playing bass guitar and singing falsetto harmonies. He was then replaced on the Beach Boys&#x27; tours by new member Bruce Johnston. Brian Wilson produced and co-wrote a single for Campbell, &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Dumb&quot;, which failed to chart despite what writer David Howard called &quot;a surging, elegant Burt Bacharach-inspired string and horn arrangement and Campbell&#x27;s forlorn Roy Orbison-like vocal.&quot;.

In 1965, he had his biggest solo hit yet, reaching number 45 on the Hot 100 with a version of Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;. Asked about the pacifist message of the song, he said that &quot;people who are advocating burning draft cards should be hung&quot;.

Campbell continued as a session musician, playing guitar on the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, among other recordings. In April of that year, he joined Rick Nelson on a tour through the Far East, again playing bass.

===1967–1972: &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; to &quot;The Goodtime Hour&quot;===

When follow-up singles did not do well, and Capitol was considering dropping Campbell from the label in 1966, he was teamed with producer Al De Lory. Together, they first collaborated on &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; which became a top 20 country hit in early 1967, and the album of the same name.

Campbell and De Lory collaborated again on 1967&#x27;s &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, written by John Hartford, which was an overnight success. The song was followed by the bigger hit &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; later in 1967, and &quot;I Wanna Live&quot; and &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; in 1968, remaining on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 charts for 15 weeks. He won four Grammy Awards for &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; and &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;.

In 1967, Campbell was also the uncredited lead vocalist on &quot;My World Fell Down&quot; by Sagittarius, a studio group. The song reached number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1968, Campbell released &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;, a song written by Jimmy Webb. It was recorded with backing from members of the Wrecking Crew and appeared on his 1968 album of the same name. It reached number 3 on the US pop chart, remaining in the Top 100 for 15 weeks. In addition, the song also topped the American country music chart for two weeks, and the adult contemporary chart for six weeks.

The 1969 song &quot;True Grit&quot; by composer Elmer Bernstein and lyricist Don Black, and sung by Campbell, who co-starred in the movie, received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song and the Golden Globe for Best Original Song.

After he hosted a 1968 summer replacement for television&#x27;s &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; variety show, Campbell was given his own weekly variety show, &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, which ran from January 1969 through June 1972. The show&#x27;s comedy writers included Steve Martin and Rob Reiner. At the height of his popularity, a 1970 biography by Freda Kramer, &quot;The Glen Campbell Story&quot;, was published.

With Campbell&#x27;s session-work connections, he hosted major names in music on his show, including the Beatles (on film), David Gates, Bread, the Monkees, Neil Diamond, Linda Ronstadt, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Roger Miller, and Mel Tillis. Campbell helped launch the careers of Anne Murray and Jerry Reed, who were regulars on his &quot;Goodtime Hour&quot; program.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Campbell released a long series of singles and appeared in the movies &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969) with John Wayne and Kim Darby and had the lead role in &quot;Norwood&quot; (1970) with Kim Darby and Joe Namath.

===1973–1979: &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Southern Nights&quot;===
After the cancellation of his CBS series in 1972, Campbell remained a regular on network television. He co-starred in a made-for-television movie, &quot;Strange Homecoming&quot; (1974), with Robert Culp and up-and-coming teen idol Leif Garrett. He hosted a number of television specials, including 1976&#x27;s &quot;Down Home, Down Under&quot; with Olivia Newton-John. He co-hosted the American Music Awards from 1976 to 1978 and headlined the 1979 NBC special &quot;Glen Campbell: Back to Basics&quot; with guest-stars Seals and Crofts and Brenda Lee. He was a guest on many network talk and variety shows, including &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, where he performed &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Cher&quot;, &quot;the Redd Foxx Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;DINAH!&quot;, &quot;Evening at Pops with Arthur Fiedler&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, he had more hits with &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Southern Nights&quot; (both U.S. number one hits), &quot;Sunflower&quot; (U.S. number 39) (written by Neil Diamond), and &quot;Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.)&quot; (U.S. number 11).

&quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; was Campbell&#x27;s largest-selling single and one of his best-known recordings, initially with over 2 million copies sold. Campbell had heard songwriter Larry Weiss&#x27; version while on tour of Australia in 1974. Both songs were in the October 4, 1975, Hot 100 top 10. &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; continues to be used in TV shows and films, including &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, and &quot;High School High&quot;. It was the inspiration for the 1984 Dolly Parton/Sylvester Stallone movie &quot;Rhinestone&quot;. The main phrase of Campbell&#x27;s recording was included in Dickie Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; movie parody song &quot;Mr. Jaws&quot;. Campbell also made a techno/pop version of the song in 2002 with UK artists Rikki &amp; Daz and went to the top 10 in the UK with the dance version and related music video.

In January 1975, Campbell was awarded 4 gold records along with a platinum award for wholesale sales in excess of $1,000,000 in Australia.

&quot;Southern Nights&quot;, by Allen Toussaint, his other number one pop-rock-country crossover hit, was generated with the help of Jimmy Webb and Jerry Reed, who inspired the famous guitar lick introduction to the song, which was the most-played jukebox number of 1977.

From 1971 to 1983, Campbell was the celebrity host of the Los Angeles Open, an annual professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour.

===1980–2011: Later career===

Campbell made a cameo appearance in the 1980 Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, for which he recorded the title song.

From 1982 to 1983, he hosted a 30-minute syndicated music show, &quot;The Glen Campbell Music Show&quot;.

Campbell gave up smoking in March 1992 and believed it improved his singing voice. In 1991, Campbell voiced Chanticleer the rooster in Don Bluth&#x27;s live action/animated film &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot;.

In 1999 he was featured on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; and on A&amp;E Network&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; and a PBS &quot;in concert&quot; special in 2001. He also appeared on a number of CMT programs, where he ranked among their Greatest Men of Country Music.

He is credited with giving Alan Jackson his first big break after Jackson recorded with Campbell&#x27;s music publishing business in the early 1990s. Campbell also served as an inspiration to Keith Urban, who cites Campbell as a strong influence on his performing career.

In 2005, Campbell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Glen was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in the first group of inductees alongside other members of the Wrecking Crew in 2007. It was announced in April 2008 that Campbell was returning to his signature label, Capitol, to release his new album, &quot;Meet Glen Campbell&quot;. The album was released on August 19. With this album, he branched off in a different musical direction, covering tracks from artists such as Travis, U2, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Jackson Browne, and Foo Fighters. It was Campbell&#x27;s first release on Capitol in over 15 years. Musicians from Cheap Trick and Jellyfish contributed to the album as well. The first single, a cover of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;, was released to radio in July 2008.

===2011–2013: Illness and retirement===
In March 2010, Campbell announced his farewell album titled &quot;Ghost on the Canvas&quot;, which served as a companion to &quot;Meet Glen Campbell&quot; (2008).

Following his late-2010 Alzheimer&#x27;s diagnosis, Campbell embarked on a final &quot;Goodbye Tour&quot;, with three of his children joining him in his backup band. He was too ill to travel to Australia and New Zealand in the summer of 2012. His final show was on November 30, 2012, in Napa, California. After the end of the tour, Campbell entered the studio in Nashville to record what would be his final album, &quot;Adiós&quot;, which would not be revealed until five years later. According to his wife Kim, he wanted to preserve &quot;what magic was left&quot; in what would be his final recordings. In January 2013, Campbell recorded his final song, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Gonna Miss You&quot;, during what would be his last recording sessions. The song, which is featured in the 2014 documentary &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;, was released on September 30, 2014, with the documentary following on October 24. On January 15, 2015, Campbell and fellow songwriter Julian Raymond were nominated for Best Original Song at the 87th Academy Awards.

In March 2016, it was confirmed that Campbell was in the final stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

On August 30, 2016, during the 10th Annual ACM Honors, Keith Urban, Blake Shelton and others performed a medley of Glen Campbell&#x27;s songs in tribute to him. His wife Kim accepted the Career Achievement Award on his behalf. Alice Cooper described him as being one of the five best guitar players in the music industry.

Campbell&#x27;s final album, &quot;Adiós&quot;, featuring twelve songs from his final 2012–13 sessions, was announced in April 2017. It was released on June 9, 2017. &quot;Adiós&quot; was named by the UK&#x27;s Official Charts Company as the best-selling country/Americana album of 2017 in Britain.

In 2024, &quot;Glen Campbell Duets: Ghost on the Canvas Sessions&quot; was released. It is a reworked version of Campbell&#x27;s farewell album, featuring newly recorded guest vocals performing posthumous duets with Campbell, from artists such as Carole King, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Hope Sandoval and Dolly Parton

==Personal life==

===Relationships and children===
Campbell was married four times and fathered six sons and three daughters: 
* In 1955, Campbell married Diane Marie Kirk (born January 3, 1939; died July 16, 2015) at the Bernalillo County, New Mexico courthouse. They had two children — Glen Travis Campbell Jr., who was born two months prematurely on July 25, 1955, and died a few days later; and Deborah Kay &quot;Debby&quot; (born September 21, 1956). After a mandatory 12-month separation, they divorced in 1959.
* On September 20, 1959, Campbell married Billie Jean Nunley (1939–1993), an Albuquerque beautician, who gave birth to Kelli Glen, William Travis, and Wesley Kane. Billie Campbell filed for divorce in 1975, and their divorce was final in 1976. 
* On September 2, 1976, Campbell married singer Mac Davis&#x27;s second wife, Sarah Jan Davis (née Barg) in Carson City, Nevada. They had one child named Dillon and divorced in 1980.

After his divorce from Sarah Barg Davis, Campbell began a relationship with fellow country artist Tanya Tucker. The relationship was marked by frequent tabloid gossip and articles. The couple recorded a number of songs together, including the single &quot;Dream Lover&quot;, and they performed the national anthem together at the 1980 Republican National Convention.
* Campbell married Kimberly &quot;Kim&quot; Woollen (born June 18, 1958) in 1982. The couple met on a blind date in 1981 when Woollen was a Radio City Music Hall &quot;Rockette&quot;. Together they had three children: Cal, Shannon, and Ashley. All three joined Campbell onstage starting in 2010 as part of his touring band.

===Religion===
Campbell was raised in the Church of Christ. In the 1980s, he joined a Baptist church in Phoenix along with his wife Kim. In a 2008 interview, Campbell said that they had been adherents of Messianic Judaism for two decades.

===Alcoholism and drug addiction===
Campbell began having problems with alcoholism and cocaine addiction in the 1970s. He credited his fourth wife Kim with helping him turn his life around. Campbell eventually stopped drinking alcohol and taking drugs in 1987. However, it was evident that he had relapsed in 2003 when he pleaded guilty in Arizona to aggravated drunk driving and leaving the scene of an accident and spent 10 days in Maricopa County jail.

===Politics===
On &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; television show, Campbell avoided political topics. Around this time, in interviews he described himself as &quot;a registered Democrat&quot;, but also said he &quot;voted Republican a few times&quot;, and he performed in support of both Republican and Democratic politicians. Campbell performed the National Anthem at the 1980 Republican National Convention and continued to make a number of campaign appearances for Republican candidates during the 1980s and 1990s.

==Death, legacy and tributes==
In June 2011, Campbell announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease six months earlier. After his diagnosis was revealed, he withdrew from a scheduled Australian concert tour with Kenny Rogers. He became a patient at an Alzheimer&#x27;s long-term care and treatment facility in 2014. That same year, Campbell was the subject of the documentary &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;, directed by longtime friend James Keach, that examined Campbell&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s diagnosis and how it affected his musical performances during his final tour across the United States with his family. The documentary received critical acclaim, earning a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Campbell died in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 8, 2017, at the age of 81. He was buried in the Campbell family cemetery in Billstown, Arkansas.

In June 2020, Campbell&#x27;s wife of 34 years, Kim Campbell, published &quot;Gentle on My Mind: In Sickness and in Health with Glen Campbell&quot;, a memoir of their life together.

===Tributes and acclaim===
Following the announcement of Campbell&#x27;s death, fellow musicians, friends and fans expressed their condolences and noted his music legacy. Recording Academy president Neil Portnow praised him for having been &quot;an American treasure&quot; whose songs, guitar work, and &quot;dazzling showmanship shot him to superstardom in the 1960s&quot; to make him one of the most successful music artists in history.

Tributes poured in from countless others in the industry, including Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, comedy writer and actor Steve Martin, Sheryl Crow, Dolly Parton, Lenny Kravitz, and Anne Murray. Campbell&#x27;s former partner Tanya Tucker wrote and released a song in his honor, &quot;Forever Loving You&quot;.

Jimmy Webb, who wrote many of Campbell&#x27;s hits and worked with him throughout his life, said that Campbell could play with &quot;any guitar player in the world, from George Benson to Eric Clapton&quot;, adding that Paul McCartney considered him among the best guitar players. &quot;People will realize what an extraordinary genius Glen really was&quot;, Webb told ABC News.

The Country Music Television Channel (CMT) aired a special about his career a few days after his death. Other networks were also &quot;lining up to honor his life and brilliant legacy&quot;, including interviews with Keith Urban, Reba McEntire and Blake Shelton, among others.

Campbell&#x27;s daughter Ashley was invited to perform at The O2 Arena in London as part of the C2C: Country to Country festival. Her set was billed as a special tribute to her father and included a medley of his hits alongside &quot;Remembering&quot;, a song she wrote about Campbell&#x27;s battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

==Discography and videography==

Campbell recorded and released 60 studio albums and six live albums between 1962 and 2017. He also lent his vocals to four soundtracks for motion pictures: &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), &quot;Norwood&quot; (1970), &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; (1992), and the 2014 documentary film &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;. He placed a total of 82 singles (one of which was a re-release) on either the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Chart, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, or the Adult Contemporary Chart, nine of which peaked at number one on at least one of those charts. He released 15 video albums and featured in 21 music videos. His first two music videos, &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;, were directed by Gene Weed in 1967 and 1968, respectively. Campbell released his final music video, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Gonna Miss You&quot;, in 2014 to coincide with the release of the documentary &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;. His final studio album, &quot;Adiós&quot;, was released on June 9, 2017.

In May 2019, it was announced that Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Legacy&quot; box set was to be expanded and reissued.

<text>Stephen Edward Robinson (May 23, 1947 – June 17, 2018) was a religious scholar and apologist, who was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

== Biography ==

Stephen E. Robinson was born and raised in Southern California (La Crescenta/La Canada) and served a two-year mission for the LDS Church in the Northern States Mission (Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin). In 1972, he married Janet Bowen (B.A., B.S., CPA), and they have six children. He has been a member of the faculty at Brigham Young University (BYU) since 1986, and he was appointed chairman of the Department of Ancient Scripture there in 1990. Robinson received a B.A. in English and Philosophy from the BYU Honors Program in 1971, graduating with &quot;High Honors with Distinction.&quot; He received a Ph.D. in Biblical Studies and Classics from Duke University in 1978, and was tenured at Lycoming College in 1984, after teaching religion there, at Hampden–Sydney College, at UNC-Chapel Hill, and Duke. Robinson also served as chairman of the Scholars Program, of the Religion Department, and of the Faculty Senate at Lycoming. He has published in scholarly venues such as the Society of Biblical Literature, Revue de Qumran, the Coptic Encyclopedia, Journal for the Study of Judaism, and the Anchor Bible Dictionary. Robinson also has several popular books, &quot;Are Mormons Christians?,&quot; &quot;Believing Christ&quot; (the &quot;Best Book&quot; Award-winner at ILDS Booksellers for 1995), &quot;Following Christ&quot; (the &quot;Best Book&quot; at ILDSB for 1996), and &quot;How Wide the Divide?&quot; (a &quot;Best Book&quot; Award-winner at &quot;Christianity Today&quot; in 1997). He has received numerous awards for his research, teaching, and writing. Robinson retired in 2012 and received &quot;emeritus&quot; status at BYU.

Besides his professional work in Biblical Studies, Robinson is also widely known for his ecumenical dialogue with non-Mormon scholars. He was the first practicing Latter-day Saint to be tenured in Religion at a non-Mormon institution (Lycoming College). Robinson and Craig Blomberg, an Evangelical New Testament scholar at the Denver Seminary, co-authored an important book on LDS/Evangelical relations entitled &quot;How Wide the Divide?&quot; (1997), which in turn led to an ongoing series of friendly and objective exchanges between LDS and traditional Christian scholars.

Robinson died June 17, 2018.

== Controversy ==
In LDS circles, Robinson is generally considered to be orthodox and to have a reliable grasp of LDS doctrine. He came to the center of a conflict between the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) and Salt Lake City publisher Signature Books, through his critical review of the writing of Dan Vogel, by describing it as being patterned after the teachings of Korihor, an atheist orator in the Book of Mormon (). According to Daniel C. Peterson, then editor of the &quot;FARMS Review&quot;, FARMS tried to quiet down the counter-attack by Signature Books by emphasizing that Robinson&#x27;s review was directed at the methodology of the writings and not the beliefs or character of the authors reviewed.

<text>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. In 2008, Downey was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. From 2013 to 2015, he was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actor. His accolades include a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Academy Award, and nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards.

At the age of five, Downey made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Pound&quot;. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985) and &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1987). Downey&#x27;s portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic &quot;Chaplin&quot; garnered him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor and his first Academy Award nomination. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; in 2000 and won a Golden Globe Award for the role. Downey was fired from the show in 2001 in the wake of additional drug charges. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.

Downey made his acting comeback in the 2003 film &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, after Mel Gibson paid his insurance bond because completion bond companies would not insure him, and went on to star in the black comedy &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; (2005), the thriller &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007) and the action comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008). Downey gained global recognition for starring as Iron Man in ten Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, from &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) to &quot;&quot; (2019). He also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and in its 2011 sequel.

Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in &quot;The Judge&quot; (2014) and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), winning an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for playing multiple characters in the black comedy miniseries &quot;The Sympathizer&quot; (2024), and made his Broadway debut that year, playing the title role in Ayad Akhtar&#x27;s &quot;McNeal&quot;.

==Early life==
Robert John Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of the two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was a filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.&#x27;s films. Downey&#x27;s father was Jewish, while Downey&#x27;s mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss ancestry. His great-great-grandparents were Hungarian.

Downey moved often, mainly due to his father&#x27;s film projects, living in places such as Woodstock, New York, London, New Mexico, California, Connecticut, and Greenwich Village. The family experienced both periods of near-poverty and wealth, depending on the success of the films. As a child, Downey was &quot;surrounded by drugs.&quot; His father was a drug addict, and his mother was an alcoholic. His father allowed him to use drugs at a young age; he said that he gave Downey marijuana for the first time at age six and also gave Downey cocaine as a child. His father later said that he regretted it. Downey stated that he and his father did drugs together for the first time when he was eight, and that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: &quot;When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how.&quot;

During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father&#x27;s films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy film &quot;Pound&quot; (1970), and then, at seven, appeared in the surrealist Western film &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot; (1972). He went to Stagedoor Manor, a summer acting camp in upstate New York, when he was eleven and twelve. Downey&#x27;s parents divorced in 1977, when he was twelve. He went and lived with his mother in a fifth-floor apartment in New York, as she &quot;needed&quot; him after the divorce, while his sister went to live with their father in California. After a few years, Downey went to live with his father and began attending Santa Monica High School, but dropped out in 1982. At the age of 17, he moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time. Downey worked a number of different jobs to support himself while going to auditions, including clearing tables at Central Falls restaurant, working in a shoe store, and performing as &quot;living art&quot; at the nightclub Area. Meanwhile, Downey got a few parts in local theater and off-Broadway productions. He got his first credited film role in the 1983 film &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You;&quot; however, his scenes ended up being cut.

==Career==
===1983–1995: Early work and critical acclaim===
Downey began building upon his theater roles, making his debut on stage in 1983 at the Geva Theatre Center in &quot;Alms for the Middle Class&quot; for a three-week run. He also performed in the short-lived off-Broadway musical &quot;American Passion&quot; at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1984, Downey got a part in the film &quot;Firstborn&quot;, where he met Sarah Jessica Parker, and the pair started dating. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Downey has said that Anthony Michael Hall, whom he had met and become friends with on the set of his &quot;Weird Science&quot;, helped him get the audition. However, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast&#x27;s comedic talents. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Downey the worst &quot;SNL&quot; cast member in its entire run, stating that the &quot;Downey Fail sums up everything that makes &quot;SNL&quot; great.&quot;

That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;Tuff Turf&quot; and then a bully in John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Weird Science&quot;. Molly Ringwald wanted him for the role of Duckie in John Hughes&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, but the part went to Jon Cryer. He went on to star with Ringwald in his first lead role in &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack. Downey moved to Hollywood and lived with fellow actors Billy Zane, who later appeared with Downey in &quot;Only You&quot; (1994), Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kiefer Sutherland, who starred with Downey in &quot;1969&quot; (1988).

In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. His performance, described by Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;desperately moving,&quot; was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him &quot;the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future&quot; since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an &quot;exaggeration of the character&quot; in real life. Soon after completing the film, Downey went into rehab for the first time; the episode would be followed by a number of interventions and stints in rehab over the next decade prior to his 1996 arrest. &quot;Zero&quot; drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O&#x27;Neal, &quot;Air America&quot; (1990) with Mel Gibson, and &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Cathy Moriarty, and Whoopi Goldberg.

In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in &quot;Chaplin&quot;, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to help him imitate Chaplin&#x27;s posture and way of carrying himself. The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the 65th Academy Awards ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. In 1993, he appeared in the films &quot;Heart and Souls&quot; with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and &quot;Short Cuts&quot; with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled &quot;The Last Party&quot; (1993). He starred in the 1994 films &quot;Only You&quot; with Marisa Tomei, and &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; with Woody Harrelson. He then subsequently appeared in &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995), &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1995), &quot;Two Girls and a Guy&quot; (1997), as Special Agent John Royce in &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998), and in &quot;Black and White&quot; (1999).

===1996–2001: Addiction-related setbacks and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;===
From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested several times on charges related to drugs, including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. He went through drug treatment programs and spent time in county jail and prison. He explained in 1999 to a judge: &quot;It&#x27;s like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I&#x27;ve got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal.&quot; He said he had been addicted to drugs since the age of eight due to the fact that his father had been giving them to him.

In early 1996, after becoming increasingly concerned for Downey, Sean Penn and Dennis Quaid knocked on his door, took his keys, and took him to a rehab center in Tucson; however, Downey escaped and checked himself out a few days later. In June 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he wandered into a neighbor&#x27;s home through the unlocked front door while under the influence of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds. The family refused to press trespassing charges. The tape of the neighbor&#x27;s 911 call was made available online, and it became known as the &quot;Goldilocks incident&quot;. In November 1996, after spending time in court-ordered rehab, he received a further six months of live-in rehab, three years&#x27; probation, and was ordered to undergo compulsory drug testing. In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend six months in the Los Angeles County jail. After being released, he went into a court-ordered 120-day rehab program.

In 1999, after being clean during the shooting of &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, Downey relapsed. During this time, he was struggling with legal bills and had lost his house in Malibu. After Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested again. Despite Downey&#x27;s lawyer, Robert Shapiro, assembling the same team of lawyers that had successfully defended O. J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California. At the time of the arrest, all of Downey&#x27;s film projects had wrapped and were close to release. He had been hired to provide the voice of the devil on the NBC animated television series &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot;, but was fired when he failed to attend rehearsals.

After spending nearly a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Downey, on condition of posting a $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release. A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, playing a new love interest. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. He also appeared as a writer and singer on Vonda Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal: For Once in My Life&quot; album and sang with Sting a duet of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claimed that his performance on the series was overrated and said, &quot;It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn&#x27;t give a fuck whether I ever acted again.&quot; In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.

Before the end of his first season on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, Downey was arrested on Thanksgiving in 2000, when his room at Merv Griffin&#x27;s Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California, was searched by the police, who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and valium. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later ran a six-page investigation into the weekend&#x27;s events. Despite the fact that, if convicted, he would have faced a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; episodes.

In April 2001, while Downey was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefoot in Culver City. He was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and fired Downey, despite the fact that Downey&#x27;s character had resuscitated &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;″s ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot;, and the subsequent incarceration prompted Gibson to cancel his &quot;Hamlet&quot; production. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and received three years of probation, benefiting from California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail. Downey spent a year at the court-ordered drug-treatment facility. By this time, Downey was homeless, too much of an insurance liability to be employable, and on the verge of bankruptcy.

The book &quot;Conversations with Woody Allen&quot; reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his 2003 film &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; but was unable to do so because he could not get insurance on them. Allen stated, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on &quot;Celebrity&quot;] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent.&quot;

In a December 18, 2000, article for &quot;People&quot; magazine titled &quot;Bad to Worse&quot;, Downey&#x27;s stepmother, Rosemary, told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder &quot;a few years ago&quot; and added that this was &quot;the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn&#x27;t been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy.&quot; In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of &quot;Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth&quot;, claimed she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that &quot;no one had done a complete [psychiatric] evaluation [on him] ... I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, &#x27;Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I&#x27;m hyperactive, and there are other times I&#x27;m down.&#x27;&quot;

In an article for the March 2007 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Downey stated that he wanted to address &quot;this whole thing about the bipolar&quot; after receiving a phone call from &quot;the Bipolar Association&quot; asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the &quot;People&quot; article, to which Downey replied, &quot;&#x27;No! &quot;Dr. Malibusian&quot; said [I said I was bipolar] ... &#x27;, and they go, &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s been written, so we&#x27;re going to quote it.&#x27;&quot; Downey flatly denied being &quot;depressed or manic&quot; and said that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because &quot;the guy I was seeing didn&#x27;t know I was smokin&#x27; crack in his bathroom. You can&#x27;t make a diagnosis until somebody&#x27;s sober.&quot;

===2001–2008: Recovery and comeback===
After five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehabilitation, and relapse, Downey was ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that &quot;when someone says, &#x27;I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?&#x27; Well, uh, you&#x27;re a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot.&quot; He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, &quot;I said, &#x27;You know what? I don&#x27;t think I can continue doing this.&#x27; And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you&#x27;ll get it and you won&#x27;t take advantage of it. It&#x27;s not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what&#x27;s hard is to decide to do it.&quot;

Downey got his first post-rehabilitation acting job in August 2001, lip-syncing in the video for Elton John&#x27;s single &quot;I Want Love&quot;. Video director Sam Taylor-Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed and &quot;the way he underplays it is fantastic.&quot; Downey was able to return to the big screen after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in &quot;Air America&quot;, paid Downey&#x27;s insurance bond for the 2003 film &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (directed by his &quot;Back to School&quot; co-star Keith Gordon). Gibson&#x27;s gamble paved the way for Downey&#x27;s comeback, and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with &quot;Gothika&quot;, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40% of Downey&#x27;s salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses became standard in his contracts throughout the 2000s. Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin (later Susan Downey), also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.

After &quot;Gothika&quot;, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: &quot;A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&quot;, &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck;&quot; Richard Linklater&#x27;s dystopian, rotoscoped &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (in which Downey plays the role of a drug addict); and Steven Shainberg&#x27;s fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, &quot;Fur&quot;, in which Downey&#x27;s character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus&#x27;s professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel. Downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; and Disney&#x27;s poorly received &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;.

On November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, &quot;The Futurist&quot;, on Sony Classical, for which he designed the cover art and the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably would not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated. In 2006, Downey returned to television when he did voice acting on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in the episode &quot;The Fat Guy Strangler&quot;. Downey had previously telephoned the show&#x27;s production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in episode creation, as his son Indio is a fan of the show. The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt, Lois Griffin&#x27;s long-lost, mentally disturbed brother, for Downey.

Downey signed on with publisher HarperCollins to write a memoir, which in 2006 was already being billed as a &quot;candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career.&quot; In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers and canceled the book without further comment. In 2007, Downey appeared in David Fincher&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Zodiac&quot;, which was based on a true story. He played the role of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; journalist Paul Avery, who was reporting on the Zodiac Killer case.

===2008–2019: Stardom with Iron Man===
Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a &quot;blockbuster&quot; film. That changed in 2008, when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey&#x27;s entry in the 2008 edition of &quot;The Time 100&quot;, he offered an observation on Downey&#x27;s commercially successful summer at the box office:

In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film &quot;Iron Man&quot;, with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating, &quot;Downey wasn&#x27;t the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in &#x27;Tony Stark&#x27;.&quot; Favreau insisted on having Downey, as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to &quot;Iron Man&quot; what Johnny Depp is to the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public&#x27;s interest in it. For the role, Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he &quot;had the power to forge iron.&quot;

&quot;Iron Man&quot; was released worldwide between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide and receiving rave reviews that cited Downey&#x27;s performance as a highlight of the film. By October 2008, Downey had agreed to star in two &quot;Iron Man&quot; sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as &quot;The Avengers&quot;, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron Man&#x27;s alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, as a part of Marvel Studios&#x27; depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the movies.

After &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Downey appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the Stiller-directed &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. The three actors play a Hollywood archetype, with Downey playing self-absorbed multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarusas they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era film called &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. Lazarus undergoes a &quot;controversial skin pigmentation procedure&quot; in order to take on the role of African-American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which requires Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey&#x27;s portrayal of the character could become controversial:

When asked by Harry Smith on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot; who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, &quot;Sadly, my sorry-ass self.&quot;

Released in the United States on August 13, 2008, &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; received good reviews, with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively. It earned US$26 million in its North American opening weekend and retained the number one position for its first three weekends of release. The film grossed $180 million in theaters before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lazarus.

Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey finished in mid-2008, &quot;The Soloist&quot;. The film was delayed from a November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio&#x27;s tight end-of-year release schedule. Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate. Downey picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year for his role in &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;.

The first role Downey accepted after &quot;Iron Man&quot; was Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Warner Bros. released it on December 25, 2009. The film set several box office records in the United States for a Christmas Day release, beating the previous record-holder, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot;, by nearly $10 million, and finished second to &quot;Avatar&quot; in a record-setting Christmas weekend box office. &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; ended up being the 8th highest-grossing film of 2009. When Downey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for his role as Sherlock Holmes, he noted in his acceptance speech that he had prepared no remarks because &quot;Susan Downey told me that Matt Damon was going to win so don&#x27;t bother preparing a speech.&quot;

Downey returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, which was released in May 2010. &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; grossed over $623 million worldwide, becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of 2010. Downey&#x27;s other commercial film release of 2010 was the comedy road film, &quot;Due Date&quot;. The movie, co-starring Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010 and grossed over $211 million worldwide, making it the 36th highest-grossing movie of 2010. Downey&#x27;s sole 2011 film credit was &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, which opened worldwide on December 16, 2011.

In 2012, Downey reprised the role of Tony Stark in &quot;The Avengers&quot;. The film received positive reviews and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time both in the United States and worldwide. His film, the David Dobkin-directed dramedy &quot;The Judge&quot;, a project co-produced by his production company Team Downey, was the opening film at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Downey played Tony Stark again in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). Three of his scenes from &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; were used as archive footage in the first episode of the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot;. Downey hosted &quot;The Age of A.I.&quot;, a YouTube documentary series released in 2019.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and expansion ===
In 2020, Downey starred in &quot;Dolittle&quot;, playing the titular character, depicted in the film as a 19th-century Welsh veterinarian who can communicate with animals. This was the second film from Team Downey. It was a box office disappointment and received negative reviews from critics, who called it &quot;too long [and] lifeless.&quot;

In 2023, Downey portrayed antagonistic bureaucrat Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. He took a pay cut to work on the film, earning $4 million in lieu of his usual $10–20 million upfront salary. Downey would later describe &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; as &quot;the best film&quot; in which he has appeared to date. The biopic and Downey&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. For the role, he won the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2023, Downey hosted the television series &quot;Downey&#x27;s Dream Cars&quot;, where he and his team converted some of Downey&#x27;s cars from gas to electric.

Downey next starred in a 2024 television adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen&#x27;s historical satire novel &quot;The Sympathizer&quot; on HBO, portraying five supporting antagonistic roles representing the American establishment. His multi-role performance earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. Downey Jr. made his Broadway debut in &quot;McNeal&quot;, from playwright Ayad Akhtar, playing Jacob McNeal, a gifted novelist with a difficult family life and a potentially problematic interest in artificial intelligence. Previews began on September 5, 2024, and opened on September 30 at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theatre, playing a strictly limited engagement through November 24.

In July 2024 at San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Downey would return to the MCU in a new role as Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom in the upcoming films &quot;&quot; (2026) and &quot;&quot; (2027).

==Other ventures==
===Music===
Downey has sung on several soundtracks for his films, including &quot;Chaplin&quot;, &quot;Too Much Sun&quot;, &quot;Two Girls and a Guy&quot;, &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;. In 2001, he appeared in the music video for Elton John&#x27;s song &quot;I Want Love&quot;. He released a CD in 2004 called &quot;The Futurist&quot;, and while promoting his film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, he and his co-stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black were back-up singers for &quot;The Pips&quot; to Gladys Knight singing &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; for the season 7 finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

Downey&#x27;s most commercially successful recording venture to date (combining sales and radio airplay) has been his remake of the 1973 Joni Mitchell Christmas song &quot;River&quot;, which was included on the &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; tie-in album &quot;Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas&quot;, released in 2000; Downey&#x27;s character Larry Paul performs the song in the &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; episode &quot;Tis the Season&quot;.

===Business===
On June 14, 2010, Downey and his wife Susan opened their own production company called Team Downey. Their first project was &quot;The Judge&quot;. In 2024, Downey launched a coffee company named Happy with Craig Dubitsky.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and marriages===
Downey started dating actress Sarah Jessica Parker in 1984 after meeting her on the set of &quot;Firstborn&quot;. They were both 18 and moved in together after eight weeks of dating. The couple separated eight years later, in 1991, due to his drug addiction.

Downey married actress and singer Deborah Falconer on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship. They had only know each other for six weeks before marrying. Their son was born in September 1993. The strain on their marriage from Downey&#x27;s repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 1996, Falconer left Downey and filed for divorce in early 2001, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; as the reason. Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce in 2004, with Falconer gaining custody of their son.

In 2003, Downey met producer Susan Levin, an executive vice president of production at Joel Silver&#x27;s film company, Silver Pictures, on the set of &quot;Gothika&quot;. Though Susan twice turned down his romantic advances, she and Downey did quietly strike up a romance during production. Despite Susan&#x27;s worries that the romance would not last after the completion of shooting given that &quot;he&#x27;s an actor; I have a real job,&quot; the couple&#x27;s relationship continued after production wrapped on &quot;Gothika&quot;, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her thirty-first birthday. In August 2005, the couple were married in a Jewish ceremony at Amagansett, New York. A tattoo on one of his biceps reads &quot;Suzie Q&quot; in tribute to her. The Downeys&#x27; first child, a son, was born in February 2012, and their second, a daughter, was born in November 2014.

Downey has been a close friend of Mel Gibson since they starred in &quot;Air America&quot;. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and said &quot;nobody&#x27;s perfect&quot; in reference to Gibson&#x27;s 2006 DUI. Gibson said of Downey: &quot;He was one of the first people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, &#x27;Hey, welcome to the club. Let&#x27;s go see what we can do to work on ourselves.&#x27;&quot; In October 2011, Downey was honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards. Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life&#x27;s work and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.

===Sobriety===
Downey says he has been drug-free since July 2003 and credits his wife with helping him overcome his drug and alcohol habits, along with his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery programs, yoga, and the practice of Wing Chun kung fu, the martial art he learned from Eric Oram, who is also a fight consultant in several of Downey&#x27;s movies. Oram was Downey&#x27;s personal fight coordinator in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. In December 2015, Downey was chosen as one of 91 people to be pardoned by the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, for his prior drug offenses. The pardon does not erase Downey&#x27;s criminal record, but it does allow him to serve on a jury. Oram wrote a letter in support of Downey&#x27;s pardon to Governor Brown. When asked on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; how he was able to make his sobriety stick this time, Downey said, &quot;It&#x27;s really not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems. What&#x27;s hard is to decide to do it.&quot;
===Religious beliefs===
In 2014, Downey has described his religious beliefs as &quot;Jewish Buddhist&quot;. In the past, Downey has been interested in Christianity and the Hare Krishna movement.

===Political views===
In a 2008 interview, Downey stated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat, saying: &quot;I have a really interesting political point of view, and it&#x27;s not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can&#x27;t go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since.&quot;

However, when asked about the quote in a 2015 interview to promote &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot;, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part and stated, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat.&quot;

Downey has shown support for the Democratic Party. He donated to Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2012. In 2014, Downey attended a fundraiser for the Democratic Party and donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In 2016, Downey appeared in an Internet video urging the American public to vote against Donald Trump in the then-upcoming presidential election. In 2020, Downey took part in a virtual fundraiser for Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign, with fellow &quot;Avengers&quot; actors and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

Downey serves on the board of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit organization that advocates for criminal justice reform to reduce incarceration, improve the outcomes of formerly incarcerated individuals, and build healthier communities.

===Environmentalism===
In January 2020, during the promotion of his film &quot;Dolittle&quot;, Downey announced that he had made the decision to adopt a vegan diet in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m a one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus&quot; and believing he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously announced the opening of Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around the world using advanced technology. The Footprint Coalition promotes technologies that protect the environment, such as French insect-farming startup Ynsect, the bio-based alternative to plastic manufacturer RWDC, and bamboo toilet paper manufacturer Cloud Paper.

In January 2024, Downey stated that he was a pescetarian and had to give up his vegan diet due to low levels of vitamin B12, calcium, and iron. He co-authored &quot;Cool Food: Erasing Your Carbon Footprint One Bite at a Time,&quot; which advocates a low-carbon plant-based diet to reduce carbon footprints.

<text>Restoration is a 1995 historical drama film directed by Michael Hoffman from a screenplay by Rupert Walters, based on the 1989 novel of the same title by Rose Tremain. It stars Robert Downey Jr. as a 17th-century medical student exploited by King Charles II. The film was shot in Wales and won the Academy Awards for art direction and costume design.

==Plot==
Young doctor Robert Merivel enters into King Charles II of England&#x27;s service after saving the King&#x27;s favorite spaniel. Merivel revels in debauched pleasure and popularity at court until the King arranges for him to wed Celia, a royal mistress who has fallen out of favor. The arranged marriage is to fool the King&#x27;s favorite mistress, Barbara Castlemaine. Merivel is given an estate named Bidnold in Suffolk, and Celia is installed in a house in Kew where the king can secretly visit. Merivel lives a life of debauchery there, but also finds pleasure in restoring the house to its former beauty with assistance from Will Gates, the estate manager. Matters become complicated when Merivel breaks the King&#x27;s cardinal rule and falls in love with Celia. The King commissions artist Elias Finn to paint Celia&#x27;s portrait. Elias tricks Merivel into revealing his romantic feelings for Celia, who does not return Merivel&#x27;s affections. After discovering Merivel&#x27;s romantic feelings for Celia, the King banishes him from court and back to his life as a physician.

Merivel rejoins his old friend, John Pearce, who now runs a Quaker sanitarium. There, Merivel meets Katharine, a troubled young woman whose husband abandoned her after their daughter drowned. Merivel and Katharine become lovers. When Pearce contracts consumption, Merivel tends his dying friend. They discover that Katharine is pregnant with Merivel&#x27;s child. After Pearce&#x27;s death, Merivel and Katharine leave.

The pair returns to London just as the Great Plague has hit. Katharine gives birth to a daughter, Margaret, via Caesarean section, but dies from the procedure. Before her death, Merivel promises Katharine he will care for Margaret.

As the plague continues killing people, Merivel is compelled to help as a physician. He leaves Margaret with a wet nurse, and goes into the city. He separates the sick from the well, who have all been quarantined together, and eases the suffering of the dying. When asked his name, Merivel says he is John Pearce, as a tribute to his friend. Merivel realizes his life now is more rewarding and fulfilling than the one he left behind.

Under the alias &quot;Pearce&quot; and in disguise, Merivel is summoned to the palace, where the King fears that Celia has contracted the plague. Merivel examines Celia and reassures the King that she has a treatable fever, and also that she is pregnant. Before the King can express his thanks, the court is notified that a large part of London is on fire. Merivel races back to save his infant daughter but is unable to find her. He falls through the burning floor and lands in a small row boat below. Unconscious, he floats on the river current away from the city. He awakens back at Bidnold, being cared for by Will Gates. As Merivel recuperates, he grieves his lost daughter. 

Soon after, the King and his entourage arrive. Celia suspected the true identity of the &quot;John Pearce&quot; who examined her, and it was confirmed when a nurse came to the palace with Margaret, urgently seeking the whereabouts of Robert Merivel. With that, the King steps aside and reveals the nurse holding Margaret, alive and well. Impressed with the man that Merivel has become, and for his courage and good work in treating Celia and the plague victims, the King returns Bidnold to Merivel, promising it will never be taken away. The film ends with Merivel returning to London, with Margaret in his arms, to establish a new hospital with the King&#x27;s assistance.

==Reception==
&quot;Restoration&quot; won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration for Eugenio Zanetti and Best Costume Design for James Acheson. The film was also entered into the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics have given the film a positive review based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Restoration&quot; spins an engaging period yarn out of its bestselling source material, brought to life through the efforts of an eclectic ensemble cast led by Robert Downey Jr.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers, in a favorable review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, praised the film for its timely AIDS parable and described Ryan as miscast in the role of the troubled Katharine. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;&quot;Restoration&quot; crams in more research and period detail than it can comfortably digest, but its story is not overwhelmed by such overkill&quot;.

Rose Tremain, author of the novel on which the film was based, said of the film that it had a beautiful texture to it. She was however disappointed with the film&#x27;s storytelling, and said the story has no logic and so does not move the audience. The disappointment led her to take up scriptwriting herself.

==Soundtrack==

Composer James Newton Howard&#x27;s main theme is based on the music from &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; by Henry Purcell.

<text>Billy Joe Thomas (August 7, 1942 – May 29, 2021) was an American singer widely known for his country, contemporary Christian, and pop hits of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. 

Popular songs by Thomas include &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; (1968), &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; (1969), &quot;(Hey Won&#x27;t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song&quot; (1975), &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; (1977), and &quot;Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love&quot; (1983).

In 2014, &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Early life and education ==
Billy Joe Thomas was born in Hugo, Oklahoma, on August 7, 1942. He was the son of Geneva and Vernon Thomas. Thomas grew up both in and near Houston; he graduated from Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas.

He sang in a church choir in his teens and later joined the musical group The Triumphs with Tim Griffith (lead guitar), Tom Griffith (bass), Denver &quot;Zeke&quot; Zatyka (keyboards), Don Drachenberg (vocal and sax), and Ted Mensik (drums). During his senior year, Thomas made friends with Roy Head of Roy Head and The Traits. The Traits and the Triumphs held several Battle of the Bands events in the early 1960s.

== Music career ==
===1960s–1970s===
In 1966, Thomas and the Triumphs released the album &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (Pacemaker Records), featuring a hit cover version of the Hank Williams song &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. The follow-up single, &quot;Mama&quot;, peaked at No. 22. In the same year, Thomas released a solo album of the same title on the Scepter Records label. Thomas achieved mainstream success again in 1968, with the song &quot;The Eyes of a New York Woman&quot;. Five months later, the more successful single &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; featured the sound of Reggie Young&#x27;s electric sitar; it was first released on the album &quot;On My Way&quot; via Scepter Records. &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; became Thomas&#x27; second million-selling record. 

A year later, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; featured Thomas performing the Bacharach/David song &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;, which won the Academy Award for best original song that year. The song reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1970. Its sales exceeded one million copies, with Thomas being awarded his third gold record. The song was also released on an album of the same title. His other hits of the 1970s included: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Out of Town&quot;, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Help Believing&quot; (it reached No. 9 in 1970 and was covered by Elvis Presley), &quot;No Love at All&quot;, &quot;Mighty Clouds of Joy&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll Lullaby&quot;.

After experiencing hits with Scepter Records, his label for six years, Thomas left the label in 1972. He was with Paramount Records from 1973 to 1974; during that time he released &quot;Songs&quot; (1973) and &quot;Longhorns &amp; Londonbridges&quot; (1974). In 1975, Thomas released the album &quot;Reunion&quot; on ABC Records, which had absorbed the Paramount label. It contained &quot;(Hey Won&#x27;t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song&quot;, which was the longest-titled No. 1 hit ever on the Hot 100. It was his first big hit since 1972 and secured him his fourth gold record. According to the Arlington Historical Society, Thomas&#x27; music career from 1966 to 1977 was his heyday as a pop star. In 1976, Thomas released &quot;Home Where I Belong&quot;, produced by Chris Christian on Myrrh Records, the first of several gospel albums. It was the first Christian album to go platinum, and Thomas became one of the biggest contemporary Christian musical artists of the period. After his performance at Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1977 memorial service, Thomas would continue record and tour extensively, but primarily on the gospel circuit, with forays into the country music scene. Thomas embraced his newfound faith, but sometimes clashed with fundamentalist Christian fans because he still performed his previous popular hits.

On MCA Records, Thomas and Chris Christian recorded his last Top 40 hit single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;. It appeared on his last pop album, which also included the adult contemporary hit &quot;Still the Lovin&#x27; Is Fun&quot;.

===1980s–2010s===
During the 1980s, Thomas had little success on the pop charts, but some of his singles topped the country singles chart. Two of those songs included &quot;Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love&quot; and &quot;New Looks from an Old Lover&quot; in 1983. Additionally, &quot;Two Car Garage&quot; reached No. 3 on the country charts. In 1981, on his 39th birthday, Thomas became the 60th member of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. His Opry membership later lapsed, with the Opry classifying him as a non-regular &quot;guest artist&quot;. He scored another hit, recording &quot;As Long as We Got Each Other&quot;, the theme song for the television series &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. The first-season theme was a solo for Thomas; it was re-recorded as a duet with Jennifer Warnes for the second and third seasons. For the show&#x27;s fourth season, it was re-recorded with British singer Dusty Springfield, however the Thomas/Warnes version was used for season five and part of season seven. Thomas first released the track on his 1985 album &quot;Throwing Rocks at the Moon&quot; via Columbia Records.

Thomas also wrote two books, including the autobiography &quot;Home Where I Belong&quot; and starred in the movies &quot;Jory&quot; and &quot;Jake&#x27;s Corner&quot;. Several commercial jingles including ones for Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Bell Telephone, have featured him singing and his music. On December 31, 2011, Thomas was the featured halftime performer at the 2011 Hyundai Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. On April 2, 2013, he released &quot;The Living Room Sessions&quot;, an album with acoustic arrangements of well-known hits. It featured guest appearances with established and emerging vocalists, accompanying Thomas on seven of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks.

On December 3, 2013, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced that the 1969 single &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; by Thomas would be inducted into the 2014 Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Personal life and death ==
Thomas married singer-songwriter Gloria Richardson in December 1968. They had three daughters: Paige (born in 1970), Nora (adopted from North Korea in 1978), and Erin (born in 1979). 

Shortly after his career began, Thomas became dependent on drugs and alcohol, which led to his marriage nearly ending. On January 28, 1976, he became a Christian less than a month after Gloria did. Most press sources indicated that Thomas had been sober since he and Gloria reconciled in 1976.

On March 23, 2021, Thomas announced on his official Facebook page that he had stage IV lung cancer and was being treated in Texas. He died on May 29 at his home in Arlington, Texas, at the age of 78.

<text>Harry Forster Chapin (; December 7, 1942 – July 16, 1981) was an American singer-songwriter, philanthropist, and hunger activist best known for his folk rock and pop rock songs. He achieved worldwide success in the 1970s. Chapin, a Grammy Award-winning artist and Grammy Hall of Fame inductee, has sold over 16 million records worldwide.

Chapin recorded a total of 11 albums from 1972 until his death in 1981. All 14 singles that he released became hits on at least one national music chart. Chapin&#x27;s best-known songs include &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle.&quot;

As a dedicated humanitarian, Chapin fought to end world hunger. He was a key participant in the creation of the Presidential Commission on World Hunger in 1977. In 1987, Chapin was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his humanitarian work.

==Biography==
Harry Forster Chapin was born on December 7, 1942, in New York City, the second of four children of percussionist Jim Chapin and Jeanne Elspeth, daughter of the literary critic Kenneth Burke. His brothers, Tom and Steve, would also become musicians.

The earliest Chapin to come to America was Samuel Chapin, who was the first deacon of Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1636. His other great-grandparents on his mother&#x27;s side had immigrated in the late 19th century. Chapin&#x27;s parents divorced in 1950, with his mother retaining custody of their four sons, as Jim spent much of his time on the road as a drummer for Big Band-era acts such as Woody Herman. Chapin&#x27;s mother married &quot;Films in Review&quot; magazine editor Henry Hart a few years later.

Chapin&#x27;s first formal introduction to music was trumpet lessons at The Greenwich House Music School under Mr. Karesick. Harry&#x27;s younger brothers Tom and Steve were choirboys at Grace Episcopal Church in Brooklyn Heights, and through them Chapin met &quot;Big&quot; John Wallace, a baritone with a five-octave range, who later became his bassist, backing vocalist, and straight man onstage. Chapin began performing with his brothers while a teenager, with their father occasionally joining them on drums. Chapin graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1960 and was among the five inductees in the school&#x27;s Alumni Hall of Fame for the year 2000. He briefly attended the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and was then a student at Cornell University, but did not complete a degree.

Chapin originally intended to be a documentary film-maker and took a job with The Big Fights, a company run by Bill Cayton that owned a large library of classic boxing films. Chapin directed &quot;Legendary Champions&quot; in 1968, which was nominated for a documentary Academy Award. In 1971, he began focusing on music. With John Wallace, Tim Scott, and Ron Palmer, Chapin started playing in various nightclubs in New York City.

==Career==
===Early music career (1971–1972)===

In 1972, there was a bidding war over Chapin between music business heavyweights Clive Davis  at Columbia and Jac Holzman at Elektra. Chapin signed a multi-million dollar recording contract with Elektra Records. The contract was one of the biggest of its time. It granted him free recording time, along with many other perks.

The same year, Chapin released his debut album, &quot;Heads &amp; Tales.&quot; The album was an international success, selling over one million units. Its success was due to the top-25 Billboard Hot 100 hit single &quot;Taxi.&quot; The song also became a top-5 hit in Canada. The success of the song in America is credited to American radio personality Jim Connors, who helped promote the song on the radio despite its length, and helped it to stay on the charts for 16 weeks. It became the number-one requested song for 10 weeks in a row. The song was performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,&quot; which received so many calls that Chapin returned the next night. It was the first time in the show&#x27;s history that a performer had been called back the next night. It was also one of the first performances on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, with John Denver hosting.

When asked if the song was true, Chapin said &quot;It&#x27;s emotionally true, if not literally true. I&#x27;ve been in the film business on and off for a lot of years and wasn&#x27;t doing well at one point. So, I went out and got a hack license for bread, and during the month that I was waiting for it to come through, I heard an old girlfriend of mine had gotten married and instead of becoming an actress, she married a rich guy. I envisioned some night I&#x27;d be driving a cab in the big city streets and this lady would get in the back, and I&#x27;d turn and look at her and she&#x27;d look at me and know we both sold out our dreams.&quot; Billboard ranked &quot;Taxi&quot; as the 85th song of the year. &quot;Taxi&quot; also earned Chapin a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist of the Year.

The follow-up album, &quot;Sniper and Other Love Songs,&quot; was also released in 1972. The album&#x27;s title song, &quot;Sniper,&quot; is a semi-fictional account of the University of Texas tower shooting. The single release from the album, &quot;Sunday Morning Sunshine,&quot; charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a top-40 hit on Billboard Adult Contemporary. The album was less successful than the last, selling 350,000 units. The album also contained the Chapin anthem &quot;Circle.&quot; In 2004, the double album &quot;Sniper and Other Love Songs and Heads &amp; Tales&quot; was released. It contained previously unreleased tracks from both albums.

===Career peak (1973–1975)===

In 1973, Chapin released his third album, &quot;Short Stories.&quot; The album sold over 1 million units and produced another international hit, &quot;W.O.L.D.,&quot; a song about an aging disc jockey who has given up his entire life and family for his career. The song is sung from the point of view of the disc jockey, who is singing to his ex-wife. It was inspired by American radio personality Jim Connors. Chapin wrote the song when he listened to Connors calling his ex-wife in the WMEX studio in Boston. The song became a top-40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, a top-10 hit in Canada, and a top-10 and -20 hit in various other countries. Other notable songs from the album not released as singles are &quot;Mr. Tanner,&quot; &quot;Mail Order Annie,&quot; and &quot;They Call Her Easy.&quot; The song &quot;Mr. Tanner&quot; was loosely based on a pair of &quot;New York Times&quot; concert reviews of baritone Martin Tubridy – once in 1971 and once in 1972.

In 1974, Chapin released his most successful album, &quot;Verities and Balderdash&quot;, which sold 2.5 million units because of the number 1 hit &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle.&quot; The song is about a father who does not find time for his son during the boy&#x27;s childhood; ultimately the son grows up to be just like his father, not making any time for his dad. The song earned Chapin another Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, and Chapin was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Verities and Balderdash&quot; peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. The album&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;I Wanna Learn a Love Song,&quot; charted at number 7 on Billboard Adult Contemporary. The song is a true story of how Chapin met his wife, Sandra Chapin. &quot;30,000 Pounds of Bananas&quot; was included on the album and became the number-one requested song for a few weeks, despite not being released as a single. It is a semi-fictional account of a truck crash that occurred in Scranton, Pennsylvania, transporting bananas—based loosely on a March 18, 1965, accident involving truck driver Gene Sesky. Other notable songs from the album include &quot;Shooting Star,&quot; &quot;Halfway to Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Six String Orchestra.&quot;

In 1975, Chapin released his fifth album, &quot;Portrait Gallery&quot;, which produced a top-40 Billboard Adult Contemporary hit, &quot;Dreams Go By.&quot; However, it was less successful than the last, selling 350,000 units. Chapin also wrote and performed a Broadway play, &quot;The Night That Made America Famous&quot;, which earned two Tony Award nominations and two Drama Desk Award nominations.

===Later years (1976–1981)===
By 1976, Chapin was established as one of the most popular singers of the decade. He released his first live album, &quot;Greatest Stories Live.&quot; The album sold 2.1 million units. However, Elektra Records underwent a management change and gave almost no promotion for his later albums with Elektra, but they all sold at least 250,000 units each and charted successfully.

By the end of the decade, Chapin concentrated more on touring than producing hit singles, but still released one album a year. He earned an estimated $2,000,000 per year () until his death in 1981, making him one of the highest-paid artists in the world. Chapin&#x27;s album &quot;Dance Band on the Titanic&quot; sold poorly, but it was voted Album of the Year by &quot;The Times&quot; of London. In 1980, his recording contract with Elektra expired. Chapin signed a one-album contract with Boardwalk Records and released his ninth studio album, &quot;Sequel&quot;, which was described as his fastest-breaking album. Three singles were released, with all of them becoming hits. The first single, &quot;Sequel,&quot; became a top-25 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is a follow-up to “Taxi.” The second single, &quot;Remember When the Music,&quot; became a top-50 hit on the Adult Contemporary Chart. The last single, &quot;Story of a Life,&quot; became a hit on the Bubbling Under chart. The album sold 500,000 units.

==Philanthropic work==
Chapin resolved to leave his imprint on Long Island. He envisioned a Long Island where the arts flourished, universities expanded, and humane discourse was the norm. &quot;He thought Long Island represented a remarkable opportunity&quot;, said Chapin&#x27;s widow, Sandy.

In the mid-1970s, Chapin devoted much time and effort to social activism, including raising money to combat hunger in the United States. His daughter Jen said: &quot;He saw hunger and poverty as an insult to America. He co-founded the organization World Hunger Year with radio personality Bill Ayres, before returning to music with &quot;On the Road to Kingdom Come&quot;. He also released a book of poetry, &quot;Looking ... Seeing&quot;, in 1975. More than half of Chapin&#x27;s concerts were benefit performances (for example, a concert to help save the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse, New York, as well as hunger causes such as food banks), and proceeds from his concert merchandise were used to support World Hunger Year. Among those he helped is filmmaker Michael Moore, who, in 1977, got help funding his Mid-Michigan based independent newspaper startup, &quot;The Flint Voice&quot;, with Chapin benefit concerts. 

On October 15, 1977, a one-time benefit concert called Four Together - Concert for World Hunger and featuring Chapin and three other renowned folk and country rock singer-songwriters -- Gordon Lightfoot, James Taylor and John Denver -- was performed at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit, Mich. The performance -- which lasted nearly three hours -- was played live on CKLW AM 800, and raised money to combat world hunger. 

Chapin&#x27;s social causes at times caused friction among his band members. Chapin donated an estimated third of his paid concerts to charitable causes, often performing alone with his guitar to reduce costs.

One report quotes Chapin&#x27;s widow saying soon after his death – &quot;only with slight exaggeration&quot; – that &quot;Harry was supporting 17 relatives, 14 associations, seven foundations, and 82 charities. Harry wasn&#x27;t interested in saving money. He always said, &#x27;Money is for people,&#x27; so he gave it away.&quot; Despite his success as a musician, he left little money and it was difficult to maintain the causes for which he raised more than $3 million in the last six years of his life. The Harry Chapin Foundation was the result.

== Death ==

On the afternoon of July 16, 1981, Chapin was driving on the Long Island Expressway en route to perform at a free benefit concert at Lakeside Theater at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York, that evening. At 12:27 p.m. Chapin had reportedly put on his emergency flashers, decelerated his vehicle&#x27;s speed to 15 mph, and had weaved from the far-left lane to the center lane, to the left lane, and then back to the center lane before his vehicle was struck from behind by a semi-trailer truck. The force of the collision crushed the rear of the car, ruptured the fuel tank, and dragged the car several hundred feet on the pavement. Passers-by managed to help the unconscious Chapin out of his engulfed 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit. Chapin was immediately taken by helicopter from the crash site outside Jericho, New York, to the nearby Nassau County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:05 p.m. due to internal bleeding.

Chapin&#x27;s widow won a $12 million decision in a negligence lawsuit against Supermarkets General, the owners of the truck involved.

Chapin is buried in the Huntington Rural Cemetery in Huntington, New York. His epitaph is taken from his 1978 song &quot;I Wonder What Would Happen to This World&quot;:

== Legacy ==

Chapin&#x27;s work on hunger included being widely recognized as a key player in the creation of the Presidential Commission on World Hunger (under 39th President Jimmy Carter) in 1977 (he was the only member who attended every meeting).

Chapin was also the inspiration for the antihunger projects USA for Africa and Hands Across America, which were organized by Ken Kragen, who had been Chapin&#x27;s manager at the end of Chapin&#x27;s career, after Fred Kewley. Kragen, explaining his work on these benefit events, said, &quot;I felt like Harry had crawled into my body and was making me do it.&quot;

From around 1975 until the owners changed the format of the station in the late 1990s, WNEW-FM, 102.7, a NYC radio station with the motto &quot;Where Rock Lives&quot; held an annual &quot;Hungerthon&quot; every Thanksgiving, to benefit Harry Chapin&#x27;s World Hunger League. During the 24-hour period of the event, little to no music was played, with the exception of the iconic &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; by Arlo Guthrie played at noon and 6 p.m. For the remainder of the day, during every DJ&#x27;s four-hour show, guests such as Harry himself, other music stars, and experts on hunger brought to the listeners information about the severity of hunger in America, in New York City, and in the tri-state area, sometimes in graphic detail.

After Chapin&#x27;s death, the &quot;Hungerthon&quot; continued, and on July 13, 1985, at the U.S. leg of the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia at JFK Stadium, Kenny Loggins was presented with the first &quot;Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award&quot; by actor Jeff Bridges for his work for the World Hunger League in fighting hunger in America. Since WNEW-FM changed formats, other New York stations have continued to do fundraisers for the charity. In 1987, singer Kenny Rogers was awarded the first-ever &quot;ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award&quot; from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Since 1987, the ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award has been bestowed more than 20 times to various artists for their various &quot;humanitarian contributions.&quot; The ASCAP awards are now presented by Why Hunger, the organization originally co-founded by Harry Chapin and Bill Ayres as World Hunger Year.

Four additional organizations once presented awards in the name of Harry Chapin in the past. They include the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) Harry Chapin Memorial Humanitarian Award—now known as the Music Business Association or MusicBiz, the Harry Chapin Award for Contributions to Humanity by the National Association of Campus Activities (NACA), the Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award for Community Service from the Long Island Association, and the Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award by Long Island Cares.

Before his death, Chapin had worked with Peter M. Coan for several years on Chapin&#x27;s biography, &quot;Taxi: The Harry Chapin Story&quot;. Soon after Chapin&#x27;s death, his estate notified Coan that he must return all materials related to the book and that he &quot;no longer had the rights to the book-in-progress&quot;. Coan sued the estate, receiving a $65,000 settlement in 1990.&quot;Taxi&quot; was published in September 1990.

The Lakeside Theatre at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York, was renamed Harry Chapin Lakeside Theatre during a memorial concert held one month after his death, as a tribute to his efforts to combat world hunger. Other Long Island landmarks named in honor of Chapin include a graduate-student apartment complex at Stony Brook University, a theater in Heckscher Park in Huntington, New York, and a playground at the intersection of Columbia Heights and Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights.

The village of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, has hosted the Harry Chapin Run Against Hunger, a 10k, 5k, and fun run, since 1981.

On December 7, 1987, on what would have been his 45th birthday, Chapin was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his campaigning on social issues, particularly his highlighting of hunger around the world and in the United States.

In 1994, admirers of the late singer&#x27;s passionate fight against hunger renamed the then 11-year-old Southwest Florida Food Bank (Fort Myers, FL) the Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida, in tribute to Chapin, and with the permission of his widow.

In 2001, Chapin&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle&quot; was ranked number 186 of 365 on the Recording Industry Association of America list of Songs of the Century.

Chapin was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006.

On September 27, 2011, former U.S. Representative Alan Grayson wrote an article on the internet publication &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; about Chapin&#x27;s song &quot;What Made America Famous&quot;.

Singer and songwriter Guthrie Thomas has long publicly stated that Chapin&#x27;s song &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle&quot; is one of the most difficult songs to perform, due to Chapin&#x27;s masterful guitar playing and his brilliant syncopation of the lyrics, meaning each word must fit perfectly and in time with the playing. Also, despite seeming social and political differences with Chapin, Dr. James Dobson often quotes the entirety of &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle&quot; to illustrate dynamics of contemporary American families.

A children&#x27;s picture book was created using the lyrics of &quot;Mr. Tanner&quot; and the illustrations of Bryan Langdo; it was published by Ripple Grove Press in May 2017.

Greenwich Entertainment released a documentary film titled &quot;Harry Chapin: When in Doubt, Do Something&quot;. It was directed by Rick Korn and produced by Jason Chapin. It was released theatrically and through virtual cinema on October 16, 2020 (World Food Day).

== Family ==
Chapin&#x27;s widow is now chair of the Harry Chapin Foundation, where she continues to pursue his legacy. His son, Josh, is involved with the foundation, along with other family members.

Chapin often remarked that he came from an artistic family. His father Jim, brothers Tom and Steve, and daughter Jen Chapin are musicians, while his nieces, Abigail and Lily Chapin, perform under the name the Chapin Sisters. His paternal grandfather, James Ormsbee Chapin, was an artist who illustrated Robert Frost&#x27;s first two books of poetry; his maternal grandfather was the philosopher and rhetorician Kenneth Burke.

Chapin&#x27;s brothers sometimes performed with Harry at various times throughout his career, particularly during live performances. They played with him before his solo career took off, and were credited on the albums &quot;Greatest Stories Live,&quot; &quot;Legends of the Lost and Found,&quot; and &quot;Chapin Music!&quot; Tom and Steve continued to perform together (often with Harry&#x27;s former bandmates) occasionally after his death.

Country singer Mary Chapin Carpenter is Chapin&#x27;s fifth cousin.

<text>The Fisher King is a 1991 American fantasy comedy drama film written by Richard LaGravenese and directed by Terry Gilliam. Starring Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, with Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer and Michael Jeter, the film tells the story of a radio shock jock who tries to find redemption by helping a man whose life he inadvertently shattered. It explores &quot;the intermingling of New York City&#x27;s usually strictly separated social strata&quot;, and has been described as &quot;a modern-day Grail Quest that fused New York romantic comedy with timeless fantasy&quot;.

The film was released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on September 20, 1991. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, and grossed $72 million on a $24 million budget. At the 64th Academy Awards, the film earned five nominations, including Best Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for LaGravenese, with Ruehl winning Best Supporting Actress, making &quot;The Fisher King&quot; the only Oscar-winning film of Gilliam&#x27;s career.

==Plot==
Jack Lucas, a narcissistic, misanthropic shock jock, dismisses a disturbed regular caller, Edwin, over his infatuation with a woman he met at a Manhattan restaurant, brashly describing her social circle as a vain enemy to people like Edwin that &quot;must be stopped before it&#x27;s too late&quot;. Meanwhile, Jack has an equally vain girlfriend, a high rise penthouse apartment, and is in consideration for the lead in a comedic TV pilot. While practicing a line read at home, he turns on a news report and discovers his comments spurred Edwin to commit a mass murder–suicide at the restaurant, to his horror. 

Three years later, Jack is working for his new girlfriend, Anne, in her video store, and is in a mostly drunken, depressed state, fearful of being recognized. One night, while on a bender, he is moments from suicide. However, he is attacked and nearly set on fire by teenage punks who mistake him for a homeless person. He is rescued by Parry, a delusional homeless man who claims to have been tasked by cherubs to find the Holy Grail.

Parry tries to enlist Jack&#x27;s help in getting the Grail, relaying the legend of God charging the Fisher King with finding the Holy Grail, but the King incurred an incapacitating wound for his sin of pride. &quot;A Fool asks the King why he suffers, and when the King says he is thirsty, the Fool gives him a cup of water to drink. The King realizes the cup is the Grail and asks, &#x27;How did you find what my brightest and bravest could not?&#x27; The Fool said &#x27;I don&#x27;t know. I only knew that you were thirsty.&#x27;&quot;

Jack is initially reluctant, but acquiesces after learning his role in Parry&#x27;s current condition. Parry, whose real name is Henry Sagan, had been a teacher at Hunter College. After witnessing his wife&#x27;s gruesome death during Edwin&#x27;s massacre, Henry had a psychotic break and became catatonic. When he awakened, he took on the persona of Parry and became obsessed with the legend of the Fisher King. With Parry as his shielding persona, mentions of reality panic him, and he is continually haunted by a terrifying, hallucinatory Red Knight, from a distorted memory of his wife&#x27;s face exploding from a shotgun blast.

Jack seeks to redeem himself by helping Parry find love again. Lydia, a shy woman with whom Parry is smitten, is at first sent a cabaret telegram performed by a homeless singer, inviting her to Anne&#x27;s video store membership. While there, she&#x27;s prodded to meet Parry for joining Jack and Anne for dinner. Afterward, Parry walks Lydia home and declares his love for her from observing her for months. She reciprocates before heading inside, but Perry&#x27;s initiating a new romance summons the Red Knight. Fleeing his vision, the memory of his wife&#x27;s murder, and his institutionalization, he is ambushed by the same punks against whom he had defended Jack. Beaten and knifed mercilessly, Parry becomes catatonic again. Jack, feeling whole again after &quot;saving&quot; Parry, breaks up with Anne and begins to rebuild his career. However, he has a crisis of conscience during a sitcom pitch after ignoring the homeless cabaret singer&#x27;s reaching out to him.

After finding out what happened to Parry, Jack furiously wrestles with his self-loathing and Parry&#x27;s earlier belief in him. Ultimately wanting to help his friend, dons Parry&#x27;s clothing and infiltrates the Upper East Side castle of a famous architect and retrieves the &quot;Grail&quot;, a trophy that Parry believes to be the real Grail. During the theft, Jack finds the architect unconscious from attempting suicide. He triggers the alarm while leaving, alerting authorities and saving the man&#x27;s life.

When he brings the &quot;Grail&quot; to Parry, Parry regains consciousness and tells a silent Jack that he is ready to miss his wife. Lydia visits Parry in the hospital; she finds him awake and leading the patients of the ward in a rendition of the song, &quot;How About You?&quot;, with Jack. Parry and Lydia embrace, and Jack reconciles with Anne, telling her that he loves her. She slaps him, but grabs and kisses him. That night, Jack and Parry lie naked in Central Park gazing at the clouds, as they view a fireworks display over New York.

==Cast==
==Production==
During an appearance on an episode of &quot;The Directors&quot;, Gilliam said that he wanted to do the film because he was tired of big-budget special-effects films, such as his previous film, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, which went over budget and cost more than $45 million, nearly twice as much as &quot;The Fisher King&quot;″s budget of $24 million. This was the first film that Gilliam directed in which he was not involved in writing the screenplay, as well as his first film to not feature any other members of Monty Python.

According to &quot;The Directors&quot; episode, Gilliam came up with the scene in which Robin Williams shadows Amanda Plummer through a large crowd performing a waltz in the middle of Grand Central Terminal because he felt that the scene that LaGravenese had written, in which a large group of people in a crowded subway listen to a homeless woman sing with a beautiful voice that fills the room, was not working. Initially, he hesitated about this because his original intentions were to shoot the script, and the waltz would make it &quot;a Terry Gilliam film&quot;. The scene was shot in one night with a mix of professional extras and passengers alighting from the train.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film did moderately well at the box office, with a gross of almost $42 million in the United States and Canada, and an international gross of $30.5 million, for a worldwide total of $72.4 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Fisher King&quot; has an approval rating of 85%, based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;An odd but affecting mixture of drama, comedy and fantasy, &quot;The Fisher King&quot; manages to balance moving performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges with director Terry Gilliam&#x27;s typically askew universe.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the film &quot;sweeps you up on waves of humor, heartbreak and ravishing romance&quot;.

John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; described &quot;The Fisher King&quot; as &quot;one of the most nonsensical, pretentious, mawkishly cloying movies I ever had to wretch[&quot;sic&quot;] through&quot;.

Following Robin Williams&#x27;s death, a reappraisal of the film on RogerEbert.com said that &quot;no Williams film can hit harder—or be so fully consoling in such heartbreaking circumstances—than &quot;The Fisher King&quot;&quot;, in which his character &quot;gradually simmers to a boil of bristling insecurities, terror and agonizing internalized pain&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Home media==
===Laserdisc===
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc by Columbia TriStar Home Video in 1992. The first Laserdisc release was a fullscreen presentation, but showed more vertical information while cropping horizontally. The second release in 1997 presented the film in its 1.85:1 theatrical ratio. The Criterion Collection released their Laserdisc version in 1993 with several extras that have not surfaced on any other release, and a director-approved widescreen transfer in 1.66:1.

===DVD and Blu-ray===
The film was released on DVD in 1999 by Columbia TriStar Home Video, using the same master as the 1997 Laserdisc release, with only the theatrical trailer as a special feature. In 2011, Image Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray, utilizing a new high-definition master in the 1.85:1 theatrical ratio, with Dolby Digital Tru-HD 5.1 surround, with no special features.

<doc id="171052" wikidata="Q488205" url="?curid=171052" title="Singer-songwriter">
<text>A singer-songwriter is a musician who writes, composes, and performs their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. In the United States, the category is built on the folk-acoustic tradition with a guitar, although this role has transmuted through different eras of popular music. Traditionally, these musicians would write and sing songs personal to them. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole musical accompaniment to an entire song. The piano is also an instrument of choice.

In the early 21st century, various digital production tools, examples including GarageBand and other software programs, began to be used by singer-songwriters to compose their music and otherwise work as an audio engineer enhancing media.

== Definition and usage ==
The label &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; (or &quot;song-writer/singer&quot;) is used by record labels and critics to define popular music artists who write and perform their own material, which is often self-accompanied – generally on acoustic guitar or piano.
Such an artist performs the roles of composer, lyricist, vocalist, sometimes instrumentalist, and often self-manager. According to AllMusic, singer-songwriters&#x27; lyrics are often personal but veiled by elaborate metaphors and vague imagery, and their creative concern is to place emphasis on the song rather than on their performance of it. Most records by such artists have a similarly straightforward and spare sound that places emphasis on the song itself.

The term may also characterise songwriters in the rock, folk, country, and pop-music genres – including Henry Russell (1812–1900), Aristide Bruant (1851–1925), Hank Williams (1923–1953), and Buddy Holly (1936–1959). The phrase &quot;singer-songwriter&quot;, recorded from 1949, came into popular usage from the 1960s onwards to describe songwriters who followed particular stylistic and thematic conventions, particularly lyrical introspection, confessional songwriting, mild musical arrangements, and an understated performing style. According to writer Larry David Smith, because it merged the roles of composer, writer, and singer, the popularity of the singer-songwriter phenomenon reintroduced the Medieval troubadour tradition of &quot;songs with public personalities&quot; after the Tin Pan Alley era in American popular music. Song topics of singer-songwriters from the American folk music revival include political protest, as in the case of Woody Guthrie (1912–1967) and Pete Seeger (1919–2014). According to the &quot;Journal of Popular Music Studies&quot;, from the folk revival and onward into its permanence in pop music, the role of a singer-songwriter has involved several dimensions of creative identity:

== History ==

The concept of a singer-songwriter can be traced to ancient bardic oral tradition, which has existed in various forms throughout the world. Poems would be performed as chant or song, sometimes accompanied by a harp or other similar instrument. After the invention of printing, songs would be written and performed by ballad sellers. Usually these would be versions of existing tunes and lyrics, which were constantly evolving. This developed into the singer-songwriting traditions of folk culture.

Traveling performers existed throughout Europe. Thus, the folklorist Anatole Le Braz gives a detailed account of one ballad singer, Yann Ar Minouz, who wrote and performed songs traveling through Brittany in the late nineteenth century and selling printed versions.

In large towns it was possible to make a living performing in public venues, and with the invention of phonographic recording, early singer-songwriters like Théodore Botrel, George M. Cohan, and Hank Williams became celebrities; radio further added to their public recognition and appeal.

During the period from the 1940s through the 1960s, sparked by the American folk music revival, young performers inspired by traditional folk music and groups like the Almanac Singers and the Weavers began writing and performing their own original material and creating their own musical arrangements.

In the early 21st century, the digital audio workstation GarageBand has been utilized by many aspiring singer-songwriters to compose and record music. Singer-songwriters who have composed music professionally with GarageBand include Erykah Badu (for her 2008 album &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot;) and Bilal (for his 2010 album &quot;Airtight&#x27;s Revenge&quot;).

== Traditions in different countries==
=== North America, United Kingdom, and Ireland ===

The term &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; in North America can be traced back to singers who developed works in the blues and folk music style. Early to mid-20th century American singer-songwriters include Lead Belly, Jimmie Rodgers, Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker, Blind Willie McTell, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Son House, and Robert Johnson. In the 1940s and 1950s country singer-songwriters like Hank Williams became well known, as well as Woody Guthrie, and Pete Seeger, along with Ronnie Gilbert and Lee Hays and other members of the Weavers who performed their mostly topical works to an ever-growing wider audience. These proto-singer-songwriters were less concerned than today&#x27;s singer-songwriters with the unadulterated originality of their music and lyrics, and would lift parts from other songs and play covers without hesitation. The tradition of writing topical songs (songs regarding specific issues of the day, such as Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Jim Crow Blues&quot; or Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)&quot;) was established by this group of musicians. Singers like Seeger and Guthrie would attend rallies for labor unions, and so wrote many songs concerning the life of the working classes, and social protest; as did other folksingers like Josh White, Cisco Houston, Malvina Reynolds, Earl Robinson, Ewan MacColl, John Jacob Niles, and Doc Watson, while blues singers like Johnson and Hopkins wrote songs about their personal life experiences. This focus on social issues has greatly influenced the singer-songwriter genre. Additionally in the 1930s through the 1950s several jazz and blues singer-songwriters emerged like Hoagy Carmichael, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Harry Gibson, Peggy Lee, and Nina Simone, as well as in the rock n&#x27; roll genre from which emerged influential singer-songwriters Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, Ritchie Valens, and Paul Anka. In the country music field, singer-songwriters like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, Billy Edd Wheeler, and others emerged from the 1940s through the 1960s, often writing compelling songs about love relationships and other subjects.

The first popular recognition of the singer-songwriter in English-speaking North America and the United Kingdom occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s when a series of blues, folk and country-influenced musicians rose to prominence and popularity. These singer-songwriters included Bob Dylan, Neil Young, John Lennon, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen, Albert Hammond, Gordon Lightfoot, and Joni Mitchell. Artists who had been primarily songwriters, notably Carole King, Townes Van Zandt, and Neil Diamond, also began releasing work as performers. In contrast to the storytelling approach of most prior country and folk music, these performers typically wrote songs from a highly personal (often first-person), introspective point of view. The adjectives &quot;confessional&quot; and &quot;sensitive&quot; were often used (sometimes derisively) to describe singer-songwriter style.

In the rock band era, members were not technically singer-songwriters as solo acts. However, many were singer-songwriters who created songs with other band members. Examples include Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, Elton John (with Bernie Taupin), Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Robbie Robertson, Ian Anderson, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Peter Frampton, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Country Joe McDonald, and Barry Melton. Many others like Eric Clapton found success as singer-songwriters in their later careers.

The scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival, pioneered by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger had grown to a major movement in the early 1960s, popularized by Joan Baez and her protégée, Bob Dylan, who had started reaching a mainstream audience with his hit, Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; (1963) bringing &quot;protest songs&quot; to a wider audience. There were hints of cross-pollination, but rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with different audiences. An early attempt at fusing elements of folk and rock was highlighted in the Animals &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; (1964), a folk song, recorded with rock and roll instrumentation.

By the mid-1960s Bob Dylan took the lead in merging folk and rock, and in July 1965, released &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, with a revolutionary rock sound, steeped in tawdry urban imagery, followed by an electric performance later that month at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter. Often writing from an urban point of view, with poetry punctuated by rock rhythms and electric power, Dylan&#x27;s fusing of folk and rock freed up emerging singer-songwriters to use elements of both traditions to tell their stories. In the mid- to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art/music scene. The release of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; in 1967, featuring singer-songwriter Lou Reed and German singer and collaborator Nico was described as the &quot;most prophetic rock album ever made&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003.

In the late &#x27;60s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvas for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, July 1969, &quot;The Girls: Letting Go: &#x27;What is common to them – to Joni Mitchell and Lotti Golden, to Laura Nyro, Melanie, and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter—they sang about politics, love affairs, the urban landscape, drugs, disappointment, and the life and loneliness of the itinerant performer. Lotti Golden, in her Atlantic debut album &quot;Motor-Cycle&quot;, chronicled her life in NYC&#x27;s East Village in the late 1960s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay&#x27;s). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the contemporary female singer-songwriter that has informed generations of women singer-songwriters into the 21st century, with poet Warsan Shire as the muse for Beyoncé&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Lemonade&quot;.
 
By the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the original wave of singer-songwriters had largely been absorbed into a more general pop or soft rock format, but some new artists in the singer-songwriter tradition (including Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, Chris Isaak, Victoria Williams, John Mellencamp, and Warren Zevon) continued to emerge, and in other cases rock and even punk rock artists such as Peter Case, Paul Collins, and Paul Westerberg transitioned to careers as solo singer-songwriters. Kate Bush remained distinctive throughout with her idiosyncratic style.

In the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with Suzanne Vega whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Nanci Griffith, k.d. lang, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Colvin, Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Joan Osborne, Indigo Girls, and Tori Amos, who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market. In the early 1990s, female artists also began to emerge in new styles, including Courtney Love and PJ Harvey. Later in the mid-1990s, the term was revived again with the success of Canada&#x27;s Alanis Morissette and her breakthrough album &quot;Jagged Little Pill.&quot;

Also in the 1980s and 1990s, artists such as Bono, the Edge, Dave Matthews, Jeff Buckley, Richard Barone, Duncan Sheik, and Elliott Smith borrowed from the singer-songwriter tradition to create new acoustic-based rock styles. In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as Norah Jones, Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, David Bazan, South San Gabriel, Iron &amp; Wine, David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, Meg Hutchinson, Darden Smith, Josh Rouse, Steve Millar, Jolie Holland, Patrick Duff, Richard Buckner, Jewel, Jack Savoretti, Richard Shindell, John Gorka, and Antje Duvekot. Some started to branch out in new genres such as Kurt Cobain, Noel Gallagher, T Bone Burnett, Eddie Vedder, and Pete Yorn. Others used drugs as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of Holy Sons took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an indie label.

Recording on the professional-grade systems became affordable for individuals in the late 1990s. This created opportunities for people to independently record and sell their music. Such artists are known as &quot;indies&quot; because they release their records on independent, often self-owned record labels, or no label at all. Additionally the Internet has provided a means for indies to get their music heard by a wider audience.

=== Chanson, the French tradition ===
French &quot;chanson&quot; comes from an old tradition, since the Middle Ages. It is driven by the rhythms of the French language. It can be distinguished from the rest of French &quot;pop&quot; music or soft rock format that began to spread in France during the 1960s until today, under the cultural influence of Anglo-American rock music and the rock band era.

The first modern French singer-songwriter was Charles Trenet, who began his solo career in 1938. He was the first to use jazz rhythms in chanson. He would remain an isolated act until the creative blooming of a new generation during the post-World War II era (mid-1940s and 1950s), where such artists as Léo Ferré, Georges Brassens, Félix Leclerc (from Quebec), Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel (from Belgium), Henri Salvador (from French Guiana), Charles Aznavour, and Barbara appeared, with contrasted and rich imagination. Most of them are recognized as great masters by younger generations of French artists, especially Ferré (for the richness of his lyrics, his melodic genius, his critical density on social issues and his body of work&#x27;s profoundness) and Gainsbourg (for the bright and tasteful adaptation of pop or rock music with French language-driven rhythms).

During the 1960s and 1970s, prominent singer-songwriters included Claude Nougaro, Jean Ferrat, Boby Lapointe, Françoise Hardy, Frédérik Mey, Michel Polnareff, Nino Ferrer, Christophe, Bernard Lavilliers, Véronique Sanson and Jacques Higelin, amongst others.

=== &quot;Cantautori&quot;, the Italian tradition ===

&quot;Cantautori&quot; (Italian plural; the singular is &quot;cantautore&quot;) is the Italian expression corresponding to singer-songwriters in English. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;cantante&quot; (singer) and &quot;autore&quot; (writer).

The first internationally renowned &quot;cantautore&quot; was Domenico Modugno with his song &quot;Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)&quot;, a huge best seller in 1958; other early &quot;cantautori&quot;, who began their careers in the late 50s, are Gino Paoli, Luigi Tenco, Umberto Bindi, Giorgio Gaber, and Enzo Jannacci.

Fabrizio De André, Lucio Battisti, and Francesco Guccini began their careers in the &#x27;60s, while Edoardo Bennato, Lucio Dalla, Francesco De Gregori, Franco Battiato, Rino Gaetano, Ivano Fossati, Antonello Venditti, Claudio Baglioni, Pino Daniele, Roberto Vecchioni, Angelo Branduardi, and Eugenio Finardi all appeared in the &#x27;70s.
Their songs are still popular today, often telling stories of marginalized (De André, Guccini, Dalla) and rebellious people (Finardi, De Gregori, Venditti), or having a political background (Venditti, Guccini).

Branduardi was greatly influenced by Medieval and Baroque musical styles, while his lyrics are usually inspired by ancient fables. Battiato started as a progressive rock and cultivated music artist in the 1970s, shifting to an original blend of pop, electronic, new wave, and world music in the 1980s.

Those &quot;canutautori&quot; linked to the city of Genoa (De André, Paoli, Bindi, Tenco, Baccini, etc.) are also referred as members of the Genoese School.

The Neapolitan &quot;cantautore&quot; Pino Daniele often fused genres as diverse as R&amp;B, fusion, blues, pop, jazz, and tarantella to produce a sound uniquely his own, with lyrics variously in Italian, Neapolitan, or English. Similarly Paolo Conte was often tagged as a &quot;cantautore&quot;, but was more into the jazz tradition.

In the 1980s Vasco Rossi was renowned for his blend of blues-tinged rock music mixed with Italian melodies.
He was nicknamed the &quot;only Italian rockstar&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;unica rockstar italiana&quot;) by his fans.

Mixing international sounds and Italian lyrics, in the 2000s Bugo became the &quot;fantautore&quot;, a neologism coined for him. Despite not having achieved great fame, he is considered the pioneer of the renewal of Italian songwriting, making a point to break from the politicised content of the 70s.

In the last 25 years the tradition has mainly been continued by Samuele Bersani, Caparezza, and the so-called &quot;2nd Roman school of cantautori&quot; (including Max Gazzè, Niccolò Fabi, Daniele Silvestri, Simone Cristicchi).

The word has been borrowed into other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan &quot;cantautor&quot;, French &quot;chantauteur&quot;, Maltese &quot;kantawtur&quot;, Romanian &quot;cantautor&quot;, and Slovenian &quot;kantavtor&quot;.

=== Iberian-Latin American traditions ===

Beginning in the 1960s and following the Italian &quot;cantautori&quot; style of the 1950s (like the one of Domenico Modugno), many Latin American countries developed singer-songwriter traditions that adopted elements from various popular styles. The first such tradition was the mid-1960s invention of nueva canción, which took hold in Andean countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia.

At around the same time, the Brazilian popular style bossa nova was evolving into a politically charged singer-songwriter tradition called Tropicalismo. Two performers, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso became two of the most famous people in all of Brazil through their work in Tropicalismo.

After World War II it was developed in Italy a very prolific singer-songwriter (in Italian &quot;cantautore&quot;) tradition, initially connected with the French school of the &quot;chansonniers&quot;, and lately developed very heterogeneously. Although the term &quot;cantautore&quot; normally implies consistent sociopolitical content in lyrics, noteworthy performers in a more inclusive singer-songwriter categorization are: Domenico Modugno, Luigi Tenco, Gino Paoli, Sergio Endrigo, Fabrizio De André, Francesco De Gregori, Antonello Venditti, Roberto Vecchioni, Ivano Fossati, Lucio Dalla, Francesco Guccini, and Franco Battiato.

In neighbouring Malta, the main singer-songwriters are Walter Micallef, Manwel Mifsud and Vince Fabri. They all perform in Maltese.

Spain and Portugal have also had singer-songwriter traditions, which are sometimes said to have drawn on Latin elements. Catalonia is known for the Nova Cançó tradition – exemplified by Joan Manuel Serrat and Lluís Llach; the Portuguese folk/protest singer and songwriter José Afonso helped lead a revival of Portuguese folk culture, including a modernized, more socially aware form of fado called nova canção. Following Portugal&#x27;s Carnation Revolution of 1974, nova canção became more politicized and was known as canto livre. Another important Spain singer-songwriters are Joaquín Sabina, José Luis Perales, and Luis Eduardo Aute.

In the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s, socially and politically aware singer-songwriters like Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés emerged in Cuba, birthing a genre known as nueva trova. Trova as a genre has had broad influence across Latin America. In Mexico, for example, canción yucateca on the Yucatán Peninsula and trova serrana in the Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca, are both regional adaptations of trova. Today, Guatemalan Ricardo Arjona qualifies as Latin America&#x27;s most commercially successful singer-songwriter. Although sociopolitical engagement is uneven in his oeuvre, some see Arjona&#x27;s more engaged works as placing him in the tradition of the Italian &quot;cantautori&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, a singer-songwriter tradition called canto popular emerged in Uruguay.

With the influence of Tropicalismo, Traditional Samba and Bossa Nova, MPB (Música popular brasileira), or Brazilian Popular Music, became highly singer-songwriter based. For years solo artists would dominate Brazilian popular music with romantic cynicism alla Jobim or subliminal anti-government messages alla Chico Buarque. After the end of the military dictatorship in Brazil, Brazilian music became less politically and socially conscious. The censored Raul Seixas or the humorous spiritualist Jorge Ben were slowly obscured by funk carioca, axé music, and Brazilian disco. In recent years, however, a new stock of socially conscious Brazilian singer-songwriters is beginning to break the almost strictly dance-music momentum that has reigned since the 1980s (see the &#x27;Brazilian folk/folk-rock sub-article in Brazilian Music).

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===


Since the 1960s, those singers who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment have been known as &quot;bards&quot;. The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs are thought to be written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students&#x27; song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a Russian guitar, rarely if ever would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Though, bards using piano or accordion are also known. Those who became popular held modest concerts. The first nationwide-famous bards (starting their career in the 1950s) are traditionally referred to as the First Five: Mikhail Ancharov, Alexander Gorodnitsky, Novella Matveyeva, Bulat Okudzhava, and Yuri Vizbor. In the 1960s, they were joined by Vladimir Vysotsky, Victor Berkovsky, Yuliy Kim, and many others.

In the course of the 1970s, the shift to the classical 6-string guitar took place, and now, a Russian guitar is a rare bird with the bards. In the same period, the movement of KSP (Kluby Samodeyatelnoy Pesni – amateur song fan clubs) emerged, providing the bards with highly educated audience, and up to the end of the 1980s being their key promotion engine. Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, partly given the political nature of many songs, partly due to their vague status in the strictly organised state-supported show business establishment of the USSR. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around as folk lore, from mouth to mouth, or via the copying of amateur recordings (sometimes referred as magnitizdat) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of political nature. Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in the fact that it is sung along with a simple guitar melody as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that this form of poetry focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry often takes the form of narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. On the other hand, in the USSR the chief bard supporter was the state Union of Composers, and the main bard hater was the state Union of Writers. A far more obvious difference was the commerce-free nature of the genre: songs were written to be sung and not to be sold. The similar genre dominated by singers-songwriters is known as sung poetry in other Post-Soviet countries.

=== Bulgaria ===
Singer-songwriters are popular in Bulgaria under the name &quot;bards&quot;, or &quot;poets with guitars&quot;. Their tradition is a mixture of traditional folk motifs, city folklore from the early 20th century, and modern influences. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the Communist regime in the country started to tolerate the Bulgarian &quot;bards&quot;, promoting the so-called &quot;political songs&quot;, performed usually by one-man bands. A national festival tradition was established, under the title &quot;Alen Mak&quot; (Red Poppy), a symbol with strong Communist meaning in Bulgaria. At the same time, there were some prominent underground figures which were against the official Communist Party line, such as Angel &quot;Jendema&quot; Angelov, Yavor &quot;Yavkata&quot; Rilov, and Velizar &quot;Valdes&quot; Vankov.

After the collapse of Communism in 1989, the singer-songwriters&#x27; tradition was re-established. Currently, the Bulgarian &quot;bards&quot; enjoy several festivals (local and international) per year, namely the PoKi Festival (Poets with Guitars, Poetic Strings) in the town of Harmanli, the Bardfest in Lovech, the Sofia Evenings of Singer-Songwriters, and others. Major figures in the Bulgarian tradition are Dimitar Taralezhkov, Angel &quot;Jendema&quot; Angelov, Yavor &quot;Yavkata&quot; Rilov, Velizar &quot;Valdes&quot; Vankov, Dimitar Dobrev, Andro Stubel, Branimir &quot;Bunny&quot; Stoykov, Dorothea Tabakova, Mihail Belchev, Assen Maslarski, Grisha Trifonov, Plamen Stavrev, Vladimir Levkov, Margarita Drumeva, Maria Batchvarova, Plamen Sivov, and Krasimir Parvanov.

=== Romania ===
Despite the communist isolation, the tradition of the singer-songwriter in Romania flourished beginning with the end of the 1960s and it was put in the context of folk music, with its three main styles in Romania: ethno folk, American-style folk and lyrical (cult) folk. The framework for many of these initiatives came under the form of Cenaclul Flacăra, a series of mass cultural events with an inevitable ideological touch. Still, with the merit of supporting great opening initiatives: the appropriation of Western artists like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and others from the Woodstock generation, the public performance of gospel-like music, the opening to big international issues (pop culture, accountability of the leadership, tension surging during the Cold War-with surprisingly neutral positions, etc.).
Overall, the Romanian folk, in general, could be marked as an underground cultural movement, somewhere between non-aligned and protest music.

=== &quot;Liedermacher&quot;, the German tradition ===
Rooted in the European Bänkelsang (&quot;bench-singing&quot;) and Moritat traditions while also taking immediate inspiration from the French chanson scene and the American folk music revival, the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a whole generation of German-language singer-songwriters called Liedermacher (&quot;songmakers&quot;), among them Hannes Wader, Franz Josef Degenhardt, Reinhard Mey, and Konstantin Wecker from West Germany, Wolf Biermann from East Germany as well as Ludwig Hirsch and Georg Danzer from Austria. With regards to content and style, the Liedermacher spectrum ranges from political balladeering to rather observational storytelling and love songs. The lyrics often deal with topics such as social injustice, militarism, consumerism, environmental issues or the repercussions of the German Nazi past, often expressing technoskepticism and anti-establishment views.

=== Sweden ===
In the mid-1960s, Sweden witnessed the renaissance of the &quot;trubadur&quot;, the Swedish version of the singer-songwriter. Cornelis Vreeswijk and Fred Åkerström were particularly influential in their efforts to blend the heritage of the &quot;visa&quot; (a specific way to render simple stanzaic poems or songs, given distinction by artists such as Carl Michael Bellman and Evert Taube) with modern approaches to balladeering.

=== Netherlands ===
Ede Staal (Warffum) (1941–1986) was a Dutch singer-songwriter from the Northern province of Groningen who sang mainly in the Groninger dialect of Dutch.

<text>Richard Donald Crenna (November 30, 1926 – January 17, 2003) was an American actor and television director.

Crenna starred in such motion pictures as &quot;Made in Paris&quot; (1966), &quot;Marooned&quot; (1969), &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot; (1975), &quot;The Evil&quot; (1978), &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;Summer Rental&quot; (1985) and &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995). His first success came on radio in 1948 as high school student Walter Denton co-starring with Eve Arden and Gale Gordon in the series &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. Crenna continued with the comedy in its 1952 move into television. He also starred as Luke McCoy in the television series &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; (1957–1963). In 1985, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for his portrayal of the title role in &quot;The Rape of Richard Beck&quot; (1985).

==Early life==
Crenna was born November 30, 1926, in Los Angeles, the only child of Edith Josephine (née Pollette), who was a hotel manager in Los Angeles, and Domenick Anthony Crenna, a pharmacist. His parents were both of Italian descent. Crenna attended Virgil Junior High School, followed by Belmont Senior High School in Los Angeles, from which he graduated in 1944. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, entering the Army in February 1945 and serving until August 1946.

After his Army service, Crenna attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in English literature, and he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

==Acting career==
===Radio years===
Crenna got his acting start on radio. In 1937, he had gained his first role, that of &quot;the kid who did everything wrong&quot; on &quot;Boy Scout Jamboree&quot;, a show on which he continued to appear occasionally in numerous roles until 1948. In the following year, he started playing Walter &quot;Bronco&quot; Thompson on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, a role he played until 1954. He also originated the role of geeky Walter Denton on the radio comedy &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; alongside Eve Arden and Gale Gordon in 1948, and followed that role when the series moved to television in 1952. He remained in that role until 1957. He appeared as a delivery boy in &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; (episode &quot;Liz Cooks Dinner for 12&quot;), was Oogie Pringle on &quot;A Date With Judy&quot; (episode &quot;The Competitive Diet&quot;, among several other episodes of the show) and as a teenager on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; (episode &quot;Watching the Neighbor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;).

===Early television years===
Crenna played Walter Denton on radio&#x27;s &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, remaining with the cast when it moved into television in 1952. He remained with the show until it was canceled in 1957. He guest-starred on the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode &quot;The Young Fans&quot;, with Janet Waldo and on the 1955–56 anthology series &quot;Frontier&quot;, in the lead role of the episode titled &quot;The Ten Days of John Leslie&quot;. In 1955, he was the guest star on &quot;The Millionaire&quot; in the episode &quot;The Ralph McKnight Story&quot;.

Crenna appeared in 1956 on the television series &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; in the episode &quot;The Promising Young Man&quot; as a young man named Woody. In 1957, he played a bank robber on &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (season 2, episode 19).

After &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; was canceled in 1957, Crenna joined the cast of the comedy series &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; as Luke McCoy; his co-star was Walter Brennan, who played Grandpa Amos McCoy. Crenna ultimately became one of the series&#x27;s four directors during its six-year run (1957–1963).

===1960s–1970s===
Credited as Dick Crenna, he directed eight episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; during its 1963-1964 season, including &quot;Opie the Birdman,&quot; &quot;The Sermon for Today,&quot; and the Gomer Pyle-instigated &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Arrest.&quot; Crenna also directed &quot;Henhouse,&quot; a 1977 episode of &quot;Lou Grant&quot;.

Crenna portrayed California state senator James Slattery in the series &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot; (1964–1965). For his acting in this series, he was twice nominated for an Emmy Award with slightly different names: for Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment and for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series, both in 1965. Crenna was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star – Male for this same role in 1965. In 1966, Crenna played beside Steve McQueen as an ill-fated captain of an American gunboat in 1920s China in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;.

During the 1970s, Crenna continued acting in Western dramas such as &quot;The Deserter&quot;, &quot;Catlow&quot;, &quot;The Man Called Noon&quot;, and &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot;. He made a notable performance in Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s final film &quot;Un Flic&quot; in 1972. In 1976, Crenna returned to weekly network television in the sitcom &quot;All&#x27;s Fair&quot;, a political satire co-starring Bernadette Peters. Despite high expectations and good critical reviews, it lasted just a single season. The 1978 miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;, based on James A. Michener&#x27;s historical novel of the same name saw Crenna in the role of deranged religious fanatic Colonel Frank Skimmerhorn, who ordered the 1864 massacre of Colorado American Indians.

===1980s–early 2000s===
Crenna won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television nomination for his performance in the title role of the 1985 film &quot;The Rape of Richard Beck&quot;.

Crenna played John Rambo&#x27;s ex-commanding officer Colonel Sam Trautman, in the first three &quot;Rambo&quot; films, a role for which he was hired after Kirk Douglas left the production a day into filming. Trautman became the veteran actor&#x27;s most famous role; his performance received wide critical praise. He also spoofed the character in &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot; in 1993.

Crenna starred as NYPD lieutenant of detectives Frank Janek in a series of seven popular made-for-television films, beginning in 1988 and ending in 1994. The character of Janek had originally appeared in a series of novels by William Bayer.

In 2001, Crenna played US President Ronald Reagan in the Showtime film &quot;The Day Reagan Was Shot&quot;, a fictionalised account of the attempted assassination attempt of Reagan in 1981.

==Legacy==
Crenna was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6714 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Illness and death==
Crenna died of heart failure at age 76 on January 17, 2003, in Los Angeles. At the time of his death he was also suffering from pancreatic cancer.

<text>The Nice were an English progressive rock band active in the late 1960s. They blended rock, jazz and classical music. 

Keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist Lee Jackson, guitarist David O&#x27;List, and drummer Ian Hague originally formed in 1967 to be the backing band of soul singer P. P. Arnold. After replacing Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own and quickly developed a strong live following. The group&#x27;s stage performances featured Emerson&#x27;s Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of the instrument. Their compositions included radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.

The band achieved commercial success with an instrumental rearrangement of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;America&quot;, following which O&#x27;List left the group. The remaining members carried on as a trio, releasing several albums, before Emerson left the band in early 1970 in order to form Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. The group briefly re-formed in 2002 for a series of concerts.

==History==

===Early career===
The Nice evolved from Gary Farr and the T-Bones, which keyboardist Keith Emerson and bassist Keith &quot;Lee&quot; Jackson were both members of before the band dissolved in early 1967. Emerson then briefly played with the VIPs, who toured the Star-Club in Hamburg, and his playing style became influenced by the organist Don Shinn, including standing up to play the instrument and rocking it on stage. Meanwhile, P. P. Arnold, a performer who reached a higher level of popularity in the UK than her native US, was unhappy with her backing band, the Blue Jays, and wanted a replacement. Her driver suggested Emerson would be able to put together such a group. Emerson agreed, but only on the condition the band could perform on their own as a warm-up act. Since it effectively meant getting two bands for the price of one, manager Andrew Loog Oldham readily agreed. Emerson recruited Jackson, drummer Ian Hague and ex-The Attack guitarist David O&#x27;List, the latter by recommendation from journalist Chris Welch. The name came from Arnold saying, &quot;Here comes the Naz&quot;, which the group misheard as &quot;the Nice&quot;.

The band played its first gig in May 1967, and had its first major break at the 7th National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor on 13 August. Oldham had managed to secure a separate set for the group in a side tent away from also accompanying Arnold on the main stage, where they gained attention. The next week, Welch wrote in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that &quot;it was the first time I had seen a group actually in the act of winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances&quot;. When Arnold returned to the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own. Hague was not interested in the &quot;progressive&quot; direction the group wanted to go in, so he was replaced by former Mark Leeman Five and Habits drummer Brian Davison.

Now a band in their own right, the Nice expanded their gear, recruiting roadies Bazz Ward and Lemmy, the latter of whom provided Emerson with a Hitler Youth ceremonial dagger to stick into the keys on his Hammond organ. They spent the end of 1967 on a package tour with Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Move and Amen Corner. Pink Floyd&#x27;s then leader, Syd Barrett, missed several gigs and O&#x27;List had to stand in for him. The group&#x27;s first album was recorded throughout the autumn of 1967, and in October of that year they recorded their first session for John Peel&#x27;s radio show &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The album included classical and jazz influences including extracts from Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; and a rearrangement of Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk&quot; renamed as &quot;Rondo&quot;, changing the time signature from the original 9/8 to 4/4 in the process. The group clashed with producer Oldham in the studio over the length of the track, but eventually won the argument; the full eight-minute piece was included on the album. After the album was released, the group realised that Oldham had a conflict of interest as manager and record company owner, so they recruited sports journalist Tony Stratton Smith to take over management duties.

For their second single, the Nice created an arrangement of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;America&quot; which Emerson described as the first ever instrumental protest song. The track used the main theme of the Bernstein piece (from &quot;West Side Story&quot;) but also included fragments of Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot;. The single concludes with Arnold&#x27;s three-year-old son speaking the lines &quot;America is pregnant with promise and anticipation, but is murdered by the hand of the inevitable.&quot; The new arrangement was released under the title &quot;America (Second Amendment)&quot; as a pointed reference to the US Bill of Rights provision for the right to bear arms. In July 1968, Immediate Records publicised the single with a controversial poster picturing the group members with small boys on their knees, with superimposed images of the faces of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. on the children&#x27;s heads. A spokesman for the band said: &quot;Several record stores have refused to stock our current single ... the Nice feel if the posters are issued in United States they will do considerable harm&quot;. During the tour that followed the release of their second album in July, the group spawned controversy when Emerson burned an American flag onstage during a performance of &quot;America&quot; at a charity event, &quot;Come Back Africa&quot; in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. The group were subsequently banned from ever playing the venue again.

By summer 1968, the group had become concerned about O&#x27;List&#x27;s reliability and matters came to a head following a gig in Croydon&#x27;s Fairfield Hall in September. According to roadie Ward, O&#x27;List had an altercation with him mid-performance. Emerson subsequently called a band meeting with Jackson and Davison and stated flatly that O&#x27;List should be sacked. They agreed, and immediately after their performance at The Ritz, Bournemouth in October, he was fired by Stratton Smith with the rest of the band present. O&#x27;List, however, claims that he left the band voluntarily because he was upset at Smith&#x27;s decision to make Emerson the front man, saying: &quot;I left the band and waited for Keith to get in contact... I should have gone straight to Keith, but I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

===Reduction to a three-piece===

The Nice briefly considered looking for a replacement, with Steve Howe auditioning. Howe got on well with the rest of the band, but a week later had second thoughts and decided not to join. Emerson tried to learn guitar so he could cover some of O&#x27;List&#x27;s old parts, but gave up after one gig.

The band&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Ars Longa Vita Brevis&quot;, featured an arrangement of the Intermezzo from the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot; by Jean Sibelius, which the band&#x27;s friend Roy Harper had recommended they cover, and the album&#x27;s second side was a suite which included an arrangement of a movement from J.S. Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3. The group used an orchestra for the first time on some parts of the suite. The band were on the bill at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival and briefly toured Ireland with Yes and Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band which, by all accounts, was fraught with logistical problems.

The third album, titled &quot;Nice&quot; in the UK and &quot;Everything As Nice As Mother Makes It&quot; in the US, featured one side recorded live on their American tour and one side of studio material. As with previous albums, it included arrangements of classical material, in this case Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie espagnole&quot; which was rewritten as &quot;Diary of an Empty Day&quot; plus rearrangements of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; and Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Hang On to a Dream&quot;.

In 1969, the band found time to contribute to other projects. Emerson performed as a session player for Rod Stewart and the Faces, while the whole group provided instrumental backing for the track &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; on Roy Harper&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Flat Baroque and Berserk&quot;. Mid-year, tour promoter Michael Emmerson asked the Nice to write some music for the Newcastle upon Tyne Arts Festival. The result was the &quot;Five Bridges&quot; suite. The group premièred the piece on 10 October 1969 at Newcastle City Hall. A complete version with an orchestra was performed at the Fairfield Hall, Croydon on 17 October, which was recorded for the album of the same name. The title refers to the city&#x27;s five bridges spanning the River Tyne, and Jackson&#x27;s lyrics refer to his Newcastle childhood and the St James&#x27; Park football ground.

By late 1969, Emerson thought the Nice had progressed as far as it could musically, and was particularly dissatisfied with Jackson&#x27;s limited vocal style. He asked Jack Bruce and Yes&#x27; Chris Squire about forming a new band, but both turned Emerson down. While on tour in the US with King Crimson, Emerson held a meeting with Stratton Smith and declared &quot;the Nice had outlived its usefulness&quot;. By the end of the year, Emerson and Crimson&#x27;s Greg Lake had decided to form a band together. The group carried on touring into 1970, but sometime early in the year, Emerson told Jackson that he would be leaving the band. Matters were not helped by Immediate Records filing for bankruptcy; the band later said they received no royalties from the label while an active group.

In February 1970, the group collaborated with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra led by Zubin Mehta. This was broadcast in the following month as part of the &quot;Switched-On Symphony&quot; program. Following standard television procedure of the day, the Nice&#x27;s contribution (a version of &quot;America&quot;) was recorded ahead of time and the band mimed for the cameras.

By March, the group had confirmed they would split, and a report on the band&#x27;s decision was printed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The group played their last British concert on 22 March at the Fairfield Hall, Croydon, and after a short German tour the band broke up, playing their last gig on 30 March at the Berlin Sportpalast.

===Post-Nice and reunion===

Emerson and Lake recruited Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster and formed Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (ELP). In 1971, the posthumous Nice album &quot;Elegy&quot; was released. It included different versions of previously released tracks, two being studio versions and two live from the 1969 US tour. Emerson had no involvement with compiling the album, which was done by Jackson, Davison and Charisma Records. The album reached No. 5 in the UK.

Jackson formed Jackson Heights which released five albums between 1970 and 1973. Emerson supported the band and became a fan. Davison formed &quot;Every Which Way&quot; which released an album in 1970. Both Jackson and Davison formed Refugee with keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1974, but Moraz left the group after one album to replace Rick Wakeman in Yes.

After over three decades of inactivity, the Nice reformed in 2002 for a series of concerts. A three-CD set &quot;Vivacitas&quot; was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. O&#x27;List did not attend the reunion and was replaced by guitarist Dave Kilminster. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

==Musical style==

The Nice were primarily a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which he used to hold down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson&#x27;s playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.

The group&#x27;s early sound was geared more towards psychedelic rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O&#x27;List&#x27;s departure, Emerson&#x27;s control over the band&#x27;s direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson&#x27;s redefining of the role of keyboard instruments in rock set the Nice apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification and Leslie speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate for the lack of a guitarist.

Jackson never considered himself a great singer, partly because the group chose poor keys for his vocal range, but his bass playing, with heavy use of a plectrum, was a distinctive part of the band&#x27;s overall sound. He was influenced by Bob Dylan, whose songs were often covered at the time; the Nice interpreted several of them, typically reducing them to three or four verses and featuring a long improvised middle section, such as &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;.

==Legacy==

Though noted in rock history primarily as the band which brought Keith Emerson into the spotlight, the Nice were one of the pioneering progressive rock bands and their fusion of styles strongly influenced the movement into the 1970s. Their commercial success on Charisma Records was key to establishing the label, which went on to include several other progressive acts, including Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator. Genesis were fans of the Nice and &quot;The Knife&quot; from their album &quot;Trespass&quot; was directly inspired by the band. Though the Nice were not the first to combine a rock band and orchestra, they did inspire similar attempts by other groups, such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;.

Emerson&#x27;s showmanship was more important in the Nice, and he mostly used just a Hammond organ live as opposed to a wider range of keyboards, including the Moog synthesizer, in ELP. John Peel, an early champion of the Nice, called ELP &quot;a waste of talent and electricity&quot;.

<text>Chaplin is a 1992 biographical comedy-drama film about the life of English comic actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin. It was produced and directed by Richard Attenborough and stars Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei, Dan Aykroyd, Penelope Ann Miller and Kevin Kline. It also features Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s own daughter, Geraldine Chaplin, in the role of his mother, Hannah Chaplin.

The film was adapted by William Boyd, Bryan Forbes and William Goldman from Chaplin&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;My Autobiography&quot; and the 1985 book &quot;&quot; by film critic David Robinson. Associate producer Diana Hawkins got a story credit. The original music score was composed by John Barry.

The film was a box office bomb, grossing $12 million against a $31 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics; Downey&#x27;s titular performance, however, garnered critical acclaim and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor along with nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.

==Plot==
An elderly Charlie Chaplin reminisces during a 1962 conversation in Switzerland with George Hayden, the fictionalized editor of his autobiography.

In the Victorian era East End of London, Chaplin escapes his poverty-stricken childhood by immersing himself in the world of variety circuit. In 1894, after his mother Hannah loses her voice onstage, five-year-old Charlie takes her place. Hannah is eventually committed to an asylum after developing psychosis. Over the years, Chaplin and his brother Sydney gain work with variety producer Fred Karno, who later sends him to the United States. He begins a relationship with dancer Hetty Kelly and soon proposes to her. However, Kelly declines, reasoning she is too young. Chaplin vows to return when he is a success.

In America, Chaplin is employed by famous comedy producer Mack Sennett. He creates the Tramp persona, and due to the terrible directorial abilities of Sennett&#x27;s girlfriend Mabel Normand, he becomes his own director. After Sydney becomes his manager, Chaplin breaks from Sennett to gain creative control over his films, with the goal of one day owning his own studio. In 1917, he completes work on his film &quot;The Immigrant&quot; and starts a two-year relationship with actress Edna Purviance.

Years later, at a party thrown by Douglas Fairbanks, Chaplin dates child actress Mildred Harris. He sets up his own studio and becomes &quot;the most famous man in the world&quot; before his 30th birthday. Chaplin tells Fairbanks that he must marry Harris because she is pregnant but later learns it is a hoax. Chaplin has a confrontation with J. Edgar Hoover about actor/directors and propaganda. This sparks a 40-year-long vendetta by Hoover.

Harris&#x27;s divorce lawyers claim Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;The Kid&quot; as an asset. Chaplin and Sydney flee with the footage, finish editing it in a Salt Lake City hotel, then smuggle it back to Los Angeles.

The brothers arrange for their mother to join them, but Chaplin cannot cope with her worsened condition. In 1921, Chaplin attends the UK premiere of &quot;The Kid&quot;. He hopes to locate Hetty, but soon learns that she died in the influenza epidemic. Chaplin also discovers the British working class resent him for not joining the British armed forces during World War I as they did.

Back in America, Hoover digs into Chaplin&#x27;s private life, suspecting him of Pro-Soviet sympathies. Chaplin is forced to consider the effect of &quot;talkies&quot; on his career. Despite the popularity of sound films, he vows never to make a talkie featuring the Tramp.

In 1925, Chaplin makes &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; and marries bit-part actress Lita Grey. However, he later says to George that he always thought of her as a &quot;total bitch&quot; and barely mentions her in his autobiography. Chaplin marries Paulette Goddard and feels a sense of guilt and sympathy for the millions unemployed due to the Wall Street Crash (Chaplin sold most of his shares the year before the crash). Chaplin decides to address the issue in &quot;Modern Times&quot;, but his dedication to this film results in the breakup of his marriage.

At an industry party, the partially Roma Chaplin refuses to shake hands with a visiting Nazi. Fairbanks comments that Chaplin resembles Adolf Hitler, inspiring him to create &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;. The film, which satirizes Nazism, is a hit worldwide and further enrages Hoover, who believes it to be anti-American propaganda.

Chaplin marries actress Oona O&#x27;Neill, who resembles Hetty. However, it is alleged that he is the father of the child of former lover Joan Barry. Despite a blood test proving that the child is not his, Chaplin is ordered to provide financial support after the blood test is declared inadmissible in court. With his reputation damaged, he stays out of the public eye for over seven years until producing &quot;Limelight&quot;. During McCarthyism, the Chaplins leave America together on a visit to Britain, but then the United States Attorney General revokes his re-entry permit.

In 1972, Chaplin is invited back to America to receive a special Academy Honorary Award. Despite being initially resentful after two decades in exile and certain that no one will even remember him, he is moved to tears when the audience laughs at footage from his films and gives Chaplin the Academy Awards&#x27; longest standing ovation ever.

== Cast ==


In addition, the Academy Award tribute sequence at the end features footage of the real Chaplin.

==Production==
Richard Attenborough acquired the rights to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s biography in 1988 and intended to make it with Universal Pictures. According to Marc Wanamaker, who served as an advisor on the film, Attenborough had thought of making a miniseries at one point, to fully explore Chaplin&#x27;s life. Although Attenborough wanted Robert Downey Jr. for the part of Chaplin, studio executives wanted Robin Williams or Billy Crystal for the role. Jim Carrey was also considered, as was Tom Hanks. On David Letterman&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;My Next Guest Needs No Introduction&quot;, Downey Jr. revealed that Attenborough had also been interested in Tom Cruise for the role, but Cruise declined the offer. The film had a four-hour cut that was later edited down to two and a half hours for release.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews, lauded for its high production values, but many critics dismissed it as an overly glossy biopic. Although the film was criticized for taking dramatic license with some aspects of Chaplin&#x27;s life, Downey&#x27;s performance as Chaplin won universal acclaim. Attenborough was sufficiently confident in Downey&#x27;s performance to include historical footage of Chaplin himself at the end of the film. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 61% of critics have given &quot;Chaplin&quot; a positive review based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Chaplin&quot; boasts a terrific performance from Robert Downey, Jr. in the title role, but it isn&#x27;t enough to overcome a formulaic biopic that pales in comparison to its subject&#x27;s classic films.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Downey&#x27;s performance, and deemed the film &quot;extremely appreciative&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that Chaplin&#x27;s life was too grand to be properly captured in a film, criticizing the screenplay, but praised the casting and the film&#x27;s first hour.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, dubbing the film, &quot;a disappointing, misguided movie that has all of the parts in place to be a much better one&quot;, but praised Downey and the production values. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt Attenborough&#x27;s filmmaking and Chaplin&#x27;s life were ill-suited to each other, but said of Downey, &quot;Lithe and lively and looking remarkably like the younger Chaplin, Downey does more than master the man’s celebrated duck walk and easy grace. In one of those acts of will and creativity that actors come up with when you least expect it, Downey becomes Chaplin, re-creating his character and his chilly soul so precisely that even the comedian’s daughter Geraldine, a featured player here, was both impressed and unnerved.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed £1.8 million ($2.7 million) in the United Kingdom and $9.5 million in the United States.

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in June 1993 and later on DVD in 1997, and on LaserDisc by Live Home Video on July 5, 1998. A 15th-anniversary edition was released by Lions Gate Entertainment (who obtained the distribution rights to the film in the interim under license from the copyright holder, StudioCanal) in 2008. The anniversary edition contained extensive interviews with the producers, and included several minutes of home-movie footage shot on Chaplin&#x27;s yacht. The box for this DVD mistakenly lists the film&#x27;s running time as 135 minutes, although it retains the 143-minute length of the original theatrical release.

The 15th Anniversary Edition was later released on Blu-ray on February 15, 2011.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;Chaplin&quot; was released on December 15, 1992.

A newly expanded soundtrack with 35 tracks to celebrate the film&#x27;s 30 anniversary was released by La La Land Records in 2023.

<text>BITNET Relay, also known as the Inter Chat Relay Network, was a chat network setup over BITNET nodes. It predated Internet Relay Chat and other online chat systems. The program that made the network possible was called &quot;Relay&quot; and was developed by Jeff Kell of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1985 using the REXX programming language.

This system drew its name from &quot;relay race&quot; which shares a comparable behavior, where messages travel hop-by-hop along the network of Relay servers until they reached their destination. Messages sent within the United States would take a few seconds to reach their destinations, but communication times varied in other countries or internationally. If one or more network links were down, BITNET would store and forward the messages when the network links recovered, minutes or even hours later.

== Background ==

Before BITNET Relay was implemented, any form of communication over BITNET required identifying the remote user and host.

Relay ran on a special ID using several BITNET hosts. To use it, a message was sent to a user ID called RELAY. The Relay program running on that user ID would then provide multi-user chat functions, primarily in the form of &quot;channels&quot; (chat rooms). The message could contain either a command for Relay (preceded by the popular &quot;/&quot; slash character command prefix, still in use today), or a message at the remote host (typically a mainframe computer).

Computers connected to BITNET were generally located at universities and government agencies, due to limited access to computer network bandwidth. It was not uncommon for a university&#x27;s entire network connection to run over a single leased telephone line or even a 4800 baud dial-up connection. Thus using scarce computing and network resources for &quot;frivolous&quot; purposes, such as chat, was often discouraged.

== Popularity ==

One of the reasons Relay gained acceptance was that its system of peer servers decreased the network bandwidth consumed by group chat, due to no longer having to send multiple copies of the same message individually to each server. Because of this efficiency and the limited bandwidth at the time, users were often not allowed to use or develop alternate chat systems. Experimental chats like &quot;Galaxy Network&quot; and &quot;VM/Shell&quot; were asked to shut down before they achieved noteworthy success.

Bitnet Relay gained popularity in the late 1980s when Valdis Kletnieks at Virginia Tech created a Pascal version that consumed far less CPU time, and again in the early 1990s when Smart Relay improved handling of message delivery.

Though Jeff Kell himself had made observations about the possible demise of BITNET Relay, only TCP/IP and the Internet brought about the end of BITNET and Relay. Jarkko Oikarinen, the creator of Internet Relay Chat, says that he was inspired by BITNET Relay

<text>What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It is a 1993 American biographical film based on the life of American singer-songwriter Tina Turner. Directed by Brian Gibson and written by Kate Lanier from a uncredited story draft by the late Howard Ashman, based on Tina&#x27;s 1986 autobiography &quot;I, Tina&quot;, it stars Angela Bassett as Tina and Laurence Fishburne as her abusive husband Ike Turner.

&quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on June 6, 1993, and was theatrically released by Touchstone Pictures on June 25, 1993. Although the Turners disapproved of its inaccuracies, the film was critically and commercially successful, grossing $61 million on a $15 million budget. For their performances, Bassett and Fishburne received nominations at the 66th Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor. Bassett also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

==Plot==
Raised in Nutbush, Tennessee, in the early 1950s, Anna Mae Bullock returns home from church one day to see her mother Zelma leaving, and taking her elder sister Alline with her. She is distraught over her mother leaving and is consoled by her grandmother Georgeanna. Six years later, a teenage Anna Mae relocates to St. Louis, where she reunites with her mother and Alline. While in St. Louis, Alline takes Anna to a nightclub at East St. Louis, where she sees bandleader Ike Turner perform with his band Kings of Rhythm. After nights of seeing women in the crowd coming onstage to sing with Ike, Anna finally gets her chance to perform for Ike and impresses him so much that he offers to mentor her and produce her music.

As the first frontwoman of Kings of Rhythm, along with the formation of a backing girl group (later known as the Ikettes), Anna develops a local popularity at the St. Louis club scene. The two record a hit song, &quot;A Fool in Love&quot; and develop a romance. Anna becomes pregnant with their son and learns, while in the hospital, that her name has changed to Tina Turner after the radio station announces the name &quot;Ike &amp; Tina Turner&quot; following the playing of &quot;A Fool in Love&quot;. The couple drives to Tijuana to get married and soon after the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue becomes a national sensation and relocates to Los Angeles. Upon learning that Ike &amp; Tina have moved to Los Angeles, Ike&#x27;s former girlfriend Lorraine Taylor makes an unexpected visit to their new home and drops off their two sons, which further complicates matters at home.

One day while at home, Tina voices her opinion that Ike&#x27;s music &quot;all sounds the same&quot;, which leads to Ike beating her in front of their four sons. Following a performance on a teen rock and roll show in 1966, Tina is offered a solo deal with Phil Spector for the song, &quot;River Deep – Mountain High.&quot; Following the release of the song, the duo open for the Rolling Stones in London and find success with their recording of &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, which transforms the Revue from a national R&amp;B phenomenon to an international sensation. Over time, crowds begin clamoring more to Tina than Ike, which causes further tension as Ike discovers cocaine.

During one recording session of the song, &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; in 1973, an addicted Ike violently rapes Tina in their home recording studio for not singing the song to his satisfaction, blaming her for the duo&#x27;s issues in following their previous hits. Feeling hopeless, Tina attempts suicide by overdosing a full bottle of sleeping pills before a show and is rushed to a hospital where she recovers. Tina eventually visits a friend, a former Ikette, who convinces her to practice Buddhism and the chant Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo which leads Tina to find a newfound strength. Then, in 1976, while en route to a show in Dallas, a fed-up Tina begins to annoy Ike and they get into a physical altercation in the limousine on their way to the hotel. Upon their arrival, Ike falls asleep and Tina flees, running across a freeway to the Ramada Inn where she finds refuge. Tina later files for divorce and in the final matter, she agrees to give up everything except her stage name.

In 1980, Tina begins rebuilding her career at the cabaret circuit and invites a young impresario named Roger Davies to see her perform so he could manage her and help her realize her dreams as a rock star. Impressed that she still could perform, Davies agrees to manage her. Still, the presence of Ike threatens to derail her chances. Turning to her Buddhist faith, she prepares for a show at the Ritz Theatre in 1983 where Ike confronts her at her dressing room with a gun. Undeterred, Tina verbally silences him and leaves the dressing room where she dazzles the audience at the Ritz with her new hit single, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;, where she eventually realizes her dream of being a rock superstar.

==Production==

Taylor Hackford was originally slated to direct; however, Hackford would later be replaced by Mario Van Peebles, who also wanted to play Ike Turner. Van Peebles left the project to direct &quot;Posse&quot; (1993). Touchstone Pictures offered the film to Brian Gibson, who was about to direct &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot; (1993) for Paramount Pictures. Gibson choose to helm the Touchstone project due to a more profitable pay-or-play deal which Paramount failed to match.

Halle Berry, Robin Givens, Pam Grier, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Vanessa L. Williams were all considered for the lead role. Houston was actually offered the role, but had to decline due to imminent maternity. Jenifer Lewis also originally auditioned to play Tina but was cast instead as Tina&#x27;s mother despite being only a year older than Bassett.

Angela Bassett auditioned in October 1992 and was chosen only a month before production began in December. During that time, she had to learn not only how to talk like Turner but to dance and move like her. She would have been willing to try to do the singing as well, but &quot;not in the time we had,&quot; she said. &quot;I did think about it for a second, though.&quot; Instead, she lipsyncs to soundtracks recorded by Tina and Fishburne. Bassett worked with Tina, but only &quot;a little bit.&quot; Turner helped most with the re-creations of her famed dance routines. She also re-recorded new versions of all the songs used in the film.

Laurence Fishburne was offered the role of Ike five times and turned it down each time. &quot;It was pretty one-sided,&quot; said Fishburne, who turned down the project based on the script he first read. Ike, Fishburne added, was &quot;obviously the villain of the piece, but there was no explanation as to why he behaved the way he behaved - why she was with him for 16 to 20 years, what made her stay.&quot; The writers made some changes and though Ike is still shown as a pretty despicable sort, the film offers at least some insight into him - most notably a scene in which Ike recalls watching, at age 6, his father&#x27;s death from wounds suffered in a fight over a woman. The changes helped persuade Fishburne to do the role, but he says that Bassett&#x27;s casting as Tina &quot;was the deciding factor.&quot;

Fishburne did not have Ike around to help model his performance as much as he would have liked. He met him once during production. &quot;He was not particularly welcome on this project,&quot; Fishburne says. The actor&#x27;s only meeting was a brief introduction when Ike showed up at the Turners&#x27; former home in View Park during a location shoot. Ike signed some autographs and showed Fishburne his walk. &quot;It was nice to meet him,&quot; says Fishburne. &quot;Regardless of his actions, he was so much a part of Tina&#x27;s life. The movie is about him just as much as her. It&#x27;s unfortunate that he wasn&#x27;t welcomed, that both of them weren&#x27;t around more.&quot; Director Gibson had no contact with Ike. &quot;I never spoke to him,&quot; says Gibson. &quot;I was not allowed to. Disney felt that it would not be a good idea.&quot;

Screenwriter Kate Lanier omitted much of the brutality Tina said she endured in her book. Her character was also sanitized; most notably, her relationship with saxophonist Raymond Hill and the birth of their son was excluded from the film. Lanier admitted that Tina Turner was not happy with certain aspects of the film because some parts were fictionalized. Tina Turner tried to talk to the Disney filmmakers about the script. In 1993, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that they saw &quot;a deep need&quot; to make a film about &quot;a woman who was a victim to a con man. How weak! How shallow! How dare you think that was what I was? I was in control every minute there. I was there because I wanted to be, because I had promised.&quot; She added, &quot;O.K. so if I was a victim, fine. Maybe I was a victim for a short while. But give me credit for &quot;thinking&quot; the whole time I was there. See, I do have pride.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
Although the film was adapted from Tina Turner&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I, Tina&quot;, elements of the script were &quot;fictionalized for dramatic purposes&quot;.

* Ike did not sing or play guitar on the record &quot;Rocket 88&quot; as depicted in the film. He wrote the song and played piano on the record. His saxophonist Jackie Brenston was the vocalist. The record was released under the alias Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats who were actually Ike&#x27;s band the Kings of Rhythm.
* The song Anna Mae first performs onstage with Ike, &quot;You Know I Love You&quot;, was actually a slower B.B. King blues ballad; Ike played piano on King&#x27;s record. When Anna Mae sang the song, Ike played the organ, not the guitar as depicted in the film. Tina recorded a blues rock rendition of the song for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.
*Anna Mae and Ike did not have sex the night his live-in girlfriend Lorraine Taylor shot herself as depicted. In reality, when Anna Mae was pregnant in 1958, Lorraine pulled a gun on her before shooting herself because she believed that Anna Mae and Ike were having an affair. However, Anna Mae and Ike were platonic friends until 1960 when she went to sleep in his bed after a musician threatened to come into her room.
* The first song Anna Mae is portrayed recording, &quot;Tina&#x27;s Wish&quot;, is actually a 1973 track titled &quot;Make Me Over&quot; from the album &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;. In reality, the first song she recorded is &quot;Boxtop&quot; in 1958.
* A theater marquee is shown for a 1960 show starring Otis Redding, Martha and the Vandellas, and Ike &amp; Tina Turner. In reality, Martha and the Vandellas were known as The Del-Phis until 1961, and Otis Redding did not release his first solo single until 1962.
* In the film, Anna Mae learns of her name change to Tina Turner after her song is played on a radio in the hospital where she had given birth. In reality, Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s debut single &quot;A Fool In Love&quot; was released in August 1960, months before she gave birth to their son.
* In real life, Ike did not call her Anna Mae, he called her either Ann or &quot;Bo&quot; (short for her surname Bullock). Even after she received the stage name Tina Turner, family and friends still called her Ann.
* The film implies that Tina&#x27;s eldest child, Craig Raymond (born Raymond Craig in 1958), is Ike&#x27;s biological son. In reality, his biological father was saxophonist Raymond Hill and Ike later adopted him. Tina and Ike have one biological child, Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Renelle, born in 1960.
* The film depicts Ike and his entourage sneaking Tina out of the hospital after she gave birth to get married. In reality, Ike was not present for the birth of their son Ronnie. Tina wrote in her book that a few days after she checked herself out of the hospital, she discovered that the woman Ike hired to replace her while she recuperated was a sex worker using her stage name Tina Turner to get clients. She confronted the woman and after they got into a fight, Tina performed a show that night. Ike wrote in his book &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name&quot; that he was unaware the woman was a sex worker. He was out of town to attend a court hearing in St. Louis when Tina gave birth in Los Angeles. They married in 1962, two years after the birth of their son.
* Lorraine Taylor, the mother of Ike&#x27;s sons Ike Junior and Michael, did not drop them off at his home with Tina as depicted in the film. In reality, Ike went to St. Louis and brought his sons to Los Angeles after Lorraine informed him she was going to leave them there. Tina also brought her son Craig to live with them.
* In a scene dated 1968, Ike and Tina open for the Rolling Stones performing &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. In reality, Ike and Tina did not perform &quot;Proud Mary&quot; until after it was released by Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1969. The Rolling Stones did not have any concerts in 1968; Ike and Tina opened for them on their 1966 British Tour and 1969 American Tour.
* Jackie and Fross are both fictional characters. Jackie represents an amalgamation of Ikettes and associates of Tina, one of whom was Ike&#x27;s friend Valerie Bishop who introduced Tina to Buddhism in 1973.
* The infamous &quot;eat the cake Anna Mae&quot; scene was an exaggerated reenactment of an incident that occurred during the early years of the revue. Tina recalled that when they stopped to order food, someone brought her a pound cake while they were sitting in a car. Although Tina said she did not order it, Ike ordered her to eat all of it while he watched.
* The scene where Tina was raped during the recording of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; was exaggerated from what she stated in her book. Tina claimed that sometimes after Ike would hit her, he then would have sex with her. Ike maintained that he never raped Tina. &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; was recorded at their Bolic Sound recording studio, not at home as depicted in the film.
* The film depicts Tina&#x27;s suicide attempt in 1974 when it actually occurred six years prior in 1968.
* Ike did not tell Tina &quot;if you don&#x27;t make it, I&#x27;ll kill you&quot; as depicted in the ambulance scene. Tina stated in her book that after her suicide attempt she joked with a friend that she was so afraid of Ike, he probably threatened her which is why she survived. She was unconscious and did not know what he actually said. Ike stated in his book that he scolded Tina as his way of motivating her to fight for her life.
* During the time Tina is planning her comeback in the early 1980s, a reenactment of an interview features Tina rehearsing her song &quot;I Might Have Been Queen&quot;. The song would be recorded for her 1984 comeback album, &quot;Private Dancer&quot;.
* The incident in the Ritz Theatre where Ike fails to scare Tina with his pistol is fabricated. Allegedly, Ike made threats to hire a hitman, so Tina carried a pistol, but he did not threaten her in person with a gun as depicted.
* Before performing &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; at the Ritz in 1983, the emcee announces that it was her &quot;first solo appearance&quot;, but she first performed there in 1981. Her 1983 performance there occurred before the recording of &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; and led to Capitol Records signing a contract with her.
* A title card at the end states that Tina&#x27;s first solo album won four Grammy Awards, implying it was &quot;Private Dancer&quot;. In reality that album was her fifth solo album. Her first two solo albums (&quot;Tina Turns the Country On!&quot; and &quot;Acid Queen&quot;) were released while she was still with Ike, and two (&quot;Rough&quot; and &quot;Love Explosion&quot;) were released after.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;With a fascinating real-life story and powerhouse performances from Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; is a can&#x27;t miss biopic.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average to critics&#x27; reviews, gave the film an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The brilliant, mercurial portrayal of Ike Turner by Laurence Fishburne, formerly known as Larry, is what elevates &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do With It&quot; beyond the realm of run-of-the-mill biography.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it a score of four out of four, calling it, &quot;A powerful, joyful, raw, energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers Ike and Tina Turner.&quot;

===Responses by Tina and Ike===
Tina Turner stated she wished the film had not portrayed her as a &quot;victim&quot;. In 2018, Turner told Oprah Winfrey that she had only recently watched the film. She said, &quot;I watched a little bit of it, but I didn&#x27;t finish it because that was not how things went. Oprah, I didn&#x27;t realize they would change the details so much.&quot; Despite her disapproval of elements of the film, Turner heavily praised Bassett&#x27;s portrayal of her. When Bassett was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in 2023, Turner wrote of Bassett&#x27;s portrayal of her in &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do With It&quot;: &quot;Angela, the first time we met, you didn&#x27;t look, sound, or move like me—that came later after you worked so hard to make it happen. But even then, I could see that the young woman standing before me had strength, determination, and big, big dreams, just like me. &#x27;She&#x27;s perfect,&#x27; I said, and I was right. You never mimicked me. Instead, you reached deep into your soul, found your inner Tina, and showed her to the world.&quot;

Ike Turner said that the film and Tina Turner&#x27;s book are &quot;filled with lies&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name&quot;, he said Fishburne did &quot;a fantastic job, though the job he did isn&#x27;t really me&quot;. He also stated he was upset about the rape scene, which he claimed was fabricated and &quot;was the lowest thing they could have ever done&quot;. He added that the film damaged his reputation.

===Box office===
The film grossed $40.1 million in the United States and Canada and $20.5 million internationally for a worldwide total of $60.6 million.

<doc id="171068" wikidata="Q581501" url="?curid=171068" title="The Madness of King George">
<text>The Madness of King George is a 1994 British biographical comedy drama film directed by Nicholas Hytner and adapted by Alan Bennett from his own 1991 play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot;. It tells the true story of George III of Great Britain&#x27;s deteriorating mental health, and his equally declining relationship with his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, particularly focusing on the period around the Regency Crisis of 1788–89. Two text panels at the end of the film note that the colour of the King&#x27;s urine suggests that he was suffering from porphyria, adding that the disease is &quot;periodic, unpredictable and hereditary.&quot;

&quot;The Madness of King George&quot; won the BAFTA Awards in 1995 for Outstanding British Film and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Nigel Hawthorne, who was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film won the Oscar for Best Art Direction and was also nominated for Oscars for Best Supporting Actress for Mirren and Best Adapted Screenplay. Helen Mirren also won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and Hytner was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; the 42nd-greatest British film of all time.

==Plot==
King George III&#x27;s bout of madness in 1788 touched off the Regency Crisis of 1788 and triggered a power struggle between factions of Parliament under the Tory Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and the reform-minded Leader of the Opposition Charles James Fox.

At first, the King&#x27;s behaviour appears mildly eccentric. He is deeply concerned with the wellbeing and productivity of Great Britain and exhibits an encyclopaedic knowledge of the families of even the most obscure royal appointments. He is devoted to his loving wife, Queen Charlotte, and their large brood of 15 children. However, he is growing more unsettled, partly over the loss of America. His memory fails, his behaviour becomes erratic and hypersexual, he talks and talks, and his urine turns blue.

George, Prince of Wales, aggravates the situation, knowing that he will be named regent if the King becomes incapacitated. George chafes under his father&#x27;s relentless criticism, and yearns for greater freedom, particularly when it comes to choosing a wife. He married the woman everyone believes to be his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert, in a secret ceremony in 1785. Without his father&#x27;s consent, the marriage is illegal. Even with consent, it would remove him from the succession, because Fitzherbert is a Catholic. He knows that he has the moral support of Fox, whose agenda includes abolition of the slave trade and friendlier relations with America. Knowing how to exacerbate the King&#x27;s behaviour, the Prince arranges a concert of music by Handel. The King reacts as expected, interrupting the musicians, speaking lasciviously to Lady Pembroke, and finally assaulting his son.

In a private moment, the King tells Charlotte that he knows something is wrong. They are brutally interrupted when the Prince has them separated, supposedly on the advice of physicians. Led by the Prince of Wales&#x27; personal physician, Dr. Warren, the King is treated using the medical practices of the time, which focus on the state of his urine and bowel movements and include painful cupping and purgatives.

Lady Pembroke recommends Dr. Francis Willis, who cured her mother-in-law. Willis uses novel procedures. At his farm in Lincolnshire, patients work to gain “a better opinion of themselves.” He observes to an equerry “To be curbed, thwarted, stood up to, exercises the character.” When the King insults him, foully, he is strapped into a chair and gagged. He will be restrained whenever he “swears and indulges in meaningless discourse” and “does not strive every day and always towards his own recovery”.

When the Prince has the King transferred to Kew, Charlotte watches as her beloved, bearded and wearing a soiled diaper and a straitjacket, struggles against being put in the coach. “Until you can govern yourself, you&#x27;re not fit to govern others. And until you do so, I shall govern you,” Willis says. At Kew, the King spits soup at Willis, but gains control under the physician&#x27;s intractable gaze. Later, the King, properly dressed, feeds himself to a round of applause from staff—but the delusions persist.

The Whig opposition confronts Pitt&#x27;s increasingly unpopular Tory government with a proposal that would give the Prince powers of regency. Baron Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, obtains and suppresses proof of the marriage. Fox wins, and the Regency Bill is printed. Thurlow comes to see the King and joins in a moving reading of &quot;King Lear&quot;. “I have remembered how to seem...” the King muses. “What, what!” an expression he has not used in 6 months. His urine is yellow.

Thurlow and the King arrive at Parliament in time to thwart the bill. The King forces the Prince to admit his marriage and to put away Fitzherbert. With the crisis averted, all those who have witnessed his suffering are summarily dismissed, including Captain Greville, the King&#x27;s equerry. Fitzroy, another equerry, observes to the sacked Greville: “To be kind does not commend you to kings.”

Cheering crowds welcome the royal family to St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Willis stands by, but the King dismisses him.

“We must be a model family,” he declares; George wants “something to do.” “Smile at the people, wave at them. Let them see that we&#x27;re happy. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here.” Saluting, Willis disappears into the crowd, where Mrs. Fitzherbert also smiles, wistfully.

==Cast==
==Production==
Alan Bennett insisted that director Nicholas Hytner and actor Nigel Hawthorne should be cast in the film version, after having acted in the play.

===Title change===
In adapting the play to film, the director Nicholas Hytner changed the name from &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; to &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; for American audiences, to clarify George III&#x27;s royalty. A popular explanation developed that the change was made because there was a worry that American audiences would think it was a sequel and not go to see it, assuming they had missed &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;. An interview revealed: &quot;That&#x27;s not totally untrue,&quot; said Hytner, laughing. &quot;But there was also the factor that it was felt necessary to get the word &quot;King&quot; into the title.&quot;

===Filming locations===
Principal photography took place from 11 July to 9 September 1994. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios and on location at:
* Arundel Castle, Arundel, West Sussex
* Divinity School, Oxford

&quot;The Madness of King George&quot; was the second highest-grossing British film of the year, behind &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;, with a gross of £4.6 million in the UK. It debuted strongly at the US box office and went on to gross $15,238,689 in the United States and Canada and $27.4 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film received largely positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% score based on 47 reviews, with an average of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Thanks largely to stellar all-around performances from a talented cast, &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; is a funny, entertaining, and immensely likable adaptation of the eponymous stage production.&quot;

Reviewing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Emanuel Levy praised the film, writing: &quot;Under Hytner&#x27;s guidance, the cast, composed of some of the best actors in British cinema, rises to the occasion... Boasting a rich period look, almost every shot is filled with handsome, emotionally charged composition&quot;.

John Simon of &quot;The National Review&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Madness of King George III&quot; has survived the transfer from stage to screen, and emerges equally enjoyable on film.&quot; Simon praised the leading actors and most of the supporting cast, except for Carter&#x27;s portrayal of Fox, which he said lacked charisma.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;For those who, like myself, were disappointed in the play, the film contains pleasant surprises, all of them resulting from differences between the two arts.&quot;

<doc id="171070" wikidata="Q1551887" url="?curid=171070" title="Nobody's Fool (1994 film)">
<text>Nobody&#x27;s Fool is a 1994 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Robert Benton, based on the 1993 novel of the same name by Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffith, Dylan Walsh, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gene Saks, Josef Sommer, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Bosco and Bruce Willis.

It was Paramount&#x27;s final production under its Paramount Communications ownership (being sold to the original Viacom in July 1994) as well as Tandy&#x27;s final film performance before her death on September 11, 1994. For his performance, Newman received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role as well as for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, in addition to a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Benton at the 67th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Donald &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan is a stubborn old reprobate living in the peaceful, snowy northern New York state village of North Bath. He freelances in the construction business, usually with his dim-witted friend Rub by his side. He is often at odds with Carl Roebuck, a local contractor, suing him at every opportunity for unpaid wages and disability. Sully&#x27;s one-legged lawyer Wirf is inept, and his lawsuits are repeatedly dismissed. As a way to irritate him, Sully openly flirts with Carl&#x27;s wife Toby at every opportunity (which she enjoys). He is a regular at the Iron Horse Saloon, where he often has drinks and plays cards with Wirf, Carl, Rub, Jocko the town pharmacist, and Ollie Quinn, the town&#x27;s Chief of Police.

A running joke is the repeated theft of Carl&#x27;s snowblower. Sully steals it to get back at Carl for his latest failed lawsuit. Carl steals it back, placing it in the yard at his construction business guarded by his doberman pinscher guard dog. Sully, after drugging the dog, steals it a second time. Carl takes it back a final time, and leaves the dog, who is now skittish due to his drugging, at Sully&#x27;s childhood home for him to find.

Sully is a tenant in the home of the elderly Miss Beryl, his 8th grade teacher, whose banker son Clive strongly urges her to kick him out and sell the house. Family complications of his own develop for Sully with a visit from Peter, his estranged son who is a jobless professor at odds with his wife. While he and Sully reconstruct their relationship, Sully begins a new one with young grandson, Will. Peter&#x27;s sudden everyday presence does not sit well with Rub, who quits working with Sully. Meanwhile, Clive is on the verge of a lucrative deal to build an amusement park in North Bath. However, the deal unexpectedly falls through when the promoter turns out to be a con man, and Clive quietly skips town in shame since he used his bank&#x27;s resources to help finance the amusement park.

After being jailed for punching a police officer who has been hassling him, Sully&#x27;s luck seems to be all bad. His regular horse racing trifecta wins, but because he had been jailed, he had missed making the bet. But his son and grandson start to warm up to him, and he rebuilds his relationship with Rub. Then Toby leaves Carl, mostly due to his constant womanizing, and invites Sully to run away with her to Hawaii. Sully accepts, then realizes he cannot leave his grandson and politely declines. Miss Beryl, as a gift, pays the back taxes on Sully&#x27;s long-abandoned family home. His son gives him a winning ticket for the missing trifecta, which he had bet in his father&#x27;s absence. In the end, Sully decides to remain in North Bath because of his family obligations.

==Cast==
==Production==
The setting for both the book and movie, the fictional North Bath, New York, is based on the city of Ballston Spa, New York, in Saratoga County, New York, just east of Gloversville, where Russo grew up. The real Ballston Spa was overshadowed by neighboring Saratoga Springs, just as North Bath was eclipsed by the fictional Schuyler Springs. 
&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was filmed in the Hudson Valley city of Beacon, which was paid a $40,000 location fee for services and inconveniences. Production began in November 1993 and concluded in February 1994. The Iron Horse Bar, located on N. 7th Street in Hudson, NY, is now the Governor&#x27;s Tavern; and the Diner is now The Grazin&#x27; Diner on Warren Street, just around the corner in Hudson.

Bruce Willis reportedly agreed to a substantial pay cut to appear in the film, accepting the SAG-AFTRA scale of $1,400 per week at a time when the actor was earning roughly $15 million for his action movies. His name appears only in the closing credits.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was given a limited release on December 23, 1994, earning $92,838 in six theaters. The film was given a wide release on January 13, 1995, earning $7,142,691 over its opening weekend in 792 theaters. The film ultimately grossed $39,491,975 in the US and Canada.

===Critical response===

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was well received by film critics. Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 ½ out of 4 stars in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;: &quot;An irresistibly appealing Newman is surrounded by wonderful actors in this charmingly unpredictable character study...&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; is a gentle, flavorsome story of a loose-knit, dysfunctional family whose members essentially include every glimpsed citizen of a small New York town. Fronted by a splendid performance from Paul Newman as a spirited man who has made nothing of his life, Robert Benton&#x27;s character-driven film is sprinkled with small pleasures; the dramatic developments here don&#x27;t take place in the noisy, calamitous manner that is customary these days. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; similarly remarked: &quot;&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; is so eloquently straightforward, it practically sings to the soul. A story about very real people caught in the everyday woes and worries of a small Upstate New York town, it shows the kind of character traits, tics and from-the-heart chatter you wish there was more of in the movies. Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; also wrote: &quot;This is the first Robert Benton movie I&#x27;ve really liked — and possibly my favorite Paul Newman performance since &quot;The Hustler&quot;. Conceived somewhat in the spirit of Chekhov&#x27;s stories, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; ambles along semiplotlessly, focusing on the petty love-hatreds that link people together in small towns and the everyday orneriness that keeps them alive...it has both the poetry and the authenticity of failure.&quot;

Paul Newman was particularly praised by critics. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the star&#x27;s performance as &quot;the single best of this year and among the finest he has ever given&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;I have been watching Paul Newman in movies all of my life. He is so much a part of the landscape of modern American film that sometimes he is almost invisible: He does what he does with simplicity, grace and a minimum of fuss, and so I wonder if people even realize what a fine actor he is.

The film maintains a 91% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 55 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It&#x27;s solidly directed by Robert Benton and stacked with fine performances from an impressive cast, but above all, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; is a showcase for some of Paul Newman&#x27;s best late-period work.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics.

<text>Cincinnatus Heine Miller ( ; September 8, 1837 – February 17, 1913), better known by his pen name Joaquin Miller ( ), was an American poet, author, and frontiersman. He became known as the &quot;Poet of the Sierras&quot; after the Sierra Nevada, about which he wrote in his &quot;Songs of the Sierras&quot; (1871).

==Life==

===Early years and family===
Joaquin Miller&#x27;s parents were Hulings Miller and Margaret (née Witt), who married January 3, 1836, in Union County, Indiana. Their second son, Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, was born in 1837 near Union County, Indiana. For unknown reasons, Miller later claimed his birth date was November 10, 1841. He said he was born in Millersville, Indiana, a town he claimed was founded by his father, while on a wagon heading west. After leaving Union County, Miller&#x27;s father then moved the family to Grant County, Indiana to a location near the Mississinewa River and near the Miami Indian Reservation. Besides adopting the pen name &quot;Joaquin&quot;, he later changed his middle name from Hiner to Heine to evoke the German poet Heinrich Heine.

While Miller was a young boy, probably between 1850 and 1852, his family moved to Oregon and settled in the Willamette Valley, establishing a farm in what would become Lane County.

As a young man, he moved to northern California during the California Gold Rush years, and had a variety of adventures, including spending a year living in a Native American village, and being wounded in a battle with Native Americans. A number of his popular works, &quot;Life Amongst the Modocs,&quot; &quot;An Elk Hunt&quot;, and &quot;The Battle of Castle Crags&quot;, draw on these experiences. He was wounded in the cheek and neck with an arrow during this latter battle, recuperating at the Gold Rush-era mining town of Portuguese Flat.

===Wanderings and early writings===
He accompanied William Walker on the latter&#x27;s 1855 filibustering expedition to Nicaragua. In the spring of 1857, Miller took part in an expedition against the Pit River Tribe after they killed a white man on Pit River. Years later, he claimed that he had sided with the Native Americans and was run out of town for it. He was widely rumored to have married an Indian woman, possibly a Wintu woman who nursed him back to health after he was wounded by Modocs, and to have fathered with her a daughter named Cali-Shasta, or &quot;Lily of the Shasta.&quot; Although Miller soon left the area to pursue other adventures, in the 1870s he sought out Cali-Shasta, then in her teens, and took her to San Francisco to be educated by his friend Ina Coolbrith. Contemporaries believed that Miller&#x27;s &quot;Indian wife&quot; was the woman later kidnapped by Modocs and held in captivity for some years until rescued by a man named Jim Brock (whom she married), but when &quot;Amanda Brock&quot; died in 1909, Miller denied news reports describing his supposed romance with her. He credited her with saving his life, but said she had always been a platonic friend.

Spending a short time in the mining camps of northern Idaho, Miller found his way to Canyon City, Oregon by 1864 where he was elected the third Judge of Grant County. His old cabin in Canyon City is still standing.

Miller&#x27;s exploits included a variety of occupations: mining-camp cook (who came down with scurvy from only eating what he cooked), lawyer and a judge, newspaper writer, Pony Express rider, and horse thief. On July 10, 1859, Miller was caught stealing a horse gelding valued at $80, a saddle worth $15, and other items. He was jailed briefly in Shasta County for the crime, and various accounts give other incidents of his repeating this crime in California and Oregon.

Miller earned an estimated $3,000 working as a Pony Express rider, and used the money to move to Oregon. With the help of his friend, Senator Joseph Lane, he became editor of the &quot;Democratic Register&quot; in Eugene, a role he held from March 15 to September 20, 1862. Though no copies survive, it was known as sympathetic to the Confederacy until it was forced to shut down because of its treasonable character. That year, Miller married Theresa Dyer on September 12, 1862, in her home four days after meeting her in Port Orford, Oregon. He had corresponded with her after exchanging poems with her for critique and chasing away a competing suitor. She published poetry under the pen name &quot;Minnie Myrtle&quot; and later, as Minnie Myrtle Miller. The couple had three children: Maud, George, and Henry, although Miller would later claim the baby Henry was not his own.

In 1868, Miller paid for the publication of 500 copies of his first book of poetry, &quot;Specimens&quot;. It was unnoticed and Miller gave away more copies than he sold. Few have survived. The author&#x27;s despair and disappointment was reflected in his second book, &quot;Joaquin et al.&quot;, the next year.

Dyer filed for divorce on April 4, 1870, claiming they had a third child, Henry Mark, the year before and that Miller was &quot;wholly&quot; neglectful. The court declared them divorced on April 19 and Dyer was granted custody of the baby while the two older children were left in the care of her mother. Miller was ordered to pay $200 per year in child support. Miller believed the divorce prevented him from being nominated for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court. He never denied her charges that he was neglectful of her and their children and was rarely home. He also may have had an affair with actress Adah Isaacs Menken shortly into the marriage.

===Travels===

Miller had sent a copy of &quot;Joaquin, et al.&quot; to Bret Harte, who offered advice that he avoid &quot;faults of excess&quot; and encouragingly wrote, &quot;you are on your way to become a poet.&quot; The next summer, July 1870, Miller traveled to San Francisco with borrowed money and there befriended Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith. Stoddard was the first to meet him at the dock and, as he recalled, Miller&#x27;s first words to him were, &quot;Well, let us go and talk with the poets.&quot;

Miller went to England, where he was celebrated as a frontier oddity. There, in May 1871, Miller published &quot;Songs of the Sierras&quot;, the book which finalized his nickname as the &quot;Poet of the Sierras&quot;. It was well received by the British press and members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, particularly Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti.

While in England, he was one of the few Americans invited into the Savage Club along with Julian Hawthorne, son of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The younger Hawthorne referred to Miller as &quot;a licensed libertine&quot; but admitted to finding him &quot;charming, amiable, and harmless&quot;. Rather abruptly, Miller left England in September 1871 and landed in New York. At the encouragement of family, he made his way to Easton, Pennsylvania to visit his dying brother before returning to Oregon; his father died shortly thereafter. Miller eventually settled in California, where he grew fruit and published his poems and other works.

In 1877, Miller adapted his &quot;First Fam&#x27;lies of the Sierras&quot; into a play, &quot;The Danites, or, the Heart of the Sierras&quot;. It opened on August 22 in New York with McKee Rankin as the main character. The anti-Mormon play, which featured Danites hunting the daughter of one of the murderers of Joseph Smith, became one of the most commercially successful in a series of anti-Mormon dramas at the time. The &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, however, attributed its success to curious audience members expecting a disastrous failure and instead discovering a good show: &quot;The play proved to possess more than ordinary merit, and if it is not a great work, it is decidedly not a very bad one.&quot; &quot;The Danites&quot; was extended from a run of only a few days to one of seven straight weeks before moving to another theatre and, ultimately, was performed to such a degree that it rivaled the popularity of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. It was published in book form later in 1877. Miller later admitted that he regretted the anti-Mormon tone.

Miller married for a third time on September 8, 1879 to Abigail Leland, in New York City.

===Later years and death===

In 1886, Miller published &quot;The Destruction of Gotham&quot;, a book which was one of the earliest to depict a prostitute as a heroine. That year, he moved to Oakland, California, and built a home for himself he nicknamed &quot;The Abbey&quot; on property he called &quot;The Hights&quot; . He remained there until his death in 1913.

Japanese poet Yone Noguchi came to The Hights in 1894 and spent the next four years there as an unpaid laborer in exchange for room and board. While living there, he published his first book, &quot;Seen or Unseen; or, Monologues of a Homeless Snail&quot; (1897). Though he referred to Miller as &quot;the most natural man&quot;, Noguchi reflected on those years as his most difficult in the United States and later fictionalized his experience in &quot;The American Diary of a Japanese Girl&quot;.

In 1897, Miller traveled to the Yukon as a newspaper correspondent. He saw Alaska for the first time on July 30. His dispatches, many of which were written before reaching Alaska, incorrectly implied an easy and inexpensive trip. Miller himself nearly froze to death; two toes were lost to frostbite.

Miller died on February 17, 1913, surrounded by friends and family. His last words were recorded as &quot;Take me away; take me away!&quot; The poet had asked to be cremated by friends in the funeral pyre he built at The Hights with no religious ceremony and without being embalmed. His wishes were mostly ignored and the funeral on February 19 drew thousands of curious onlookers. The preacher who spoke referred to Miller as &quot;the last of America&#x27;s great poets.&quot; On May 23, members of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco and the Press Club returned to Miller&#x27;s funeral pyre to burn the urn which contained his ashes, allowing them to scatter. He had left no will and his estate — estimated at $100,000 — was divided between his wife, Abigail and daughter, Juanita.

==Critical response and reputation==
Miller was championed, although not enthusiastically, by Bret Harte and Ambrose Bierce. In his time, Miller was known for his dishonesty and womanizing. Bierce, his friend and contemporary, said of him, &quot;In impugning Mr. Miller&#x27;s veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be sorry to be understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than he really has. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood.&quot; Miller&#x27;s response was, &quot;I always wondered why God made Bierce.&quot;

Called the &quot;Poet of the Sierras&quot; and the &quot;Byron of the Rockies&quot;, he may have been more of a celebrity in England than in his native U.S. Much of his reputation, however, came not from his poetry but from the image he created for himself by capitalizing on the stereotypical image of Western frontiersmen. As poet Bayard Taylor bitterly noted in 1876, British audiences &quot;place the simulated savagery of Joaquin Miller beside the pure and serene muse of Longfellow.&quot; Critics made much of Miller&#x27;s poor spelling and rhymes; he once rhymed &quot;Goethe&quot; and &quot;teeth&quot;. Henry Cuyler Bunner satirized the error in a poem titled &quot;Shake, Mulleary, and Go-ethe&quot;. Miller himself once admitted, &quot;I&#x27;m damned if I could tell the difference between a hexameter and a pentameter to save my scalp.&quot;

The &quot;Westminster Review&quot; referred to Miller&#x27;s poetry as &quot;Whitman without the coarseness&quot;. For a time, Miller&#x27;s poem &quot;Columbus&quot; was one of the most widely known American poems, memorized and recited by legions of schoolchildren. Miller is remembered today, among other reasons, for lines from his poem in honor of &quot;Burns and Byron&quot;:

:In men whom men condemn as ill
::I find so much of goodness still.
:In men whom men pronounce divine
::I find so much of sin and blot
:I do not dare to draw a line
::Between the two, where God has not.

==Legacy==

A historical marker for his birthplace was unveiled October 10, 1915, on U.S. 27 north of Liberty in Union County, Indiana. Joaquin Miller Cabin is located in Washington, DC. The Hights, the Oakland home Miller built at the end of his life, was purchased by the city of Oakland in 1919, and is known as the Joaquin Miller House, located in Joaquin Miller Park. It is a designated California Historical Landmark. He planted the surrounding trees and he personally built, on the eminence to the north, his own funeral pyre and monuments dedicated to Moses, General John C. Frémont, and the poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Several schools in California are named for him, including Miller Middle School in San Jose, Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Oakland, and Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Burbank.

Joaquin Miller is portrayed by Sean McClory in the &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; 13th season episode &quot;Magic Locket&quot;, which portrays Ina Coolbrith and the love of her life.
Actor George Paulsin portrayed a youthful Joaquin Miller in the &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; episode &quot;Early Candle Lighten&quot;, hosted by Dale Robertson. The episode, which aired April 24, 1970, marked Paulsin&#x27;s first screen appearance and the last of the series&#x27; 452 episodes. In the story line, a cook at a gold camp in the Arizona Territory faces hanging for stealing nuggets from the miners. His assistant, &quot;Nat Miller&quot;, played by Paulsin, thinks he can save his life by bringing the cook&#x27;s sister from Tucson. It was at this gold camp that Miller perfected his penchant for western poetry.

In the 1978 British miniseries &quot;Lillie&quot;, actor Bruce Boa as Miller startles guests when Lillie Langtry arrives at a ball by scattering rose petals in her path.

In 2012, artist Mark Oliver created a large statue called &quot;Joaquin&#x27;s Book&quot; in Hoo Hoo Park in McCloud, California. The location is near where Miller lived with the Wintus.

<text>Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus is a 1995 American drama film directed by Stephen Herek, produced by Ted Field, Robert W. Cort, and Michael Nolin, and written by Patrick Sheane Duncan. The film stars Richard Dreyfuss in the title role of Glenn Holland, a dedicated high-school music teacher who attempts to compose his own music while struggling to balance his job and life with his wife and profoundly deaf son. The cast also includes Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, and Jay Thomas.

The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay in 1995. Richard Dreyfuss received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Plot==
In the fall of 1964, 30-year-old Glenn Holland is a successful and talented musician and composer from Portland, Oregon. He switches gears, taking a position as a music teacher at John F. Kennedy High School so that he can spend more time with his young wife Iris and work on his symphony. The film covers his 30-year teaching career, set amongst the changes in American society.

Holland at first struggles in his new job, but learns how to connect with his students by using rock and roll and other popular music to convince them that music is a fun and worthwhile pursuit. He becomes a popular teacher at the school and rises to the task of creating a school marching band with help from the football coach, Bill Meister, with whom he becomes lifelong friends. Holland persuades principal Helen Jacobs to maintain funding for the school&#x27;s arts programs, despite a shrinking budget and the objections of vice principal Gene Wolters.

The time Holland devotes to his classes, the marching band, orchestra, productions and mentoring both struggling and talented students leaves him little time to work on his symphony, or to spend with his family. When his son, Cole, is found to be deaf, he is severely disappointed that he will never be able to share his love of music. He fails to learn American Sign Language properly, leaving him unable to communicate with his son and creating a rift between him and Iris, who has to raise Cole mostly by herself. As the years progress, Holland grows closer to his students at Kennedy High and more distant from his own son. An argument with his teenage son finally makes Holland realize the error of his ways and he learns to communicate with his son and help him visualize the music he can&#x27;t hear, and repairs his relationship with his wife.

In 1995, Wolters (who is now the principal) shuts down the school&#x27;s arts programs, citing further cuts from the Education Board and the need to prioritize reading, writing and math, and Holland is laid off as a result. Holland makes an impassioned plea to the Board to no avail and becomes despondent, believing that his teaching career has amounted to nothing. On his last day, Holland&#x27;s wife and son, now a teacher himself, help him clear out his office and quietly leave the otherwise empty school. Passing the auditorium, Holland finds it is packed full of current and former students who greet him with a standing ovation. Gertrude Lang, a struggling clarinetist from Holland&#x27;s first year teaching, now Governor of Oregon, gives a speech praising Mr. Holland, that his legacy is more than just the symphony; it is all the people he has helped and influenced, all the lives he has touched, over 30 years. She joins past members of the school&#x27;s orchestra, who have been practicing the symphony in secret, on stage. Mr. Holland conducts them in its premiere performance.

===Box office===
In the United States, gross domestic takings totaled US$82,569,971. International takings are estimated at US$23,700,000, for a gross worldwide takings of $106,269,971. Rental totals reached $36,550,000 in the US. Although the film is included among 1995 box-office releases (it ranks as the 14th-most successful film of that year), it was released in only a few theatres in New York and Los Angeles on December 29, 1995, because Disney felt, accurately, that Richard Dreyfuss&#x27; performance had a good chance of getting an Oscar nomination if it beat that year&#x27;s in-theatre deadline.

===Critical===
&quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; holds a 76% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating from 29 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A feel-good story brought to life by a terrific ensemble cast, &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; plucks the heartstrings without shame -- and with undeniable skill.&quot; CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film review cited Dreyfuss for &quot;a warm and really touching performance&quot;; &quot;Variety&quot; also called his performance &quot;quite effective and surprisingly restrained&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; further noted the &quot;nostalgic aura&quot; that permeates the film, &quot;which encourages viewers to think fondly of — and pay tribute to — the one teacher in their lives who made a difference&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars, commending its starring and supporting casts and agreeing with the film&#x27;s message of the ability of high school teachers to inspire their students, as well as the importance of cultural offerings on the curriculum.

Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards. Dreyfuss was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.

<text>Nixon is a 1995 American epic historical drama film directed by Oliver Stone, produced by Stone, Clayton Townsend, and Andrew G. Vajna, and written by Stone, Christopher Wilkinson, and Stephen J. Rievele, with significant contributions from &quot;project consultants&quot; Christopher Scheer and Robert Scheer. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins.

The film portrays Nixon as a complex and in many respects admirable, albeit deeply flawed, person. &quot;Nixon&quot; begins with a disclaimer that the film is &quot;an attempt to understand the truth ... based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete historical record&quot;. The cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, Annabeth Gish, Marley Shelton, Bai Ling, Powers Boothe, J. T. Walsh, E. G. Marshall, Sam Waterston, James Woods, Paul Sorvino, Bob Hoskins, Larry Hagman, Ed Harris and David Hyde Pierce, plus archival appearances from political figures such as President Bill Clinton in television footage from the Nixon funeral service.

The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, with Hopkins&#x27; performance receiving particular praise. Despite this, the film grossed only $13.6 million domestically against a $44 million budget, making it one of the biggest box-office bombs of 1995. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Supporting Actress (Joan Allen), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Original Screenplay. This was Stone&#x27;s second of three films about the presidents of America, after &quot;JFK&quot;, which was about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and &quot;W.&quot;, which was about George W. Bush.

==Plot==
In 1972, the White House Plumbers break into The Watergate and are subsequently arrested. Eighteen months later in December 1973, Richard Nixon&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig, brings Nixon audio tapes for Nixon to listen to. The two men discuss the Watergate scandal and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon uses profanity when discussing John Dean, James McCord, and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he has not been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier.

A majority of the movie is told through flashbacks of Nixon&#x27;s tapes. Nixon starts the taping system, which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972, about one week after the break-in, during a meeting with H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Dean. Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the &quot;smoking gun&quot; tape to Haldeman.

Henry Kissinger figures prominently in the film, beginning as a respected professor and later as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State. Throughout the film, there is a battle with Nixon and his staff over who Kissinger actually is—is he a leaker who only cares about his reputation in the press, or is he a loyal subject who follows the president&#x27;s orders? Although many cabinet members blame Kissinger for the leaks, Nixon cannot turn his back on him.

While at the height of his political career, Nixon thinks back to childhood and how his parents raised him and his brothers. Two of his brothers died of tuberculosis at a young age and this deeply impacted the president. The film covers most aspects of Nixon&#x27;s life and political career and implies that he and his wife abused alcohol and prescription medications. Nixon&#x27;s health problems, including his bout of phlebitis and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis, are also shown; his heavy use of medications is sometimes attributed to these.

The film hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the John F. Kennedy assassination through references to the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his 8-year term as Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and eventually Watergate.

The film ends with Nixon&#x27;s resignation and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, Army One. Real-life footage of Nixon&#x27;s state funeral in Yorba Linda, California plays out over the extended end credits, and all living ex-presidents at the time—Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush—as well then-president Bill Clinton, are shown in attendance.

==Production==
===Origins===
Eric Hamburg, former speechwriter and staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, got the idea of a film about Nixon after having dinner with Oliver Stone. Originally, Oliver Stone had been developing two projects – the musical &quot;Evita&quot; and a movie about Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. When neither was made, Stone turned his attention to a biopic about Richard Nixon. The former President&#x27;s death on April 22, 1994, was also a key factor in Stone&#x27;s decision to make a Nixon film. He pitched the film to Warner Bros., but, according to Stone, they saw it, &quot;as a bunch of unattractive older white men sitting around in suits, with a lot of dialogue and not enough action&quot;.

In 1993, Hamburg mentioned the idea of a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician&#x27;s misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment in November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as &quot;the Beast&quot;, which Wilkinson describes as &quot;a headless monster that lurches through postwar history,&quot; a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, and helped Nixon&#x27;s rise to power and his fall from it as well. Stone said in an interview that Nixon realizes that &quot;the Beast&quot; &quot;is more powerful than he is. We can&#x27;t get into it that much, but we hint at it so many times—the military-industrial complex, the forces of money&quot;. In another interview, the director elaborates,
 It was this concept that convinced Stone to make &quot;Nixon&quot; and he told Hamburg to hire Rivele and Wilkinson. Stone commissioned the first draft of the film&#x27;s screenplay in the fall of 1993. Rivele and Wilkinson delivered the first draft of their script on June 17, 1994, the anniversary of the Watergate scandal. Stone loved the script but felt that the third act and the ending needed more work. They wrote another draft and delivered it on August 9, the 20th anniversary of Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

===Pre-production===
Stone immersed himself in research with the help of Hamburg. With Hamburg and actors Hopkins and James Woods, Stone flew to Washington, D.C., and interviewed the surviving members of Nixon&#x27;s inner circle: lawyer Leonard Garment and Attorney General Elliot Richardson. He also interviewed Robert McNamara, a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired Alexander Butterfield, a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant to make sure that the Oval Office was realistically depicted, former deputy White House counsel John Sears, and John Dean, who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film. Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact John Ehrlichman because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed. Hopkins watched a lot of documentary footage on Nixon. At night, he would go to sleep with the Nixon footage playing, letting it seep into his subconscious. Hopkins said, &quot;It&#x27;s taking in all this information and if you&#x27;re relaxed enough, it begins to take you over.&quot;

Stone originally had a three-picture deal with Regency Enterprises which included &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;, and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. After the success of &quot;Killers&quot;, Arnon Milchan, head of Regency, signed Stone for three more motion pictures. Stone could make any film up to a budget of $42.5 million. When Stone told Milchan that he wanted to make &quot;Nixon&quot;, Milchan, who was not keen on the idea, told the director that he would only give him $35 million, thinking that this would cause Stone to abandon the project. Stone took the project to Hungarian financier Andrew G. Vajna who had co-financing deal with Disney. Vajna&#x27;s company, Cinergi Pictures, were willing to finance the $38 million film. This angered Milchan who claimed that &quot;Nixon&quot; was his film because of his three-picture deal with Stone and he threatened to sue. He withdrew after Stone paid him an undisclosed amount. Stone was finalizing the film&#x27;s budget a week before shooting was to begin. He made a deal with Cinergi and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Pictures in order to supply the $43 million budget. To cut costs, Stone leased the White House sets from Rob Reiner&#x27;s film &quot;The American President&quot;.

===Casting===
The studio did not like Stone&#x27;s choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson – two of Stone&#x27;s original choices. The director also considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but Beatty declined as he felt that &quot;Nixon was not treated compassionately&quot;. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; and &quot;Shadowlands&quot;. Of Hopkins, Stone said, &quot;The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon.&quot; When the actor met the director he got the impression that Stone was &quot;one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away.&quot; What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and &quot;impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film when he talks about his mother and father. That affected me.&quot; Hopkins wore a hair piece and false teeth &quot;to hint at a physical resemblance to Nixon&quot;.

When Beatty was thinking about doing the film, he insisted on doing a reading of the script with an actress and Joan Allen was flown in from New York City. Afterwards, Beatty told Stone that he had found his Pat Nixon.

===Principal photography===
The film began shooting on May 1, 1995, but there was a week of pre-shooting at the end of April to film scenes that would be used as part of a mock documentary about Nixon&#x27;s career. Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, &quot;There were moments when I wanted to get out, when I wanted to just do a nice &quot;Knots Landing&quot; or something.&quot; Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims he told Hopkins that he thought &quot;there was room for improvement&quot; and that he would be willing to help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was &quot;doing the whole thing wrong&quot; and that he was an &quot;expert&quot; who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, &quot;I&#x27;d always tell him how great he was in &quot;Psycho&quot;. I&#x27;d call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins.&quot;

In Spring of 1994, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that an early draft of the screenplay linked Nixon to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The facts contained in the script were based on research from various sources, including documents, transcripts and hours of footage from the Nixon White House. Dean said about the film&#x27;s accuracy: &quot;In the larger picture, it reflected accurately what happened.&quot; Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, &quot;The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, it was based on research and interpretation.&quot; John Taylor, head of the Nixon Presidential Library, leaked a copy of the script to Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, who threatened to sue the production. In response, Stone cut out all scenes with Helms from the theatrical print and claimed that he did for &quot;artistic reasons&quot; only to reinstate this footage on the home video release.

During the post-production phase, Stone had his editors in three different rooms with the scenes from the film revolving from one room to another, &quot;depending on how successful they were&quot;. If one editor wasn&#x27;t successful with a scene then it went to another. Stone said that it was &quot;the most intense post- I&#x27;ve ever done, even more intense than &quot;JFK&quot;&quot; because they were screening the film three times a week, making changes in 48–72 hours, rescreening the film and then making another 48 hours of changes.

===Music===

The score was composed by John Williams, who previously worked with Stone on &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; and &quot;JFK&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;Nixon&quot; grossed a total of $2.2 million in 514 theaters in the United States and Canada. The film grossed a total of $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, less than its $44 million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Nixon&quot; has a 75% approval rating, based reviews from 63 critics, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Much like its subject&#x27;s time in office, &quot;Nixon&quot; might have ended sooner—but what remains is an engrossing, well-acted look at the rise and fall of a fascinating political figure.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 66 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A+ to F.
Two days before the film was released in theaters, the Richard Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda, California issued a statement on behalf of the Nixon family, calling parts of the film &quot;reprehensible&quot; and that it was designed to &quot;defame and degrade President and Mrs. Nixon&#x27;s memories in the mind of the American public.&quot; This statement was based on a published copy of the script. The statement also criticized Stone&#x27;s depiction of Nixon&#x27;s private life, that of his childhood, and his part in planning the assassination of Fidel Castro. Stone responded that his &quot;purpose in making the film, &quot;Nixon&quot; was neither malicious nor defamatory&quot;, and was an attempt to gain &quot;a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon – the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world.&quot; Walt Disney&#x27;s daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Nixon&#x27;s daughters saying that Stone had &quot;committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history.&quot; Stone does not see his film as the definitive statement on Nixon but as &quot;a basis to start reading, to start investigating on your own.&quot;

Some critics took Stone to task for portraying Nixon as an alcoholic, though Stone says that was based on information from books by Stephen Ambrose, Fawn Brodie, and Tom Wicker. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for how it took &quot;on the resonance of classic tragedy. Tragedy requires the fall of a hero, and one of the achievements of &quot;Nixon&quot; is to show that greatness was within his reach.&quot; Ebert also placed the film on his list of the top ten films of the year. Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Anthony Hopkins&#x27; performance and &quot;his character&#x27;s embattled outlook and stiff, hunched body language with amazing skill.&quot;

Mick LaSalle in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, felt that &quot;the problem here isn&#x27;t accuracy. It&#x27;s absurdity. Hopkins&#x27; exaggerated portrayal of Nixon is the linchpin of a film that in its conception and presentation consistently veers into camp&quot;. Richard Corliss, in his review for &quot;Time&quot;, also had a problem with Hopkins&#x27; portrayal: &quot;Hopkins, though, is a failure. He finds neither the timbre of Nixon&#x27;s plummy baritone, with its wonderfully false attempts at intimacy, nor the stature of a career climber who, with raw hands, scaled the mountain and was still not high or big enough.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s gripping psychodrama — just don&#x27;t confuse &quot;Nixon&quot; with history.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Nixon&quot; No. 40 on their &quot;50 Best Biopics Ever&quot; list and one of the 25 &quot;Powerful Political Thrillers&quot;.

==Home media==
The theatrical cut of the film was released on DVD on June 15, 1999. A director&#x27;s cut was released on DVD as part of an Oliver Stone boxset in 2001, running 212 mins and including 28 minutes of previously deleted scenes. Much of the added time consists of two scenes: one in which Nixon meets with Central Intelligence Agency director Richard Helms (played by Sam Waterston) and another on Tricia Nixon&#x27;s wedding day, where J. Edgar Hoover persuades Nixon to install the taping system in the Oval Office. The Director&#x27;s Cut was released individually on DVD in 2002. The Director&#x27;s Cut was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (branded as Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment) on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 19, 2008, with the first anamorphic widescreen version of the film in North America.

<doc id="171079" wikidata="Q1339824" url="?curid=171079" title="Mindset">
<text>A mindset refers to an established set of attitudes of a person or group concerning culture, values, philosophy, frame of reference, outlook, or disposition. It may also arise from a person&#x27;s worldview or beliefs about the meaning of life. 

Some scholars claim that people can have multiple types of mindsets. Some of these types include a growth mindset, fixed mindset, poverty mindset, abundance mindset, and positive mindset among others that make up a person&#x27;s overall mindset.

More broadly, scholars have found that mindset is associated with a range of functional effects in different areas of people&#x27;s lives. This includes influencing a person&#x27;s capacity for perception by functioning like a filter, a frame of reference, a meaning-making system, and a pattern of perception. Mindset is described as shaping a person&#x27;s capacity for development by being associated with passive or conditional learning, incremental or horizontal learning, and transformative or vertical learning. Mindset is also believed to influence a person&#x27;s behavior, having deliberative or implemental action phases, as well as being associated with technical or adaptive approaches to leadership. 

A mindset could create an incentive to adopt (or accept) previous behaviors, choices, or tools, sometimes known as cognitive inertia or groupthink. When a prevailing mindset is limiting or inappropriate, it may be difficult to counteract the grip of mindset on analysis and decision-making.

In cognitive psychology, a mindset is the cognitive process activated in a task. In addition to the field of cognitive psychology, the study of mindset is evident in the social sciences and other fields (such as positive psychology). Characteristic of this area of study is its fragmentation among academic disciplines.

==History==
Numerous scholars have identified mindset history as being a critical gap in contemporary literature and also in current approaches to mindset education and training.

The first dedicated review of mindset history found that mindset psychology has a century-long history of explicit research and practice, with its origin phase taking place between 1908 and 1939, early inquiries occurring between 1940 and 1987, and contemporary bodies of work emerging in and beyond 1988. This review also identified some of the traditions of research and practice that are closely related to the origins and history of mindset psychology, some of which span back hundreds and thousands of years. Then, there are the lineages of research and practice that did not explicitly use the term mindset, but which bear some resemblance to it and are in some way related to this history.

==Research==
Mindset research is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry. Some of the earliest studies to explicitly include mindset as an area of focus were conducted in the 1910s and 1920s, primarily within a psychology and education context. This includes studies by scholars including Thaddeus Lincoln Bolton (1909), Edward Kellogg Strong and Margaret Hart Strong (1913), Edward Lee Thorndike (1913), Alexander James Inglis (1918), William Heard Kilpatrick (1921), and more.

Between the 1980s and 2000s, mindset research and its applications began to expand into other areas, including Glen Fisher’s (1988) studies in international relations, Ellen Langer’s (1989) research on mindfulness, Peter Gollwitzer’s (1989) psychology of action phases, Donella Meadows’ (1991) theory of systems change, Stephen Rhinesmith’s (1992) work on global mindsets, Ronald Heifetz’s (1994) practice of adaptive leadership, Carol Dweck’s (2006) concept of implicit theories, and Robert Kegan’s and Lisa Lahey’s (2009) theory of adult development.

In 2024, the first systematic reviews of the mindset field were published by researcher Ash Buchanan, exploring how mindset definitions, theories, and type-based classifications have changed over time and across various contexts. The findings from these reviews were published in the Handbook of Mindset Research. Buchanan also made a significant contribution to the field by presenting the first comprehensive view of mindset psychology based on a systematic study of the mindset research.

==Politics==
A political example is the &quot;Cold War mindset&quot; in the U.S. and the USSR. This mindset reflects how people globally perceived the levels of security between the two nations. This mindset suggested that if one nation grew in strength and power, the other was threatened and vice versa. The main goal of the Cold War Mindset was to strengthen one&#x27;s own nation&#x27;s military and alliances while keeping the other nation&#x27;s power limited. Also included in this mindset is the belief in game theory, in a chain of command in control of nuclear materials, and in the mutual assured destruction of both in a nuclear war. This mindset prevented an attack by either country, but deterrence theory has made assessments of the Cold War mindset a subject of controversy.

Modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in asymmetric warfare, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These threats are &quot;a revolution in military affairs&quot;, requiring rapid adaptation to new threats and circumstances.

==Systems theory==
Building on Magoroh Maruyama&#x27;s concept of mindscape, mindset includes a cultural and social orientation: hierarchical and egalitarian individualism, hierarchical and egalitarian collectivism, hierarchic and egalitarian synergism, and hierarchical and egalitarian populism.

==Collective mindset==
Collective mindsets are described in Edwin Hutchins&#x27;s &quot;Cognition in the Wild&quot; (1995) and Maximilian Senges&#x27; &quot;Knowledge Entrepreneurship in Universities&quot; (2007). Hutchins analyzed a team of naval navigators as a cognitive unit or computational system, and Senges explained how a collective mindset is part of university strategy and practice.

Parallels exist in collective intelligence and the wisdom of the crowd. Zara said that since collective reflection is more explicit, discursive, and conversational, it needs a good &quot;Gestell&quot;.

Erik H. Erikson&#x27;s analysis of group-identities and what he calls a &quot;life-plan&quot; is relevant to a collective mindset. Erikson cites Native Americans who were meant to undergo a reeducation process to instill a modern &quot;life-plan&quot; which advocated housing and wealth; the natives&#x27; collective historic identity as buffalo hunters was oriented around such fundamentally different motivations that communication about life plans was difficult.

An institution is related to collective mindset; an entrepreneurial mindset refers to a person who &quot;values uncertainty in the marketplace and seeks to continuously identify opportunities with the potential to lead to important innovations&quot;. An institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will have entrepreneurial goals and strategies. It fosters an entrepreneurial milieu, allowing each entity to pursue emerging opportunities. A collective mindset fosters values which lead to a particular practice. Hitt cites the five dimensions of an entrepreneurial mindset as &quot;autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness&quot;.

==Theories==
The study of mindsets includes definition, measurement, and categorization. Scholars in the same discipline differ.

=== Mindset agency ===
Sagiv and Schwarts defined cultural values to explain the nature, functions, and variables which characterize mindset agency. They posited three bipolar dimensions of culture, based on values: cognitive (embedded or autonomous), figurative (mastery or harmony), and operative (hierarchical or egalitarian).

=== Mindscape theory ===
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) measures psychological functions which, paired with social attitudes, combine to generate personality types that may be evaluated by exploring individual preferences. Maruyama&#x27;s mindscape theory measures individuals on a scale of characteristics and places them into one of four personality categories.

=== Fixed and growth mindsets ===
According to Carol Dweck, individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their views about where ability originates, from a fixed to a growth mindset. An individual&#x27;s mindset affects the &quot;motivation to practice and learn&quot;.

People with a fixed mindset believe that &quot;intelligence is static&quot;, and little can be done to improve ability. Feedback is seen as &quot;evaluation of their underlying ability&quot; and success is seen as a result of this ability, not any effort expended. Failure is intimidating, since it &quot;suggests constraints or limits they would not be able to overcome&quot;. Those with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenges, give up easily, and focus on the outcome. They believe that their abilities are fixed, and effort has little value.

Those with a growth mindset believe that &quot;intelligence can be developed&quot;, and their abilities can be increased by learning. They tend to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of adversity, accept and learn from failure, focus on process rather than outcome, and see abilities as skills which are developed through effort. Feedback and failure are seen as opportunities to increase ability, signaling the &quot;need to pay attention, invest effort, apply time to practice, and master the new learning opportunity&quot;.

Grit, a personality trait combining determination and perseverance, is related to a growth mindset. Keown and Bourke discussed the importance of a growth mindset and grit. Their 2019 study found that people with lower economic status had a greater chance of success if they had a growth mindset and were willing to work through tribulation.

Much of Dweck&#x27;s research was related to the effect of a student&#x27;s mindset on classroom performance. For students to develop a growth mindset, a nurturing classroom culture must be established with appropriate praise and encouragement. According to Dweck, &quot;Praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied, the strategies they used, the choices they made, the persistence they displayed, and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are &#x27;smart&#x27; when they succeed&quot;. Teachers need to design meaningful learning activities for their students: &quot;The teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting, while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain&quot;.

A second strategy to promote a growth mindset in the classroom is more explicit, establishing personal goals, and having students &quot;write about and share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at.&quot; Hinda Hussein studied the positive effect of reflective journal writing on students&#x27; growth mindset; journaling can improve a student&#x27;s conceptual knowledge and enhance the understanding of their thoughts. Dweck has identified the word &quot;yet&quot; as a valuable tool to assess learning. If a teacher hears students saying that they are not good at something or cannot do something, they should interject &quot;not yet&quot; to reinforce the idea that ability and motivation are fluid.

Dweck and Jo Boaler indicate a fixed mindset can lead to sex differences in education, which can partially explain low achievement and participation by minority and female students. Boaler builds on Dweck&#x27;s research to show that &quot;gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students&quot;. Boaler and Dweck say that people with growth mindsets can gain knowledge. Boaler said, &quot;The key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections, and that students control this process. The growth mindset intervention halted the students&#x27; decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement&quot;. 

L. S. Blackwell presented research in 2015 exploring whether growth mindsets can be promoted in minority groups. Blackwell builds on Dweck&#x27;s research, observing minority groups and finding that &quot;students with a growth mindset had stronger learning goals than the fixed mindset students.&quot; These students &quot;had much more positive attitudes toward effort, agreeing that &#x27;when something is hard, it just makes me want to work more on it, not less. Students with a fixed mindset were more likely to say that &quot;if you&#x27;re not good at a subject, working hard won&#x27;t make you good at it” and “when I work hard at something, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m not very smart&quot;.

Dweck&#x27;s research on growth and fixed mindsets is useful in intervening with at-risk students, dispelling negative stereotypes in education held by teachers and students, understanding the impacts of self-theories on resilience, and understanding how praise can foster a growth mindset and positively impact student motivation. There has also been movement towards the application of Dweck&#x27;s mindset research in non-academic environments, such as the workplace. Other scholars have conducted research building on her findings. A 2018 study by Rhew et al. suggested that a growth-mindset intervention can increase the motivation of adolescent special-education participants. A 2019 study by Wang et al. suggested that substance use has adverse effects on adolescent reasoning. Developing a growth mindset in these adolescents was shown to reduce this adverse effect. These studies illustrate how educators can intervene, encouraging a growth mindset, by allowing students to see that their behavior can be changed with effort. Criticism has been directed at &quot;growth mindset&quot; and related research, however. Moreau et al. (2019) suggest &quot;that overemphasizing the malleability of abilities and other traits can have negative consequences for individuals, science, and society.&quot;

Follow up research after the release of her book has led Dweck to be quoted as saying &quot;Nobody has a growth mindset in everything all the time.&quot; along with the acknowledgement of the reality of the false growth mindset, and the truer growth mindset. One of Dweck&#x27;s concerns being that educators were giving praise based on effort alone, when the results gained did not merit praise. Researchers noted adults within a study &quot;who agree with growth mindset, but do not behave as though they believe ability can change&quot; as holding a false growth mindset.

=== Students and teachers ===
Elements of personality (such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks) may predispose toward a particular mindset, which can be developed and reshaped through interactions. In a number of studies, Dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through &quot;praising the process through which success was achieved&quot;, &quot;having [college aged students] read compelling scientific articles that support one view or the other&quot;, or teaching junior-high-school students &quot;that every time they try hard and learn something new, their brain forms new connections that, over time, make them smarter.&quot;

Much research in education focuses on a student&#x27;s ability to adopt a growth mindset, and less attention is paid to teachers&#x27; mindsets and their influence on students. Hattie writes, &quot;Differing mindsets, or assumptions, that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations, teaching practices, and how students perceive their own mindset.&quot;

A study by Patrick and Joshi explored how teachers explain growth and fixed mindsets, with two major findings in 150 semi-structured interviews. First, they found that teachers&#x27; prior beliefs about learning and students influenced how they engaged with their mindsets. Second, they found that many teachers oversimplified growth and fixed mindsets as positive and negative traits.

A study conducted by Fiona S. Seaton (2018) examined the impact of teacher training to influence mindset. The teachers in this study had six training sessions, and Seaton found that the sessions had an impact on their mindsets which was sustained three months afterward. The results of this study suggest that adult mindsets are malleable, and can shift with appropriate supports.

=== Benefit mindset ===
In 2015, Ash Buchanan and Margaret L. Kern proposed a &quot;benefit mindset&quot;: an evolution of the fixed and growth mindsets. The benefit mindset describes society&#x27;s leaders, who promote individual and collective well-being: people who discover their strengths to contribute to causes greater than the self. They question why they do what they do, positioning their actions within a purposeful context.

=== Global mindset ===
Originating from the study of organizational leadership and coinciding with the growth of multinational corporations during the 1980s, organizations observed that executive effectiveness did not necessarily translate cross-culturally. A global mindset emerged as an explanation. Cross-cultural leaders were hypothesized to need an additional skill, ability, or proficiency (a global mindset) to be effective regardless of culture or context. Cultural agility refers to such a need. A defining characteristic of the study of global mindset is the variety with which scholars define it, but they typically agree that global mindset and its development increase global effectiveness for individuals and organizations.

=== Abundance and scarcity ===

People with an abundance mindset believe that there are enough resources for everyone, and see the glass as half-full; those with a scarcity mindset believe that there is a limited number of resources, and see the glass as half-empty. Mehta and Zhu found that an &quot;abundance mindset makes people think beyond established functionalities to explore broadly for solutions, thereby heightening creativity. In contrast, a scarcity mindset induces functional fixedness, thereby reducing creativity.&quot;

=== Productive and defensive mindsets ===
According to Chris Argyris, organizations have two dominant mindsets: productive and defensive. The productive mindset is hinged in logic, focused on knowledge and its certifiable resultsa decision-making mindset which is transparent and auditable.

The defensive mindset is closed, self-protective and self-deceptive. It does not see the greater good, but centers on individual defense; truth, if perceived as harmful to the person concerned, would be denied. This may allow personal growth, but no organizational growth or development.

=== Deliberative and implemental mindsets ===
The deliberative and implemental mindsets are part of the decision making process in goal setting and goal striving. When someone has a deliberative mindset, they are considering a variety of actions and have not yet settled on what they are going to do. This person will tend to be open to alternative options when presented and will explore ideas until they have decided upon a course of action. This mindset is connected to the idea of goal setting.

After someone narrows down their options and makes a commitment to follow a particular path, they will have an implemental mindset. People with an implemental mindset are less open to alternative courses of action because they have already decided what they are going to do and now focus more energy on goal striving, rather than goal setting.

The deliberative mindset has been recognized as important for coming to conclusions in order to make a well-planned goal, but it has negative consequences for goal striving once a goal is already in place. On the other hand, the implemental mindset helps people to focus their behavior in a particular direction; this can be detrimental for someone who has not spent sufficient time with a deliberative mindset.

=== Promotion and prevention mindsets ===
The promotion and prevention mindsets are motivational orientations that are focused on the outcomes or consequences of behavior. People with a promotion mindset focus on achievement and accomplishment. Those with a prevention mindset pay closer attention to avoiding negative outcomes. They act more out of a sense of obligation and the fulfillment of duty than to seek any sort of reward. Both of these mindsets can be caused or influenced by individual disposition or by environmental stimuli. Those who are dispositionally in a promotion mindset seek to make good things happen, and situations that encourage a promotion mindset are those in which there is a promise of gain. Those with a dispositional prevention mindset believe that they need to keep bad things from happening, and situations conducive to the prevention mindset are those in which the idea of duty is emphasized.

Those with a promotion mindset are characterized as being eager and quick to act. They take initiative and move to cause improvements towards their ideal state. People with a prevention mindset are characterized as being cautious and careful, avoiding risks and any course of action that could potentially cause failure in reaching a goal.

==Criticism==
In 2019 a larger randomized controlled trial by the Education Endowment Foundation for growth mindset training showed no significant increase in numeracy or literacy. A 2024 study showed that growth mindset scales by Carol Dweck have psychometric comparability, however this study showed no connection between growth mindset and goal achievement.

<doc id="171080" wikidata="Q2267955" url="?curid=171080" title="Music of the United States">
<text>The United States&#x27; multi-ethnic population is reflected through a diverse array of styles of music. It is a mixture of music influenced by the music of Europe, Indigenous peoples, West Africa, Latin America, Middle East, North Africa, amongst many other places. The country&#x27;s most internationally renowned genres are traditional pop, jazz, blues, country, bluegrass, rock, rock and roll, R&amp;B, pop, hip-hop/rap, soul, funk, religious, disco, house, techno, ragtime, doo-wop, folk, americana, boogaloo, tejano, surf, and salsa, amongst many others. American music is heard around the world. Since the beginning of the 20th century, some forms of American popular music have gained a near global audience.

Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, settlers from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. Enslaved people from West Africa brought their musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.

There are also some African-American influences in the musical tradition of the European-American settlers, such as jazz, blues, rock, country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others.

Many American cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Musical centers around the country have all have produced and contributed to the many distinctive styles of American music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples of diversity in American music.

==Characteristics==
The music of the United States can be characterized by the use of syncopation and asymmetrical rhythms, long, irregular melodies, which are said to &quot;reflect the wide open geography of (the American landscape)&quot; and the &quot;sense of personal freedom characteristic of American life&quot;. Some distinct aspects of American music, like the call-and-response format, are derived from African techniques and instruments.

Throughout the later part of American history, and into modern times, the relationship between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music. Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles. Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War &quot;the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first &#x27;American&#x27; sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country.&quot;

The Civil War, and the period following it, saw a general flowering of American art, literature and music. Amateur musical ensembles of this era can be seen as the birth of American popular music. Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining &quot;the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique, eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression. If it was vocal music, the words would be in English, despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language. In a way, it was part of the entire awakening of America that happened after the Civil War, a time in which American painters, writers, and &#x27;serious&#x27; composers addressed specifically American themes.&quot; During this period the roots of blues, gospel, jazz, and country music took shape; in the 20th century, these became the core of American popular music, which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip hop music.

===Social identity===
Music intertwines with aspects of American social and cultural identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race is perhaps the most potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled with European styles and instruments, leading to the creation of new genres and self expression from enslaved people. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and has long been perceived as a form of white music.

Economic and social classes separates American music through the creation and consumption of music, such as the upper-class patronage of symphony-goers, and the generally poor performers of rural and ethnic folk musics. Musical divisions based on class are not absolute, however, and are sometimes as much perceived as actual; popular American country music, for example, is a commercial genre designed to &quot;appeal to a working-class identity, whether or not its listeners are actually working class&quot;. Country music is also intertwined with geographic identity, and is specifically rural in origin and function; other genres, like R&amp;B and hip hop, are perceived as inherently urban. For much of American history, music-making has been a &quot;feminized activity&quot;. In the 19th century, amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle- and upper-class women. Women were also a major part of early popular music performance, though recorded traditions quickly become more dominated by men. Most male-dominated genres of popular music include female performers as well, often in a niche appealing primarily to women; these include gangsta rap and heavy metal.

==History==

==Diversity==

The United States is often said to be a cultural melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music can be traced back to specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.

The process of transplanting music between cultures is not without criticism. The folk revival of the mid-20th century, for example, appropriated the musics of various rural peoples, in part to promote certain political causes, which has caused some to question whether the process caused the &quot;commercial commodification of other peoples&#x27; songs ... and the inevitable dilution of mean&quot; in the appropriated musics. The use of African American musical techniques, images, and conceits in popular music largely by and for white Americans has been widespread since at least the mid-19th century songs of Stephen Foster and the rise of minstrel shows. The American music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of African American music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle-class Americans. This process has been related to the rise of stars as varied as Benny Goodman, Eminem, and Elvis Presley, as well as popular styles like blue-eyed soul and rockabilly.

==Folk music==
Folk music in the US is varied across the country&#x27;s numerous ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles and instruments were brought to the Americas. By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, Klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music.

The Native Americans played the first folk music in what is now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near universal among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.

The Thirteen Colonies of the original United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as the music of the Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.

The ancestors of today&#x27;s African American population were brought to the United States as slaves, working primarily in the plantations of the South. They were from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and they brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complexly rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans &quot;retain continuity with their past through music&quot;. The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, field hollers and, following Christianization, hymns. In the 19th century, a Great Awakening of religious fervor gripped people across the country, especially in the South. Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called Negro spirituals. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs, and field hollers, that blues, jazz, and gospel developed.

===Blues and spirituals===
Spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations. In the mid to late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. In imitation of this group, gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, from whence came the popular style of gospel music.
Blues is a combination of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the rural South in the first decade of the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.

===Other immigrant communities===
The United States is a melting pot consisting of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music. Some nationalities have produced local scenes in regions of the country where they have clustered, like Cape Verdean music in New England, Armenian music in California, and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City.

The Creoles are a community with varied non-Anglo ancestry, mostly descendant of people who lived in Louisiana before its purchase by the U.S. The Cajuns are a group of Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana, being a major port, has acted as a melting pot for people from all over the Caribbean basin. The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun music and Creole music.

Spain and subsequently Mexico controlled much of what is now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.

==Classical music==
Classical music was brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European classical music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on what is known as the common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.

===Early classical music===

During the colonial era, there were two distinct fields of what is now considered classical music. One was associated with amateur composers and pedagogues, whose style was originally drawn from simple hymns and gained sophistication over time. The other colonial tradition was that of the mid-Atlantic cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore, which produced a number of prominent composers who worked almost entirely within the European model; these composers were mostly English in origin, and worked specifically in the style of prominent English composers of the day.

Classical music was brought to the United States during the colonial era. Many American composers of this period worked exclusively with European models, while others, such as Supply Belcher and Justin Morgan, also known as the &quot;First New England School&quot;, developed a style almost entirely independent of European models. Among the country&#x27;s earliest composers was William Billings who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s; he was also influential &quot;as the founder of the American church choir, as the first musician to use a pitch pipe, and as the first to introduce a violoncello into church service&quot;. Many of these composers were amateur singers who developed new forms of sacred music suitable for performance by amateurs, and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary European standards. These composers&#x27; styles were untouched by &quot;the influence of their sophisticated European contemporaries&quot;, using modal or pentatonic scales or melodies and eschewing the European rules of harmony.

In the early 19th century, America produced diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style and was the first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine&#x27;s example inspired the composers of the &quot;Second New England School&quot;, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.

Louis Moreau Gottschalk is perhaps the best-remembered American composer of the 19th century, said by music historian Richard Crawford to be known for &quot;bringing indigenous or folk, themes and rhythms into music for the concert hall&quot;. Gottschalk&#x27;s music reflected the cultural mix of his home city, New Orleans, Louisiana, which was home to a variety of Latin, Caribbean, African American, Cajun, and Creole music. He was well acknowledged as a talented pianist in his lifetime, and was also a known composer who remains admired though little performed.

===20th century===
The New York classical music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were strongly influenced by jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin&#x27;s work made American classical music more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, he turned to the ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.

Many of the later 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, John Adams, and Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich discovered a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.

==Popular music==

The United States has produced many popular musicians and composers in the modern world. Beginning with the birth of recorded music, American performers have continued to lead the field of popular music, which out of &quot;all the contributions made by Americans to world culture... has been taken to heart by the entire world&quot;. Most histories of popular music start with American ragtime or Tin Pan Alley; others, however, trace &quot;popular music&quot; to the Renaissance and through broadsheets, ballads, and other popular traditions. Other authors typically look at popular sheet music, tracing &quot;American popular music&quot; to spirituals, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and the patriotic songs of the Civil War.

===Early popular song===


The patriotic lay songs of the American Revolution constituted the first kind of mainstream popular music. These included &quot;The Liberty Tree&quot; by Thomas Paine. Cheaply printed as broadsheets, early patriotic songs spread across the colonies and were performed at home and at public meetings. Fife songs were especially celebrated, and were performed on fields of battle during the American Revolution. The longest lasting of these fife songs is &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, still well known today. The melody dates back to 1755 and was sung by both American and British troops. Patriotic songs were based mostly on English melodies, with new lyrics added to denounce British colonialism; others, however, used tunes from Ireland, Scotland or elsewhere, or did not utilize a familiar melody. The song &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; was a major work that remained an unofficial national anthem until the adoption of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Much of this early American music still survives in Sacred Harp. Although relatively unknown outside of Shaker Communities, Simple Gifts was written in 1848 by Elder Joseph Brackett and the tune has since become internationally famous.

During the Civil War, when soldiers from across the country commingled, the multifarious strands of American music began to cross-fertilize each other, a process that was aided by the burgeoning railroad industry and other technological developments that made travel and communication easier. Army units included individuals from across the country, and they rapidly traded tunes, instruments and techniques. The war was an impetus for the creation of distinctly American songs that became and remained wildly popular. The most popular songs of the Civil War era included &quot;Dixie&quot;, written by Daniel Decatur Emmett. The song, originally titled &quot;Dixie&#x27;s Land&quot;, was made for the closing of a minstrel show; it spread to New Orleans first, where it was published and became &quot;one of the great song successes of the pre-Civil War period&quot;. In addition to popular patriotic songs, the Civil War era also produced a great body of brass band pieces.
Following the Civil War, minstrel shows became the first distinctively American form of music expression. The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in blackface. Minstrel shows used African American elements in musical performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism. The minstrel show was invented by Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels. Minstrel shows produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After minstrel shows&#x27; popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular.

The composer John Philip Sousa is closely associated with the most popular trend in American popular music just before the start of the 20th century. Formerly the bandmaster of the United States Marine Band, Sousa wrote military marches like &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; that reflected his &quot;nostalgia for [his] home and country&quot;, giving the melody a &quot;stirring virile character&quot;.

In the early 20th century, American musical theater was a major source for popular songs, many of which influenced blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.

===Blues and gospel===


The blues is a genre of African American folk music that is the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music. Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like Thomas A. Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.
Ragtime was originally a piano style, featuring syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms. It is primarily a form of dance music utilizing the walking bass, and is generally composed in sonata form. Ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the African American cakewalk dance, mixed with styles ranging from European marches and popular songs to jigs and other dances played by large African American bands in northern cities during the end of the 19th century. The most famous ragtime performer and composer was Scott Joplin, known for works such as &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;.

Blues became a part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record companies launched the field of race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta blues musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont blues musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm &amp; blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson. The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, as well as in the 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country blues musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas.

===Jazz===
Jazz is a kind of music characterized by swung and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Though originally a kind of dance music, jazz has been a major part of popular music, and has also become a major element of Western classical music. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Early jazz was closely related to ragtime, with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation. The earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues, including bent and blue notes and instrumental &quot;growls&quot; and smears otherwise not used on European instruments. Jazz&#x27;s roots come from the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, populated by Cajuns and black Creoles, who combined the French-Canadian culture of the Cajuns with their own styles of music in the 19th century. Large Creole bands that played for funerals and parades became a major basis for early jazz, which spread from New Orleans to Chicago and other northern urban centers.
Though jazz had long since achieved some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who became one of the first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called &quot;swing&quot;. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley. Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance.

Jazz influenced many performers of all the major styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such a major part of American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th-century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as Miles Davis. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres, beginning with bebop. Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody, and use of the flatted fifth. Bebop was developed in the early and mid-1940s, later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz. Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City.

===Country music===

Country music is primarily a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country, then known as &quot;hillbilly music&quot;. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as &quot;country and western&quot; and then simply &quot;country&quot;. The earliest country instrumentation revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added. String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century.

The roots of commercial country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. Popular success was very limited, though a small demand spurred some commercial recording. After World War II, there was increased interest in specialty styles like country music, producing a few major pop stars. The most influential country musician of the era was Hank Williams, a bluesy country singer from Alabama. He remains renowned as one of country music&#x27;s greatest songwriters and performers, viewed as a &quot;folk poet&quot; with a &quot;honky-tonk swagger&quot; and &quot;working-class sympathies&quot;. Throughout the decade the roughness of honky-tonk gradually eroded as the Nashville sound grew more pop-oriented. Producers like Chet Atkins created the Nashville sound by stripping the hillbilly elements of the instrumentation and using smooth instrumentation and advanced production techniques. Eventually, most records from Nashville were in this style, which began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs.

By the early part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become perceived as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best-selling performers in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.

===Soul, R&amp;B and funk===

R&amp;B, an abbreviation for &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;, is a style that arose in the 1930s and 1940s. Early R&amp;B consisted of large rhythm units &quot;smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections&quot;. R&amp;B was not extensively recorded and promoted because record companies felt that it was not suited for most audiences, especially middle-class whites, because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms. Bandleaders like Louis Jordan innovated the sound of early R&amp;B, using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation. 

By the end of the 1940s, he had had several hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like Wynonie Harris and John Lee Hooker. Many of the most popular R&amp;B songs were not performed in the rollicking style of Jordan and his contemporaries; instead they were performed by white musicians like Pat Boone in a more palatable mainstream style, which turned into pop hits. By the end of the 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues rock and country-influenced R&amp;B performers like Chuck Berry gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners.
Motown Records became highly successful during the early and mid-1960s for producing music of black American roots that defied racial segregation in the music industry and consumer market. Music journalist Jerry Wexler (who coined the phrase &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;) once said of Motown: &quot;[They] did something that you would have to say on paper is impossible. They took black music and beamed it directly to the white American teenager.&quot; Berry Gordy founded Motown in 1959 in Detroit, Michigan. It was one of few R&amp;B record labels that sought to transcend the R&amp;B market (which was definitively black in the American mindset) and specialize in crossover music. The company emerged as the leading producer (or &quot;assembly line,&quot; a reference to its motor-town origins) of black popular music by the early 1960s and marketed its products as &quot;The Motown Sound&quot; or &quot;The Sound of Young America&quot;—which combined elements of soul, funk, disco and R&amp;B. Notable Motown acts include the Four Tops, the Temptations, the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Jackson 5. Visual representation was central to Motown&#x27;s rise; they placed greater emphasis on visual media than other record labels. Many people&#x27;s first exposure to Motown was by television and film. Motown artists&#x27; image of successful black Americans who held themselves with grace and aplomb broadcast a distinct form of middle-class blackness to audiences, which was particularly appealing to whites.

Soul music is a combination of rhythm and blues and gospel which began in the late 1950s in the United States. It is characterized by its use of gospel-music devices, with a greater emphasis on vocalists and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul. Charles&#x27; &quot;Modern Sounds&quot; (1962) records featured a fusion of soul and country music, country soul, and crossed racial barriers in music at the time. One of Cooke&#x27;s most well-known songs &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; (1964) became accepted as a classic and an anthem of the American Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. According to AllMusic, James Brown was critical, through &quot;the gospel-impassioned fury of his vocals and the complex polyrhythms of his beats&quot;, in &quot;two revolutions in black American music. He was one of the figures most responsible for turning R&amp;B into soul and he was, most would agree, the figure most responsible for turning soul music into the funk of the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s.&quot;

Pure soul was popularized by Otis Redding and the other artists of Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee. By the late 1960s, Atlantic recording artist Aretha Franklin had emerged as the most popular female soul star in the country. Known for singing in a wide variety of genres, Franklin is considered one of the all-time greatest American singers. Also by this time, soul had splintered into several genres, influenced by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the 1960s inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release albums with hard-hitting social commentary, while another variety became more dance-oriented music, evolving into funk. Despite his previous affinity with politically and socially-charged lyrical themes, Gaye helped popularize sexual and romance-themed music and funk, while his 70s recordings, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (1973) and &quot;I Want You&quot; (1976) helped develop the quiet storm sound and format. One of the most influential albums ever recorded, Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) has been considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in the group&#x27;s earlier work. Artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and The Last Poets practiced an eclectic blend of poetry, jazz-funk, and soul, featuring critical political and social commentary with afrocentric sentiment. Scott-Heron&#x27;s Proto-rap work, including &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; (1971) and &quot;Winter in America&quot; (1974), has had a considerable impact on later hip hop artists, while his unique sound with Brian Jackson influenced neo soul artists.

During the mid-1970s, highly slick and commercial bands such as Philly soul group The O&#x27;Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall &amp; Oates achieved mainstream success. By the end of the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, had been disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called &quot;R&amp;B&quot;, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as &quot;contemporary R&amp;B&quot;.

The first contemporary R&amp;B stars arose in the 1980s, with the dance-pop star Michael Jackson, funk-influenced singer Prince, and a wave of female vocalists like Tina Turner and Whitney Houston. Michael Jackson and Prince have been described as the most influential figures in contemporary R&amp;B and popular music because of their eclectic use of elements from a variety of genres. Prince was largely responsible for creating the Minneapolis sound: &quot;a blend of horns, guitars, and electronic synthesizers supported by a steady, bouncing rhythm.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s work focused on smooth balladry or disco-influenced dance music; as an artist, he &quot;pulled dance music out of the disco doldrums with his 1979 adult solo debut, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, merged R&amp;B with rock on &quot;Thriller&quot;, and introduced stylized steps such as the robot and moonwalk over the course of his career.&quot; Jackson is often recognized as the &quot;King of Pop&quot; for his achievements.

By 1983, the concept of popular music crossover became inextricably associated with Michael Jackson. &quot;Thriller&quot; saw unprecedented success, selling over 10 million copies in the United States alone. By 1984, the album captured over 140 gold and platinum awards and was recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the best-selling record of all-time, a title it still holds today. MTV&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was the first for any black artist, thereby breaking the &quot;color barrier&quot; of pop music on the small screen. &quot;Thriller&quot; remains the only music video recognized by the National Film Registry.
Janet Jackson collaborated with former Prince associates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her third studio album &quot;Control&quot; (1986); the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Nasty&quot; has been described as the origin of the new jack swing sound, a genre innovated by Teddy Riley. Riley&#x27;s work on Keith Sweat&#x27;s &quot;Make It Last Forever&quot; (1987), Guy&#x27;s &quot;Guy&quot; (1988), and Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; (1998) made new jack swing a staple of contemporary R&amp;B into the mid-1990s. New jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music, often featuring rapped verses and drum machines. The crossover appeal of early contemporary R&amp;B artists in mainstream popular music, including works by Prince, Michael and Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Anita Baker, and The Pointer Sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry, as their success &quot;was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.&quot;

The use of melisma, a gospel tradition adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey would become a cornerstone of contemporary R&amp;B singers beginning in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Whitney Houston&#x27;s R&amp;B hits included &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot; (1990) and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (1992), later became the best-selling physical single by a female act of all time, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide. Her 1992 hit soundtrack &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, spent 20 weeks on top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200, sold over 45 million copies worldwide and remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time.

Hip hop came to influence contemporary R&amp;B later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly and Bobby Brown, the former is a mixture of contemporary R&amp;B with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s critically acclaimed album &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.

===Pop music===

Pop Music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. &quot;Rock&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which &quot;pop&quot; became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Bing Crosby was one of the first artists to be nicknamed &quot;King of Song&quot; or &quot;King of Popular Music&quot;. Indie pop, which developed in the late 1970s, marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, with guitar bands formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label. By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which &quot;favoured those artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal&quot;. The 1980s are commonly remembered for an increase in the use of digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synth-pop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity. By 2014, pop music worldwide had been permeated by electronic dance music. In 2018, researchers at the University of California, Irvine, concluded that pop music has become &#x27;sadder&#x27; since the 1980s. The elements of happiness and brightness have eventually been replaced with the electronic beats making the pop music more &#x27;sad yet danceable&#x27;. 

===Rock, metal, and punk===

Rock and roll developed out of country, blues, and R&amp;B. Rock&#x27;s exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, and are the subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called &quot;rockabilly&quot;, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, but it was the white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.

The 1960s saw several important changes in popular music, especially rock. Many of these changes took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, and The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and had a profound effect on American culture and music. These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.

In the early 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, beginning with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre characterized by a distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys&#x27; songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock were associated with the rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream in the middle of the 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles&#x27; shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan&#x27;s influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.

Following the turbulent political, social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as &quot;rock and roll&quot; evolved into a catchall category called simply &quot;rock music&quot;, which came to include diverse styles developed in the US like punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade with a wave of singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.

Punk was a form of rebellious rock that began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a reaction against the popular music of the period, especially disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and Talking Heads, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore was a form of sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.

Hardcore, punk, and garage rock were the roots of &quot;alternative rock&quot;, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle&#x27;s local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With the addition of a more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums &quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;Smash&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; and &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.

Heavy metal is characterized by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal&#x27;s origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. The first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N&#x27; Roses rose to fame near the end of the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.

By the mid-1980s heavy metal had branched in so many different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was known as one of the birthplaces of death metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Deicide, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.

===Hip hop===
Hip hop is a cultural movement, of which music is a part. Hip hop music for the most part is itself composed of two parts: rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and DJing and/or producing, the production of instrumentation through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism, or beatboxing, the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul, funk, and R&amp;B songs that the DJs played, and to keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs (when the rhythm climaxes), producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.

Unlike Motown which predicated its mainstream success on the class appeal of its acts that rendered racial identity irrelevant, hip hop of 1980s, particularly hip hop that crossed over to rock-and-roll, was predicated on its (implicit but emphatic) primary identification with black identity. By the beginning of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared in the latter part of the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.

Gangsta rap is a kind of hip hop, most importantly characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap can be traced back to the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia&#x27;s Schoolly D and the West Coast&#x27;s Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G. and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.

The dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, largely due to the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent&#x27;s third studio albums, &quot;Graduation&quot; and &quot;Curtis&quot; respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of &quot;Graduation&quot; in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West&#x27;s victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists, while the second former won a Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018, being the first musician outside the classical and jazz genres to be honored.

Jay-Z became an internationally renowned hip hop icon in the wake of the deaths of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur in the mid-1990s. Kanye West was mentored by Jay-Z and produced for him, before attaining a similar level of success.
Female rappers Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Saweetie, Doja Cat, Iggy Azalea, City Girls and Megan Thee Stallion also entered the mainstream. There are many women that have notably influenced the hip hop culture. However, a few names that cannot go unsaid are MC Sha-rock, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliot, Lil Kim, Erykah Badu, Foxy Brown, and many more. Of this list MC Sha-rock is considered the historian/pioneer of female hip-hop culture. She started her career as a break-dancer in the Bronx, New York and later became &quot;The hip-hop&#x27;s culture&#x27;s first female emcee/rapper&quot;. Her career has been long-lived. From being a former member of the Funky 4+1 more to having MC rhyming battles with groups such as Grandmaster Flash and Furious 5. Another notable pioneer of female hip-hop is the famous Queen Latifah, Born Dana Elaine Owens in Newark, New Jersey. Queen Latifah started her career from a young age, as early as 17. But, not long after it began it soon took-off. She released her first full-length album, &quot;All Hail the Queen&quot;, in 1989. As she continued to release music she grew more and more popular, and her fame increased amidst the hip-hop culture. However, Queen Latifah was not an ordinary rapper. She rapped about the issues surrounding being a black woman and overall social injustice issues that appear in the music industry. These early pioneers have led female rap culture and impacted today&#x27;s popular female hip-hop artists. For example, such popular artists may include Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Miss Mulatto, Flo Milli, Cupcakke and many others. Each artists has their own identity in the rap game, however as hip-hop evolves so does the style of music. Cardi B&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Invasion of Privacy&quot; (2018), debuted at number one on the &quot; Billboard&quot; 200 and was named the number-one female rap album of the 2010s by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Critically acclaimed, it made Cardi B the only woman to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album as a solo artist, and marked the first female rap album in fifteen years to be nominated for Album of the Year.

===Other niche styles and Latin American music===

The American music industry is dominated by large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering a wide variety of recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.
Among the Hispanic American musicians who were pioneers in the early stages of rock and roll were Ritchie Valens, who scored several hits, most notably &quot;La Bamba&quot; and Herman Santiago wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. Songs that became popular in the United States and are heard during the Holiday/Christmas season are &quot;¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?&quot; is a novelty Christmas song with 12-year-old Augie Ríos was a record hit in 1959 which featured the Mark Jeffrey Orchestra. &quot;&quot;(1970) by José Feliciano is another famous Latin song.

The single largest niche industry is based on Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially crucial part of the development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha-cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, &quot;salsa&quot; refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica. Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously. The clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases.
Latin American music has long influenced American popular music, jazz, rhythm and blues, and even country music. This includes music from Spanish, Portuguese, and (sometimes) French-speaking countries and territories of Latin America.

Today, the American record industry defines Latin music as any type of release with lyrics mostly in Spanish. Mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from Latin artists and it has also become more likely that English language songs crossover to Spanish radio and vice versa.

The United States played a significant role in the development of electronic dance music, specifically house and techno, which originated in Chicago and Detroit, respectively.

Today Latin American music has become a term for music performed by Latinos regardless of whether it has a Latin element or not. Acts such as Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Selena Gomez, Christina Aguilera, Gloria Estefan, Demi Lovato, Mariah Carey, Becky G, Paulina Rubio, and Camila Cabello are prominent on the pop charts. Iglesias who holds the record for most #1s on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Latin Tracks released a bilingual album, inspired by urban acts he releases two completely different songs to Latin and pop formats at the same time.

==Government, politics and law==
The government of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain kinds of music. Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property as soon as they are fixed in a tangible form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.

Music has long affected the politics of the United States. Political parties and movements frequently use music and song to communicate their ideals and values, and to provide entertainment at political functions. The presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison was the first to greatly benefit from music, after which it became standard practice for major candidates to use songs to create public enthusiasm. In more recent decades, politicians often chose theme songs, some of which have become iconic; the song &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;, for example, has been associated with the Democratic Party since the 1932 campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Since the 1950s, however, music has declined in importance in politics, replaced by televised campaigning with little or no music. Certain forms of music became more closely associated with political protest, especially in the 1960s. Gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson became important figures in the Civil Rights Movement, while the American folk revival helped spread the counterculture of the 1960s and opposition to the Vietnam War.

==Industry and economics==
The United States has the world&#x27;s largest music market with a total retail value of 4.9 billion dollars in 2014, The American music industry includes a number of fields, ranging from record companies to radio stations and community orchestras. Total industry revenue is about $40 billion worldwide, and about $12 billion in the United States. Most of the world&#x27;s major record companies are based in the United States; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. Record companies may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. Record companies may be affiliated with other music media companies, which produce a product related to popular recorded music. These include television channels like MTV, magazines like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and radio stations. In recent years the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music; many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music.
Radio stations in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. Many radio stations in the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel, and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are tracked by the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry&#x27;s revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.

Though the major record companies dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (&quot;indie music&quot;) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation&#x27;s members have steady music employment.

==Education and scholarship==

Music is an important part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years.

The scholarly study of music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music can be traced back to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library&#x27;s Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.

Early 20th scholarly analysis of American music tended to interpret European-derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study, with the folk, religious, and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low-class and of little artistic or social worth. American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations, and was found wanting, leading writers like the composer Arthur Farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture, in his 1915 &quot;Music in America&quot;. In 1930, John Tasker Howard&#x27;s &quot;Our American Music&quot; became a standard analysis, focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States. Since the analysis of musicologist Charles Seeger in the mid-20th century, American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry. Under this view, the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races, while still fostering constant acculturation, as elements of European, African, and indigenous musics have shifted between fields. Gilbert Chase&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Music, from the Pilgrims to the Present&quot;, was the first major work to examine the music of the entire United States, and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall. Chase&#x27;s analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment. Until the 1960s and 1970s, however, most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music, limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music, especially European-derived classical and operatic styles, and sometimes African American jazz. More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history. Prominent recent studies of American music include Charles Hamm&#x27;s &quot;Music in the New World&quot; from 1983 and Richard Crawford&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Musical Life&quot; from 2001.

==Holidays and festivals==

Music is an important part of several American holidays, especially playing a major part in the wintertime celebration of Christmas. Music of the holiday includes both religious songs like &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and secular songs like &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. Patriotic songs like the national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, are a major part of Independence Day celebrations. Music also plays a role at many regional holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, most famously Mardi Gras, a music and dance parade and festival in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The United States is home to numerous music festivals, which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal. Some music festivals are strictly local in scope, including few or no performers with a national reputation, and are generally operated by local promoters. The large recording companies operate their own music festivals, such as Lollapalooza and Ozzfest, which draw huge crowds.

<text>The Teenagers were an American music group, most noted for being one of rock music&#x27;s earliest successes, presented to international audiences by DJ Alan Freed. The group, which made its most popular recordings with young Frankie Lymon as lead singer, is also noted for being rock&#x27;s first all-teenaged act. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

==History==
The Teenagers had their origins in the Earth Angels, a group founded at Edward W. Stitt Junior High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan by second tenor Jimmy Merchant and bass Sherman Garnes. Eventually, Garnes and Merchant had added lead singer Herman Santiago and baritone Joe Negroni to their lineup and evolved into The Coupe De Villes. In 1954, 12-year-old Frankie Lymon joined the Coupe De Villes, who changed their name to first the Ermines and later the Premiers.

The same year Lymon joined the group, he helped Santiago and Merchant rewrite a song they had composed to create &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot;. The song got the Teenagers an audition with George Goldner&#x27;s Gee Records, but Santiago was too sick to sing lead on the day of the audition. Lymon sang the lead on &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; instead, and the group was signed to Gee as The Teenagers, with Lymon as lead singer.

&quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; was the Teenagers&#x27; first and biggest hit. The group, known for both their harmony and choreography, also had hits with &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Juvenile Delinquent&quot; and &quot;The ABC&#x27;s of Love&quot;.

By 1957, the group was being billed as &quot;Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers&quot;. This caused in-fighting, and by September, Goldner had pulled Lymon out of the group to record solo. Lymon had little success as a solo artist. He became a heroin addict at the age of 15 and his sales dropped quickly in the early 1960s. In 1966, he stopped using heroin after being forced to go to the army, but on February 27, 1968, he decided to celebrate his good fortune by taking heroin (he was planning to launch a comeback) and died of a heroin overdose at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother&#x27;s bathroom. He had been clean since entering the army two years earlier. The Teenagers continued recording, bringing in a new lead. Billy Lobrano, as the group&#x27;s first white member, made them more racially mixed, now with two black, one white, and two Hispanic members. The group had little success with Lobrano, and he left. Sherman Garnes died of a heart attack in 1977, while Joe Negroni died a year later due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Their replacements were Bobby Jay and Frankie&#x27;s brother Lewis Lymon, respectively. 

In the 1980s, the Teenagers had resorted to using a female singer to imitate Lymon&#x27;s prepubescent voice, and Pearl McKinnon joined the band. The members at that time were Jimmy Merchant, Herman Santiago, Eric Ward, and Pearl McKinnon. By 1983, Ward had been replaced by Derek Ventura, and in 1984 Phil Garrito took over for Ventura. Roz Morehead replaced McKinnon, and Marilyn Byers moved into Morehead&#x27;s lead spot. Later in the 1980s the group had settled on a new lead, Jimmy Castor. Castor remained lead until the 1990s, when he was replaced by Timothy Wilson, former lead of Tiny Tim and the Hits. This line-up appeared on the PBS special &quot;Doo Wop 51&quot; in 2000.

The group&#x27;s line-up was Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward. They were often billed as Frankie Lymon&#x27;s Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers.

As of 2019 the line-up was Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Joseph Rivera and Donald McCall.

<text>Thomas Peter Rademacher (November 20, 1928 – June 4, 2020) was an American heavyweight boxer. As an amateur, he was a gold medalist at the 1956 Olympics. Rademacher became the only person to challenge for the world heavyweight championship in his first professional bout when he faced Floyd Patterson in Seattle on August 22, 1957. He compiled a 15-7-1 record over 23 professional bouts.

A former college football player at Washington State, Rademacher took up boxing as a form of rehabilitation during his recovery from rheumatic fever, which he contracted in military school.

==Amateur career==
In his amateur career, Rademacher won 72 bouts and lost 7. He won a series of tournaments, including the 1949 and 1951–1953 Seattle Golden Gloves (he lost in 1950 to Zora Folley, who was his frequent opponent throughout his boxing career), and the US Amateur Championship as a heavyweight in 1953—avenging his earlier loss to Folley.

He captured the Chicago Golden Gloves, the All-Army championship, and the Service championship in 1956, before qualifying for the Olympic team. At the Olympics, he captured a gold medal in the heavyweight division and served as the U.S. flag bearer at the closing ceremony.

=== 1956 Olympic results===
* Round of 16: bye
* Quarterfinal: Defeated Josef Němec (Czechoslovakia) KO 2
* Semifinal: Defeated Daan Bekker (South Africa) KO 3
* Final: Defeated Lev Mukhin (Soviet Union) KO 1 (won gold medal)

Rademacher also attended college, playing offensive line on the football team for Washington State.

==Professional career==
After winning the gold medal, Rademacher started saying that he would be able to become world heavyweight champion in his first professional fight. He made his belief public and was able to lure world Heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson into defending his crown against him in his professional debut. It is the only time to date that a fighter making his professional debut has challenged for the world heavyweight title.

The bout, at Sick&#x27;s Stadium in Seattle, was refereed by former light-heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran, who himself had contended for the heavy crown once, vs. Primo Carnera, in 1934. Rademacher dropped Patterson in round two, but Patterson recovered and knocked Rademacher down seven times, defeating him by a knockout in round six. Legendary boxing promoter Jack Hurley promoted the match.

Rademacher fought Zora Folley, Brian London, George Chuvalo, Buddy Turman, and the former world light heavyweight champion, Archie Moore. He lost to Moore, Folley and London but beat Chuvalo, LaMar Clark, and Turman, among others. His last bout was with former world middleweight champion Carl &quot;Bobo&quot; Olson, whom he beat by decision.

==Personal life==
Rademacher had Finnish ancestry; his maternal grandparents were immigrants from Finland. He was married to Margaret and had a daughter Susan (born c. 1954–1955). In addition to boxing, he was a salesman and inventor. He was president of the company Kiefer-McNeil which was founded by fellow Olympian, Adolph Kiefer. Rademacher died in Sandusky, Ohio on June 4, 2020, at the age of 91. His brain was donated for medical research.

<doc id="171087" wikidata="Q1210340" url="?curid=171087" title="Normal science">
<text>Normal science, identified and elaborated on by Thomas Samuel Kuhn in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, is the regular work of scientists theorizing, observing, and experimenting within a settled paradigm or explanatory framework. Regarding science as puzzle-solving, Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad theory, without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory.

==The route to normal science==
Kuhn stressed that historically, the route to normal science could be a difficult one. Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would-be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by Pliny the Elder or Francis Bacon, while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories.

Arguably at least the social sciences remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.

==Normal science at work==
Kuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the &#x27;normal&#x27; scientist, as they engaged with the threefold task of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.

Paradigms are central to Kuhn&#x27;s conception of normal science. Scientists derive rules from paradigms, which also guide research by providing a framework for action that encompasses all the values, techniques, and theories shared by the members of a scientific community. Paradigms gain recognition from more successfully solving acute problems than their competitors. Normal science aims to improve the match between a paradigm&#x27;s predictions and the facts of interest to a paradigm. It does not aim to discover new phenomena.

According to Kuhn, normal science encompasses three classes of scientific problems. The first class of scientific problems is the determination of significant fact, such as the position and magnitude of stars in different galaxies. When astronomers use special telescopes to verify Copernican predictions, they engage the second class: the matching of facts with theory, an attempt to demonstrate agreement between the two. Improving the value of the gravitational constant is an example of articulating a paradigm theory, which is the third class of scientific problems.

==The breakdown of consensus==
The normal scientist presumes that all values, techniques, and theories falling within the expectations of the prevailing paradigm are accurate. Anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved &quot;within&quot; the prevailing paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge during what Kuhn deems a crisis of normal science. If the paradigm is unsalvageable, it will be subjected to a paradigm shift. 

Kuhn lays out the progression of normal science that culminates in scientific discovery at the time of a paradigm shift: first, one must become aware of an anomaly in nature that the prevailing paradigm cannot explain. Then, one must conduct an extended exploration of this anomaly. The crisis only ends when one discards the old paradigm and successfully maps the original anomaly onto a new paradigm. The scientific community embraces a new set of expectations and theories that govern the work of normal science. Kuhn calls such discoveries scientific revolutions. Successive paradigms replace each other and are necessarily incompatible with each other.

In this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound research, whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively. Kuhn&#x27;s framework restricts the permissibility of paradigm falsification to moments of scientific discovery.

==Criticism==
Kuhn&#x27;s normal science is characterized by upheaval over cycles of puzzle-solving and scientific revolution, as opposed to cumulative improvement. In Kuhn&#x27;s historicism, moving from one paradigm to the next completely changes the universe of scientific assumptions. Imre Lakatos has accused Kuhn of falling back on irrationalism to explain scientific progress. Lakatos relates Kuhnian scientific change to a mystical or religious conversion ungoverned by reason.

With the aim of presenting scientific revolutions as rational progress, Lakatos provided an alternative framework of scientific inquiry in his paper &quot;Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes.&quot; His model of the research programme preserves cumulative progress in science where Kuhn&#x27;s model of successive irreconcilable paradigms in normal science does not. Lakatos&#x27; basic unit of analysis is not a singular theory or paradigm, but rather the entire research programme that contains the relevant series of testable theories. Each theory within a research programme has the same common assumptions and is supposed by a belt of more modest auxiliary hypotheses that serve to explain away potential threats to the theory&#x27;s core assumptions. Lakatos evaluates problem shifts, changes to auxiliary hypotheses, by their ability to produce new facts, better predictions, or additional explanations. Lakatos&#x27; conception of a scientific revolution involves the replacement of degenerative research programmes by progressive research programmes. Rival programmes persist as minority views.

Lakatos is also concerned that Kuhn&#x27;s position may result in the controversial position of relativism, for Kuhn accepts multiple conceptions of the world under different paradigms. Although the developmental process he describes in science is characterized by an increasingly detailed and refined understanding of nature, Kuhn does not conceive of science as a process of evolution towards any goal or telos. He has noted his own sparing use of the word &quot;truth&quot; in his writing. 

An additional consequence of Kuhn&#x27;s relavitism, which poses a problem for the philosophy of science, is his blurred demarcation between science and non-science. Unlike Karl Popper&#x27;s deductive method of falsification, under Kuhn, scientific discoveries that do not fit the established paradigm do not immediately falsify the paradigm. They are treated as anomalies within the paradigm that warrant further research, until a scientific revolution refutes the entire paradigm.

<doc id="171090" wikidata="Q245296" url="?curid=171090" title="Zydeco">
<text>Zydeco ( ; ) is a music genre that was created in rural Southwest Louisiana by Afro-Americans of Creole heritage. It blends blues and rhythm and blues with music indigenous to the Louisiana Creoles, such as la la and juré. Musicians use the French accordion and a Creole washboard instrument called the frottoir.

==Characteristics==
Zydeco music is typically played in an uptempo, syncopated manner with a strong rhythmic core, and often incorporates elements of blues, rock and roll, soul music, R&amp;B, Cajun, and early Creole music. Zydeco music is centered on the accordion, which leads the rest of the band, and a specialized washboard, called a vest frottoir, as a prominent percussive instrument. Other common instruments in zydeco are the electric guitar, bass, keyboard, and drum set. If there are accompanying lyrics, they are typically sung in English or French. Many zydeco performers create original zydeco compositions, though it is also common for musicians to adapt blues standards, R&amp;B hits, and traditional Cajun tunes into the zydeco style.

==Origin of term ==

The origin of the term &quot;zydeco&quot; is uncertain. One theory is that it derives from the French phrase , which, when spoken in Louisiana French, is pronounced . This literally translates as &quot;the green beans aren&#x27;t salted&quot; and is used idiomatically to express hardship.

In 1960, musicologist Mack McCormick used the spelling &quot;zydeco&quot; in the liner notes for a compilation album: &quot;A Treasury of Field Recordings&quot;. The word was used in reviews, and McCormick began publicizing it around Houston as a standard spelling. Its use was also accepted by musician Clifton Chenier (who had earlier recorded &quot;Zodico Stomp&quot; in 1955) in his recording &quot;Zydeco Sont Pas Salés&quot;. Chenier later claimed credit for having coined this spelling

Another possible root word for zydeco is a West African term for &quot;musicking&quot;. Recent studies based on early Louisiana recordings made by Alan and John Lomax suggest that the term, as well as the tradition, may have African origins. The west African languages of tribes affected by the slave trade provide some clues as to the origins of zydeco. In at least a dozen languages from this culture-area of Africa, the syllables &quot;za&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, and &quot;go&quot; are frequently associated with dancing and/or playing music&quot;. It is also possible that &quot;za re go&quot; evolved into by French-Creole speaking generations unfamiliar with the original language, turning what would have been unfamiliar words into a phonetically similar phrase in the regional language.

The word &quot;zydeco&quot; can refer to the musical genre, the dance style, or a social gathering at which the music is played.

==Early history==
The original French settlers came to Louisiana in the late 1600s, sent by the Regent of France, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans, to help settle &quot;La Louisiane&quot; (the Louisiana Territory) they claimed as a colony. Arriving in New Orleans on seven ships, the settlers quickly moved into the bayous and swamps. There, the French culture permeated those of the Spanish and Native American Indians, who had long populated the area.

In 1720, German Catholics founded the second permanent European settlements in St. John the Baptist Parish, part of what became known as the German Coast. Later in the 18th century, more German and Irish immigrants also settled in this area. Europeans imported or acquired African slaves as workers, and they soon outnumbered the whites on major sugar cane and other plantations. Through the decades, all the peoples gradually mixed.

For 150 years, Louisiana Creoles enjoyed an insular lifestyle, prospering, educating themselves without the government and building their invisible communities under the Code Noir. The French created the Code Noir in 1724 to establish rules for treatment of enslaved Africans. It also established restrictions and rights for &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;, free people of color who were a growing class, often descended from French white men and Black African or mixed-race women. They had the right to own land, something which few blacks or people of color in the American South had at that time.

The disruption of the Louisiana Creole community began when the United States made the Louisiana Purchase and Americans started settling in the state, particularly migrating from the Southeast. The new settlers typically recognized only the binary system of race that prevailed in the slave societies common where they had come from. The American states had made laws based on the assumption of second-class status for most people of visible African descent, because of its strong association with the caste of slavery.

When the Civil War ended, and the black slaves were freed across the South, Louisiana Creoles who had been free before the war often assumed positions of leadership during Reconstruction. However, segregationist Democrats in Louisiana classified Creoles as Black, or having the same status as freed slaves. By the end of the 19th century, Louisiana, Mississippi, and other former Confederate states were passing new constitutions and laws to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites under rules designed to suppress black voting (despite the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). Creoles continued to press for education and advancement while negotiating the new society.

Zydeco&#x27;s rural beginnings and the prevailing economic conditions at its inception are reflected in the song titles, lyrics, and bluesy vocals. The music arose as a synthesis of traditional Creole music, some Cajun music influences, and African-American traditions, including R&amp;B, blues, jazz, and gospel. It was also often just called French music or &quot;le musique Creole&quot; known as &quot;la-la.&quot;

Amédé Ardoin, the second and most influential musician of the region to record the Creole music of southwest Louisiana, made his first recordings in 1929. This Creole music served as a foundation for what later became known as zydeco. Originally performed at house dances in the community, the music eventually was also performed in Catholic Church community centers, as Creoles were mostly Catholic, as well as in rural dance halls and nightclubs.

During World War II, and the Second Great Migration, many French-speaking and Louisiana Creole-speaking Créoles from the area around Marksville and Opelousas, Louisiana left a poor and prejudiced state for better economic opportunities in Texas. Their numbers were surpassed by the many southern Blacks, including people of color, who migrated to California, Oregon and Washington states, where the buildup of defense industries provided more access to good jobs. They still had to deal with some discrimination but found more opportunities than in the legally segregated South. In California blacks from Louisiana and other Southern states could vote and began to participate in political life. Today, there are many Cajun and zydeco festivals throughout the US.

==Post-war history==
Zydeco music pioneer Clifton Chenier, &quot;The King of Zydeco&quot;, made zydeco popular on regional radio stations with his bluesy style and keyboard accordion. In the mid-1950s, Chenier&#x27;s popularity brought zydeco to the fringes of the American mainstream. He signed with Specialty Records, the same label that first recorded Little Richard and Sam Cooke for wide audiences. Chenier, considered the architect of contemporary zydeco, became the first major zydeco artist. His early hits included &quot;Les Haricots Sont Pas Salés&quot; (&quot;The Snap Beans Ain&#x27;t Salty&quot; — a reference to the singer being too poor to afford salt pork to season the beans).

The first zydeco vest frottoir was designed by Clifton Chenier in 1946 while he and his brother Cleveland were working at an oil refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Chenier commissioned the instrument from Willie Landry, a welder-fabricator who worked at the same refinery. Landry&#x27;s original frottoir is held in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

Tejano music performers of the 1950s–1970s, such as Little Joe and Freddie Fender, were known for their zydeco roots and inspiration. They helped popularize the style in South Texas within mainstream country music.

In 1978, Clifton Chenier saw how popular Zydeco was becoming on the road and overseas. He persuaded a young creole/lala accordionist named Fernest Arceneaux to pick up the accordion again. Arceneaux had given up the accordion in the 1960s to play the guitar. Shortly after, he began to tour internationally as Fernest and the Thunders.

In the mid-1980s, Rockin&#x27; Sidney brought international attention to zydeco music with his hit tune &quot;My Toot Toot&quot;. Clifton Chenier, Rockin&#x27; Sidney, and Queen Ida all garnered Grammy awards during this pivotal period, opening the door to emerging artists who would continue the traditions. Rockin&#x27; Dopsie recorded with Paul Simon on his album &quot;Graceland&quot; and also signed a major label deal during this time.

John Delafose was extremely popular regionally. The music made major advances when emerging bands burst exuberantly onto the national scene, fusing new sounds and styles with the music. Boozoo Chavis, Roy Carrier, Zydeco Force, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas, the Sam Brothers, Terrance Simien, Chubby Carrier, and many others were breathing new life into the music. Zydeco superstar Buckwheat Zydeco, already well into his career, signed his deal with Island Records in the mid-1980s. Combined with the national popularity of Creole and Cajun food, and the popular feature film &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, set in New Orleans, zydeco music had a revival. New artists were cultivated, the music took a more innovative direction, and zydeco increased in mainstream popularity.

Active zydeco musicians such as C.J. Chenier (son of Clifton Chenier), Chubby Carrier (son of Roy Carrier), Geno Delafose (son of John Delafose), Terrance Simien, Nathan Williams and others began touring internationally during the 1980s. Beau Jocque was a monumental songwriter and innovator who infused zydeco with powerful beats and bass lines in the 1990s, adding striking production and elements of funk, hip-hop and rap. Young performers such as Chris Ardoin, Keith Frank, Corey Arceneaux (great nephew of Fernest Arceneaux), and Zydeco Force tied the sound to the bass drum rhythm to accentuate or syncopate the backbeat even more. This style is sometimes called &quot;double clutching&quot;.

Hundreds of zydeco bands continue the music traditions across the U.S. and in Europe, Japan, the UK and Australia. A precocious 7-year-old zydeco accordionist, Guyland Leday, was featured in a 2006 HBO documentary about music and young people.

In 2007, zydeco was recognized with a separate category in the Grammy awards, the Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album category. But with changes in popularity, in 2011 the Grammy awards eliminated the category and folded the genre into its new &quot;Best Regional Roots Album&quot; category.

21st century zydeco artists include but not limited to Lil&#x27; Nate (son of Nathan Williams), Leon Chavis, Rusty Metoyer. Andre Thierry has kept the tradition alive on the West Coast, while Corey Arceneaux among other artist perform on the East Coast. Dwayne Dopsie (son of Rockin&#x27; Dopsie) and his band, the Zydeco Hellraisers, were nominated for best Regional Roots Album in the 2017 Grammy Awards. In 2024 at the 66th annual Grammy Awards Buckwheat Zydeco Jr. (son of the late Buckwheat Zydeco) and the Legendary Ils Sont Partis Band took home the Grammy Award for best regional roots album.

While zydeco is a genre that has become synonymous with the cultural and musical identity of Louisiana, it is an important part of the musical landscape of the United States. This southern Black music tradition has received wide recognition throughout the country. Because of the migration of the French-speaking blacks and multiracial Creoles, the mixing of Cajun and Creole musicians, and the warm embrace of people from outside these cultures, there are multiple hotbeds of zydeco and festivals for it throughout the US and in Europe: Louisiana, Texas, Oregon, California, and Europe, as far north as Scandinavia.

<text>Liliane Rudabet Gloria Elsveta &quot;Leelee&quot; Sobieski (born June 10, 1983) is an American artist and retired actress. She achieved fame in her teens with roles in films such as &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Here on Earth&quot; (2000), &quot;Joy Ride&quot; and &quot;The Glass House&quot; (both 2001). 

She received Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations for her portrayal of the title character in the television film &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999), and a further Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the NBC miniseries &quot;Uprising&quot; (2001). Sobieski continued to work in films and on television until retiring in 2012, after which she focused on her children and art career.

==Early life and education==

Sobieski was born in New York City, on June 10, 1983. Her mother, Elizabeth Sobieski (née Salomon), is an American film producer and screenwriter who also worked as Sobieski&#x27;s manager, and her father, Jean Sobieski, is a French-born painter and former actor of Polish and Swiss descent. Her maternal grandfather, United States Navy Captain Robert Salomon, was Jewish. Her maternal grandmother was of Ashkenazi Jewish and one quarter Dutch descent. Sobieski grew up in a &quot;pan-religious&quot; family; she has said that she is &quot;proud of [her] melting pot roots&quot;. Her younger brother is Robert &quot;Roby&quot; Sobieski.

Sobieski&#x27;s first name, Liliane, was the name of her paternal grandmother. One of her middle names, Elsveta, is derived from her mother&#x27;s name, Elizabeth.

She graduated from Trevor Day School in 2001 and studied literature and fine art at Brown University but did not graduate.

== Acting career ==
Sobieski was first noticed by a talent scout in the cafeteria of a New York City private school. That encounter led to her audition for the role of Claudia in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994), a role that ultimately went to Kirsten Dunst. Sobieski portrayed the character of Anna Yates in the 1994 TV movie &quot;Reunion&quot; starring Marlo Thomas. Next, she played a lead role in &quot;A Horse for Danny&quot;, a 1995 made-for-television film. In 1997, she snagged her first role in a studio film playing the daughter of Martin Short&#x27;s character in the Tim Allen comedy &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot;. 

While still in her mid-teens, Sobieski rose to fame with her appearance in the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998). The film was a major financial success, grossing over $349 million worldwide on a $75 million production budget. &quot;Deep Impact&quot; brought her to the attention of many casting directors. That same year Sobieski appeared in the Merchant Ivory film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot;. Sobieski&#x27;s performance received praise from critics; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;the graceful Sobieski registers strongly as a potential star, combining physical charm with technical skill.&quot; The film garnered her a Young Artist Award nomination, as well as a nomination by the Chicago Film Critics Association.

In 1999, Sobieski appeared in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Recalling acting alongside Tom Cruise, Sobieski stated he was &quot;very kind and considerate with me,&quot; and says her most vivid recollection of Kubrick, who died soon after filming finished, was that he &quot;genuinely seemed to hold something magic&quot;.

Also in 1999, Sobieski was cast in a supporting role in the teen comedy feature &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; starring Drew Barrymore. Her next performance in the title role of the TV movie &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999) earned her an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe nomination, and she became the youngest actress ever to portray Joan of Arc on screen. 

In 2000, Sobieski played the female lead in the film &quot;Here on Earth&quot; opposite Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein, for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination. She received a second Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Tosia Altman in the 2001 TV film &quot;Uprising&quot;.

In 2001, Sobieski played the lead role in the road horror film &quot;Joy Ride&quot; with Paul Walker and Steve Zahn. The film received generally favorable reviews. Garth Franklin of &quot;Dark Horizons&quot; stated that Sobieski &quot;does a better job than usual.&quot; That same year, she starred in the thriller &quot;The Glass House&quot;, alongside Diane Lane. The film was panned by critics and, with little promotion, had a disappointing opening weekend gross of just under $6 million. Sobieski&#x27;s performance in the 2001 low-budget drama &quot;My First Mister&quot; was praised by critics, with Pete Croatto of &quot;Filmcritic.com&quot; writing that, &quot;As for Sobieski, who I&#x27;ve always liked, she does another fine job. This time it&#x27;s with a shaky character – the troubled Goth chick... [but] Sobieski finds her character&#x27;s human touch and runs with it.&quot;

Sobieski landed a starring role in the independent film &quot;L&#x27;Idole&quot; (2002), which opened at the Toronto International Film Festival. She then starred alongside John Cusack in the drama feature &quot;Max&quot;, as the mistress of a Jewish art dealer who mentors a young Adolf Hitler. Next, she portrayed the character of Cecile in the miniseries &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (2003) with Catherine Deneuve and Rupert Everett, an adaptation of Laclos&#x27;s classic novel of sexual intrigue which made use of Sobieski&#x27;s fluency in French. She portrayed the role of Deianira in &quot;Hercules&quot;, a 2005 television miniseries.

The experimental-indie film &quot;Lying&quot;, starring Sobieski alongside Chloë Sevigny and Jena Malone, debuted at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, followed by a limited release in the United States in 2008. She next starred in the American drama &quot;Heavens Fall&quot; as one of several young women who accuse nine black youths of rape in the segregated South. That same year, she appeared in the horror film &quot;In a Dark Place&quot; as well as the remake of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; starring Nicolas Cage.
The independent comedy film &quot;Walk All over Me&quot;, in which Sobieski plays a woman who becomes a dominatrix, premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival and was later screened at several other film festivals. Her next major motion picture, the thriller &quot;88 Minutes&quot; co-starring Al Pacino and Alicia Witt, opened on April 18, 2008, in the United States, after a release in various other countries the previous year. Though panned by critics, the film was a minor success at the box office, earning more than $32 million worldwide.

In January 2008, Sobieski appeared in &quot;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot;, a fantasy film inspired by the &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; video game series. For her performances in both &quot;88 Minutes&quot; and &quot;A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot;, she received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress. Sobieski next reteamed with her &quot;Joy Ride&quot; co-star Steve Zahn in the direct-to-video film &quot;Night Train&quot;. In the film, Sobieski plays Chloe, a potentially lethal medical student who has a fateful encounter with two other strangers aboard a Polar Express-like train.

In 2009, Sobieski had a small role in the biographical crime drama &quot;Public Enemies&quot;. In June 2010, she starred alongside Denise Richards and Jamie Kennedy in the film &quot;Finding Bliss&quot;, a romantic comedy about a straitlaced aspiring filmmaker who is forced to go to work for a producer of adult films. She made a guest appearance in the television series &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; in the episode &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Secret&quot;. Sobieski also played a lead role in the 2010 drama thriller &quot;Acts of Violence&quot;, the story of a man on a mission of vengeance after his wife is raped. Also in 2010, Sobieski filmed a supporting role in the indie comedy-drama &quot;The Last Film Festival&quot;, which would not be released until 2016.

Sobieski guest-starred on a January 2011 episode of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, playing the girlfriend of one of Lockhart/Gardner &amp; Bond&#x27;s most influential clients, who is accused of using prescription stimulants.

From April 2012 to August 2012, Sobieski starred in the lead role of Officer Jennifer &quot;White House&quot; Perry, a rookie New York City police officer, on the CBS drama series &quot;NYC 22&quot;, which was created by Richard Price and produced by Robert De Niro. She also played the lead role of Abby Gibbons in the movie &quot;Branded&quot;, which was released on September 7th, 2012.

Sobieski retired from acting in 2012.

== Art career ==
She began her art career using her married surname Leelee Kimmel. She paints and sculpts abstract work, and works in VR, using Google Tilt Brush. She uses bright colors, abstracted and textured shapes floating on either a large black or white background.

Her 2018 solo exhibit debut, “Channels,” opened at the Journal Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and garnered positive reviews. &quot;Vogue&quot; said the exhibit and her work &quot;warrants serious merit&quot;. She then debuted her first UK exhibit titled “Wormhole” at the Simon Lee Gallery in London. In this latest installment, she presents large-scale abstract paintings that are confrontational in both colour and dimension, exploring themes of creation and destruction. “Kimmel’s world is very much her own – a heady mix of daftness and profundity – and a space that’s potentially fascinating, yet disorientating for those unfamiliar with it. Such are the worlds she builds in her paintings, too, and which expand beyond the canvas into gloriously gelatinous sculptures and a pioneering VR piece.” Interview Magazine says, &quot;Leelee Kimmel has always been an artist.&quot;

== Personal life ==
===Family and relationships===

In January 2009, Sobieski began dating fashion designer Adam John Kimmel, the son of American real estate developer Martin Kimmel and grandson of American boat racer and designer Donald Aronow. They were engaged on May 28, 2009 and the couple officially announced their engagement on July 17, 2009. Their daughter was born in December 2009, and their son in August 2014. They live in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Sobieski speaks fluent French, which she learned from her French-born father.

===Interviews===
Sobieski, in a 2001 interview with IGN, expressed her thoughts about whether the movies she was making were escapist fare, or that they had a deeper message for society,
&quot;Joy Ride&quot; isn&#x27;t a film you would make a statement with. It&#x27;s a fun, jump out of life film. That&#x27;s great. I love those films. Those films are great in times like these too. You can make a point with a film and help society or not. Take a film like &quot;Bulworth&quot;, a fantastic film. There are certain films like that, that can appeal to everybody and have a message in it and that&#x27;s really great.

In 2016, Sobieski confirmed &quot;I don&#x27;t do movie stuff anymore.&quot; Commenting on the reasons for her early retirement to &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, Sobieski said, &quot;I am just focused on my kids. I think that&#x27;s mainly why I stopped ... Also, ninety percent of acting roles involve so much sexual stuff with other people, and I don&#x27;t want to do that.&quot;

<text>Raï (, ; , , ), sometimes written rai, is a form of Algerian folk music that dates back to the 1920s. Singers of Raï are called &quot;cheb&quot; () or cheba (شابة), i.e. young, as opposed to &quot;sheikh&quot; (, &quot;shaykh&quot;), i.e. old, the name given to Chaabi singers. The tradition arose in the city of Oran, primarily among the poor. Traditionally sung by men, by the end of the 20th century, female singers became common. The lyrics have concerned social issues such as disease and the policing of European colonies that affected native populations.

==History==

===Origins===
Raï is a type of Algerian popular music that arose in the 1920s in the port city of Oran, and that self-consciously ran counter to accepted artistic and social mores. It appealed to young people who sought to modernize the traditional Islamic values and attitudes. Regional, secular, and religious drum patterns, melodies, and instruments were blended with Western electric instrumentation. Raï emerged as a major world-music genre in the late 1980s.

In the years just following World War I, the Algerian city of Oran—known as &quot;little Paris&quot;—was a melting pot of various cultures, full of nightclubs and cabarets; it was the place to go for a bawdy good time. Out of this milieu arose a group of male and female Muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates, who rejected the refined, classical poetry of traditional Algerian music. Instead, to the accompaniment of pottery drums and end-blown flutes, they sang about the adversity of urban life in a raw, gritty, sometimes vulgar, and inevitably controversial language that appealed especially to the socially and economically disadvantaged. The cheikhates further departed from tradition in that they performed not only for women but also and especially for men.

The music performed was called raï. It drew its name from the Algerian Arabic word raï (&quot;opinion&quot; or &quot;advice&quot;), which was typically inserted—and repeated—by singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics. By the early 1940s Cheikha Rimitti el Reliziana had emerged locally as a musical and linguistic luminary in the raï tradition, and she continued to be among the music&#x27;s most prominent performers into the 21st century.

In the early 20th century, Oran was divided into Jewish, French, Spanish, and Native Algerian quarters. By independence in 1962, the Jewish quarter (known as the Derb), was home to musicians like Reinette L&#x27;Oranaise, Saoud l&#x27;Oranais and Larbi Bensari. Sidi el Houari was home to Spanish fishermen and many refugees from Spain who arrived after 1939. These two-quarters had active music scenes, and the French inhabitants of the city went to the Jewish and Spanish areas to examine the music. The Arabs of Oran were known for al-andalous, a classical style of music imported from Southern Spain after 1492. Hawzi classical music was popular during this time, and female singers of the genre included Cheikha Tetma, Fadila D&#x27;zirya and Myriam Fekkai. Another common musical genre was &quot;Bedoui&quot; (&quot;Bedouin&quot;) (or &quot;gharbi&quot; (&quot;Western&quot;)), which originated from Bedouin chants. Bedoui consisted of Melhun poetry being sung with accompaniment from guellal drums and gaspa Flutes. Bedoui was sung by male singers, known as &quot;cheikh&quot;s, who were dressed in long, white jellabas and turbans. Lyrics came from the poetry of people such as Mestfa ben Brahim and Zenagui Bouhafs. Performers of bedoui included Cheikh Hamada, Cheikh Mohammed Senoussi, Cheikh Madani, Cheikh Hachemi Bensmir and Cheikh Khaldi. Senoussi was the first to have had recorded the music in 1906.

French colonization of Algeria changed the organization of society, producing a class of poor, uneducated urban men and women. Bedoui singers mostly collaborated with the French colonizers, though one exception from such collaboration was Cheikh Hamada. The problems of survival in a life of poverty were the domain of street musicians who sang bar-songs called zendanis. A common characteristic of these songs included exclamations of the word &quot;raï!&quot; and variations thereof. The word &quot;rai&quot; implies that an opinion is being expressed.

In the 1920s, the women of Oran were held to strict code of conduct. Many of those that failed became social outcasts and singers and dancers. They sang medh songs in praise of the prophet Mohammed and performed for female audiences at ceremonies such as weddings and circumcision feasts. These performers included Les Trois Filles de Baghdad, Soubira bent Menad and Kheira Essebsadija. Another group of female social outcasts were called &quot;cheikhas&quot;, who were known for their alluring dress, hedonistic lyrics, and their display of a form of music that was influenced from meddhahates and zendani singers. These cheikhas, who sang for both men and women, included people such as Cheikha Remitti el Reliziana, Cheikha Grélo, Cheikha Djenia el Mostganmia, Cheikha Bachitta de Mascara, and Cheikha a; Ouachma el Tmouchentia. The 1930s saw the rise of revolutionary organizations, including organizations motivated by Marxism, which mostly despised these early roots raï singers. At the same time, Arabic classical music was gaining huge popularity across the Maghreb, especially the music of Egypt&#x27;s Umm Kulthum.

When first developed, raï was a hybrid blend of rural and cabaret musical genres, invented by and targeted toward distillery workers, peasants who had lost their land to European settlers, and other types of lower class citizens. The geographical location of Oran allowed for the spread of many cultural influences, allowing raï musicians to absorb an assortment of musical styles such as flamenco from Spain, gnawa music, and French cabaret, allowing them to combine with the rhythms typical of Arab nomads. In the early 1930s, social issues afflicting the native population in the colony, such as the disease of typhus, harassment and imprisonment by the colonial police, and poverty were prominent themes of raï lyrics. However, other main lyrical themes concerned the likes of wine, love, and the meaning and experiences of leading a marginal life. From its origins, women played a significant role in the music and performance of raï. In contrast to other Algerian music, raï incorporated dancing in addition to music, particularly in a mixed-gender environment.

In the 1930s, Raï, al-andalousm, and the Egyptian classical style influenced the formation of wahrani, a musical style popularized by Blaoui Houari. Musicians like Mohammed Belarbi and Djelloul Bendaoud added these influences to other Oranian styles, as well as Western piano and accordion, resulting in a style called bedoui citadinisé. Revolt began in the mid-1950s, and musicians which included Houari and Ahmed Saber supported the Front de Libération National. After independence in 1962, however, the government of the Houari Boumédienne regime, along with President Ahmed Ben Bella, did not tolerate criticism from musicians such as Saber, and suppression of Raï and Oranian culture ensued. The number of public performances by female raï singers decreased, which led to men playing an increased role in this genre of music. Meanwhile, traditional raï instruments such as the gasba (reed flute), and the derbouka (North African drums) were replaced with the violin and accordion.

===Post-independence===

In the 1960s, Bellamou Messaoud and Belkacem Bouteldja began their career, and they changed the raï sound, eventually gaining mainstream acceptance in Algeria by 1964. In the 1970s, recording technology began growing more advanced, and more imported genres had Algerian interest as well, especially Jamaican reggae with performers like Bob Marley. Over the following decades, raï increasingly assimilated the sounds of the diverse musical styles that surfaced in Algeria. During the 1970s, raï artists brought in influences from other countries such as Egypt, Europe, and the Americas. Trumpets, the electric guitar, synthesizers, and drum machines were specific instruments that were put into music. This marked the beginning of pop raï, which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of Cheb (male) or Chaba (female), meaning &quot;young,&quot; to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style. Among the most prominent performers of the new raï were Chaba Fadela, Cheb Hamid, and Cheb Mami. However, by the time the first international raï festival was held in Algeria in 1985, Cheb Khaled had become virtually synonymous with the genre. More festivals followed in Algeria and abroad, and raï became a popular and prominent new genre in the emergent world-music market. International success of the genre had begun as early as 1976 with the rise to prominence of producer Rachid Baba Ahmed.

The added expense of producing LPs as well as the technical aspects imposed on the medium by the music led to the genre being released almost exclusively onto cassette by the early 1980s, with a great deal of music having no LP counterpart at all and a very limited exposure on CD.

While this form of raï increased cassette sales, its association with mixed dancing, an obscene act according to orthodox Islamic views, led to government-backed suppression. However, this suppression was overturned due to raï&#x27;s growing popularity in France, where it was strongly demanded by the Maghrebi Arab community. This popularity in France was increased as a result of the upsurge of Franco-Arab struggles against racism. This led to a following of a white audience that was sympathetic to the antiracist struggle.

After the election of president Chadli Bendjedid in 1979, Raï music had a chance to rebuild because of his lessened moral and economic restraints. Shortly afterwards, Raï started to form into pop-raï, with the use of instruments such as electrical synthesizers, guitars, and drum machines.

In the 1980s, raï began its period of peak popularity. Previously, the Algerian government had opposed raï because of its sexually and culturally risqué topics, such as alcohol and consumerism, two subjects that were taboo to the traditional Islamic culture.
The government eventually attempted to ban raï, banning the importation of blank cassettes and confiscating the passports of raï musicians. This was done to prevent raï from not only spreading throughout the country, but to prevent it from spreading internationally and from coming in or out of Algeria. Though this limited the professional sales of raï, the music increased in popularity through the illicit sale and exchange of tapes. In 1985, Algerian Colonel Snoussi joined with French minister of culture Jack Lang to convince the Algerian state to accept raï. He succeeded in getting the government to return passports to raï musicians and to allow raï to be recorded and performed in Algeria, with government sponsorship, claiming it as a part of Algerian cultural heritage. This not only allowed the Algerian government to financially gain from producing and releasing raï, but it allowed them to monitor the music and prevent the publication of &quot;unclean&quot; music and dance and still use it to benefit the Algerian State&#x27;s image in the national world. In 1985, the first state-sanctioned raï festival was held in Algeria, and a festival was also held in January 1986 in with Cheb Khaled, Cheb Saharaoui, Chebba Fadela, Cheb Hamid, Cheb Mami and the group Raï NaraÏ in the theater MC93 of Bobigny, France.

In 1988, Algerian students and youth flooded the streets to protest state-sponsored violence, the high cost of staple foods, and to support the Peoples&#x27; Algerian Army. President Chadli Bendjedid, who held power from 1979 to 1992, and his FLN cronies blamed raï for the massive uprising that left 500 civilians dead in October 1988. Most raï singers denied the allegation, including Cheb Sahraoui, who said there was no connection between raï and the October rebellion. Yet raï&#x27;s reputation as protest music stuck because the demonstrators adopted Khaled&#x27;s song &quot;El Harba Wayn&quot; (&quot;To Flee, But Where?&quot;) to aid their protesting.

In the 1990s, censorship ruled raï musicians. One exiled raï singer, Cheb Hasni, accepted an offer to return to Algeria and perform at a stadium in 1994. Hasni&#x27;s fame and controversial songs led to him receiving death threats from Islamic fundamentalist extremists. On September 29, 1994, he was the first raï musician to be murdered, outside his parents&#x27; home in the Gambetta district of Oran, reportedly because he let girls kiss him on the cheek during a televised concert. His death came amid other violent actions against North African performers. A few days before his death, the Kabyle singer Lounès Matoub was abducted by the GIA. The following year, on February 15, 1995, Raï producer Rachid Baba-Ahmed was assassinated in Oran.

The escalating tension of the Islamist anti-raï campaign caused raï musicians such as Chab Mami and Chaba Fadela to relocate from Algeria to France. Moving to France was a way to sustain the music&#x27;s existence. France was where Algerians had moved during the post-colonial era to find work, and where musicians had a greater opportunity to oppose the government without censorship.

Though raï found mainstream acceptance in Algeria, Islamic fundamentalists still protested the genre, saying that it was still too liberal and too contrasting to traditional Islamic values. The fundamentalists claimed that the musical genre still promoted sexuality, alcohol and Western consumer culture, but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and raï musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population, the youth, who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures. Despite the governmental support, a split remained between those citizens belonging to strict Islam and those patronizing the raï scene.

=== International success ===

Cheb Khaled was the first musician with international success, including his 1988 duet album with jazz musician Safy Boutella album &quot;Kutché&quot;, though his popularity did not extend to places such as the United States and Latin America. Other prominent performers of the 1980s included Houari Benchenet, Raïna Raï, Mohamed Sahraoui, Cheb Mami, Cheba Zohra and Cheb Hamid.

International success grew in the 1990s, with Cheb Khaled&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Khaled&quot;. With Khaled no longer in Algeria, musicians such as Cheb Tahar, Cheb Nasro, and Cheb Hasni began singing lover&#x27;s raï, a sentimental, pop-ballad form of raï music. Later in the decade, funk, hip hop, and other influences were added to raï, especially by performers like Faudel and Rachid Taha, the latter of whom took raï music and fused it with rock. Taha did not call his creation raï music, but rather described it as a combination of folk raï and punk.
Another mix of cultures in Arabic music of the late 1990s came through Franco-Arabic music released by musicians such as Aldo.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rise in female raï performers. According to authors Gross, McMurray, and Swedenburg in their article &quot;Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Raï, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identity,&quot; raï musician Chaba Zahouania was forbidden by her family to perform or even appear in public. According to Gross et al., the raï record companies have pushed female artists to become more noticed.

In 2000, raï music had international success thanks to Sting&#x27;s duet with raï singer Cheb Mami on the song &quot;Desert Rose&quot;, released January 17, 2000. Sting was widely credited for introducing raï music to Western music audiences, and as such, the song was a success on many charts, reaching No. 2 in Canada, No. 3 in Switzerland, No. 4 in Italy, No. 15 in the UK, and No. 17 in the US. It also reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Adult Alternative and Hot Dance Single Sales charts respectively.

==Censorship==
Throughout the course of raï music&#x27;s development and commercialization in Algeria, there have been many attempts to stifle the genre. From lyrical content to the album cover images, raï has been a controversial music. Religious identity and transnationalism function to define the complexities of Maghrebi identity. This complex identity is expressed through raï music and is often contested and censored in many cultural contexts.

In 1962, as Algeria claimed its national independence, expression of popular culture was stifled by the conservative nature of the people. During this time of drastic restriction of female expression, many men started to become raï singers. By 1979, when president Chadli Bendjedid endorsed more liberal moral and economic standards, raï music became further associated with Algerian youth. The music remained stigmatized amongst the Salafi Islamists and the Algerian government. Termed the &quot;raï generation&quot;, the youth found raï as a way to express sexual and cultural freedoms. An example of this free expression is through the lyrics of Cheb Hasni in his song &quot;El Berraka&quot;. Hasni sang: &quot;I had her ... because when you&#x27;re drunk that&#x27;s the sort of idea that runs through your head!&quot; Hasni challenged the fundamentalists of the country and the condemnation of non-religious art forms.

Raï started to circulate on a larger scale, via tape sales, TV exposure, and radio play. However, the government attempted to &quot;clean up&quot; raï to adhere to conservative values. Audio engineers manipulated the recordings of raï artists to submit to such standards. This tactic allowed for the economy to profit from the music by gaining conservative audiences. The conservativeness not only affected the way listeners received raï music, but also the way the artists, especially female artists, presented their own music. For instance, female raï artists usually do not appear on their album covers. Such patriarchal standards pressure women to societal privacy.

<text>Rafael Muñiz García de la Noceda, better known as Rafo Muñiz (born 1956), is a Puerto Rican actor, comedian, director, and producer of television shows and concerts.

The son of pioneering comic actor and producer Tommy Muñiz, Rafo&#x27;s acting career began in the role of &quot;Miguel&quot; in &quot;Gloria y Miguel&quot;, which aired on WAPA in Puerto Rico. After graduating high school, he starred alongside his father as his father&#x27;s son in law in the sitcom &quot;Los García&quot; (&quot;The Garcias&quot;), also on WAPA, during the late 1970s.

From there on, Rafo had on and off work as an actor, but by 1985, he had become a game show host at WAPA-TV. By that era also, he established a company named Promotores Latinos, where he performs as company President and main show producer. Promotores Latinos is now known as ProLat Entertainment.

Since the 1980s, Muñiz has been one of the top music promoters/managers in Puerto Rico, and his firm, ProLat Entertainment, has represented artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Rubén Blades, Olga Tañón, Gilberto Santa Rosa, and others in their concerts in Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Panama. Tanon split from his company in 2002, and Muñiz sued her for breach of contract. He quickly signed another Merengue singer, Melina León and TV personality, Silverio Pérez, to be represented by him. He also represented the late Luis Raúl, a Puerto Rican stand up comedian, and singer Jailene Cintrón. Some of his projects in the mainland U.S. include &quot;ViVa Puente&quot; a star-studded tribute to the late Puerto Rican superstar Tito Puente in New York, L.A., Miami and Dallas. He has produced concerts at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Jackie Gleason Theater, and Madison Square Garden, among other venues. Currently, he is the manager of salsa music singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, latin pop singer Yolandita Monge, and author Uka Green.

<doc id="171103" wikidata="Q518589" url="?curid=171103" title="Happy Days">
<text>Happy Days is an American television sitcom that aired first-run on the ABC network from January 15, 1974, to July 19, 1984, with a total of 255 half-hour episodes spanning 11 seasons. Created by Garry Marshall, it was one of the most successful series of the 1970s. The series presented an idealized vision of life in the 1950s and early 1960s Midwestern United States, and it starred Ron Howard as Richie Cunningham, Henry Winkler as his friend Fonzie, and Tom Bosley and Marion Ross as Richie&#x27;s parents, Howard and Marion Cunningham. Although it opened to mixed reviews from critics, &quot;Happy Days&quot; became successful and popular over time.

The series began as an unsold pilot starring Howard, Ross and Anson Williams, which aired in 1972 as a segment titled &quot;Love and the Television Set&quot; (later retitled &quot;Love and the sad days&quot; for syndication) on ABC&#x27;s anthology show &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. Based on the pilot, director George Lucas cast Howard as the lead in his 1973 film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, causing ABC to take a renewed interest in the pilot. The first two seasons of happy &quot;days&quot; focused on the experiences and dilemmas of &quot;innocent teenager&quot; Richie Cunningham, his family, and his high school friends, attempting to &quot;honestly depict a wistful look back at adolescence&quot;.

Initially a moderate success, the series&#x27; ratings began to fall during its second season, causing Marshall to retool it. The new format emphasized broad comedy and spotlighted the previously minor character of Fonzie, a &quot;cool&quot; biker and high school dropout. Following these changes, &quot;Happy Days&quot; became the number-one program in television in 1976–1977, Fonzie became one of the most merchandised characters of the 1970s, and Henry Winkler became a major star. The series also spawned a number of spin-offs, including &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;.

== Plot ==
Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the 1950s, the series revolves around teenager Richie Cunningham and his family: his father, Howard, who owns a hardware store; traditional homemaker and mother, Marion; younger sister Joanie Cunningham; Richie&#x27;s older brother Chuck (briefly in seasons 1 and 2 only, disappearing from storylines afterward); and high school dropout, leather-jacket–clad greaser, suave and promiscuous mechanic Fonzie, who would eventually become Richie&#x27;s best friend and the Cunninghams&#x27; over-the-garage tenant. The earliest episodes revolve around Richie and his friends, Potsie Weber and Ralph Malph, with Fonzie as a secondary character. However, as the series progressed, Fonzie proved to be a favorite with viewers, and soon more story lines were written to reflect his growing popularity, Winkler was top billed in the opening credits alongside Howard by season 3. Fonzie befriended Richie and the Cunningham family and, when Richie left the series for military service, Fonzie became the central figure of the show, with Winkler receiving sole top billing. In later seasons, other characters were introduced including Fonzie&#x27;s young cousin, Chachi Arcola, who became a love interest for Joanie Cunningham.

The series&#x27; pilot was originally shown as &quot;Love and the Television Set&quot;, later retitled &quot;Love and the Happy Days&quot; for syndication, a one-episode teleplay on the anthology series &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, aired on February 25, 1972. &quot;Happy Days&quot; spawned successful television shows &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; as well as three failures: &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;, &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties&quot; featuring Nancy Walker as Howard&#x27;s cousin, and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. The show is the basis for the &quot;Happy Days&quot; musical touring the United States since 2008. The leather jacket worn by Winkler during the series was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution for the permanent collection at the National Museum of American History. The original, light grey McGregor windbreaker Winkler wore during the first season eventually was thrown into the garbage after ABC relented and allowed the Fonzie character to wear a leather jacket.

== Characters ==

=== Main ===
* Richie Cunningham – The protagonist for the first seven years of the series (1974–80). When Ron Howard left the show due to his burgeoning directorial career, Richie was written out by leaving to join the United States Army. He marries his girlfriend, Lori Beth, in season eight by phone so that she will be able to join him at his post in Greenland, while Fonzie stands in for him in the wedding. Howard returned for guest appearances as Richie during the show&#x27;s final season. He came back with Lori Beth and their son, Richie Jr., and Ralph in the season 11 two-part episode, &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, and then left for California with Lori Beth and Richie Jr. to pursue a career in screenwriting. He also returned in &quot;Passages&quot;, when he and his family attended Joanie and Chachi&#x27;s wedding.
* Marion Cunningham (née Kelp) – Wife of Howard Cunningham, mother of Chuck, Richie, and Joanie, and a traditional homemaker. She is the only character who is allowed to call Fonzie by his real first name, Arthur, which she does affectionately. She sometimes gets tired of being at home, such as in &quot;Marion Rebels&quot; where she gets into an argument with Howard and briefly gets a job as a waitress at Arnold&#x27;s. Marion was one of only four characters to remain with the show throughout its entire run.
* Howard Cunningham – Husband of Marion Cunningham, father of Chuck, Richie, and Joanie, business owner of a hardware store called &quot;Cunningham&#x27;s Hardware&quot;, he is a lodge member, and family man.

* Arthur Fonzarelli, a.k.a. The Fonz or Fonzie – Initially a secondary or recurring character, billed in the end credits, during the first season, he became a popular breakout character and was promoted to front billing by the second season. Fonzarelli&#x27;s &quot;Fonzie&quot; nickname and comeback phrase, &quot;Sit on it&quot;, were created by the show&#x27;s producer Bob Brunner. His parents abandoned him as a child and his grandmother raised him from the age of four.
* Warren &quot;Potsie&quot; Weber – Richie&#x27;s best friend and an aspiring and talented singer.

Chachi becomes &quot;one of the guys&quot;, joining Richie, Potsie, Ralph, and Fonzie in their antics and as their bandmate/drummer.
* (Cathy Silvers) – Joanie&#x27;s boy-crazy best friend (1980–1983), frequently mentioned but never seen in early episodes. She made her first on-screen appearance in the eighth season and remained a recurring character through the ninth season, becoming a regular during the tenth season in 1983. She returned as a guest star in the 1984 series finale. Jenny&#x27;s father, played by Cathy Silvers&#x27; real-life father Phil Silvers, appeared in one episode (S9E8 &quot;Just a Piccalo&quot;).
* Roger Phillips (Ted McGinley) – Marion&#x27;s nephew; coach and teacher at Jefferson High, until the episode &quot;Vocational Education&quot; when he became principal at Patton High. Introduced in 1980 after Richie left the show as a recurring character.

He is rarely seen and disappears without explanation in season three, never to be seen nor referenced again after season 2&#x27;s &quot;Fish and Fins&quot;. The character&#x27;s disappearance gave rise to the term &quot;Chuck Cunningham Syndrome&quot;, used to describe TV characters that disappear from shows without an in-narrative explanation and are nowhere to be seen or mentioned again. Gavan O&#x27;Herlihy played Chuck, but then he asked to leave the series. He was replaced by Randolph Roberts.

== Production ==

&quot;Happy Days&quot; originated during a time of 1950s nostalgic interest as evident in 1970s film, television, and music. In late winter of 1971, Michael Eisner was snowed in at Newark airport where he bumped into Tom Miller, head of development at Paramount. Eisner has stated that he told Miller, &quot;Tom, this is ridiculous. We&#x27;re wasting our time here. Let&#x27;s write a show.&quot; The script treatment that came out of that did not sell. But in spite of the market research department telling them that the 1950s theme would not work, they decided to redo it, and this was accepted as a pilot. This unsold pilot was filmed in late 1971 and titled &quot;New Family in Town,&quot; with Harold Gould in the role of Howard Cunningham, Marion Ross as Marion, Ron Howard as Richie, Anson Williams as Potsie, Ric Carrott as Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Cunningham, and Susan Neher as Joanie. Paramount passed on making it into a weekly series, and the pilot was recycled with the title &quot;Love and the Television Set&quot; (later retitled &quot;Love and the Happy Days&quot; for syndication), for presentation on the television anthology series &quot;Love, American Style.&quot; Also in 1971, the musical &quot;Grease&quot; had a successful opening in Chicago, and by the following year became successful on Broadway. In 1972, George Lucas asked to view the pilot to determine if Ron Howard would be suitable to play a teenager in &quot;American Graffiti,&quot; then in pre-production. Lucas immediately cast Howard in the film, which became one of the top-grossing films of 1973. With the movie&#x27;s success generating a renewed interest in the 1950s era (although the film was set in 1962), TV show creator Garry Marshall and ABC recast the unsold pilot to turn &quot;Happy Days&quot; into a series. According to Marshall in an interview, executive producer Tom Miller said while developing the sitcom, &quot;If we do a TV series that takes place in another era, and when it goes into reruns, then it won&#x27;t look old.&quot; This made sense to Marshall while on the set of the show.

Gould had originally been tapped to reprise the role of Howard Cunningham on the show. However, during a delay before the start of production he found work doing a play abroad and when he was notified the show was ready to begin production, he declined to return because he wanted to honor his commitment. Bosley was then offered the role.

=== Production and scheduling notes ===
* Jerry Paris, who played next-door neighbor Jerry Helper on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and directed 84 episodes of that series, directed every episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; from season three on, except for three episodes in season three (&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;Dance Contest&quot;, and &quot;Arnold&#x27;s Wedding&quot;).
* Producer and writer Bob Brunner created Arthur Fonzarelli&#x27;s &quot;Fonzie&quot; nickname and his iconic comeback phrase, &quot;Sit on it.&quot;
* Beginning in September 1979 until the show went out of production, reruns of the show were syndicated under the title &quot;Happy Days Again&quot;.
* &quot;Happy Days&quot; was produced by Miller-Milkis Productions, a teaming of Thomas L. Miller with former film editor Edward K. Milkis, which became Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions when Robert L. Boyett joined the company in 1980, and was the first-ever show to be produced by the company&#x27;s most recent incarnation, Miller-Boyett Productions, which followed Milkis&#x27;s resignation from the partnership. It was also produced by Henderson Productions and was one of the popular shows produced in association with Paramount Television.
* In its 11 seasons on the air, &quot;Happy Days&quot; is the third-longest-running sitcom in ABC&#x27;s history (behind &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,&quot; which ran 14 seasons, from 1952 to 1966), and one of the longest-running primetime programs in the network&#x27;s history. It is also unique in that it remained in the same time slot, leading off ABC&#x27;s Tuesday night programming at 8:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific (7:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain zones) for its first ten seasons. That half-hour became a signature timeslot for ABC, with &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; instantly entering the top 10 when it was moved from Thursdays and staying in that time slot for six seasons, followed by the equally family-friendly sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; (another Miller-Boyett co-production). That sitcom also hit the top 10 immediately after inheriting the Tuesday at 8:00/7:00 p.m. slot and then stayed there for four seasons.
* &quot;Happy Days&quot; also proved to be quite popular in daytime reruns; the show joined the ABC daytime schedule in September 1975, airing reruns at 11:30 a.m. ET (10:30 a.m. CT/MT/PT), being moved to 11:00/10:00 a.m. in April 1977, paired with &quot;Family Feud&quot; following at 11:30/10:30 a.m. It was replaced on the daytime schedule by reruns of its spin-off, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley,&quot; in April 1979.
* CBS programming head Fred Silverman scheduled the &quot;Maude&quot; spin-off &quot;Good Times&quot; directly against &quot;Happy Days&quot; during their respective second seasons in an attempt to kill the ABC show&#x27;s growing popularity. In a way this move backfired on Silverman, as he was named president of ABC in 1975, thus forcing him to come up with a way to save the show he tried to kill the year before. After having knocked &quot;Happy Days&quot; out of the top 20 programs on television his last year at CBS, Silverman had the series at the top of the Nielsen ratings by 1977 (see below). &quot;Good Times&quot; was later ended in 1979.
* Ron Howard later revealed that many of the exterior scenes filmed in &quot;Happy Days&quot; were actually shot in Munster, Indiana.
* The official series finale (&quot;Passages&quot;) aired on May 8, 1984. But there were five &quot;leftover&quot; episodes that ABC did not have time to air during the regular season due to the Winter Olympics and the spring run of &quot;a.k.a. Pablo&quot;. Four of these aired on Thursday nights during the summer of 1984; the fifth (&quot;Fonzie&#x27;s Spots&quot;) aired on September 24, 1984.

==== Production styles ====
The first two seasons of &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–75) were filmed using a single-camera setup and laugh track. One episode of season two (&quot;Fonzie Gets Married&quot;) was filmed in front of a studio audience with three cameras as a test run. From the third season on (1975–84), the show was a three-camera production in front of a live audience (with a cast member, usually Tom Bosley, announcing in voice-over, &quot;&quot;Happy Days&quot; is filmed before a live audience&quot; at the start of most episodes), giving these later seasons a markedly different style. A laugh track was still used during post-production to smooth over live reactions.

Garry Marshall&#x27;s earlier television series &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; had undergone an identical change in production style after its first season in 1970–71.

==== Sets ====
The show had two main sets: the Cunningham home and Arnold&#x27;s/Al&#x27;s Drive-In.

In seasons one and two, the Cunningham house was arranged with the front door on the left and the kitchen on the right of screen, in a triangular arrangement. From season three on, the house was rearranged to accommodate multiple cameras and a studio audience.

The Cunninghams&#x27; official address is 565 North Clinton Drive, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The house that served as the exterior of the Cunningham residence is actually located at 565 North Cahuenga Boulevard (south of Melrose Avenue) in Los Angeles, several blocks from the Paramount lot on Melrose Avenue.

The Milky Way Drive-In, located on Port Washington Road in the North Shore suburb of Glendale, Wisconsin (now Kopp&#x27;s Frozen Custard Stand), was the inspiration for the original Arnold&#x27;s Drive-In; it has since been demolished. The exterior of Arnold&#x27;s was a standing set on the Paramount Studios lot that has since been demolished. This exterior was close to Stage 19, where the rest of the show&#x27;s sets were located.

The set of the diner in the first season was a room with the same vague details of the later set, such as the paneling, and the college pennants. When the show changed to a studio production in 1975, the set was widened and the entrance was hidden, but allowed an upstage, central entrance for cast members. The barely-seen kitchen was also upstaged and seen only through a pass-through window. The diner had orange booths, downstage center for closeup conversation, as well as camera left. There were two restroom doors camera right, labeled &quot;Guys&quot; and &quot;Dolls&quot;. A 1953 Seeburg Model G jukebox (with replaced metal pilasters from Wico Corp.) was positioned camera right, and an anachronistic &quot;Nip-It&quot; pinball machine (actually produced in 1972) was positioned far camera right.
In 2004, two decades after the first set was destroyed, the &quot;Happy Days 30th Anniversary Reunion&quot; requested that the reunion take place in Arnold&#x27;s. The set was rebuilt by production designer James Yarnell based on the original floor plan. The reunion special was taped at CBS Television City&#x27;s Bob Barker Studio in September 2004.

=== Theme music ===

Season one used a newly recorded version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets (recorded in the fall of 1973) as the opening theme song. This recording was not commercially released at the time, although the original 1954 recording returned to the American Billboard charts in 1974 as a result of the song&#x27;s use on the show. The &quot;Happy Days&quot; recording had its first commercial release in 2005 by the German label Hydra Records. (When &quot;Happy Days&quot; entered syndication in 1979, the series was retitled &quot;Happy Days Again&quot; and used an edited version of the 1954 recording instead of the 1973 version.) In some prints intended for reruns and overseas broadcasts, as well as on the Season 2 DVD set release and later re-releases of the Season 1 DVD set, the original &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; opening theme is replaced by the more standard &quot;Happy Days&quot; theme, because of music rights issues.

The show&#x27;s closing theme song in seasons one and two was a fragment from &quot;Happy Days&quot; (although in a different recording with a different lyric from that which would become the standard version), whose music was composed by Charles Fox and whose lyric was written by Norman Gimbel. According to SAG, this version was performed by Jim Haas on lead vocals, The Ron Hicklin Singers, Stan Farber, Jerry Whitman, and Gary Garrett on backing vocals, and studio musicians.

From seasons three to ten inclusive, a longer version of &quot;Happy Days&quot; replaced &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; at the beginning of the show. Released as a single in 1976 by Pratt &amp; McClain, &quot;Happy Days&quot; cracked the Top 5. The show itself finished the 1976–77 television season at No. 1, ending the five-year Nielsen reign of &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

For the show&#x27;s 11th and final season (1983–84), the theme was rerecorded in a more modern style. It featured Bobby Arvon on lead vocals, with several back-up vocalists. To accompany this new version, new opening credits were filmed, and the flashing &quot;Happy Days&quot; logo was reanimated to create an overall &quot;new&quot; feel which incorporated 1980s sensibilities with 1950s nostalgia (although by this time the show was set in 1965).

=== Merchandising revenue lawsuit ===
On April 19, 2011, &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-stars Erin Moran, Don Most, Marion Ross and Anson Williams, as well as the estate of Tom Bosley (who died in 2010), filed a $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS, which owns the show, claiming they had not been paid for merchandising revenues owed under their contracts. The cast members claimed they had not received revenues from show-related items, including comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunch boxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards and DVDs where their images appear on the box covers. Under their contracts, they were supposed to be paid 5% of the net proceeds of merchandising if their sole image were used, and half that amount if they were in a group. CBS said it owed the actors $8,500 and $9,000 each, most of it from slot machine revenues, but the group said they were owed millions. The lawsuit was initiated after Ross was informed by a friend playing slots at a casino of a &quot;Happy Days&quot; machine on which players win the jackpot when five Marion Rosses are rolled.

In October 2011, a judge rejected the group&#x27;s fraud claim, which meant they could not receive millions of dollars in potential damages. On June 5, 2012, a judge denied a motion filed by CBS to have the case thrown out, which meant it would go to trial on July 17 if the matter was not settled by then. In July 2012, the actors settled their lawsuit with CBS. Each received a payment of $65,000 and a promise by CBS to continue honoring the terms of their contracts.

== Daytime reruns ==
The series was rebroadcast on ABC from September 1, 1975, to March 30, 1979.

== Legacy ==
In 1978, actor Robin Williams made his screen debut during the fifth season of &quot;Happy Days,&quot; as the character &quot;Mork&quot; in the episode &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;. Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition. While portraying Mork on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice, and he made the most of the script. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives were deeply impressed with his performance. As such, the executives moved quickly to get the performer on contract just four days later before competitors could make their own offers.

In 1980, the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution asked Winkler to donate one of Fonzie&#x27;s leather jackets.

In 1985, Jon Hein developed the phrase jumping the shark in response to the season 5 episode &quot;Hollywood: Part 3&quot;, written by Fred Fox Jr., which aired on September 20, 1977. In this episode, Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water-skis. The phrase is used to suggest that a creative outlet appears to be making a misguided attempt at generating new attention or publicity for something that is perceived to be once, but no longer, widely popular. In a 2019 interview with NPR, Terry Gross asked Winkler what it was &quot;about that scene or that episode that came to signify when something&#x27;s time is upwhen it&#x27;s over?&quot; Winkler responded: &quot;You know what? I don&#x27;t know. To them, the Fonz water skiing was just like the last straw. The only thing is it wasn&#x27;t to the audience because we were number one for years after that. So it didn&#x27;t much matter to anybody.&quot; In addition, he told TheWrap in 2018 that he is &quot;not embarrassed&quot; by the phrase. He stated that &quot;newspapers would mention jumping the shark... and they would show a picture of me in my leather jacket and swim shorts water-skiing. And at that time I had great legs. So I thought, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care.&#x27; And we were number one for the next four or five years.&quot; As his character Barry Zuckerkorn (in the sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot;) hopped over a shark in Episode 13 of the second season, Winkler also noted that there &quot;was a book, there was a board game and it is an expression that is still used today ... [and] I&#x27;m very proud that I am the only actor, maybe in the world, that has jumped the shark twiceonce on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and once on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.&quot;

In 1999 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Fonzie as number 4 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list.

In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 in the UK, the Fonz was ranked 13th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

In 2008, American artist Gerald P. Sawyer unveiled the Bronze Fonz (a public artwork) on the Milwaukee Riverwalk in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

In December 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Happy Days&quot; number 87 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

== Home media ==
Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released the first six seasons of &quot;Happy Days&quot; on DVD in Region 1, as of December 2, 2014. For the second season, CBS features music replacements due to copyright issues, including the theme song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. (&#x27;The Complete First Season&#x27; retains the original opening, as it was released before CBS was involved). Only seasons 1, 3 and 4 of the DVD release contain the original music. The sixth season was released on December 2, 2014. The remaining 5 seasons have not been released.

The season 7 premiere &quot;Shotgun Wedding: Part 1&quot; was also released on the &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; season 5 DVD. To date, this is the last episode released on home media.

The first four seasons have also been released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) and Australia (Region 4).

== Reunion specials ==
There have been two reunion specials which aired on ABC: the first was &quot;The Happy Days Reunion Special&quot; originally aired in March 1992, followed by &quot;Happy Days: 30th Anniversary Reunion&quot; in February 2005 to commemorate the program&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Both were set up in interview/clip format.

== Spin-offs ==
&quot;Happy Days&quot; resulted in seven different spin-off series, including two that were animated: &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley,&quot; &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties,&quot; &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy,&quot; &quot;Out of the Blue,&quot; &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi,&quot; &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot; (animated), and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley with The Fonz&quot; (animated).
* The most successful of these spin-offs, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1976–83) starring Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams, respectively, also took place in early/mid-1960s Milwaukee. As Shotz Brewery workers, modeled after the Miller, Schlitz, and Pabst Breweries once located in Milwaukee, Laverne and Shirley find themselves in adventures with The Fonz, Lenny and Squiggy and even the Cunninghams also living in the midwestern city. The two starring characters eventually moved to Los Angeles in the show&#x27;s later years. Penny Marshall was the sister of producer Garry Marshall. &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; had a crossover episode, &quot;Shotgun Wedding&quot;, in which Richie and Fonzie get into trouble with a farmer for courting his daughters, and Laverne and Shirley try to help them. Part one is the season seven premiere of &quot;Happy Days&quot; and part two is the season five premiere of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;.
* After Robin Williams appeared as Mork in &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;, he was given his own sitcom, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; (1978–82). In this series, Mork is an alien from the planet Ork, who lands in 1970s Boulder, Colorado, to study humans. He moves in with Pam Dawber&#x27;s character of Mindy McConnell.
* &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; (1982–83) was a show about Richie&#x27;s younger sister Joanie and Fonzie&#x27;s younger cousin Chachi&#x27;s relationship during their years as musicians in Chicago. While commonly believed that the show was canceled due to low ratings, the program finished in the Top 20 its first season, but ABC determined that the show was losing too much of its lead-in, suggesting low appeal if the show were moved (a suggestion that came to be realized, as the show&#x27;s ratings dropped dramatically after a move to another time slot in its second season). This type of cancellation seemed strange in the early 1980s, but soon became a commonplace part of TV audience research.
* &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1979) is a spin-off of &quot;Happy Days,&quot; though a scheduling error had the series airing prior to the main character&#x27;s introduction on &quot;Happy Days.&quot;
* &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties&quot; (1977) starred Nancy Walker as former Las Vegas showgirl Nancy Blansky. One week before the show&#x27;s premiere, the Blansky character appeared on &quot;Happy Days&quot; as a cousin of Howard Cunningham. Scott Baio and Lynda Goodfriend co-starred before joining &quot;Happy Days&quot; the following fall, and Pat Morita reprised his role of Arnold. Similarly, Eddie Mekka of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; played the cousin of his Carmine character, while pulling double duty as a regular in both shows.

Spin-off pilots that did not succeed include &quot;The Ralph and Potsie Show&quot; as well as &quot;The Pinky Tuscadero Show&quot;.

== List of songs performed on &quot;Happy Days&quot; ==

=== Musicals ===
In the late 1990s, a touring arena show called &quot;Happy Days: The Arena Spectacular&quot; toured Australia&#x27;s major cities. The story featured a property developer, and former girlfriend of Fonzie&#x27;s, called Miss Frost (Rebecca Gibney), wanting to buy the diner and redevelop it. It starred Craig McLachlan as Fonzie, Max Gillies and Wendy Hughes as Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham, Doug Parkinson as Al, and Jo Beth Taylor as Richie&#x27;s love interest Laura. Tom Bosley presented an introduction before each performance live on stage, and pop group Human Nature played a 1950s-style rock group.

Another stage show, &quot;Happy Days: A New Musical,&quot; began touring in 2008.

====Music videos====
The music video for the song &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; (which takes place at Arnold&#x27;s Drive-in) by Weezer features footage from the series, including clips of Richie, Potsie, Ralph Malph, Joanie, and Fonzie. Al Molinaro also reprises his role as Al Delvecchio in the video, joking about how bad his fish is at the beginning and end of the video.

=== Video games ===
A 1976 arcade racing game named Fonz was released based on Fonzie, with a picture of the character appearing on the side of the arcade cabinet.

<text>Chitin (C8H13O5N)n ( ) is a long-chain polymer of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine, an amide derivative of glucose. Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature (behind only cellulose); an estimated 1 billion tons of chitin are produced each year in the biosphere. It is a primary component of cell walls in fungi (especially filamentous and mushroom-forming fungi), the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae, cephalopod beaks and gladii of molluscs and in some nematodes and diatoms.
It is also synthesised by at least some fish and lissamphibians. Commercially, chitin is extracted from the shells of crabs, shrimps, shellfish and lobsters, which are major by-products of the seafood industry. The structure of chitin is comparable to cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. It is functionally comparable to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved useful for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;chitin&quot; comes from the French word &quot;chitine&quot;, which was derived in 1821 from the Greek word χιτών (&quot;khitōn&quot;) meaning covering.

A similar word, &quot;chiton&quot;, refers to a marine animal with a protective shell.

== Chemistry, physical properties and biological function ==

The structure of chitin was determined by Albert Hofmann in 1929. Hofmann hydrolyzed chitin using a crude preparation of the enzyme chitinase, which he obtained from the snail &quot;Helix pomatia&quot;.

Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy--glucose). These units form covalent β-(1→4)-linkages (like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose). Therefore, chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced with an acetyl amine group. This allows for increased hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers, giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.

In its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most arthropods, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of composite materials, such as in sclerotin, a tanned proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects. Combined with calcium carbonate, as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate. Another difference between pure and composite forms can be seen by comparing the flexible body wall of a caterpillar (mainly chitin) to the stiff, light elytron of a beetle (containing a large proportion of sclerotin).

In butterfly wing scales, chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotypic signaling and communication for mating and foraging. The elaborate chitin gyroid construction in butterfly wings creates a model of optical devices having potential for innovations in biomimicry. Scarab beetles in the genus &quot;Cyphochilus&quot; also utilize chitin to form extremely thin scales (five to fifteen micrometres thick) that diffusely reflect white light. These scales are networks of randomly ordered filaments of chitin with diameters on the scale of hundreds of nanometres, which serve to scatter light. The multiple scattering of light is thought to play a role in the unusual whiteness of the scales. In addition, some social wasps, such as &quot;Protopolybia chartergoides&quot;, orally secrete material containing predominantly chitin to reinforce the outer nest envelopes, composed of paper.

Chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin by treatment with sodium hydroxide. Chitosan has a wide range of biomedical applications including wound healing, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Due to its specific intermolecular hydrogen bonding network, dissolving chitin in water is very difficult. Chitosan (with a degree of deacetylation of more than ~28%), on the other hand, can be dissolved in dilute acidic aqueous solutions below a pH of 6.0 such as acetic, formic and lactic acids. Chitosan with a degree of deacetylation greater than ~49% is soluble in water

===Humans and other mammals===
Humans and other mammals have chitinase and chitinase-like proteins that can degrade chitin; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products, initiating an immune response.

Chitin is sensed mostly in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract where it can activate the innate immune system through eosinophils or macrophages, as well as an adaptive immune response through T helper cells. Keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments.

===Plants===
Plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin, namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein. The first chitin receptor was cloned in 2006. When the receptors are activated by chitin, genes related to plant defense are expressed, and jasmonate hormones are activated, which in turn activate systemic defenses. Commensal fungi have ways to interact with the host immune response that, , were not well understood.

Some pathogens produce chitin-binding proteins that mask the chitin they shed from these receptors. &quot;Zymoseptoria tritici&quot; is an example of a fungal pathogen that has such blocking proteins; it is a major pest in wheat crops.

==Fossil record==

Chitin was probably present in the exoskeletons of Cambrian arthropods such as trilobites. The oldest preserved (intact) chitin samples thus far reported are dated to the Oligocene, about , from specimens encased in amber where the chitin has not completely degraded.

== Uses ==

=== Agriculture ===
Chitin is a good inducer of plant defense mechanisms for controlling diseases. It has potential for use as a soil fertilizer or conditioner to improve fertility and plant resilience that may enhance crop yields.

=== Industrial ===
Chitin is used in many industrial processes. Examples of the potential uses of chemically modified chitin in food processing include the formation of edible films and as an additive to thicken and stabilize foods and food emulsions. Processes to size and strengthen paper employ chitin and chitosan.

==Research==
How chitin interacts with the immune system of plants and animals has been an active area of research, including the identity of key receptors with which chitin interacts, whether the size of chitin particles is relevant to the kind of immune response triggered, and mechanisms by which immune systems respond. Chitin is deacetylated chemically or enzymatically to produce chitosan, a highly biocompatible polymer which has found a wide range of applications in the biomedical industry. Chitin and chitosan have been explored as a vaccine adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate an immune response.

Chitin and chitosan are under development as scaffolds in studies of how tissue grows and how wounds heal, and in efforts to invent better bandages, surgical thread, and materials for allotransplantation. Sutures made of chitin have been experimentally developed, but their lack of elasticity and problems making thread have prevented commercial success so far.

Chitosan has been demonstrated and proposed to make a reproducible form of biodegradable plastic. Chitin nanofibers are extracted from crustacean waste and mushrooms for possible development of products in tissue engineering, drug delivery and medicine.

Chitin has been proposed for use in building structures, tools, and other solid objects from a composite material, combining chitin with Martian regolith. To build this, the biopolymers in the chitin are suggested as the binder for the regolith aggregate to form a concrete-like composite material. The authors believe that waste materials from food production (e.g. scales from fish, exoskeletons from crustaceans and insects, etc.) could be put to use as feedstock for manufacturing processes.
