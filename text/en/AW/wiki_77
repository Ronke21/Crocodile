<text>Primorsky Krai, informally known as Primorye, is a federal subject (a krai) of Russia, part of the Far Eastern Federal District in the Russian Far East. The city of Vladivostok on the southern coast of the krai is its administrative center, and the second largest city in the Russian Far East, behind Khabarovsk in the neighbouring Khabarovsk Krai. Primorsky Krai has the largest economy among the federal subjects in the Russian Far East, and a population of 1,845,165 as of the 2021 Census.

The krai has Russia&#x27;s only border with North Korea, along the Tumen River in Khasansky District in the southwestern corner of the krai. Peter the Great Gulf, the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan, is on the south coast.

The territory of the krai was historically part of Manchuria. It was ceded to the Russian Empire by Qing China in 1860 as part of a region known as Outer Manchuria, forming most of the territory of Primorskaya Oblast. As a result, China permanently lost its coastline with the Sea of Japan. During the Russian Civil War it became part of the Far Eastern Republic before joining the Soviet Union, going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938. Primorsky Krai is home to the Russian Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet and is also known as the birthplace of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.

==Etymology==
The name of the krai is derived from the Russian words (), meaning &quot;littoral&quot; or &quot;coastal&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;region&quot; or &quot;area&quot;. It is informally known as Primorye (, ) in Russian, and is occasionally translated as Maritime Territory in English.

==Geography==
*Border length — over , including of the sea borders.
*Highest peak — Anik Mountain, 
*Rail network length — (of which are electrified).
*Automobile road length — 

Primorsky Krai, bordered by China (Jilin and Heilongjiang), North Korea (Rason) and Khabarovsk Krai, and the relatively warm—although freezing in winter—waters of the Sea of Japan, is the southeasternmost region of Russia, located between the 42° and 48° north latitude and 130° and 139° east longitude. It is stretched in the meridianal direction, the distance from its extreme northern point to its most southerly point being about .

===Topography===

Highlands dominate the territory of the krai. Most of the territory is mountainous, and almost 80% of it is forested. The average elevation is about . Sikhote-Alin is a mountainous formation, extending for the most part of the Krai. It consists of a number of parallel ranges: the Partizansky (Partisan), the Siny (Blue), the Kholodny (Cold), and others. There are many karst caves in the south of Primorye, including the relatively accessible Spyashchaya Krasavitsa cave (the Sleeping Beauty) in the Ussuriysky Nature Preserve. There are comparatively well-preserved fragments of ancient volcanoes in the area.

The ranges are cut by the picturesque narrow and deep valleys of the rivers and by large brooks, such as the Partizanskaya, the Kiyevka, the Zerkalnaya, the Cheryomukhovaya, the Yedinka, the Samarga, the Bikin, and the Bolshaya Ussurka. Most rivers in the Krai have rocky bottoms and limpid water. The largest among them is the Ussuri, with a length of . The head of the Ussuri River originates east of Oblachnaya Mountain. The vast Khanka Lowlands extend into the west and southwest of Primorye, carpeted by coniferous-deciduous forest. A part of the Lowland surrounding the largest lake in the Russian Far East, Khanka Lake, is occupied by a forest-steppe.

===Coast and islands===
The krai&#x27;s coastline is fairly straight, except for the southernmost section around Vladivostok which contains the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula.
There are numerous islands in this area, the main ones being Lisy Island, Askold Island, Putyatin Island, Skrebtsov island, Sibiryakov Island, the Eugénie Archipelago (the largest island of which being Russky Island), the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago and Furugelm Island.

===Flora and fauna===
The geographic location of Primorye accounts for the variety of its flora. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past in contrast to the rest of Siberia during the ice ages. The specifics of the geographic situation and the specific features of climate determine the unique diversity of the plant world at species and genetic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye, there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which are about 250 species of trees, bushes, and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens are very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and threatened extermination.

There are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including ferns, lotus, and the willow &quot;Salix arbutifolia&quot; (syn. &quot;Chosenia arbutifolia&quot;). The flora of the territory contains such plants as &quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot;, &quot;Juniperus rigida&quot;, &quot;Phellodendron amurense&quot;, &quot;Kalopanax&quot;, &quot;Aralia elata&quot;, &quot;Maackia amurensis&quot;, &quot;Alnus japonica&quot;, &quot;Actinidia kolomikta&quot;, &quot;Schisandra chinensis&quot;, &quot;Celastrus orbiculatus&quot;, &quot;Thladiantha dubia&quot;, &quot;Weigela&quot;, &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot;, &quot;Flueggea suffruticosa&quot;, &quot;Deutzia&quot;, &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, &quot;Betula schmidtii&quot;, &quot;Carpinus cordata&quot;, &quot;Acer mandshuricum&quot;, &quot;Parthenocissus tricuspidata&quot;, &quot;Vitis amurensis&quot;, &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; and many others.

The fauna of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the Krai: Ussuri black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;), Amur tiger, Amur leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus orientalis&quot;), Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), Manchurian deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus xanthopygos&quot;), Siberian roe deer (&quot;Capreolus pygargus&quot;), musk deer (&quot;Moschus moschiferus&quot;), long-tailed goral (&quot;Naemorhedus caudatus&quot;), sika deer (&quot;Cervus nippon&quot;), sable (&quot;Martes zibellina&quot;), Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;Bubo blakistoni&quot;), mandarinka duck (&quot;Aix galericulata&quot;), black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;), scaly goosander (&quot;Mergus squamatus&quot;), chestnut-cheeked starling (&quot;Sturnia philippensis&quot;), black griffon (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), large-winged cuckoo (family Cuculidae), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former USSR, 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of salmon, Hucho taimen, lenok and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wildlife Fund, Wild Salmon Center, and Russian NGOs including Phoenix Fund are active in the region&#x27;s wildlife and habitat conservation.

===Climate===
*Primorsky Krai is dominated by a four-season humid continental climate.
*Average annual temperature — near in the north of the krai; on the southern coast.
*Average annual precipitation — .

==History==

The area is believed to have been settled by several Tungusic and Mongolic tribes, such as the Sushen, the proto-Mongol Shiwei and the Mohe. Although, there are other popular theories, such as the fact that the place was earlier settled by the Ainu people.

The Udege people are said to have traditionally settled in territories along the Bikin River long ago, however, they are possibly of Jianzhou Jurchen origin.

During the Balhae Kingdom, most of the krai was within the boundaries of the provinces of Dingli, Anbian and Anyuan. After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, the territory became part of Liao dynasty&#x27;s Eastern Circuit and Jin dynasty&#x27;s Supin Circuit. It then came under Mongol and Manchu rule.

The acquisition of Siberia by the Tsardom of Russia and the subsequent Russian expansion to the Far East brought the Russians into direct contact with China. The Nerchinsk Treaty of 1689 demarcating the borders of the two states gave all lands lying south of the Stanovoy Mountains, including Primorye, to the Qing Empire. However, with the weakening of the Qing Empire in the second half of the 19th century, Russia began its expansion into the area. In 1858, the towns of Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk were founded. In 1858, Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky signed the Aigun Treaty with China, followed by the Beijing Treaty two years later. As a result of the two treaties, the Sino–Russian border shifted south in the Amur Annexation to the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, granting Russia full control of Primorye.

Primorskaya Oblast was established as the easternmost division of the Russian Empire in 1856. It included the territory of modern Primorsky Krai as well as the territories of modern Khabarovsk Krai and Magadan Oblast, stretching from Vladivostok to the Chukchi Peninsula in the far north.

In the period from 1859 to 1882, ninety-five settlements were established in the Primorye region, including Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Razdolnoye, Vladimiro-Aleksandrovskoye, Shkotovo, Pokrovka, Tury Rog, and Kamen-Rybolov. Russians began migrating to these regions. The population was primarily engaged in hunting, fishing and cultivation. More than two-thirds of the territory&#x27;s inhabitants followed these occupations.
During the latter part of the 19th century, there was a significant resource, industrial and resulting economic development in Primorye. Coal mining became a prominent industry, as did the export of sea-kale, velvet antlers, timber, crab, dried fish, and trepangs. The rapid economic expansion of Primorye was financed in large measure by Russian and foreign capital investment.

After the Russian Revolution and the victory of the communists, the new government renamed Primorskaya Oblast as the Zemstvo of Maritime Territory. It was defined as the Far-Eastern Republic (1920–1922). Within the Russian SFSR, this became Far-Eastern Oblast (1922–1926) and then Far-Eastern Krai (1926–1938).

The area became a battleground for allied and Bolshevik troops during the Siberian Intervention. In 1922, shortly before the end of the Civil War, Primorye came under Bolshevik control. The new government directed the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the territory. The Soviet Government spent the following ten years combating &quot;bourgeois ideology&quot; in many areas of life and culture. As a result, the music, theater, literature, and the fine arts of Primorye were censored.

Primorsky was the center of the ethnic Korean minority of Russia. The Pos&#x27;et Korean National Raion was created under the policy of Korenizatsiya. The Krai had 105 both fully and mixed Korean towns where residents used the Korean language as an official language. Nearly 200,000 ethnic Koreans were living in the Krai by the time of their deportation in 1938. The Soviet Union had earlier deported ethnic Chinese from western Siberia.

During this period, the Soviet government emphasized centralized planning of the economy. As in the rest of the Soviet Union, priority was given to heavy industry, with a special emphasis on mining and commercial fishing. There was a widespread investment in the construction of rail and sea transit, and new port facilities were constructed.

Primorsky Krai was formed by further subdivision of Far-Eastern Krai in 1938, as part of the Stalin-era policy of &quot;unbundling&quot;. Primorsky Krai, as defined in 1938, corresponds to the northeastern part of the historical region of Outer Manchuria.

On April 18, 1942, the region became accidentally involved in World War II, which the United States had entered after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Primorsky Krai was the location where one of 16 United States Army Air Corps B-25 Mitchell medium bombers landed. The group had been launched from USS &quot;Hornet&quot; to carry out the Doolittle Raid on Japan. Japan and the Soviet Union were not then at war. The landing occurred 40 miles (65 km) west of Vladivostok; the bomber&#x27;s crew could not return to their base, the aircraft carrier &quot;Hornet,&quot; by the mission plan. The crew later returned home via Iran.

During the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded scientific institutions in Primorye, especially in the city of Vladivostok. Several large research institutions are located here, such as the Institute of Biology and Agriculture, the Pacific Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, the Institute of Marine Biology, the Pacific Institute of Geography, the Pacific Oceanological Institute, as well as several Institutes affiliated with the Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Science.

By the early 1990s, once-small enterprises in the city had developed into large companies. Some of the most prominent include the DVMP (FESCO) shipping company, the Dalmoreprodukt fishing company, Progress Arsenyev Aircraft Works, and Vostok Mining. Commercial fishing plays an important part in the economy of the Primorye and includes firms like Vladivostok Trawling and Refrigerating Fleet (VBTRF), the Active Marine Fisheries Base of Nakhodka, and the Fishing and Marine Transport Fleet of Primorye. Numerous enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex were also established in Primorye.

The Udege people, led by Pavel Sulyandziga, are trying to gain control over their traditional territories along the Bikin River and in particular a Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use of federal status.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Primorsky CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After 1991, the head of the Oblast administration and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Primorsky Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai is the province&#x27;s regional standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Administrative divisions==
==Economy==
Primorsky Krai&#x27;s economy, the most balanced in the Russian Far East, is also the largest in absolute terms. Food production is the most important sector, represented mainly by fish processing. Annual catch exceeds two million tonnes, or one half of the Russian Far East total. Second is machine building, where half of the output is geared toward the fishing industry and shipyards. Defense is another important sector, producing naval vessels and military aircraft. The construction materials industry here provides for the whole Russian Far East. Lead smelting is conducted in Rudnaya Pristan on the coast.

The timber industry, though in recession, is still second only to Khabarovsk Krai&#x27;s with an annual yield of about 3 million cubic meters of timber. Primorsky Krai is the largest coal producer in the Russian Far East and generates more electricity than any other Russian Far East administrative division, but power shortages are common. Agriculture is also important; the krai produces rice, milk, eggs, and vegetables.
The krai&#x27;s proximity to Pacific Rim markets gives it an edge over most other Russian Far East administrative divisions in developing foreign trade. Major trade items are seafood products, timber products, and ferrous metals. Major trading partners are Japan, China, and South Korea.The economy will be further diversified with the addition of as many as 8 government sanctioned casinos to be built in the Primorye Gambling Zone, which encompasses the entire Primorsky Krai. Primorsky Entertainment Resort City, under development by NagaCorp Ltd. of Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia, will be the largest. The development is expected to cost in the region of RUB11.6 billion (approximately HK$2.7 billion, US$350 million) and have a total footprint of 214.89 hectares.

Primorsky Krai&#x27;s compact territory is well endowed with infrastructure. Its railway density is twice the Russian average. Railroads connect it with China and North Korea. Vladivostok, the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, was surpassed as a port by the nearby Nakhodka-Vostochny Port container, coal and timber terminals. Primorsky Krai-based shipping companies provide 80% of marine shipping services in the Russian Far East. All the krai&#x27;s significant ports are now open to international shipping.

The largest companies in the region include Far-Eastern Energy Company, NNK-Bunker, Mazda Sollers, and Vostochny Port.

==Natural resources==
===Coal===
More than 100 deposits of coal are known in Primorsky Krai. The commercial deposits of coal are connected to the Partizansky and Razdolnensky coal basins, the Podgorodnensky deposit, the Uglovsky basin, and the Shkotovsky, Pavlovsky, Bikinsky, Rettikhovsky, and Suputinsky deposits.

Partizansky Basin: The city of Partizansk is located in the southern part of the basin. The total area of the basin is . The basin has been known since the 19th century and has been explored since 1902. Five regions—Staropartizansky, Melnikovsky, Belopadinsky, Molchanovsky, and Sergeyevsky—are within the limits of the basin. The coal is anthracite coal. By the output of volatile substances and caking ability, rich coals prevail. The reserves of coal in the basin total 193.6 million tonnes. The deposits are maintained by the mines of the Partizanskugol Association. A coal-mining factory also operates in this area.

<text>Erica Abi Wright (born February 26, 1971), known professionally as Erykah Badu (), is an American singer and songwriter. Influenced by R&amp;B, soul, and hip hop, Badu rose to prominence in the late 1990s when her debut album &quot;Baduizm&quot; (1997), placed her at the forefront of the neo soul movement, earning her the nickname &quot;Queen of Neo Soul&quot; by music critics.

Badu&#x27;s career began after she opened a show for D&#x27;Angelo in 1994 in Fort Worth, leading to record label executive Kedar Massenburg signing her to Kedar Entertainment. Her first album, &quot;Baduizm&quot;, was released in February 1997. It spawned four singles: &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, &quot;Appletree&quot;, &quot;Next Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Otherside of the Game&quot;. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her first live album, &quot;Live&quot;, was released in November 1997, contained her signature song &quot;Tyrone&quot; and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.

Her second studio album, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot;, was released in 2000. It spawned three singles: &quot;Bag Lady&quot;, which became her first top 10 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 peaking at #6, &quot;Didn&#x27;t Cha Know?&quot; and &quot;Cleva&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Badu&#x27;s third album, &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot;, was released in 2003. It generated three singles: &quot;Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Back in the Day (Puff)&quot;, with the first becoming her second song to reach the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at #9. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. Badu&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot;, was released in 2008. It spawned two singles: &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot;. &quot;New Amerykah Part Two&quot; was released in 2010 and fared well both critically and commercially. It contained the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Window Seat&quot;, which led to controversy.

Badu&#x27;s voice has been compared to jazz singer Billie Holiday. Early in her career, Badu was recognizable for her style, which often included wearing very large and colorful headwraps. She was a core member of the Soulquarians. As an actress, she has played a number of supporting roles in movies including &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and &quot;House of D&quot;. She also has appeared in the documentaries &quot;Before the Music Dies&quot; and &quot;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975.&quot;

==Early life==
Erica Abi Wright was born in Dallas, Texas. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. The children&#x27;s maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu began singing and dancing at the age of four at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King.

By the age of 14, Badu was freestyling for a local radio station alongside artists such as Roy Hargrove. In her youth, she had decided to change the spelling of her first name from Erica to Erykah, as she believed her original name was a &quot;slave name&quot;. The term &quot;kah&quot; signifies the inner self. She adopted the surname &quot;Badu&quot; because it is her favorite jazz scat sound; also, among the Akan people in Ghana, it is the term for the 10th-born child.

After graduating from Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Badu went on to study theater at Grambling State University, a historically black university. She left the university in 1993 before graduating, to focus more fully on music. During this time, Badu took several minimum-wage jobs to support herself. She taught drama and dance to children at the South Dallas Cultural Center. Working and touring with her cousin, Robert &quot;Free&quot; Bradford, she recorded a 19-song demo, &quot;Country Cousins&quot;, which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D&#x27;Angelo, &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records.

==Career==

===1997–1999: &quot;Baduizm&quot; and &quot;Live&quot; ===
&quot;Baduizm&quot;, Badu&#x27;s debut album, was released in early 1997. The album met with critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. &quot;Baduizm&quot;″s commercial and critical success helped establish Badu as one of the emerging neo soul genre&#x27;s leading artists. Her particular style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday.
&quot;Baduizm&quot; was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

The album produced four singles; the lead single &quot;On &amp; On&quot; was released in December 1996, and reached number 12 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts and the UK Singles Charts, as well as making an appearance on the New Zealand charts. The album and lead single also gave Badu her first nomination and win at the Grammy Awards, where &quot;On &amp; On&quot; won Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and the album won Best R&amp;B Album.

Badu recorded her first live album, &quot;Live&quot;, while pregnant with Seven, and the release of the recording coincided with his birth. The album was released on November 18, 1997 and reached number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200
and number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified two times platinum by RIAA for shipments of over two million copies. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Tyrone&quot;, was released in October 1997 and became another R&amp;B hit single. &quot;Tyrone&quot;, lyrically, is a song chiding a selfish, cheap, and inattentive boyfriend.
Badu also collaborated with the Roots (who had previously handled production duties on a number of tracks on &quot;Baduizm&quot;) on their breakthrough 1999 release &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. She was featured on the song &quot;You Got Me&quot;, by The Roots and American women rapper Eve. Co-written by Jill Scott, the song peaked at 39 in the U.S. and 31 in the UK. The song went on to win The Roots and Badu a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1999.

===2000–2006: &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; ===

After taking some time off to raise her child, Badu returned in 2000 with &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun.&quot; The album was characterized as more organic in sound than her previous studio album, and primarily produced by the Soulquarians and noted bassist Pino Palladino. A remix of one of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Bag Lady&quot;, was issued as the first single and topped the R&amp;B charts for seven weeks. The album was well-received, with the lyrical content winning notices from many publications. Reviewers found some of her lyrics hard to decipher on her initial releases. Despite not charting as high as her first two albums, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was another platinum-selling success, and &quot;Bag Lady&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award.

By 2000, Badu was in a romantic relationship with fellow Soulquarian Common. The two released &quot;Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)&quot; as a collaboration on the &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Love of My Life&quot; hit #9 on the pop charts, topped the R&amp;B listings, and in 2003 Badu was awarded her fourth Grammy Award for it.
In 2001 Badu embarked on the &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun World Tour&quot;. The tour started in North America on February 10 in Cleveland, Ohio at the Allen Theatre. 
After the release of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, Badu suffered writer&#x27;s block.

On September 16, 2003, she released her third studio album, &quot;Worldwide Underground.&quot; The album was more jam-oriented than any of her prior releases, and Badu said that the album was designed to be &quot;one continuous groove.&quot; Upon its release &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; met with some criticism for its loose, unconventional structure and songwriting, but the album received generally positive reviews from critics.
Commercially the album fared well and debuted at number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the week of October 4, 2003, selling 143,561 copies in its first week. Ultimately spending 11 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it also entered at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and spent 30 weeks on the chart.

It began in 2005 as an event to bring awareness to health issues to African-American women. British duo Floetry opened shows during the 2005 run. The festival was relaunched briefly in 2006 with Kelis opening the show and comedian Mo&#x27;Nique hosting the festival. 2006 was its final year. The festival had plans to expand into Europe and Asia, but this did not come to fruition. The &quot;Summer Tour&quot; was a concert tour in 2006 by Badu. The tour started on June 10, in Knoxville, TN, with three shows in the U.S., and resumed in July for several shows in Europe. Badu co-headlined on dates in August with Jill Scott and Queen Latifah at the Sugar Water Festival.

===2007–2009: &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot;===
After receiving her first computer as a Christmas gift, Badu began communicating with and receiving music from Questlove, Q-Tip and J Dilla, among others. She later began to use her laptop as a mini recording studio to construct various backing tracks for songs, which led to the album&#x27;s primary recording sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.
In 2007 Badu was said to have three albums in the works for release during 2007 and 2008. &quot;Honey&quot;, a new single produced by 9th Wonder, was leaked online in November 2007. The fourth studio album, &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot;, was released by Universal Motown Records, in the United States on February 26, 2008, Badu&#x27;s 37th birthday. It was released in European countries on February 29, in Australia and the United Kingdom on March 3, and in Japan on March 12. Both Japanese and Australian editions contain the bonus track &quot;Real Thang&quot;.

===2010–2014: &quot;New Amerykah Part Two&quot; and Window Seat controversy===
&quot;New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)&quot;, Badu&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released March 30, 2010, on Universal Motown in the United States. It was released in Japan on April 14, 2010. Upon release the album was met with general acclaim from critics. The album debuted at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 110,000 copies in its first week. It also entered at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

In Canada, the album debuted at number 36 on the Top 100 and at number five on the R&amp;B Top 50 chart. &quot;New Amerykah Part Two&quot; achieved moderate chart success in international markets, peaking within the top 50 in several countries, including Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark.

During March 2010, Badu promoted the album through television performances on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Good Day New York&quot;. She also appeared on the April issue cover of &quot;EQ&quot; magazine and was featured in issues of &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, and &quot;People&quot;, among others. Badu performed at a surprise midnight show on March 31, 2010 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.

The internet-only promotional single &quot;Jump up in the Air (Stay There)&quot;, featuring Lil Wayne and Bilal, was released on Badu&#x27;s official website in January 2010. RC Williams, Badu&#x27;s musical director, said that a music video for the track was shot in Dallas. The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Window Seat&quot;, was released by Badu through a downloadable link on her Twitter page. The song peaked at number 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)&quot;, was released March 24, 2010 by Badu as a free download online. It spent three weeks on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 87.
On Wednesday, February 9, 2011, Vimeo.com released a new video for &quot;Gone Baby, Don&#x27;t Be Long&quot;, directed by Flying Lotus. The video was tweeted by Badu herself and friend and associated music act Questlove from the Roots.

On March 13, 2010, Badu filmed the video for her song &quot;Window Seat&quot;, at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. She wrote on her Twitter feed that the video &quot;was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then ran like hell.&quot; The team did not acquire permission or permits from the city. In the video, Badu shed her clothes as she walked along a Dallas sidewalk until she was nude at the site where Kennedy was shot. A shot rang out as the song ended, Badu&#x27;s head jerked back, and she fell to the ground. Children with their families could be seen nearby as Badu stripped. When asked about stripping nude in the presence of minors, Badu said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think about them until I saw them, and in my mind I tried to telepathically communicate my good intent to them. That&#x27;s all I could do, and I hoped they wouldn&#x27;t be traumatized.&quot;

Badu said on &quot;The Wanda Sykes Show&quot; on April 3, 2010, that it was not her intention to insult the memory of the late President John F. Kennedy (JFK): &quot;My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation&#x27;s heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth.&quot; Coodie and Chike, directors of the &quot;Window Seat&quot; video, said they had bail money ready during filming in case Badu was arrested. Badu said the video was a protest against &quot;groupthink&quot; and was inspired by Matt and Kim&#x27;s music video &quot;Lessons Learned.&quot; Badu has also said she has &quot;no regrets&quot;.

In 2011 Badu appeared on Flying Lotus&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Until the Quiet Comes&quot;. Badu appeared on the debut album by the supergroup Rocketjuice and The Moon, which was released in March 2012 and the album &quot;Black Radio&quot; by Robert Glasper. In 2013, Badu appeared on &quot;Treehome95&quot; from Tyler, The Creator&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Wolf&quot; as well as on the song &quot;Heaven for the Sinner&quot; from Bonobo&#x27;s album &quot;The North Borders&quot;. Badu featured on Janelle Monáe&#x27;s first single from her second studio album, &quot;The Electric Lady&quot;, &quot;Q.U.E.E.N.&quot; The song premiered on SoundCloud and was made available for download purchase at the iTunes Store on April 23, 2013. The song peaked at 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.

===2015–2019: Touring and mixtapes ===
In May 2013, Badu announced she was writing her next project, but not placing a time constraint on it.
In July 2014, Badu revealed she was still working on the album and had been recording in April in Africa where she was &quot;laying down drum tracks&quot;. Badu also said that prior to her trip to Africa she would have meetings with her record label to set a deadline for the album.
Later that year Badu expanded on the album, stating she was working with producer Flying Lotus, who she met via MySpace years ago; they later met in L.A. at guitarist Steve Wilson&#x27;s house.

After one week of exclusive release on iTunes, &quot;But You Caint Use My Phone&quot; was released to other digital retailers and streaming services on December 4, 2015. The mixtape was released without the knowledge of her label Universal, due to Badu sending the record straight to iTunes. It also marked Badu&#x27;s first release under her own record label, Control Freaq. &quot;But You Caint Use My Phone&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Badu also hosted the 2015, 2016 and the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards.

The same year, Badu released new three tracks on SoundCloud, including &quot;Trill Friends&quot;, &quot;Thru It All&quot; and &quot;Come See Badu&quot;. On January 24, 2018, she announced a release of a new mixtape, but like the aforementioned mixtape, remains unreleased. In a publication on &quot;Vulture&quot;, Badu announced she was slowly making progress on her sixth studio album.

Badu held her annual &quot;Still Boomin&#x27;&quot; sold-out birthday bash concert at The Bomb Factory on February 26, 2016, marking her second performance at the venue since its grand opening 11 months earlier. The event was hosted by Badu&#x27;s close friend Dave Chappelle and featured a surprise appearance by André 3000 of the duo Outkast.

===2020–present: Contributions and features ===
In May 2020, she featured on a single titled &quot;Beehoove&quot; alongside D&#x27;Angelo on Slingbaum&#x27;s vinyl-only release debut studio album, &quot;Slingbaum One&quot;. On June 19, 2020 Badu featured on the song &quot;Lowkey&quot; by singer Teyana Taylor. In August 2020, Badu contributed to the live streamed recording of Bilal&#x27;s EP &quot;VOYAGE-19&quot;, created remotely during the COVID-19 lockdowns. It was released the following month with proceeds from its sales going to participating musicians in financial hardship from the pandemic. In December 2022, she featured on a track titled &quot;Yun&quot; on RM&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Indigo.&quot;

==Musical style==
Badu&#x27;s work draws from R&amp;B, 1970s soul, and 1980s hip hop, and became associated with the neo soul subgenre in the 1990s along with artists like D&#x27;Angelo. For her musical sensibilities, she has often been compared to jazz great Billie Holiday. Badu&#x27;s has been described as an experimental R&amp;B singer, and her work explores contemporary forms of soul and hip hop. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; is a neo soul album, that incorporates funk, soul, and jazz styles. The album has been viewed by critics as a women&#x27;s companion to neo soul artist D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s second album &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; followed in the same vein as Badu&#x27;s previous efforts: the album is neo-soul and prominently incorporates hip hop and funk elements, while also featuring an unconventional musical structure.
&quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot; has a dense stylistic amalgam that primarily incorporates funk, soul, and hip hop genres, as well as jazz and electronica. In contrast to its predecessor, &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot; (2008), which was digitally produced and political in tone, &quot;New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)&quot; incorporates sampling and live instrumentation.
The majority of Badu&#x27;s music is greatly influenced by her beliefs of the Nation of Gods and Earths and her exploration of her African heritage. The songs in her album &quot;Baduizm&quot; express her personal take on life. Her philosophy is influenced by African ideology, African-centered and Five Percent theologies, and Southern African-American folk traditions. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; has a confessional lyrical theme, covering themes of insecurity, social issues, and personal relationships. &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; contains minimalist songwriting concerning hip hop culture, love, ghetto life, and gang culture. &quot;New Amerykah Part One&quot; is an esoteric concept album with sociopolitical themes and mostly downbeat subject matter, featuring more impersonal topics and social commentary than on Badu&#x27;s previous work. Its subject matter deals with social concerns and struggles within the African-American community, exploring topics such as institutional racism, religion, poverty, urban violence, the abuse of power, complacency, cultural identity, drug addiction, and nihilism. Badu has said that the album discusses &quot;religion, [...] poor families, the undermining of the working class, the so-called minority&quot;, Lyrically, &quot;New Amerykah Part Two&quot; is more personal than its predecessor, focusing on themes of romance and relationships. Badu has described its sound as &quot;very analog&quot;.

Badu is inspired by &quot;stimulating&quot; experiences. She was also influenced greatly by her music teacher Ms. Goodman, who encouraged her to take up music. Badu also takes influence from her grandmother and her religious views which Erykah described as a lesson saying &quot;When you do it, it gotta be real, or that&#x27;s not it.&quot;

The charity was established in 1997 and aims to provide &quot;community-driven development for inner-city youth&quot; through the use of music, dance, theater and visual arts. The organization&#x27;s first endeavor was to establish a base of operations. Erykah chose to renovate and reopen the Black Forest Theater in South Dallas.
The Black Forest serves as a community center, bringing people together in order to celebrate the art and culture of south Dallas.
The Black Forest&#x27;s stage is equipped for shows and performances, and has hosted both free and fundraising concerts by music artists including Prince, Snoop Dogg, Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild, Dead Prez, Talib Kweli and Questlove from The Roots.

==Legal issues and controversies==
On April 2, 2010, Badu was charged with disorderly conduct for appearing nude in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas while filming the music video for her single &quot;Window Seat&quot; during March, 2010. The video debuted online March 27, 2010. The video had been filmed spontaneously, without notifying Dallas government officials. Though Badu&#x27;s performance had an estimated hundreds of eyewitnesses, none complained to police at the time of the incident. After the video gained attention online, the Dallas Police Department actively sought witnesses and complainants. Sgt. Warren Mitchell said the decision to cite Badu for a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 came after witness Ida Espinosa, 32, of Vernon, offered a sworn statement to police Thursday, April 1. Espinosa declined to comment to The Associated Press. On April 28, 2010, Badu pleaded not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 ticket and began a term of six months&#x27; probation.

In February 2012, Badu&#x27;s concert was cancelled in Malaysia because it was found that she had applied a temporary tattoo of the word Allah on a part of her body. The temporary tattoo was perceived as insulting to Islam, the nation&#x27;s majority religion.

In April 2014, Badu came under fire by the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation, for performing at the birthday celebration of King Mswati III, ruler and monarch of Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland). Mswati, credited as Africa&#x27;s last absolute monarch, is considered to be a serial human-rights abuser, ruling in luxury in a country infamous for its poverty and spiraling HIV rates. Badu presented Mswati with a $100 bill, and a good-luck stone.

In a January 2018 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, Badu was asked about accusations of antisemitism based on a 2008 &quot;Haaretz&quot; article which describes her telling a Tel Aviv crowd, &quot;[Louis] Farrakhan is not an anti-Semite. He loves all people.&quot; She denied being antisemitic, but said, &quot;I&#x27;m a humanist. I see good in everybody. I saw something good in Hitler.&quot; After being asked to clarify her comments, Badu praised Hitler&#x27;s paintings.

In the same interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, Badu reacted differently than most other American celebrities about Bill Cosby&#x27;s sexual predation, saying, &quot;I love Bill Cosby, and I love what he&#x27;s done for the world. But if he&#x27;s sick, why would I be angry with him?&quot;

In a January 2019 concert, Badu elicited boos from the audience after giving support to musician R. Kelly, saying: &quot;I dunno how everybody else feel about it but I&#x27;m putting up a prayer right now for R. ... I love you. Unconditionally&quot;. Badu has been criticized for her perceived support of R. Kelly following the release of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot;, which debuted in Han 2019 and detailed numerous allegations of sexual abuse by Kelly.

<text>The following list consists of notable concepts that are derived from Islamic and associated cultural (Arab, Persian, Turkish) traditions, which are expressed as words in Arabic or Persian language. The main purpose of this list is to disambiguate multiple spellings, to make note of spellings no longer in use for these concepts, to define the concept in one or two lines, to make it easy for one to find and pin down specific concepts, and to provide a guide to unique concepts of Islam all in one place.

Separating concepts in Islam from concepts specific to Arab culture, or from the language itself, can be difficult. Many Arabic concepts have an Arabic secular meaning as well as an Islamic meaning. One example is the concept of dawah. Arabic, like all languages, contains words whose meanings differ across various contexts.

Arabic is written in its own alphabet, with letters, symbols, and orthographic conventions that do not have exact equivalents in the Latin alphabet (see Arabic alphabet). The following list contains transliterations of Arabic terms and phrases; variations exist, e.g. &quot;din&quot; instead of &quot;deen&quot; and &quot;aqidah&quot; instead of &quot;aqeedah&quot;. Most items in the list also contain their actual Arabic spelling.

== Explanatory notes ==
* Arabic words are created from three-letter &quot;roots&quot; which convey a basic idea. For example, k-t-b conveys the idea of writing. Addition of other letters before, between, and after the root letters produces many associated words: not only &quot;write&quot; but also &quot;book&quot;, &quot;office&quot;, &quot;library&quot;, and &quot;author&quot;. The abstract consonantal root for Islam is s-l-m.
*The English word algorithm is derived from the name of the inventor of algebra; similarly Arabic words like alchemy, alcohol, azimuth, nadir, zenith and oasis, which mean the same as in English. Arabic numerals are what we use in English (&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;...) 
* Some Islamic concepts are usually referred to in Persian or Turkic. Those are typically of later origin than the concepts listed here; for completeness it may be best to list Persian terms and those unique to Shi&#x27;a on their own page, likewise Turkic terms and those unique to the Ottoman period on their own page, as these are culturally very distinct.
* The word &quot;crusade&quot; in English is usually translated in Arabic as &quot;ḥamlah ṣalībīyah&quot; which means literally &quot;campaign of Cross-holders&quot; (or close to that meaning). In Arabic text it is &quot;&quot; and the second word comes from &quot;ṣalīb&quot; which means &quot;cross.&quot;

<text>A krai or kray (; , , &quot;kraya&quot;) is one of the types of federal subjects of modern Russia, and was a type of geographical administrative division in the Russian Empire and the Russian SFSR.

Etymologically, the word is related to the verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;kroit&#x27;&quot;), &quot;to cut&quot;. Historically, krais were vast territories located along the periphery of the Russian state, since the word &quot;krai&quot; also means &quot;border&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;, i.e., &quot;a place of the cut-off&quot;. In English the term is often translated as &quot;territory&quot;. , the administrative usage of the term is mostly traditional, as some oblasts also fit this description and there is no difference in constitutional legal status in Russia between the krais and the oblasts.

<doc id="173135" wikidata="Q609176" url="?curid=173135" title="Russian Far East">
<text>The Russian Far East () is a region in North Asia. It is the easternmost part of Russia and the Asian continent, and is coextensive with the Far Eastern Federal District, which encompasses the area between Lake Baikal and the Pacific Ocean. The area&#x27;s largest city is Khabarovsk, followed by Vladivostok. The region shares land borders with the countries of Mongolia, China, and North Korea to its south, as well as maritime boundaries with Japan to its southeast, and with the United States along the Bering Strait to its northeast.

Although the Russian Far East is often considered as a part of Siberia abroad, it has been historically categorized separately from Siberia in Russian regional schemes (and previously during the Soviet era when it was called the Soviet Far East).

==Terminology==
In Russia, the region is usually referred to as simply the &quot;Far East&quot; (). What is known in English as the Far East is usually referred to as the &quot;Asia-Pacific Region&quot; (, abbreviated (ATR)), or &quot;East Asia&quot; (), depending on the context.

==Geographical features==

*Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano

*Lake Baikal

==History==
===Russian expansion===
Russians reached the Pacific coast in 1647 with the establishment of Okhotsk, and the Russian Empire consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century, after the annexation of part of Chinese Manchuria (1858–1860). Primorskaya Oblast was established as a separate administrative division of the Russian Empire in 1856, with its administrative center at Khabarovsk.

===Administrative history===
Several entities with the name &quot;Far East&quot; existed in the first half of the 20th century, all with rather different boundaries:
* 1918–1922: the , which encompassed Green Ukraine;
* 1920–1922: the Far Eastern Republic, which included Transbaikal, Amur, Primorskaya, and Kamchatka Oblasts and northern Sakhalin;
* 1922–1926: , which included the Amur, Transbaikal and Kamchatka Governorates and others;
* 1926–1938: Far-Eastern Krai, which included the present-day Primorsky and Khabarovsk Krais.

Until 2000 the Russian Far East lacked officially-defined boundaries. A single term &quot;Siberia and the Far East&quot; () often referred to Russia&#x27;s regions east of the Urals without drawing a clear distinction between &quot;Siberia&quot; and &quot;the Far East&quot;.

In 2000 Russia&#x27;s federal subjects were grouped into larger federal districts, one of which, the Far Eastern Federal District, comprised Amur Oblast, the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Kamchatka Oblast with the Koryak Autonomous Okrug, Khabarovsk Krai, Magadan Oblast, Primorsky Krai, the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, and Sakhalin Oblast. In November 2018 Zabaykalsky Krai and the Republic of Buryatia were added; they had previously formed part of the Siberian Federal District. Since 2000, Russians have increasingly used the term &quot;Far East&quot; to refer to the federal district, though the term is often also used more loosely.

Defined by the boundaries of the federal district, the Far East has an area of —over one-third of Russia&#x27;s total area.

===Russo-Japanese War===
Russia in the early 1900s persistently sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for the Imperial Russian Navy as well as to facilitate maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok (founded in 1860) was operational only during the summer season, but Port Arthur (leased by Russia from China from 1896 onward) in Manchuria could operate all year. After the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the failure of the 1903 negotiations between Japan and the Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s government, Japan chose war to protect its domination of Korea and adjacent territories. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting its populace from government repression and of rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes. Japan issued a declaration of war on 8 February 1904. Three hours before Japan&#x27;s declaration of war was received by the Russian government, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Russian 1st Pacific Squadron at Port Arthur. Eight days later Russia declared war on Japan.

The war ended in September 1905 with a Japanese victory following the fall of Port Arthur and the failed Russian invasion of Japan through the Korean Peninsula and Northeast China; also, Japan had threatened to invade Primorsky Krai via Korea. The warring parties signed the Treaty of Portsmouth on 5 September 1905, and both Japan and Russia agreed to evacuate Manchuria and to return its sovereignty to China, but Japan was allowed to lease the Liaodong Peninsula (containing Port Arthur and Talien, aka Kwantung Leased Territory), and the Russian rail system in southern Manchuria with its access to strategic resources. Japan also received the southern half of the island of Sakhalin from Russia. In 1907 Japan forced Russia to confiscate land from Korean settlers (who formed the majority of Primorsky Krai&#x27;s population) due to a fear of an invasion of Korea and of the ousting of Japanese troops by Korean guerrillas.

===Soviet era===
Between 1937 and 1939, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin deported over 200,000 Koreans to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, fearing that the Koreans might act as spies for Japan. Many Koreans died on the way in cattle trains due to starvation, illness, or freezing conditions. Soviet authorities purged and executed many community leaders; Koryo-saram were not allowed to travel outside of Central Asia for the next 15 years. Koreans were also not allowed to use the Korean language and its use began to become lost with the involvement of the Koryo-mar dialect and the use of Russian.

Development of numerous remote locations in the Soviet Far East relied on Gulag labour camps during Stalin&#x27;s rule, especially in the region&#x27;s northern half. After the death of Stalin in 1953 the large-scale use of forced labour waned and was superseded by volunteer employees attracted by relatively high wages.

====Soviet–Japanese conflicts====
During the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Soviets occupied Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island, Yinlong Island, and several adjacent islets to separate the city of Khabarovsk from the territory controlled by a possibly hostile power.

Indeed, Japan turned its military attention to Soviet territories. Conflicts between the Japanese and the Soviets frequently happened on the border of Manchuria between 1938 and 1945. The first confrontation occurred in Primorsky Krai, the Battle of Lake Khasan (July–August 1938) involved an attempted military incursion of Japanese-controlled Manchukuo into territory claimed by the Soviet Union. This incursion was founded in the beliefs of the Japanese side that the Soviet Union had misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary based on the 1860 Treaty of Peking between Imperial Russia and Manchu China. Primorsky Krai was always threatened by a Japanese invasion despite the fact that most of the remaining clashes occurred in Manchukuo.

The clashes ended shortly before and after the conclusion of World War II (see Soviet–Japanese War) when a war-weakened Japan found its territories of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, Korea, and South Sakhalin invaded by Soviet and Mongolian troops (August 1945).

====World War II====
Both the Soviet Union and Japan regarded the Primorsky Krai as a strategic location in World War II, and clashes over the territory were common. The Soviets and the other Allies considered it a key location for the planned invasion of Japan through Korea; Japan viewed it as a key location to begin a mass invasion of Eastern Russia. The Primorsky Krai served as the Soviet Union&#x27;s Pacific headquarters in the war to plan an invasion for allied troops of Korea in order to reach Japan.

After the Soviet invasion, the USSR returned Manchukuo and Mengjiang to China; Korea became liberated. The Soviet Union also occupied and annexed Japan&#x27;s Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin. The planned Soviet invasion of Japan proper never happened.

====Cold War====
During the Korean War, Primorsky Krai became the site of extreme security concern for the Soviet Union.

Vladivostok was the site of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1974. At the time, the Soviet Union and the United States decided quantitative limits on various nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers. Vladivostok and other cities in Primorsky Krai soon became closed cities because of the bases of the Soviet Pacific Fleet.

Incursions of American reconnaissance aircraft from Alaska sometimes happened. Concerns of the Soviet military caused the infamous Korean Air Lines Flight 007 incident in 1983.

===Russian Federation===
====Russian Homestead Act====
In 2016, President Vladimir Putin proposed the Russian Homestead Act to populate the Russian Far East.

==Demographics==
===Population===

According to the 2021 Census, the Far Eastern Federal District had a population of 7.98 million.
Most of it is concentrated in the southern parts. Given the vast territory of the Russian Far East, 6.3 million people translates to slightly less than one person per square kilometer, making the Russian Far East one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world. The population of the Russian Far East has been rapidly declining since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (even more than for Russia in general), dropping by 14% in the last fifteen years. The Russian government had been discussing a range of re-population programs to avoid the forecast drop to 4.5 million people by 2015, hoping to attract in particular the remaining Russian population of the near abroad but eventually agreeing on a program to resettle Ukrainian Illegal immigrants.

Ethnic Russians and Ukrainians make up the majority of the population.

===Cities===
75% of the population is urban. The largest cities are:
* Khabarovsk
* Vladivostok
* Ulan-Ude
* Chita
* Komsomolsk-on-Amur
* Blagoveshchensk
* Yakutsk
* Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky
* Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk
* Nakhodka
* Ussuriysk

===Traditional ethnic groups===
The original population groups of the Russian Far East include (grouped by language group):
* Mongolic: Buryats
* Turkic: Sakha
* Eskimo–Aleut: Aleuts, Siberian Yupiks (Yuits)
* Chukotko-Kamchatkan: Chukchi, Koryaks, Alutors, Kereks, Itelmens
* Tungusic: Evenks, Evens, Nanais, Orochs, Ul&#x27;ch, Udegey, Orok, Manchus
* Isolate: Yukaghirs, Nivkhs, Ainus

==Transportation==
The region was not connected with the rest of Russia via domestic highways until the M58 highway was completed in 2010.

Uniquely for Russia, most cars have right-hand drive (73% of cars in the region), though they are still driven on the right-hand side of the road.

Railways are better developed. The Trans-Siberian Railway and Baikal–Amur Mainline (since 1984) provide a connection with Siberia (and the rest of the country). The Amur–Yakutsk Mainline is aimed to link the city of Yakutsk to the Russian railway network. Passenger trains connect to Nizhny Bestyakh as of 2013.

As in nearby Siberia, for many remote localities, aviation is the main mode of transportation to/from civilisation, but the infrastructure is often poor.

Maritime transport is important for delivering supplies to localities near the Pacific and Arctic coasts, and for shipping exports, especially oil, gas and ores.

<text>A life insurance tax shelter uses investments in insurance to protect income or assets from tax liabilities. [[Life insurance]] proceeds are not taxable in many jurisdictions. Since most other forms of income are taxable (such as capital gains, dividends and interest income), consumers are often advised to purchase life insurance policies to either offset future tax liabilities, or to shelter the growth of their investments from taxation. This insurance product is also known as Private placement life insurance.

==Life insurance to cover future taxes==
In those jurisdictions where life insurance proceeds are only tax-free at death, tax liabilities that come due at death are often offset by a policy of the same size. Since the mathematics required to compare different strategies is quite complex, most consumers defer to an accountant or life insurance agent for advice. However, there is often vast differences of opinion between these professionals, even given the same starting conditions. This should not be surprising, given the huge future differences that even small variances in starting conditions can make.

For example, assume that an individual is likely to owe $100,000.00 in taxes at death. If a permanent life insurance policy with a $100,000.00 death benefit costs $1,000 per year (remaining level for life), and the life expectancy of the person is 30 years, then the following events could occur:

* The individual could die early. In this case, it is unlikely that any alternative investment of the $1000 per year would have yielded the required $100,000.00 at death.
* The individual could live much longer than expected. The individual could have built up a significant cash value within the policy, depending on investment selection. As such, the individual would have access to these cash values tax-free regardless of growth, provided it is set up properly. 

Since one normally does not know which of these will occur (see adverse selection) calculations must be based on expected life expectancies for people of similar gender, physical condition, and behaviour.

==Life insurance to shelter investment growth and income==
In an attempt to achieve the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; (protection in the case of early death, and additional tax-protected returns in the case of long life), life insurance policies were created containing investment accounts having preferential tax treatment. 
This is most often done with a Variable universal life policy. See that article for some discussion of the tax issues.

<doc id="173147" wikidata="Q5761056" url="?curid=173147" title="Hilary Rosen">
<text>Hilary Rosen (born 1958) is the former head of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). She was a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, became the first Washington editor-at-large and political director of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and has provided political commentary for CNN, CNBC, and MSNBC.

She worked for the RIAA for 16 years, including as CEO from 1998 to 2003. Since 2010, she has been a partner and managing director at the public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker. She has been a registered lobbyist during her career, both at the RIAA and for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Rosen has been an advocate for LGBT rights since the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Rosen was born to a Jewish family in West Orange, New Jersey in 1958. Her father worked as an insurance agent and her mother was the city&#x27;s first councilwoman. In high school, Rosen served as student council president. She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in international business from George Washington University in 1981. Her parents divorced while Rosen was at college.

==Career==
In 1979, Rosen began working as a legislative assistant in the Washington, D.C. office of Governor Brendan Byrne (D-NJ), who was a friend of Rosen&#x27;s mother. She also worked for Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) early in her career. Rosen worked for the lobbying firm Liz Robbins Associates in the 1980s.

===Recording Industry Association of America===
In 1987, Rosen joined the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade organization representing the American recording industry, as its first government relations director. In 1989, she and her colleague Jay Berman updated the Parental Advisory label and launched its public awareness campaign. In 1992, she took a brief leave from the RIAA to serve as Senator Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s transition director and set up the California Democratic Party&#x27;s office in Washington, D.C.

As a registered lobbyist from 1999 to 2003, Rosen influenced the decisions made by Congress on behalf of nearly 350 companies and thousands of artists represented by the RIAA. In 1995, Rosen supported artists&#x27; rights when Bob Dole, then Senate Majority Leader, criticized Time Warner and said that rap lyrics promoted violence and were degrading to women. She became the organization&#x27;s president and chief operating officer in May 1996. Rosen was a strong supporter of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which became law in 1998, to prohibit the creation of technologies used to get around copyright protections. Rosen was promoted to the role of chief executive officer in 1998. In 1999, the RIAA Diamond certification was awarded for the first time, recognizing albums that have shipped more than 10 million copies. Rosen said the award, which was named as such because &quot;diamonds are valuable [and] no two are alike&quot;, represented &quot;a quantum leap&quot; for the music industry and an expansion of the national music market.

In 2000, the American musical recording company A&amp;M Records along with several others, through the RIAA, sued Napster on grounds of copyright infringement under the DMCA, which led to the shutting down of the pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing service. As the face of the RIAA, Rosen was vilified by proponents of free file sharing, and even traveled with security at one point because she was receiving death threats. Nonetheless, Rosen encouraged partnerships between the recording industry and online music businesses, and consulted on the launch of digital music services such as Apple Inc.&#x27;s iTunes Store. Rosen was recognized for advancing the industry&#x27;s political efforts and appeared on lists of influential leaders, including &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;Annual Power List&quot; and &quot;National Journal&quot; &quot;Washington&#x27;s Powerful Insiders&quot;. She was included in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; list of the most powerful women in entertainment in 1998, 2000 (number 10), 2002 (number 17), and 2003 (number 10).

Rosen resigned from the RIAA in June 2003 to spend more time with her family. Following her resignation, she reportedly &quot;questioned the value of lawsuits against individual downloaders&quot; said she had attempted to &quot;push the industry to evolve&quot;. In 2007, she said, &quot;I won&#x27;t be a George Tenet here, but it&#x27;s pretty well known that I was impatient with the pace of the industry&#x27;s embrace of online distribution of music. There&#x27;s no substitute for speed when times are dire. The record companies had valid reasons for their caution, but that caution let the situation get out of hand.&quot;

===Media roles===
Rosen is a Democratic strategist and political pundit. She was a regular political columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, has authored articles for many national publications, and provided political commentary for CNBC and MSNBC. In 2008, she became a CNN contributor, appearing on regular programming as well as special political coverage. Also, in 2008, Rosen became the first Washington editor-at-large and political director of &quot; The Huffington Post&quot;. In 2010, she and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, which was editorially critical of BP following the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill, reached a mutual decision to part ways when Rosen&#x27;s firm, Brunswick Group, began consulting for the British oil and gas company. In April 2012, Rosen was criticized for saying that Ann Romney had &quot;never worked a day in her life&quot; when discussing Mitt Romney&#x27;s reliance on his wife as an adviser on women&#x27;s issues during a CNN appearance. Rosen apologized the next day. In 2013, Rosen began writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as an opinion contributor.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Rosen bought over half a million fake Twitter followers. Rosen described it as &quot;an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked&quot;; however, records indicate Rosen made dozens of purchases between 2015 and 2017.

===Communications consultant===
In 2006, Rosen and Jay Berman, who formerly worked at RIAA, briefly ran the firm Berman Rosen Global Strategies, consulting for tech companies such as Facebook, Viacom, and XM. In 2008, she joined the public relations firm Brunswick Group to head its Washington, D.C. office. In 2010, Rosen became a partner and managing director at the political communications and public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker, leading the company alongside Anita Dunn. The firm is known for its work on progressive issues and focuses on Democrats in its political work. The firm also is employed by TransCanada Corporation to improve their public relations. As a communications consultant, Rosen attended the White House on multiple occasions during Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency. At least five meetings were with the president to discuss messaging around his health care reform plans. Following her 2012 comments regarding Ann Romney, Rosen was the subject of critical coverage by some media outlets, which noted White House visitor logs and speculated whether Rosen or SKDKnickerbocker employees were operating as &quot;unofficial&quot; or &quot;unregistered&quot; lobbyists. Rosen has advised many national candidates, and in 2012 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that she was consulting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz during her time as chair of the Democratic National Committee. SKDKnickerbocker was selected by Edie Windsor&#x27;s legal team to lead the public relations efforts behind the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act (&quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, 2013). In 2014, Rosen and Dunn served as senior advisors to the LGBT rights group Americans for Marriage Equality. Planned Parenthood hired Rosen to help manage the 2015 undercover videos controversy. Rosen and SKDKnickerbocker were assisting Susan G. Komen for the Cure with a public relations campaign for an environmental research initiative when the Planned Parenthood controversy arose.

===Controversies===
During the campaigning leading up to the 2012 United States presidential election, Rosen criticized Ann Romney, wife of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, claiming that, as a stay-at-home mother, Romney &quot;never worked a day in her life.&quot; Rosen was pressured to apologize when her remarks were condemned by the Democratic National Committee and President Obama, who stated he had &quot;little patience for commentary about the spouses of political candidates.&quot; Michelle Obama also distanced herself from Rosen, expressing on Twitter that &quot;every mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected.&quot;

Rosen was criticized in December 2017 for making two tweets calling several Georgetown Hoyas fans &quot;anti-Semitic,&quot; singling one out as a &quot;bigot&quot; after she noticed a photograph of a fan wearing a bacon costume. After Rosen was told that the fan in question was known as &quot;bacon man&quot; and wore the costume because of his last name (Bakan, pronounced &quot;bacon&quot;), she apologized.

In January 2018, Rosen admitted she bought more than 500,000 fake Twitter followers as &quot;an experiment,&quot; to see whether to recommend the practice to her PR clients.

In March 2020 she was criticized for telling Bernie Sanders presidential campaign chair Nina Turner that she had &quot;no standing&quot; to compare Senator Joe Biden to the disappointing &quot;white moderate&quot;, a reference to a statement by Martin Luther King Jr., in his 1963 Letter from a Birmingham jail. Rosen also mistakenly corrected Turner, stating that King only objected to the &#x27;silence&#x27; of the &quot;white moderate&quot; not the comfort of the &#x27;white moderate&#x27; with the status quo as Turner had stated. In fact Dr. King stated that &quot;the white moderate, who is more devoted to &#x27;order&#x27; than to justice&quot; was more of an obstacle to freedom than the Ku Klux Klanner. She apologized on Twitter in a now deleted tweet, stating &quot;Pls no need to defend me and attack angry black women. They have standing. I always need to listen more than I talk. We rise together.&quot;. Rosen was subsequently derided for her use of the pejorative phrase &quot;angry black women&quot; which is a racial trope. Rosen then apologized a second time on Twitter stating that she was &quot;humbly sorry&quot; and would never refer to Nina Turner as an &#x27;angry black woman&#x27; and only wanted people who were using the phrase against Ms. Turner to stop.

==LGBT advocacy==
Rosen became an LGBT activist starting in 1982 when she and others demanded federal intervention to combat HIV/AIDS in the United States. She outed herself to members of Congress in an attempt to win HIV/AIDS funding.

In 2004, she managed the successful campaign to defeat George W. Bush&#x27;s proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage. Her work on this campaign is profiled in John Harwood and Gerald Seib&#x27;s book &quot;Pennsylvania Avenue: Profiles in Backroom Power&quot; (2008).

Between 2004 and 2008, Rosen was a registered lobbyist for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States. In 2008, she served as interim director for the organization. She also served on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation board. &quot;The Advocate&quot; included Rosen in their &quot;People of the Year&quot; list in 2008.

Rosen consulted on the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; (originally &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;) series of federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in California. Rosen was included in &quot;The Advocate&quot; &quot;Out100&quot; list for her work on the &quot;Respect for Marriage Coalition&quot; media campaign during the Defense of Marriage Act challenge and &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; civil rights case. She was also named one of the 25 &quot;most powerful LGBT players&quot; in Washington, D.C., by &quot;National Journal&quot; and ranked number 62 in &quot;Out&quot; 2012 &quot;Power List&quot;. &quot;National Journal&quot; included Rosen in their list of the &quot;30 Most Influential Out Washingtonians&quot; in 2014.

Inspired by Showtime&#x27;s LGBT television series &quot;The L Word&quot;, Rosen collaborated with the show&#x27;s creator to establish OurChart.com, a social networking site for lesbians. Its name refers to &quot;the chart&quot;, which was used on the show to illustrate the relationships between characters. The site was defunct by 2012, having been acquired by Showtime.

In 1992, she helped found Rock the Vote, a non-profit organization that encourages voter turnout among young voters.

Rosen and Tammy Haddad co-host the annual Garden Brunch prior to the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association&#x27;s dinner.

== Personal life ==
Rosen met Elizabeth Birch in 1994. Birch was a lawyer for Apple and later became the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. The couple adopted twins from Texas in 1999. They received some criticism from conservative groups who opposed LGBT adoption. The two separated in 2006.

Rosen has lived in Washington, D.C. since her studies at George Washington University. She is well-connected and has been called a &quot;Washington insider&quot;. Al Gore and Greta van Susteren were among guests who attended her fiftieth birthday celebration.

In addition to being a Democratic strategist, Rosen has described herself as a &quot;strong, progressive Democrat&quot;. She has been a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for candidates, including Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA). She has also been a longtime supporter of Hillary Clinton and supported President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Her stout advocacy for Biden led her to misquote and lecture former Ohio state senator Nina Turner about the meaning of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s warning as to White moderates. She later apologized for her misstep. She has made many personal financial contributions to politicians and groups such as the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund and Kennedy for Senate 2000.

<text>In economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good) is a commodity, product or service that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous and which is typically provided by a government and paid for through taxation. Use by one person neither prevents access by other people, nor does it reduce availability to others, so the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person. This is in contrast to a common good, such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non-excludable but rivalrous to a certain degree. If too many fish were harvested, the stocks would deplete, limiting the access of fish for others. A public good must be valuable to more than one user, otherwise, its simultaneous availability to more than one person would be economically irrelevant.

Capital goods may be used to produce public goods or services that are &quot;...typically provided on a large scale to many consumers.&quot; Similarly, using capital goods to produce public goods may result in the creation of new capital goods. In some cases, public goods or services are considered &quot;...insufficiently profitable to be provided by the private sector... (and), in the absence of government provision, these goods or services would be produced in relatively small quantities or, perhaps, not at all.&quot;

Public goods include knowledge, official statistics, national security, common languages, law enforcement, broadcast radio, flood control systems, aids to navigation, and street lighting. Collective goods that are spread all over the face of the Earth may be referred to as global public goods. This includes physical book literature, but also media, pictures and videos. For instance, knowledge can be shared globally. Information about men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth health awareness, environmental issues, and maintaining biodiversity is common knowledge that every individual in the society can get without necessarily preventing others access. Also, sharing and interpreting contemporary history with a cultural lexicon (particularly about protected cultural heritage sites and monuments) is another source of knowledge that the people can freely access.

Public goods problems are often closely related to the &quot;free-rider&quot; problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it. Thus, the good may be under-produced, overused or degraded. Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be club goods; exclusion mechanisms include toll roads, congestion pricing, and pay television with an encoded signal that can be decrypted only by paid subscribers.

There is debate in the literature on the definition of public goods, how to measure the significance of public goods problems in an economy, and how to identify remedies.

== Academic literature ==
Paul A. Samuelson is usually credited as the economist who articulated the modern theory of public goods in a mathematical formalism, building on earlier work of Wicksell and Lindahl. In his classic 1954 paper &quot;The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure&quot;, he defined a public good, or as he called it in the paper a &quot;collective consumption good&quot;, as follows:[goods] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual&#x27;s consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other individual&#x27;s consumption of that good...

Many mechanisms have been proposed to achieve efficient public goods provision in various settings and under various assumptions.

=== Lindahl tax ===
A Lindahl tax is a type of taxation brought forward by Erik Lindahl, an economist from Sweden, in 1919. His idea was to tax individuals for the provision of a public good according to the marginal benefit they receive. Public goods are costly and eventually someone needs to pay the cost. It is difficult to determine how much each person should pay. So, Lindahl developed a theory of how the expense of public utilities needs to be settled. His argument was that people would pay for the public goods according to the way they benefit from the good. The more a person benefits from these goods, the higher the amount they pay. People are more willing to pay for goods that they value. Taxes are needed to fund public goods and people are willing to bear the burden of taxes. Additionally, the theory dwells on people&#x27;s willingness to pay for the public good. From the fact that public goods are paid through taxation according to the Lindahl idea, the basic duty of the organization that should provide the people with this services and products is the government.

=== Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism ===

Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanisms (VCG) are one of the best-studied procedures for funding public goods. VCG encompasses a wide class of similar mechanisms, but most work focuses on the Clarke Pivot Rule which ensures that all individuals pay into the public good and that the mechanism is individually rational.

The main issue with the VCG mechanism is that it requires a very large amount of information from each user. Participants may not have a detailed sense of their utility function with respect to different funding levels. Compare this with other mechanisms that only require users to provide a single contribution amount. This, among other issues, has prevented the use of VCG mechanisms in practice. However, it is still possible that VCG mechanisms could be adopted among a set of sophisticated actors.

=== Quadratic funding ===

Quadratic funding (QF) is one of the newest innovations in public goods funding mechanisms. The idea of Quadratic voting was turned into a mechanism for public goods funding by Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl and is now referred to as quadratic funding.

Quadratic funding has a close theoretical link with the VCG mechanism, and like VCG, it requires a subsidy in order to induce incentive compatibility and efficiency. Both mechanisms also fall prone to collusion between players and sybil attacks. However, in contrast to VCG, contributors only have to submit a single contribution – the total contribution to the public good is the sum of the square roots of individual contributions. It can be proved that there is always a deficit that the mechanism designer must pay.

One technique to reduce collusion is to identify groups of contributors that will likely coordinate and lower the subsidy going to their preferred causes.

=== Assurance contracts ===

First proposed by Bagnoli and Lipman, In 1989, assurance contracts have each funder agree to spend a certain amount towards a public good conditional on the total funding being sufficient to produce the good. If not everyone agrees to the terms, then no money is spent on the project. Donors can feel assured that their money will only be spent if there is sufficient support for the public good. Assurance contracts work particularly well with smaller groups of easily identifiable participants, especially when the game can be repeated.

Several crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo have used assurance contracts to support various projects (though not all of them are public goods). Assurance contracts can be used for non-monetary coordination as well, for example, Free State Project obtained mutual commitments for 20,000 individuals to move to New Hampshire in a bid to influence the politics of the state.
Alex Tabarrok suggested a modification called dominant assurance contracts where the mechanism designer gives every contributor a refund bonus if the contract fails. For example, in addition to returning their contributions, the mechanism designer might give all contributors an additional $5 if the total donations are not sufficient to support the project. If there is a chance that the contract will fail, a refund bonus incentivizes people to participate in the mechanism, making the all-pay equilibrium more likely. This comes with the drawback that the mechanism designer must pay the participants in some cases (e.g. when the contract fails), which is a common theme.

Zubrickas proposed a simple modification of dominant assurance contracts where people are given a refund bonus proportional to the amount they offered to donate, this incentivizes larger contributions than the fixed refund from Tabarrok’s original proposal. There have been many variations on the idea of conditional donations towards a public good. For example, the Conditional Contributions Mechanism allows donors to make variable sized commitments to fund the project conditional on the total amount committed. Similarly, the Binary Conditional Contributions Mechanism allows users to condition their donation on the number of unique funders. Extensions such as the Street Performer Protocol consider time-limited spending commitments.

=== Lotteries ===
Lotteries have historically been used as a means to finance public goods. Morgan initiated the first formal study of lotteries as a public goods funding mechanism. Since then, lotteries have undergone extensive theoretical and experimental research. Combined with their historical success, lotteries are a promising crowdfunding mechanism. 
They work by using an external source of funding to provide a lottery prize. Individual “donors” buy lottery tickets for a chance to receive the cash prize, knowing that ticket sales will be spent towards the public good. A winner is selected randomly from one of the tickets and the winner receives the entire lottery prize. All lottery proceeds from ticket sales are spent towards the public good.

Like the other mechanisms, this approach requires subsidies in the form of a lottery prize in order to function. It can be shown that altruistic donors can generate more funding for the good by donating towards the lottery prize rather than buying tickets directly.

Lotteries are approximately efficient public goods funding mechanisms and the level of funding approaches the optimal level as the prize grows. However, in the limit of large populations, contributions from the lottery mechanism converge to that of voluntary contributions and should fall to zero.

=== Role of non-profits ===
Public goods provision is in most cases part of governmental activities. In the introductory section of his book, &quot;Public Good Theories of the Nonprofit Sector&quot;, Bruce R. Kingma stated that; In the Weisbrod model nonprofit organizations satisfy a demand for public goods, which is left unfilled by government provision. The government satisfies the demand of the median voters and therefore provides a level of the public good less than some citizens&#x27;-with a level of demand greater than the median voter&#x27;s-desire. This unfilled demand for the public good is satisfied by nonprofit organizations. These nonprofit organizations are financed by the donations of citizens who want to increase the output of the public good. 

== Terminology, and types of goods ==
Non-rivalrous: accessible by all while one&#x27;s usage of the product does not affect the availability for subsequent use.

Non-excludability: that is, it is impossible to exclude any individuals from consuming the good. Pay walls, memberships and gates are common ways to create excludability.

Pure public: when a good exhibits the two traits, non-rivalry and non-excludability, it is referred to as the pure public good. Pure public goods are rare.

Impure public goods: the goods that satisfy the two public good conditions (&quot;non-rivalry&quot; and &quot;non-excludability&quot;) only to a certain extent or only some of the time. For instance, some aspects of cybersecurity, such as threat intelligence and vulnerability information sharing, collective response to cyber-attacks, the integrity of elections, and critical infrastructure protection, have the characteristics of impure public goods.

Private good: The opposite of a public good which does not possess these properties. A loaf of bread, for example, is a private good; its owner can exclude others from using it, and once it has been consumed, it cannot be used by others.

&quot;Common-pool resource&quot;: A good that is rivalrous but &quot;non-excludable&quot;. Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the &quot;public goods problem&quot; for this case is the &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27;, where the unfettered access to a good sometimes results in the overconsumption and thus depletion of that resource. For example, it is so difficult to enforce restrictions on deep-sea fishing that the world&#x27;s fish stocks can be seen as a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing.

Club goods: are the goods that are excludable but are non-rivalrous such as private parks.

Mixed good: final goods that are intrinsically private but that are produced by the individual consumer by means of private and public good inputs. The benefits enjoyed from such a good for any one individual may depend on the consumption of others, as in the cases of a crowded road or a congested national park.

=== Definition matrix ===

=== Challenges in identifying public goods ===
The definition of non-excludability states that it is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of information goods have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. Official statistics provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable. Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. Copyrights and patents both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the &quot;lost revenue&quot; of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other&#x27;s consumption of that good. Public goods also incorporate private goods, which makes it challenging to define what is private or public. For instance, you may think that the community soccer field is a public good. However, you need to bring your own cleats and ball to be able to play. There is also a rental fee that you would have to pay for you to be able to occupy that space. It is a mixed case of public and private goods.

Debate has been generated among economists whether such a category of &quot;public goods&quot; exists. Steven Shavell has suggested the following:
when professional economists talk about public goods they do &quot;not&quot; mean that there are a general category of goods that share the same economic characteristics, manifest the same dysfunctions, and that may thus benefit from pretty similar corrective solutions...there is merely an infinite series of particular problems (some of overproduction, some of underproduction, and so on), each with a particular solution that cannot be deduced from the theory, but that instead would depend on local empirical factors.

There is a common misconception that public goods are goods provided by the public sector. Although it is often the case that government is involved in producing public goods, this is not always true. Public goods may be &quot;naturally&quot; available, or they may be produced by private individuals, by firms, or by non-state groups, called collective action.

The theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish geographic region in regards to how a good may be produced or consumed. However, some theorists, such as Inge Kaul, use the term &quot;global public good&quot; for a public good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good that exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been argued as an example of a global public good, but also as a commons, the knowledge commons.
Graphically, non-rivalry means that if each of several individuals has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This is in contrast to the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.

Some writers have used the term &quot;public good&quot; to refer only to non-excludable &quot;pure public goods&quot; and refer to excludable public goods as &quot;club goods&quot;.

=== Digital public goods ===

Digital public goods include software, data sets, AI models, standards and content that are open source.

Use of the term “digital public good” appears as early as April, 2017 when Nicholas Gruen wrote Building the Public Goods of the Twenty-First Century, and has gained popularity with the growing recognition of the potential for new technologies to be implemented at scale to effectively serve people. Digital technologies have also been identified by countries, NGOs and private sector entities as a means to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A digital public good is defined by the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, as: “open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the SDGs.”

== Examples ==
=== Common examples ===
* public fireworks 
* clean air and other environmental goods 
* information goods, such as official statistics 
* free and open-source software 
* authorship 
* public television 
* radio
* invention 
* herd immunity
* Wikipedia
* national defense
* fire service
* flood defense
* street lights

=== Misclassified public goods ===

* Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but cannot be classified as public goods since they do not fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.)
* Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability &quot;is&quot; possible, but they do still fit some of the characteristics of public goods.
* The provision of a lighthouse is a standard example of a public good, since it is difficult to exclude ships from using its services. No ship&#x27;s use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular ports, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees (Ronald Coase, &quot;The Lighthouse in Economics&quot; 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.
* Technological progress can create new public goods. The most simple examples are street lights, which are relatively recent inventions (by historical standards). One person&#x27;s enjoyment of them does not detract from other persons&#x27; enjoyment, and it currently would be prohibitively expensive to charge individuals separately for the amount of light they presumably use. 
* Official statistics are another example. The government&#x27;s ability to collect, process and provide high-quality information to guide decision-making at all levels has been strongly advanced by technological progress. On the other hand, a public good&#x27;s status may change over time. Technological progress can significantly impact excludability of traditional public goods: encryption allows broadcasters to sell individual access to their programming. The costs for electronic road pricing have fallen dramatically, paving the way for detailed billing based on actual use.

Public goods are not restricted to human beings. It is one aspect of the study of cooperation in biology.

== Free rider problem ==

The free rider problem is a primary issue in collective decision-making. An example is that some firms in a particular industry will choose not to participate in a lobby whose purpose is to affect government policies that could benefit the industry, under the assumption that there are enough participants to result in a favourable outcome without them. The free rider problem is also a form of market failure, in which market-like behavior of individual gain-seeking does not produce economically efficient results. The production of public goods results in positive externalities which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the free rider problem, or occasionally, the &quot;easy rider problem&quot;. If too many consumers decide to &quot;free-ride&quot;, private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need.

The free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as &quot;Homo economicus&quot;: purely rational and also purely selfish—extremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider.

For example, consider national defence, a standard example of a pure public good. Suppose &quot;Homo economicus&quot; thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all of the millions of other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service. On the other hand, the free rider knows that he or she cannot be excluded from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or mercenaries).

The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently. Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the &quot;demand revelation problem&quot;), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good. This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since cost–benefit analysis is being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the un-generated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations.

In the case of information goods, an inventor of a new product may benefit all of society, but hardly anyone is willing to pay for the invention if they can benefit from it for free. In the case of an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.

== Efficient production levels ==
The socially optimal provision of a public good in a society occurs when the sum of the marginal valuations of the public good (taken across all individuals) is equal to the marginal cost of providing that public good. These marginal valuations are, formally, marginal rates of substitution relative to some reference private good, and the marginal cost is a marginal rate of transformation that describes how much of that private good it costs to produce an incremental unit of the public good. This contrasts to the social optimality condition of private goods, which equates each consumer&#x27;s valuation of the private good to its marginal cost of production.

For an example, consider a community of just two consumers and the government is considering whether or not to build a public park. One person is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while the other is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 surplus to maintaining the park, since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225.

The classical theory of public goods defines efficiency under idealized conditions of complete information, a situation already acknowledged in Wicksell (1896). Samuelson emphasized that this poses problems for the efficient provision of public goods in practice and the assessment of an efficient Lindahl tax to finance public goods, because individuals have incentives to underreport how much they value public goods. Subsequent work, especially in mechanism design and the theory of public finance developed how valuations and costs could actually be elicited in practical conditions of incomplete information, using devices such as the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism. Thus, deeper analysis of problems of public goods motivated much work that is at the heart of modern economic theory.

== Local public goods ==
The basic theory of public goods as discussed above begins with situations where the level of a public good (e.g., quality of the air) is equally experienced by everyone. However, in many important situations of interest, the incidence of benefits and costs is not so simple. For example, when people at a workplace keep an office clean or residents monitor a neighborhood for signs of crime, the benefits of that effort accrue to some people (those in their &quot;neighborhoods&quot;) more than to others. The overlapping structure of these neighborhoods is often modeled as a network. (When neighborhoods are totally separate, i.e., non-overlapping, the standard model is the Tiebout model.)
An example of locally public good that could help everyone, even ones not from the neighborhood, is a bus service. If you are a college student who is visiting their friend who goes to school in another city that has bus service, you get to benefit from this bus service just like everyone that resides in and goes to school in said city. There is also a correlation of benefits and costs that you are now a part of. You are benefiting by not having to walk to your destination and taking a bus instead. However, others might prefer to walk, so they do not become a part of the problem, which is pollution due to gas emitted by automobiles and congestion.

In 2019, economists developed the theory of local public goods with overlapping neighborhoods, or &quot;public goods in networks&quot;: both their efficient provision, and how much can be provided voluntarily in a non-cooperative equilibrium. When it comes to socially efficient provision, networks that are more dense or close-knit in terms of how much people can benefit each other have more scope for improving on an inefficient status quo. On the other hand, voluntary provision is typically below the efficient level, and equilibrium outcomes tend to involve strong specialization, with a few individuals contributing heavily and their neighbors free-riding on those contributions.

== Ownership ==
Economic theorists such as Oliver Hart (1995) have emphasized that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm has been applied to public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Besley and Ghatak argue that the party who has a larger valuation of the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, it has been shown that the investment technology may matter also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO. Halonen-Akatwijuka and Pafilis (2020) have demonstrated that Besley and Ghatak&#x27;s results are not robust when there is a long-term relationship, such that the parties interact repeatedly. Moreover, Schmitz (2021) has shown that when the parties have private information about their valuations of the public good, then the investment technology can be an important determinant of the optimal ownership structure.

<text>Wheat beer is a top-fermented beer which is brewed with a large proportion of wheat relative to the amount of malted barley. The two main varieties are German &quot;Weizenbier&quot; and Belgian &quot;witbier&quot;; other types include Lambic (made with wild yeast), Berliner Weisse (a cloudy, sour beer), and Gose (a sour, salty beer).

==Varieties==
Weißbier (German – &quot;white beer&quot;) uses at least 52% wheat to barley malt to make a light-coloured top-fermenting beer. Witbier (Dutch – &quot;white beer&quot;) uses flavorings such as coriander and orange peel. Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat.

German Weißbier and Belgian witbier are termed &quot;white beers&quot; because &quot;wheat&quot; has the same etymological root as &quot;white&quot; in most West Germanic languages (including English).

Other wheat beer styles, such as Berliner Weiße, Gose, and Lambic, are made with a significant proportion of wheat.

Weizenbier () or Hefeweizen, in the southern parts of Bavaria usually called Weißbier (; literally &quot;white beer&quot;, referring to the pale air-dried malt, as opposed to &quot;brown beer&quot; made from dark malt dried over a hot kiln), is a beer, traditionally from Bavaria, in which a significant proportion of malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. Wheat beer was introduced in Bavaria in the 15th century from neighbouring Bohemia. Because of reinheitsgebot only beer made from barley was allowed to be brewed in Bavaria up until 1548, when William IV, Duke of Bavaria, gave Baron Hans VI von Degenberg a special privilege to brew and sell wheat beer. By law, Weißbiers brewed in Germany must use a &quot;top-fermenting&quot; yeast. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Historically, Bavarian Weißbier was either brewed with a large share of wheat malt (which was a ducal privilege in Bavaria) or from air-dried pale barley malt only (which was a common drink amongst poor people). It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen (&quot;Wheat&quot;) outside Bavaria. The terms &quot;Hefeweizen&quot; (&quot;yeast wheat&quot;) or Hefeweißbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or &quot;Kristallweißbier&quot; (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance.

The Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 IBUs) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer&#x27;s relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavor note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is 4-vinyl guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. &quot;Hefeweizen&quot;&#x27;s phenolic character has been described as &quot;clove&quot; and &quot;medicinal&quot; (&quot;Band-aid&quot;) but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by Weißbier yeast include &quot;banana&quot; (amyl acetate), &quot;bubble gum&quot;, and sometimes &quot;vanilla&quot; (vanillin).

Weißbier is available in a number of other forms, including Dunkelweizen (dark wheat) and Weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer), commonly referred to as Weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties are made with darker, more highly kilned malts (both wheat and barley). Weizenbocks typically have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins.

The four largest brands in Germany are Erdinger, Paulaner, Franziskaner, and Maisel. Other renowned brands are Augustiner, Weihenstephaner, Schneider (a bronze-coloured specialty), and Andechser. Regional brands in Bavaria are Hopf, Unertl, Ayinger, Schweiger and Plank. Aventinus is an example of Weizen Doppelbock, stronger and darker version of Weizenbock, made by the G. Schneider &amp; Sohn brewery in Kelheim.

British brewers producing cask-conditioned varieties include Oakleaf Eichenblatt Bitte, Hoskins White Dolphin, Fyfe Weiss Squad and Oakham White Dwarf.

===Witbier===
Witbier, white beer, , or simply &quot;witte&quot; is a barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins, which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. Today, along with hops it usually contains a blend of spices, such as coriander, orange, and bitter orange.

As early as the 16th and 17th century, the white beers of Hoegaarden and Leuven were renowned. Along with barley malt and unmalted barley it contained some oats, though apart from hops no other spices were used. The barley was usually not kilned but left to dry on attics where the wind was allowed to blow past it, in order to obtain a light colour.

The style was revived by Pierre Celis at the Hoegaarden Brewery in Belgium and the Celis Brewery in the United States and is traditionally made with up to 50% raw wheat rather than wheat malt. It probably was Celis who started adding the various spices. The beers have a somewhat sour taste due to the presence of lactic acid or acetic acid, much more pronounced in the past than today. Also, the suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle.

===Other varieties===
A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Weiße (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and intentionally tart. Sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry, or woodruff herb are often added before drinking.

Leipziger Gose is similar to Berliner Weiße, but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers, but are traditional for that style of beer.

Belgian lambic is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from nearly all beers in the use of wild yeast for spontaneous fermentation.

A variation on the barley wine style involves adding a large quantity of wheat to the mash bill, resulting in what is referred to as wheat wine. This style originated in the United States in the 1980s.

==Names and types==
Wheat beers vary in name according to where they are brewed and small variations in the recipe. Among those used are:
* Weißbier, short Weiße: &quot;Weiß&quot; is German for &quot;white&quot;. These terms are used almost exclusively in the Southern German state of Bavaria and in Austria.
* Weizenbier, short Weizen: &quot;Weizen&quot; is German for &quot;wheat&quot;. These terms are used in the Western (Baden-Württemberg) and Northern German regions, as well as in Switzerland, for Weißbier.
* Hefeweißbier or Hefeweizen: &quot;Hefe&quot; is the German word for yeast, is added to indicate that the beer is bottle-conditioned (unfiltered), thus might have sediment.
* Kristallweißbier or Kristallweizen: &quot;Kristall&quot;, being German for crystal, is added if Weißbier is filtered clear of sediment.
* Dunkles Weißbier or Dunkelweizen: A dark version of a wheat beer (&quot;dunkel&quot; is the German word for &quot;dark&quot;)
* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the bock style originating in Germany.
* Witbier (literally, &quot;white beer&quot;) or simply &quot;Wit&quot;: Dutch-language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer
* Bière blanche (literally, &quot;white beer&quot;): The French language name for wheat beer

==Serving==
Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in , vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250-ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Weiße is often served in a schooner.

Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there. The modern American custom appears to have originated in Portland, Oregon, in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served Widmer Brothers Brewery&#x27;s Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the Cascade hops.

In northern Bavaria, a grain of rice commonly is added to Kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam. A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is cola-weizen, which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier.

Another mixture popular during the summer is a radler variant with a 50–50 mix of Weißbier with lemonade named after cyclists.
==Sensory profile==
Weißbiers feature fermentation by-products such as esters (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially isoamyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which smells and tastes like cloves. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weißbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weißbiers is close to 15 international bitterness units, a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.

The ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill.

The carbonation level can range from 5.5 g/L (about 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7 g/L, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially with the high protein content of wheat malt.

<doc id="173160" wikidata="Q105821893" url="?curid=173160" title="Lens flare">
<text>A lens flare happens when light is scattered, or &quot;flared&quot;, in a lens system, often in response to a bright light, producing a sometimes undesirable artifact in the image. This happens through light scattered by the imaging mechanism itself, for example through internal reflection and forward scatter from material imperfections in the lens. Lenses with large numbers of elements such as zooms tend to have more lens flare, as they contain a relatively large number of interfaces at which internal scattering may occur. These mechanisms differ from the focused image generation mechanism, which depends on rays from the refraction of light from the subject itself.

There are two types of flare: visible artifacts and glare across the image. The glare makes the image look &quot;washed out&quot; by reducing contrast and color saturation (adding light to dark image regions, and adding white to saturated regions, reducing their saturation). Visible artifacts, usually in the shape of the aperture made by the iris diaphragm, are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens that contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces.

Flare is particularly caused by very bright light sources. Most commonly, this occurs when aiming toward the Sun (when the Sun is in frame or the lens is pointed sunward), and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade. For good-quality optical systems, and for most images (which do not have a bright light shining into the lens), flare is a secondary effect that is widely distributed across the image and thus not visible, although it does reduce contrast.

== Manifestation ==

The spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts, rings, or circles in a row across the image or view. Lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera&#x27;s movement relative to light sources, tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all. The specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements. For example, if the lens has a 6-bladed aperture, the flare may have a hexagonal pattern.

Such internal scattering is also present in the human eye, and manifests in an unwanted veiling glare most obvious when viewing very bright lights or highly reflective surfaces. In some situations, eyelashes can also create flare-like irregularities, although these are technically diffraction artifacts.

When a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. This can be avoided by shading the lens using a lens hood. In a studio, a gobo or set of barn doors can be attached to the lighting to keep it from shining on the camera. Filters can be attached to the camera lens which will also minimise lens flare, which is especially useful for outdoor photographers.

When using an anamorphic lens, as is common in analog cinematography, lens flare can manifest itself as horizontal lines. This is most commonly seen in car headlights in a dark scene, and may be desired as part of the &quot;film look&quot;.

== Deliberate use ==
A lens flare is often deliberately used to invoke a sense of drama. A lens flare is also useful when added to an artificial or modified image composition because it adds a sense of realism, implying that the image is an un-edited original photograph of a &quot;real life&quot; scene.

For both of these reasons (implying realism and/or drama) artificial lens flare is a common effect in various graphics editing programs, although its use can be a point of contention among professional graphic designers. Lens flare was one of the first special effects developed for computer graphics because it can be imitated using relatively simple means. Basic flare-like effects, for instance in video games, can be obtained by drawing starburst, ring, and disc textures over the image and moving them as the location of the light source changes. More sophisticated rendering techniques have been developed based on ray tracing or photon mapping.

Lens flare was typically avoided by Hollywood cinematographers, but the director J. J. Abrams deliberately added numerous lens flares to his films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009) and &quot;Super 8&quot; (2011) by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens. He explained in an interview about &quot;Star Trek&quot;: &quot;I wanted a visual system that felt unique. I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, &#x27;Oh that&#x27;s ridiculous, that was too many.&#x27; But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn&#x27;t be contained in the frame.&quot; Many complained of the frequent use; Abrams conceded it was &quot;overdone, in some places.&quot; In contrast, the low-budget independent film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969) contains numerous incidental lens flares that resulted from Harrison Arnold&#x27;s need to modify a camera car for his Arriflex as he shot motorcycle footage against landscapes of the Southwestern United States.

David Boyd, the director of photography of the sci-fi &quot;Firefly&quot; series, desired this style&#x27;s evocation of 1970s television so much that he sent back cutting-edge lenses that reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.

== Other forms of photographic flare ==

=== Filter flare ===
The use of photographic filters can cause flare, particularly ghosts of bright lights (under central inversion). This can be eliminated by not using a filter, and reduced by using higher-quality filters or narrower aperture.

=== Diffraction artifact in digital cameras ===
One form of flare is specific to digital cameras. With the sun shining on an unprotected lens, a group of small rainbows appears. This artifact is formed by internal diffraction on the image sensor, which acts like a diffraction grating. Unlike true lens flare, this artifact is not visible in the eyepiece of a digital SLR camera, making it more difficult to avoid.

== Gallery ==

* Anti-reflective coating, used to reduce lens flare and produces the red and green colors common in lens flare.
* Bokeh, a source of circles around out-of-focus bright points, also due in part to the internals of the lens.
* Diffraction spike, a type of lens flare seen in some telescopes

<text>Motion blur is the apparent streaking of moving objects in a photograph or a sequence of frames, such as a film or animation. It results when the image being recorded changes during the recording of a single exposure, due to rapid movement or long exposure.

==Usages / Effects of motion blur==
=== Photography ===
When a camera creates an image, that image does not represent a single instant of time. Because of technological constraints or artistic requirements, the image may represent the scene over a period of time. Most often this exposure time is brief enough that the image captured by the camera appears to capture an instantaneous moment, but this is not always so, and a fast moving object or a longer exposure time may result in blurring artifacts which make this apparent. As objects in a scene move, an image of that scene must represent an integration of all positions of those objects, as well as the camera&#x27;s viewpoint, over the period of exposure determined by the shutter speed. In such an image, any object moving with respect to the camera will look blurred or smeared along the direction of relative motion. This smearing may occur on an object that is moving or on a static background if the camera is moving. In a film or television image, this looks natural because the human eye behaves in much the same way.

Because the effect is caused by the relative motion between the camera, and the objects and scene, motion blur may be manipulated by panning the camera to track those moving objects. In this case, even with long exposure times, the moving objects will appear sharper while the background will become more blurred, with the resulting image conveying a sense of movement and speed.

===Animation===

In computer animation this effect must be simulated as a virtual camera actually does capture a discrete moment in time. This simulated motion blur is typically applied when either the camera or objects in the scene move rapidly.

Without this simulated effect each frame shows a perfect instant in time (analogous to a camera with an infinitely fast shutter), with zero motion blur. This is why a video game with a frame rate of 25-30 frames per second will seem staggered, while natural motion filmed at the same frame rate appears rather more continuous. Many modern video games feature motion blur, especially vehicle simulation games. 

Some of the better-known games that utilise this are the recent Need for Speed titles, Unreal Tournament III, The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask, among many others. There are two main methods used in video games to achieve motion blur: cheaper full-screen effects, which typically only take camera movement (and sometimes how fast the camera is moving in 3-D Space to create a radial blur) into mind, and more &quot;selective&quot; or &quot;per-object&quot; motion blur, which typically uses a shader to create a velocity buffer to mark motion intensity for a motion blurring effect to be applied to or uses a shader to perform geometry extrusion. Classic &quot;motion blur&quot; effects prior to modern per-pixel shading pipelines often simply drew successive frames on top of each other with slight transparency, which is strictly speaking a form of video feedback.

In pre-rendered computer animation, such as CGI movies, realistic motion blur can be drawn because the renderer has more time to draw each frame. Temporal anti-aliasing produces frames as a composite of many instants. Frames are not points in time, they are periods of time. If an object makes a trip at a linear speed along a path from 0% to 100% in four time periods, and if those time periods are considered frames, then the object would exhibit motion blur streaks in each frame that are 25% of the path length. If the shutter speed is shortened to less than the duration of a frame, and it may be so shortened as to approach zero time in duration, then the computer animator must choose which portion of the quarter paths (in our 4 frame example) they wish to feature as &quot;open shutter&quot; times. They may choose to render the beginnings of each frame, in which case they will never see the arrival of the object at the end of the path, or they may choose to render the ends of each frame, in which case they will miss the starting point of the trip. Most computer animations systems make the classic &quot;fence-post error&quot; in the way they handle time, confusing the periods of time of an animation with the instantaneous moments that delimit them. Thus most computer animation systems will incorrectly place an object on a four frame trip along a path at 0%, 0.33%, 0.66%, and 1.0% and when called upon to render motion blur will have to cut one or more frames short, or look beyond the boundaries of the animation, compromises that real cameras don&#x27;t do and synthetic cameras needn&#x27;t do.

Motion lines in cel animation are drawn in the same direction as motion blur and perform much the same duty.
Go motion is a variant of stop motion animation that moves the models during the exposure to create a less staggered effect.

===Computer graphics===
In 2D computer graphics, motion blur is an artistic filter that converts the digital image/bitmap/raster image in order to simulate the effect.
Many graphical software products (e.g. Adobe Photoshop or GIMP) offer simple motion blur filters. However, for advanced motion blur filtering including curves or non-uniform speed adjustment, specialized software products (e.g. VirtualRig Studio) are necessary.

=== Biology ===
When an animal&#x27;s eye is in motion, the image will suffer from motion blur, resulting in an inability to resolve details. To cope with this, humans generally alternate between saccades (quick eye movements) and fixation (focusing on a single point). Saccadic masking makes motion blur during a saccade invisible. Similarly, smooth pursuit allows the eye to track a target in rapid motion, eliminating motion blur of that target instead of the scene.

==Negative effects of motion blur==

===Television===
In televised sports, where conventional cameras expose pictures 25 or 30 times per second, motion blur can be inconvenient because it obscures the exact position of a projectile or athlete in slow motion. For this reason special cameras are often used which eliminate motion blurring by taking rapid exposures on the order of 1 millisecond, and then transmitting them over the course of the next 30 to 40 milliseconds. Although this gives sharper slow motion replays, it can look strange at normal speeds because the eye expects to see motion blurring and is not provided with blurred images. 

Conversely, extra motion blur can unavoidably occur on displays when it is not desired. This occurs with some video displays (especially LCD) that exhibits motion blur during fast motion. This can lead to more perceived motion blurring above and beyond the preexisting motion blur in the video material. See display motion blur.

Sometimes, motion blur can be removed from images with the help of deconvolution.

===Video games===
In video games the use or not of motion blur is somewhat controversial. Some players claim that the blur actually makes the game worse, as it does blur images, making it more difficult to recognize objects (especially so in fast-paced moments). This does become more noticeable (and more problematic) with a reduction in framerate. Improvements in the visual quality of modern post-process motion blur shaders as well as a tendency towards higher framerates have lessened the visual detriment of undersampled motion blur effects.

===Wind turbines===
Birds cannot properly see the swirling blades of wind turbines and can get struck by them fatally. A newly published report from Norway suggests that painting one of the three blades with a black tip makes the blades more visible and hence more avoidable. This reduces the motion blur of the unpainted blades, and cuts bird deaths by up to 70 percent.

===Aerial mapping/surveying===
During aerial mapping an aircraft or drone is used to take pictures of the ground during flight. If the flight speed is too high or if shutter speeds are too long, this can lead to motion blur. Motion blur reduces the quality of the images and has a negative effect on the mapping products. Motion blur can be avoided by adjusting the flight altitude, flight velocity, or shutter speed.

<text>A spasm is a sudden involuntary contraction of a muscle, a group of muscles, or a hollow organ, such as the bladder.

A spasmodic muscle contraction may be caused by many medical conditions, including dystonia. Most commonly, it is a muscle cramp which is accompanied by a sudden burst of pain. A muscle cramp is usually harmless and ceases after a few minutes. It is typically caused by ion imbalance or muscle overload.

There are other causes of involuntary muscle contractions, and some of these may cause a health problem.

A series of spasms, or permanent spasms, is referred to as a &quot;spasmism&quot;.

==Description and causes==
Spasms occur when the part of the brain that controls movement malfunctions, causing involuntary muscle activity. 

A spasm may be a muscle contraction caused by abnormal nerve stimulation or by abnormal activity of the muscle itself.

===Causes===
The cause of spasms is often unknown, but it can be due to an inherited genetic problem, a side effect of medications, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a stroke, cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis.

Old age can also cause spasms and cramp.

Spasms can occur in dystonia, and in spasticity.

===Effects===
A spasm may lead to muscle strains or tears in tendons and ligaments if the force of the spasm exceeds the tensile strength of the underlying connective tissue. This can occur with a particularly strong spasm or with weakened connective tissue.

===Types of spasm===
A hypertonic muscle spasm is a condition of chronic, excessive muscle tone (i.e., tension in a resting muscle). This is the amount of contraction that remains when a muscle is not working. A true hypertonic spasm is caused by malfunctioning feedback nerves. This is much more serious and is permanent unless treated. In this case, the hypertonic muscle tone is excessive, and the muscles are unable to relax.

A subtype of spasm is colic. This is an episodic pain caused by spasm of smooth muscle in a particular organ (e.g., the bile duct). A characteristic of colic is the sensation of having to move about, and the pain may induce nausea or vomiting.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in complex analysis, a Riemann surface is a connected one-dimensional complex manifold. These surfaces were first studied by and are named after Bernhard Riemann. Riemann surfaces can be thought of as deformed versions of the complex plane: locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together.

Examples of Riemann surfaces include graphs of multivalued functions such as √&quot;z&quot; or log(&quot;z&quot;), e.g. the subset of pairs with . 

Every Riemann surface is a surface: a two-dimensional real manifold, but it contains more structure (specifically a complex structure). Conversely, a two-dimensional real manifold can be turned into a Riemann surface (usually in several inequivalent ways) if and only if it is orientable and metrizable. Given this, the sphere and torus admit complex structures but the Möbius strip, Klein bottle and real projective plane do not. Every compact Riemann surface is a complex algebraic curve by Chow&#x27;s theorem and the Riemann–Roch theorem.

== Definitions ==

There are several equivalent definitions of a Riemann surface.

# A Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; is a connected complex manifold of complex dimension one. This means that &quot;X&quot; is a connected Hausdorff space that is endowed with an atlas of charts to the open unit disk of the complex plane: for every point there is a neighbourhood of &quot;x&quot; that is homeomorphic to the open unit disk of the complex plane, and the transition maps between two overlapping charts are required to be holomorphic.
# A Riemann surface is an oriented manifold of (real) dimension two – a two-sided surface – together with a conformal structure. Again, manifold means that locally at any point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, the space is homeomorphic to a subset of the real plane. The supplement &quot;Riemann&quot; signifies that &quot;X&quot; is endowed with an additional structure that allows angle measurement on the manifold, namely an equivalence class of so-called Riemannian metrics. Two such metrics are considered equivalent if the angles they measure are the same. Choosing an equivalence class of metrics on &quot;X&quot; is the additional datum of the conformal structure.

A complex structure gives rise to a conformal structure by choosing the standard Euclidean metric given on the complex plane and transporting it to &quot;X&quot; by means of the charts. Showing that a conformal structure determines a complex structure is more difficult.

== Examples ==

=== Algebraic curves ===

== Further definitions and properties ==
As with any map between complex manifolds, a function between two Riemann surfaces &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is called &quot;holomorphic&quot; if for every chart &quot;g&quot; in the atlas of &quot;M&quot; and every chart &quot;h&quot; in the atlas of &quot;N&quot;, the map is holomorphic (as a function from C to C) wherever it is defined. The composition of two holomorphic maps is holomorphic. The two Riemann surfaces &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are called &quot;biholomorphic&quot; (or &quot;conformally equivalent&quot; to emphasize the conformal point of view) if there exists a bijective holomorphic function from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;N&quot; whose inverse is also holomorphic (it turns out that the latter condition is automatic and can therefore be omitted). Two conformally equivalent Riemann surfaces are for all practical purposes identical.

=== Orientability ===
Each Riemann surface, being a complex manifold, is orientable as a real manifold. For complex charts &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; with transition function , &quot;h&quot; can be considered as a map from an open set of R2 to R2 whose Jacobian in a point &quot;z&quot; is just the real linear map given by multiplication by the complex number &quot;h&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;). However, the real determinant of multiplication by a complex number &quot;α&quot; equals 2, so the Jacobian of &quot;h&quot; has positive determinant. Consequently, the complex atlas is an oriented atlas.

=== Functions ===
Every non-compact Riemann surface admits non-constant holomorphic functions (with values in C). In fact, every non-compact Riemann surface is a Stein manifold.

In contrast, on a compact Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; every holomorphic function with values in C is constant due to the maximum principle. However, there always exist non-constant meromorphic functions (holomorphic functions with values in the Riemann sphere ). More precisely, the function field of &quot;X&quot; is a finite extension of C(&quot;t&quot;), the function field in one variable, i.e. any two meromorphic functions are algebraically dependent. This statement generalizes to higher dimensions, see . Meromorphic functions can be given fairly explicitly, in terms of Riemann theta functions and the Abel–Jacobi map of the surface.

=== Algebraicity ===

All compact Riemann surfaces are algebraic curves since they can be embedded into some CP&quot;n&quot;. This follows from the Kodaira embedding theorem and the fact there exists a positive line bundle on any complex curve.

== Analytic vs. algebraic ==
The existence of non-constant meromorphic functions can be used to show that any compact Riemann surface is a projective variety, i.e. can be given by polynomial equations inside a projective space. Actually, it can be shown that every compact Riemann surface can be embedded into complex projective 3-space. This is a surprising theorem: Riemann surfaces are given by locally patching charts. If one global condition, namely compactness, is added, the surface is necessarily algebraic. This feature of Riemann surfaces allows one to study them with either the means of analytic or algebraic geometry. The corresponding statement for higher-dimensional objects is false, i.e. there are compact complex 2-manifolds which are not algebraic. On the other hand, every projective complex manifold is necessarily algebraic, see Chow&#x27;s theorem.

As an example, consider the torus &quot;T&quot; := . The Weierstrass function ℘&quot;τ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) belonging to the lattice is a meromorphic function on &quot;T&quot;. This function and its derivative ℘&quot;τ&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;) generate the function field of &quot;T&quot;. There is an equation
: formula_1
where the coefficients &quot;g&quot;2 and &quot;g&quot;3 depend on &quot;τ&quot;, thus giving an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot;&quot;τ&quot; in the sense of algebraic geometry. Reversing this is accomplished by the &quot;j&quot;-invariant &quot;j&quot;(&quot;E&quot;), which can be used to determine &quot;τ&quot; and hence a torus.

== Classification of Riemann surfaces ==
The set of all Riemann surfaces can be divided into three subsets: hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic Riemann surfaces. Geometrically, these correspond to surfaces with negative, vanishing or positive constant sectional curvature. That is, every connected Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; admits a unique complete 2-dimensional real Riemann metric with constant curvature equal to −1, 0 or 1 that belongs to the conformal class of Riemannian metrics determined by its structure as a Riemann surface. This can be seen as a consequence of the existence of isothermal coordinates. 

In complex analytic terms, the Poincaré–Koebe uniformization theorem (a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem) states that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the following:
* The Riemann sphere , which is isomorphic to P1(C); 
* The complex plane C;
* The open disk , which is isomorphic to the upper half-plane . 
A Riemann surface is elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic according to whether its universal cover is isomorphic to P1(C), C or D. The elements in each class admit a more precise description. 

=== Elliptic Riemann surfaces ===
The Riemann sphere P1(C) is the only example, as there is no group acting on it by biholomorphic transformations freely and properly discontinuously and so any Riemann surface whose universal cover is isomorphic to P1(C) must itself be isomorphic to it.

=== Parabolic Riemann surfaces ===
If &quot;X&quot; is a Riemann surface whose universal cover is isomorphic to the complex plane C then it is isomorphic to one of the following surfaces: 
* C itself; 
* The quotient ; 
* A quotient , where with . 
Topologically there are only three types: the plane, the cylinder and the torus. But while in the two former case the (parabolic) Riemann surface structure is unique, varying the parameter &quot;τ&quot; in the third case gives non-isomorphic Riemann surfaces. The description by the parameter &quot;τ&quot; gives the Teichmüller space of &quot;marked&quot; Riemann surfaces (in addition to the Riemann surface structure one adds the topological data of a &quot;marking&quot;, which can be seen as a fixed homeomorphism to the torus). To obtain the analytic moduli space (forgetting the marking) one takes the quotient of Teichmüller space by the mapping class group. In this case it is the modular curve.

=== Hyperbolic Riemann surfaces ===
In the remaining cases, &quot;X&quot; is a hyperbolic Riemann surface, that is isomorphic to a quotient of the upper half-plane by a Fuchsian group (this is sometimes called a Fuchsian model for the surface). The topological type of &quot;X&quot; can be any orientable surface save the torus and sphere. 

A case of particular interest is when &quot;X&quot; is compact. Then its topological type is described by its genus . Its Teichmüller space and moduli space are -dimensional. A similar classification of Riemann surfaces of finite type (that is homeomorphic to a closed surface minus a finite number of points) can be given. However, in general the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of infinite topological type is too large to admit such a description.

== Maps between Riemann surfaces ==
The geometric classification is reflected in maps between Riemann surfaces, as detailed in Liouville&#x27;s theorem and the Little Picard theorem: maps from hyperbolic to parabolic to elliptic are easy, but maps from elliptic to parabolic or parabolic to hyperbolic are very constrained (indeed, generally constant!). There are inclusions of the disc in the plane in the sphere: , but any holomorphic map from the sphere to the plane is constant, any holomorphic map from the plane into the unit disk is constant (Liouville&#x27;s theorem), and in fact any holomorphic map from the plane into the plane minus two points is constant (Little Picard theorem)!

=== Punctured spheres ===
These statements are clarified by considering the type of a Riemann sphere with a number of punctures. With no punctures, it is the Riemann sphere, which is elliptic. With one puncture, which can be placed at infinity, it is the complex plane, which is parabolic. With two punctures, it is the punctured plane or alternatively annulus or cylinder, which is parabolic. With three or more punctures, it is hyperbolic – compare pair of pants. One can map from one puncture to two, via the exponential map (which is entire and has an essential singularity at infinity, so not defined at infinity, and misses zero and infinity), but all maps from zero punctures to one or more, or one or two punctures to three or more are constant.

=== Ramified covering spaces ===
Continuing in this vein, compact Riemann surfaces can map to surfaces of &quot;lower&quot; genus, but not to &quot;higher&quot; genus, except as constant maps. This is because holomorphic and meromorphic maps behave locally like for integer &quot;n&quot;, so non-constant maps are ramified covering maps, and for compact Riemann surfaces these are constrained by the Riemann–Hurwitz formula in algebraic topology, which relates the Euler characteristic of a space and a ramified cover.

For example, hyperbolic Riemann surfaces are ramified covering spaces of the sphere (they have non-constant meromorphic functions), but the sphere does not cover or otherwise map to higher genus surfaces, except as a constant.

== Isometries of Riemann surfaces ==
The isometry group of a uniformized Riemann surface (equivalently, the conformal automorphism group) reflects its geometry:
* genus 0 – the isometry group of the sphere is the Möbius group of projective transforms of the complex line,
* the isometry group of the plane is the subgroup fixing infinity, and of the punctured plane is the subgroup leaving invariant the set containing only infinity and zero: either fixing them both, or interchanging them (1/&quot;z&quot;).
* the isometry group of the upper half-plane is the real Möbius group; this is conjugate to the automorphism group of the disk.
* genus 1 – the isometry group of a torus is in general generated by translations (as an Abelian variety) and the rotation by 180°. In special cases there can be additional rotations and reflections.
* For genus , the isometry group is finite, and has order at most , by Hurwitz&#x27;s automorphisms theorem; surfaces that realize this bound are called Hurwitz surfaces.
* It is known that every finite group can be realized as the full group of isometries of some Riemann surface.
** For genus 2 the order is maximized by the Bolza surface, with order 48.
** For genus 3 the order is maximized by the Klein quartic, with order 168; this is the first Hurwitz surface, and its automorphism group is isomorphic to the unique simple group of order 168, which is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group. This group is isomorphic to both and .
** For genus 4, Bring&#x27;s surface is a highly symmetric surface.
** For genus 7 the order is maximized by the Macbeath surface, with order 504; this is the second Hurwitz surface, and its automorphism group is isomorphic to , the fourth-smallest non-abelian simple group.

== Function-theoretic classification ==
The classification scheme above is typically used by geometers. There is a different classification for Riemann surfaces that is typically used by complex analysts. It employs a different definition for &quot;parabolic&quot; and &quot;hyperbolic&quot;. In this alternative classification scheme, a Riemann surface is called &quot;parabolic&quot; if there are no non-constant negative subharmonic functions on the surface and is otherwise called &quot;hyperbolic&quot;. This class of hyperbolic surfaces is further subdivided into subclasses according to whether function spaces other than the negative subharmonic functions are degenerate, e.g. Riemann surfaces on which all bounded holomorphic functions are constant, or on which all bounded harmonic functions are constant, or on which all positive harmonic functions are constant, etc.

To avoid confusion, call the classification based on metrics of constant curvature the &quot;geometric classification&quot;, and the one based on degeneracy of function spaces &quot;the function-theoretic classification&quot;. For example, the Riemann surface consisting of &quot;all complex numbers but 0 and 1&quot; is parabolic in the function-theoretic classification but it is hyperbolic in the geometric classification.

<doc id="173186" wikidata="Q4400004" url="?curid=173186" title="Roll-to-roll processing">
<text>In the field of electronic devices, roll-to-roll processing, also known as web processing, reel-to-reel processing or R2R, is the process of creating electronic devices on a roll of flexible plastic, metal foil, or flexible glass. In other fields predating this use, it can refer to any process of applying coating, printing, or performing other processes starting with a roll of a flexible material and re-reeling after the process to create an output roll. These processes, and others such as sheeting, can be grouped together under the general term [[converting]]. When the rolls of material have been coated, laminated or printed they can be subsequently slit to their finished size on a slitter rewinder.

== In electronic devices ==
Large circuits made with thin-film transistors and other devices can be patterned onto these large substrates, which can be up to a few metres wide and long. Some of the devices can be patterned directly, much like an inkjet printer deposits ink. For most semiconductors, however, the devices must be patterned using photolithography techniques.

Roll-to-roll processing of large-area electronic devices reduces manufacturing cost. Most notable would be solar cells, which are still prohibitively expensive for most markets due to the high cost per unit area of traditional bulk (mono- or polycrystalline) silicon manufacturing. Other applications could arise which take advantage of the flexible nature of the substrates, such as electronics embedded into clothing, large-area flexible displays, and roll-up portable displays.

=== LED (Light Emitting Diode) ===

* Inorganic LED - Flexible LED is commonly made into 25, 50, 100 m, or even longer strips using a roll-to-roll process. A long neon LED tube is using such a long flexible strip and encapsulated with PVC or silicone diffusing encapsulation. 
* Organic LED (OLED) - OLED for foldable phone screen is adopting roll-to-roll processing technology.

=== Thin-film cells ===
A crucial issue for a roll-to-roll thin-film cell production system is the deposition rate of the microcrystalline layer, and this can be tackled using four approaches:
*very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (VHF-PECVD)
*microwave (MW)-PECVD
*hot wire chemical vapour deposition (hot-wire CVD)
*the use of ultrasonic nozzles in an in-line process

== In electrochemical devices ==
Roll-to-roll processing has been used in the manufacture of electrochemical devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and water electrolyzers. Here, the roll-to-roll processing is utilized for electrode manufacturing and is the key to reducing manufacturing cost through stable production of electrodes on various film substrates such as metal foils, membranes, diffusion media, and separators.

<doc id="173190" wikidata="Q1689591" url="?curid=173190" title="Jingoism">
<text>Jingoism is nationalism in the form of aggressive and proactive foreign policy, such as a country&#x27;s advocacy for the use of threats or actual force, as opposed to peaceful relations, in efforts to safeguard what it perceives as its national interests. Colloquially, jingoism is excessive bias in judging one&#x27;s own country as superior to others – an extreme type of nationalism (&quot;cf&quot;. chauvinism and ultranationalism).

==Etymology==
The chorus of a song by the songwriter G. W. Hunt, popularized by the singer G. H. MacDermott – which was commonly sung in British pubs and music halls around the time of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 – gave birth to the term. The lyrics included this chorus:

The capture of Constantinople was a long-standing Russian strategic aim, since it would have given the Russian Navy, based in the Black Sea, unfettered access to the Mediterranean Sea through the  Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (known as the &quot;Turkish Straits&quot;); conversely, the British were determined to block the Russians, in order to protect their own access to India. At the time when the above song was composed and sung, the Russians were nearing their goal, through the Treaty of San Stefano; eventually, the British were able to push the Russians back by means of diplomatic pressure and the threat of war.

The phrase &quot;by Jingo&quot; was a minced oath, scarcely documented in writing, used in place of &quot;by Jesus&quot;. The term may derive from Basque Jinkoa: &quot;God&quot;.

Use of the specific term &quot;jingoism&quot; stems from its coinage by prominent British radical George Holyoake, as a political label, in a letter to the &quot;Daily News&quot; on 13 March 1878.

== Examples ==

In the 1880s, Henry Hyndman, leader of the Social Democratic Federation, turned against internationalism, and promoted a version of Socialism mixed with nationalism and antisemitism, even to the point of attacking fellow Socialist Eleanor Marx in antisemitic terms, noting that she had &quot;inherited in her nose and mouth the Jewish type from Karl Marx himself&quot;. When taking part in the breakaway group which founded the Socialist League, Eleanor Marx wrote polemics in which she characterized Hyndman and his followers as &quot;The Jingo Party&quot;.

British artillery major-general Thomas Bland Strange, one of the founders of the Canadian Army and one of the divisional commanders during the 1885 North-West Rebellion, was an eccentric and temperamental soldier who gained the nickname &quot;Jingo Strange&quot; and titled his 1893 autobiography &quot;Gunner Jingo&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;.

Probably the first uses of the term in the U.S. press occurred in connection with the proposed annexation of Hawaii in 1893, after a coup led by foreign residents, mostly Americans, and assisted by the U.S. minister in Hawaii, overthrew the constitutional monarchy and declared a republic. Republican president Benjamin Harrison and Republicans in the U.S. Senate were frequently accused of jingoism in the Democratic press for supporting annexation.

Theodore Roosevelt was frequently accused of jingoism. In an article on 23 October 1895 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Roosevelt stated, &quot;There is much talk about &#x27;jingoism&#x27;. If by &#x27;jingoism&#x27; they mean a policy in pursuance of which Americans will with resolution and common sense insist upon our rights being respected by foreign powers, then we are &#x27;jingoes&#x27;.&quot;

In &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, George Orwell decries the tactics of political journalists and wishes for introduction of aeroplanes into war in order to finally see &quot;a jingo with a bullet hole in him.&quot;

The policy of appeasement toward Hitler led to satirical references to the disappearance of such jingoistic attitudes when facing German aggression. A cartoon by E. H. Shepard titled &quot;The Old-Fashioned Customer&quot; appeared on 28 March 1938 issue of &quot;Punch&quot;. Set in a record shop, John Bull asks the record seller (Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain): &quot;I wonder if you&#x27;ve got a song I remember about not wanting to fight, but if we do... something, something, something ... we&#x27;ve got the money too?&quot;. On the wall is a portrait of Lord Salisbury.

The rhetoric of North Korea has been described as jingoist.

<text>A duet (Italian: &#x27;duo&quot;) is a musical composition for two performers in which the performers have equal importance to the piece, often a composition involving two singers or two pianists. It differs from a harmony, as the performers take turns performing a solo section rather than performing simultaneously. A piece performed by two pianists performing together on the same piano is a &quot;piano duet&quot; or &quot;piano four hands&quot;. A piece for two pianists performing together on separate pianos is a &quot;piano duo&quot;.

&quot;Duet&quot; is also used as a verb for the act of performing a musical duet, or colloquially as a noun to refer to the performers of a duet.

A musical ensemble with more than two solo instruments or voices is called a trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, octet, etc.

== History ==
When Mozart was young, he and his sister Marianne played a duet of his composition at a London concert in 1765. The four-hand, described as a duet, was in many of his compositions which included five sonatas; a set of variations, two performers and one instrument, and a sonata for two pianos. The first published sonata or duet was in 1777.

In Renaissance music, a duet specifically intended as a teaching tool, to be performed by teacher and student, was called a bicinium (&quot;see Étude&quot;).

== In opera ==
Duets have always been a part of the structure of operas. Early 16th-century operas such as &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; involve duets throughout the performance. In 17th-century Italy duets were often used in comic scenes within serious operas. In Baroque France the duet was popular in tragedies, such as songs of vengeance and confrontation. The love duet was characterized by singing in close harmonies of 3rds and 6ths, symbolizing unity after conflict.

=== Famous operatic duets ===
* &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
* &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; by Gioachino Rossini
* &quot;The Puritans&quot; of Vincenzo Bellini
* &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti
* &quot;La traviata&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi
* &quot;Aida&quot; of Giuseppe Verdi
* &quot;Mefistofele&quot; of Arrigo Boito
* &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; by Giacomo Puccini
* &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; by Giacomo Puccini
* &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot; by Pietro Mascagni

== In pop music ==

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, duets have been common in the popular music of their respective eras. In addition to a standard vocal duet, some songs have been written to be heard as conversations; for example, &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;. Other songs are performed around a theme; for example, New York City in &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot;. Occasionally, duets are an improvisation between artists; for example, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Queen and David Bowie. Bowie and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury reportedly composed the lyrics in a day by improvising together. Duets are also common in musical movies and musical theatre; &quot;Fit as a Fiddle&quot; for the 1952 movie &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and its corresponding play of the same name.

== Virtual duets ==
In addition to traditional duets performed live—either in front of an audience or recorded in a studio—a so-called virtual duet can be created by having a singer (or musician) perform over the top of a pre-existing recording. Such a duet is a form of overdubbing. A virtual duet is sometimes done when the singer (or musician) of the original recording is deceased; for example, a live performance by Paul McCartney on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; with an isolated vocal recording of John Lennon from The Beatles&#x27; famous rooftop performance, or a recording of Judy Garland being dubbed over by her daughter Lorna Luft on &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot;. It can also be done with an earlier version of oneself (such as Yusuf / Cat Stevens on &quot;Father And Son&quot;); incidentally, Ronan Keating did his own virtual duet with Yusuf on the same song. Virtual duets may also be done live via video link (such as Shaun Escoffery duetting with the late Eva Cassidy&#x27;s videotaped performance of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; in honour of the late Sir Terry Wogan) or be constructed manually from two pre-existing recordings, generally where each singer/musician can have their own isolated audio channel in the form of a stem.

Entire albums of virtual duets have been created, including albums by Frank Sinatra (&quot;Duets&quot; and &quot;Duets II&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

Theoretically, a duet could be constructed from any two pre-recorded singers or musicians so long as there are isolated audio channels from each artist. With the advent of audio deepfake technology, it is now possible to create virtual duets using an AI facsimile of a singer (or singers) who never sang the song in the first place. A famous example of this is &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; by ghostwriter977, who wrote and produced an original song using voice models of Drake and The Weeknd.

<text>Calvin Blackman Bridges (January 11, 1889 – December 27, 1938) was an American scientist known for his contributions to the field of genetics. Along with Alfred Sturtevant and H.J. Muller, Bridges was part of Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s famous &quot;Fly Room&quot; at Columbia University.

==Early life==

Calvin Blackman Bridges was born in Schuyler Falls, New York in 1889 to the parents of Leonard Bridges and Charlotte Blackman. Tragically, Calvin&#x27;s mother died when he was two years old, and his father died a year later, leaving the young Calvin an orphan. Bridges was subsequently taken in and raised by his grandmother. It took Bridges several years to complete high school, graduating when he was 20 years old. Despite this setback, he moved on to be an outstanding student at Columbia University in New York City, which he attended both undergraduate and postgraduate school.

While taking a zoology class at Columbia, Bridges met Thomas Hunt Morgan. This started a relationship which would eventually lead to many important scientific discoveries regarding genetics and evolution. 

==Work and research==

The &quot;Fly Room&quot; experiments began in 1910 and continued for seventeen years, with Thomas Hunt Morgan being the project&#x27;s lead experimental developer. Among many others working alongside Bridges and Morgan in the laboratory were Alfred Sturtevant and Hermann Joseph Muller. The &quot;Fly Room&quot; experiments were the first to use the common fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; for research in genetics, because they are cheap, easily accessible, and reproduce quickly. The experiments resulted in many important early discoveries in the field, resolved previously unclear issues such as the organization of genetic information within chromosomes, chromosomal arrangement, and linkage in sex chromosomes, and contributed to the emergence of modern treatments of genetics and evolutionary biology from their classical foundations, all in an era before molecular biology had yet revealed the structure or nature of DNA. The group also contributed to the understanding of the impact of mutations on evolution in general. The success of the &quot;Fly Room&quot; experiments eventually made &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; a widely popular model organism for biological research of all types.

Bridges in particular was responsible for many improvements regarding the techniques and the equipment used in the experiments. He suggested the use binocular microscopes instead of hand lenses that had been using before, which improved data quality and convenience. Bridges also developed temperature controls for the experiments which proved to be more useful and yielded better results than the previous temperature controls.

Bridges published many works, one of his most famous being &quot;Sex in Relation to Chromosomes and Genes&quot;. He also contributed many items to the &quot;Journal of Experimental Zoology&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;. His work with sex-linked traits suggested that chromosomes contained genes; Nettie Maria Stevens was later able to support this hypothesis by examining the chromosomes of the fruit flies. Bridges wrote a couple of papers presenting the proof. He thanked her as &quot;Miss Stevens&quot; without stating what her contribution was nor referring to her Ph.D.

Bridges&#x27; PhD thesis on &quot;Non-disjunction as proof of the chromosome theory of heredity&quot; appeared as the first paper in the first issue of the journal &quot;Genetics&quot; in 1916. In this paper, he also established that the Y chromosome does not determine gender in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Bridges&#x27; best-known contribution among &quot;Drosophila&quot; researchers is his observation and documentation of the polytene chromosomes found in larval salivary gland cells. The banding patterns of these chromosomes are still used as genetic landmarks even by contemporary researchers. Bridges was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1936 for his work with &quot;Drosophila&quot;.

After his death, Bridges&#x27; student Katherine Brehme Warren completed work on &quot;The Mutants of Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (1944), a classic book which was for two decades an indispensable resource for geneticists, with information from the &quot;Red Book&quot; later being transferred to the FlyBase database. Morgan and Sturtevant destroyed almost all of Bridges&#x27; notebooks after his death, except the four which were not in their possession.

==Personal life==

Bridges married Gertrude Ives, with whom he had four children. He was known to be both brilliant and very kind and considerate, though he was equally well-known for his womanizing and his struggles to keep up with family obligations. He was an atheist. In 1938, Bridges died from what is believed to have been a case of syphilis.

<text>In physics, a spin network is a type of diagram which can be used to represent states and interactions between particles and fields in quantum mechanics. From a mathematical perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent multilinear functions and functions between representations of matrix groups. The diagrammatic notation can thus greatly simplify calculations.

Roger Penrose described spin networks in 1971. Spin networks have since been applied to the theory of quantum gravity by Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin, Jorge Pullin, Rodolfo Gambini and others.

Spin networks can also be used to construct a particular functional on the space of connections which is invariant under local gauge transformations.

== Definition ==

=== Penrose&#x27;s definition ===
A spin network, as described in Penrose (1971), is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the world line of a &quot;unit&quot; (either an elementary particle or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called &quot;closed spin networks&quot;. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations.

Each line segment is labelled with an integer called a spin number. A unit with spin number &quot;n&quot; is called an &quot;n&quot;-unit and has angular momentum &quot;nħ/2&quot;, where &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant. For bosons, such as photons and gluons, &quot;n&quot; is an even number. For fermions, such as electrons and quarks, &quot;n&quot; is odd.

Given any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the &quot;norm&quot; of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the probabilities of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;. Then, these requirements are stated as:
* Triangle inequality: &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;.
* Fermion conservation: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; must be an even number.
For example, &quot;a&quot; = 3, &quot;b&quot; = 4, &quot;c&quot; = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and &quot;a&quot; = 3, &quot;b&quot; = 4, &quot;c&quot; = 9 is impossible since 9 &gt; 3 + 4. However, &quot;a&quot; = 3, &quot;b&quot; = 4, &quot;c&quot; = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. 
Some conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; must be a whole number.

=== Formal approach to definition ===
Formally, a spin network may be defined as a (directed) graph whose edges are associated with irreducible representations of a compact Lie group and whose vertices are associated with intertwiners of the edge representations adjacent to it.

=== Properties ===
A spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a functional on the space of connections on this manifold. One computes holonomies of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local gauge transformations.

== Usage in physics ==

=== In the context of loop quantum gravity ===
In loop quantum gravity (LQG), a spin network represents a &quot;quantum state&quot; of the gravitational field on a 3-dimensional hypersurface. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, &quot;s-knots&quot;that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under diffeomorphisms) is countable; it constitutes a basis of LQG Hilbert space.

One of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas: the operator of the area &quot;A&quot; of a two-dimensional surface Σ should have a discrete spectrum. Every spin network is an eigenstate of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals

:formula_1

where the sum goes over all intersections &quot;i&quot; of Σ with the spin network. In this formula,
*PL is the Planck length,
*formula_2 is the Immirzi parameter and
*&quot;ji&quot; = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the spin associated with the link &quot;i&quot; of the spin network. The two-dimensional area is therefore &quot;concentrated&quot; in the intersections with the spin network.

According to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an Immirzi parameter on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10−66 cm2.

The formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models. Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator &quot;A&quot; are constrained by ladder symmetry.

Similar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of a 3D submanifold that contains part of a spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary &quot;quantum of volume&quot; and every link is a &quot;quantum of area&quot; surrounding this volume.

=== More general gauge theories ===
Similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a connection form. This is actually an exact duality over a lattice. Over a manifold however, assumptions like diffeomorphism invariance are needed to make the duality exact (smearing Wilson loops is tricky). Later, it was generalized by Robert Oeckl to representations of quantum groups in 2 and 3 dimensions using the Tannaka–Krein duality.

Michael A. Levin and Xiao-Gang Wen have also defined string-nets using tensor categories that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. String-net condensation produces topologically ordered states in condensed matter.

== Usage in mathematics ==
In mathematics, spin networks have been used to study skein modules and character varieties, which correspond to spaces of connections.

<text>MG is a British automotive marque founded by Cecil Kimber in the 1920s, and M.G. Car Company Limited was the British sports car manufacturer existing between 1930 and 1972 that made the marque well known. Since 2007 the marque has been controlled by Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC Motor.

MG cars had their roots in a 1920s sales promotion sideline of Morris Garages, a retail sales and service centre in Oxford belonging to William Morris. The business&#x27;s manager, Cecil Kimber, modified standard production Morris Oxfords and added &quot;MG Super Sports&quot; to the plate at the nose of the car. A separate M.G. Car Company Limited was incorporated in July 1930. It remained Morris&#x27;s personal property until 1 July 1935, when he sold it to his holding company, Morris Motors Limited.

MG underwent many changes in ownership over the years. Morris&#x27;s Nuffield Organization merged with Austin to create the British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC) in 1952. Its activities were renamed MG Division of BMC in 1967, and so it was a component of the 1968 merger that created British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). The MG marque continued to be used by the successors of BLMC: British Leyland, the Rover Group and, by the start of 2000, the MG Rover Group, which entered receivership in 2005. The MG marque along with other assets of MG Rover were purchased by Nanjing Automobile Group (which merged into SAIC Motor in 2007). Production of MG vehicles restarted in 2007 in China under Chinese ownership. The first new MG model in the UK for 16 years, the MG6, was launched on 26 June 2011.


== M.G. Car Company (1930–1972) ==


William Morris&#x27;s Morris Garages in Longwall Street, Oxford, was the Oxford agent for his Morris cars. Cecil Kimber joined the dealership as its sales manager in 1921 and was promoted to general manager in 1922. Kimber began promoting sales by producing his own special versions of Morris cars.

Debate remains as to when MG car production started, although the first cars, rebodied Morris models that used coachwork from Carbodies of Coventry and known as &quot;Kimber Specials&quot;, bore both Morris and MG badges. Reference to MG with the octagon badge appears in an Oxford newspaper from November 1923, and the MG Octagon was registered as a trademark by Morris Garages on 1 May 1924. Morris Garages assembled its cars in premises in Alfred Lane, Oxford. Demand soon caused a move to larger premises in Bainton Road in September 1925, sharing space with the Morris radiator works. Continuing expansion meant another move in 1927 to a separate factory in Edmund Road, Cowley, Oxford, near the main Morris factory, and for the first time, it was possible to include a production line.

In 1928, the company had become large enough to warrant an identity separate from the original Morris Garages, and The M.G. Car Company was used from March of that year. In October, for the first time, a stand was taken at the London Motor Show. Space soon ran out again, and a search for a permanent home led to the lease of part an old leather factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1929. A limited liability company named M.G. Car Company was incorporated on 21 July 1930.

Kimber stayed with the company until 1941, when he fell out with Morris over procuring wartime work and was summarily dismissed. Kimber was tragically killed in the February 1945 King&#x27;s Cross railway accident.

=== Under the Nuffield Organization ===
William Morris owned MG personally, and in a re-arrangement of his various personal holdings, he sold MG in 1935 to Morris Motors (itself the leading member of his Morris Organisation, later called the Nuffield Organization).

=== Under the British Motor Corporation (BMC) ===

The M.G. Car Company Limited was absorbed along with Morris into The British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC), created in 1952 as a merger of Morris Motors Limited and The Austin Motor Company Limited. Long-time service manager John Thornley took over as general manager, guiding the company through its best years until his retirement in 1969. Under BMC, several MG models were no more than badge-engineered versions of other marques, with the main exception being the small MG sports cars. BMC merged with Jaguar Cars in September 1966, and that December, the new company was named British Motor Holdings (BMH). BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968 to form British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC).

=== Under British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) ===
By this point, MG was nothing more than a marque used by BLMC, and from about 1972, the name &quot;M.G. Car Company Limited&quot; ceased to be used.

== MG marque ==
The marque name originated from the initials of Morris Garages, William Morris&#x27;s private retail sales and service company. The marque was in continuous use, except for the duration of the Second World War, from its inception in 1924 until 2005, and then from 2007 under Chinese ownership.

In the beginning, the marque was used predominantly for two-seater sports cars made at the M.G Car Company factory in Abingdon, some south of Oxford.

=== Under British Leyland (1968–1990) ===
Following partial nationalisation in 1975, BLMC became British Leyland (later just BL). British Leyland&#x27;s management and engineering staff were predominantly from the former Leyland organisation, which included MG&#x27;s historical close rival Triumph. Triumph was grouped into BL&#x27;s Specialist Division, alongside Rover and Jaguar, while MG was retained with the other former BMC marques in the Austin-Morris Division, which otherwise made mass-production family cars. While new Triumph models such as the TR7 and the Dolomite were launched during the 1970s, no new MG models were introduced apart from the limited-production V8 version of the MGB. While the MG operations was profitable these profits were entirely offset by the huge losses accrued by the rest of the Austin-Morris division and any funding to the Division within BL was allocated to urgently required mass market models, leaving MG with limited resources to develop and maintain its existing model range, which became increasingly outdated. Amidst a mix of economic, internal and external politics, the Abingdon factory was shut down on 24 October 1980 as part of the drastic programme of cutbacks necessary to turn BL around after the turbulent times of the 1970s. The last car built there was the MGB, and after the closure of the Abingdon plant, the MG marque was temporarily abandoned, and BL decided that there would be no immediate direct successor to the MGB or Midget.

Between 1982 and 1991, the MG marque used to badge-engineer sportier versions of Austin Rover&#x27;s Metro, Maestro, and Montego ranges. The MG marque was not revived in its own right until 1992, with the MG RV8 – an updated MGB Roadster with a Rover V8 engine, which was previewed at the 1992 Birmingham Motor Show, with low-volume production commencing in 1993.

=== Under Rover Group (1992–2000) ===

After BL became the Rover Group in 1986, ownership of the MG marque passed to British Aerospace in 1988 and then in 1994 to BMW. The MG name was revived for a second time in 1992 with the launch of the MG RV8, followed by the mid-engined MG F in 1995, which proved to be more successful than the short-lived RV8.

=== Under MG Rover (2000–2006) ===

BMW sold the business in 2000 and the MG marque passed to the MG Rover Group based in Longbridge, Birmingham. The practice of selling unique MG sports cars alongside badge-engineered models (by now Rovers) continued. The Group went into receivership in 2005 and car production was suspended on 7 April 2005. As of 2003, the site of the former Abingdon factory was host to McDonald&#x27;s and the Thames Valley Police with only the former office block still standing. The headquarters of the MG Car Club (established 1930) is situated next door.

In 2006, it was reported that an initiative called Project Kimber, led by David James, had entered talks with Nanjing to buy the MG marque to produce a range of sports cars based on the discontinued Smart Roadster design by DaimlerChrysler. No agreement was reached, which resulted in the AC Cars marque being adopted for the new model, instead. The project appeared dormant by 2009, and was not pursued.

=== Under MG Motor (2006–present) ===
On 22 July 2005, Chinese manufacturer Nanjing Automobile Group purchased the rights to the MG marque along with other assets of the MG Rover Group, forming NAC MG UK Limited. In 2007, Nanjing Automobile was acquired by another Chinese manufacturer SAIC Motor, and NAC MG UK Limited was renamed MG Motor UK Limited in 2009. Since then, the MG marque has been controlled by SAIC as a division within the company&#x27;s passenger vehicle branch.

The first all-new MG model for 16 years, the MG6, was officially launched in June 2011, and was assembled in China and in UK at the Longbridge plant. In September 2016, MG Motor ended car production at the Longbridge plant. The company cites &quot;improving production scale efficiencies&quot; as the reason of the plant closure. Since then, MG vehicles had been imported from China into the UK.

Since the purchase of the marque, SAIC has designated MG as its main one internationally. The marque has been the largest single-marque car exporter from China since 2019. In 2023, 88 percent of its sales was from outside China. Aside from selling cars designed by parent company SAIC Motor for the MG marque, MG Motor also markets rebadged vehicles from SAIC such as Roewe and Maxus, and from corporate sibling SAIC-GM-Wuling.

The most popular MG Motor product in international markets is the MG ZS subcompact SUV, with a cumulative sales of 999,612 units . It is one of the most exported cars from China. In 2023, MG Motor introduced its first new roadster, the Cyberster electric vehicle, which went on sale in 2024.

== Models ==
The earliest model, the 1924 MG 14/28 consisted of a new sporting body on a Morris Oxford chassis. This car model continued through several versions following the updates to the Morris. The first car that can be described as a new MG, rather than a modified Morris was the MG 18/80 of 1928, which had a purpose-designed chassis and the first appearance of the traditional vertical MG grille. A smaller car was launched in 1929 with the first of a long line of Midgets starting with the M-Type based on a 1928 Morris Minor chassis. MG established a name for itself in the early days of the sport of international automobile racing. Beginning before and continuing after World War II, MG produced a line of cars known as the T-Series Midgets, which, post-war, were exported worldwide, achieving greater success than expected. These included the MG TC, MG TD, and MG TF, all of which were based on the pre-war MG TB, and updated with each successive model.

MG departed from its earlier line of Y-Type saloons and pre-war designs and released the MGA in 1955. The MGB was released in 1962 to satisfy demand for a more modern and comfortable sports car. In 1965 the fixed head coupé (FHC) followed: the MGB GT. With continual updates, mostly to comply with increasingly stringent United States emissions and safety standards, the MGB was produced until 1980. Between 1967 and 1969 a short-lived model called the MGC was released. The MGC was based on the MGB body, but with a larger (and heavier) six-cylinder engine, and somewhat worse handling. MG also began producing the MG Midget in 1961. The Midget was a re-badged and slightly restyled second-generation Austin-Healey Sprite. To the dismay of many enthusiasts, the 1974 MGB was the last model made with chrome bumpers due to new United States safety regulations; the 1974½ bore thick black rubber bumpers that some claimed ruined the lines of the car. In 1973, the MGB GT V8 was launched with the ex-Buick Rover V8 engine and was built until 1976. As with the MGB, the Midget design was frequently modified until the Abingdon factory closed in October 1980 and the last of the range was made. The badge was also applied to versions of BMC saloons including the BMC ADO16, (as the MG 1100, 1275 and 1300) which was also available as a Riley, but with the MG pitched as slightly more &quot;sporty&quot;.

The marque lived on after 1980 under BL, being used on a number of Austin saloons including the Metro, Maestro, and Montego. In New Zealand, the MG badge even appeared on the late 1980s Montego estate, called the MG 2.0 Si Wagon. There was a brief competitive history with a mid-engined, six-cylinder version of the Metro. The MG Metro finished production in 1990 on the launch of a Rover-only model. The MG Maestro and MG Montego remained on sale until 1991, when Rover cut production of these models to concentrate on the more modern 200 Series and 400 Series. High performance Rover Metro, 200 and 400 GTi models had gone on sale in late 1989 and throughout 1990 as the MG version of the Metro was discontinued in 1990 and the versions of the Maestro and Montego were axed in 1991.
The Rover Group revived the two-seater with the MG RV8 in 1992. The all-new MG F went on sale in 1995, becoming the first mass-produced &quot;real&quot; MG sports car since the MGB ceased production in 1980.

Following the May 2000 purchase of the MG and Rover marques by the Phoenix Consortium and the forming of the new MG Rover Group, the MG range was expanded in the summer of 2001 with the introduction of three sports models based on the contemporary range of Rover cars. The MG ZR was based on the Rover 25, the MG ZS on the Rover 45, and the MG ZT/ZT-T on the Rover 75.

The MG Rover Group purchased Qvale, which had taken over development of the De Tomaso Bigua. This car, renamed the Qvale Mangusta and already approved for sale in the United States, formed the basis of the MG XPower SV, an &quot;extreme&quot; V8-engined sports car. It was revealed in 2002 and went on sale in 2004.

== Motorsport ==
From its earliest days MGs have been used in competition and from the early 1930s a series of dedicated racing cars such as the 1931 C-Type and 1934 Q-type were made and sold to enthusiasts who received considerable company assistance. This stopped in 1935 when MG was formally merged with Morris Motors and the Competition Department closed down. A series of experimental cars had also been made allowing Captain George Eyston to take several world speed records. In spite of the formal racing ban, speed record attempts continued with Goldie Gardner exceeding in the 1100 cc EX135 in 1939.

After the Second World War record-breaking attempts restarted with 500 cc and 750 cc records being taken in the late 1940s. A decision was also taken to return to racing and a team of MGAs was entered in the tragedy-laden 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race, the best car achieving 12th place. The British Motor Corporation (BMC) competition department was also based at the Abingdon plant, producing many winning rally and race cars, until the Abingdon factory closed and MGB production ceased in the autumn of 1980.

Prior to the use of the Toyota Tundra silhouette in the Craftsman Truck Series, MG was reported as the last foreign marque used in NASCAR. It was driven in 1963 by Smokey Cook.

In 2001 MG re-launched their motor sport campaign to cover the 24 Hours of Le Mans (MG-Lola EX257), British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) (MG ZS), British and World Rally Championships and MG Independent British Rally Championship (MG ZR). The Le Mans team failed to win the endurance race in 2001 and 2002 and quit in 2003. MG Sport+Racing raced in the British Touring Car Championships with the MG ZS between 2001 and 2003 as a factory team. In 2004 WSR raced the MG ZS as a privateer team. After three years without a major sponsor, WSR teamed up with RAC in 2006 and the team was called Team RAC. In 2007 an MG ZR driven by BRC Stars Champion Luke Pinder won class N1 on Britain&#x27;s round of the World Rally championship. Wales Rally GB. The MG British Rally Challenge still runs today despite the liquidation in 2005.

In 2004 plans to race in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) with a heavily modified V8 powered ZT supertouring car were cancelled due to MG Rover&#x27;s liquidation in April 2005.

In January 2012, MG Motor announced that it would enter the 2012 British Touring Car Championship through the newly established MG KX Momentum Racing team. In its debut season the team ran two MG6s driven by Jason Plato and Andy Neate. Jason ended the season in third place, with the car yet to find its foot in wet conditions.

The team returned in 2013 with Sam Tordoff driving, who performed well in his debut year having joined through the KX Academy scheme. Plato once again came third, with Tordoff sixth.

MG won the 2014 Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship to break Honda&#x27;s four-year reign. After just three years of competition, the MG6 GT sealed the title by 95 points at the season finale at Brands Hatch. Drivers Plato and Tordoff racked up seven wins and 20 podiums in the 30-race calendar. Plato finished the Driver&#x27;s Championship in second place, behind Colin Turkington, while Tordoff finished seventh. In 2014, a third MG6 GT was on the grid, driven by Marc Hynes—also maintained by Triple Eight but in a new livery that didn&#x27;t resemble the other two MG cars. MG came second in the Constructors Championship in 2015, with Andrew Jordan leading the MG team by finishing the season fifth.

<text>Drosophila melanogaster is a species of fly (an insect of the order Diptera) in the family Drosophilidae. The species is often referred to as the fruit fly or lesser fruit fly, or less commonly the &quot;vinegar fly&quot;, &quot;pomace fly&quot;, or &quot;banana fly&quot;. In the wild, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; are attracted to rotting fruit and fermenting beverages, and are often found in orchards, kitchens and pubs. 

Starting with Charles W. Woodworth&#x27;s 1901 proposal of the use of this species as a model organism, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; was the first animal to be launched into space in 1947. As of 2017, six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to drosophilists for their work using the insect.

&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is typically used in research owing to its rapid life cycle, relatively simple genetics with only four pairs of chromosomes, and large number of offspring per generation. It was originally an African species, with all non-African lineages having a common origin. Its geographic range includes all continents, including islands. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; is a common pest in homes, restaurants, and other places where food is served.

Flies belonging to the family Tephritidae are also called &quot;fruit flies&quot;. This can cause confusion, especially in the Mediterranean, Australia, and South Africa, where the Mediterranean fruit fly &quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot; is an economic pest.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Drosophila&quot;, meaning &quot;dew-loving&quot;, is a modern scientific Latin adaptation from Greek words , &#x27;, &quot;dew&quot;, and , &#x27;, &quot;lover&quot;. The term &quot;melanogaster&quot; meaning &quot;black-belly&quot;, comes from Ancient Greek , &quot;&quot;, “black”, and , , &quot;belly&quot;.

== Physical appearance ==
Unlike humans, the sex and physical appearance of fruit flies is not influenced by hormones. The appearance and sex of fruit flies is determined only by genetic information.

Female fruit flies are substantially larger than male fruit flies, with females having bodies that are up to 30% larger than an adult male.

Wild type fruit flies are yellow-brown, with brick-red eyes and transverse black rings across the abdomen. The black portions of the abdomen are the inspiration for the species name (). The brick-red color of the eyes of the wild type fly are due to two pigments: xanthommatin, which is brown and is derived from tryptophan, and drosopterins, which are red and are derived from guanosine triphosphate. They exhibit sexual dimorphism; females are about long; males are slightly smaller. Furthermore, males have a cluster of spiky hairs (claspers) surrounding the reproducing parts used to attach to the female during mating. Extensive images are found at FlyBase.

&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; can be distinguished from related species by the following combination of features: gena ~1/10 diameter of eye at greatest vertical height; wing hyaline and with costal index 2.4; male protarsus with a single row of ~12 setae forming a sex comb; male epandrial posterior lobe small and nearly triangular; female abdominal tergite 6 with dark band running to its ventral margin; female oviscapt small, pale, without dorsodistal depression and with 12-13 peg-like outer ovisensilla.

&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; flies can sense air currents with the hairs on their backs. Their eyes are sensitive to slight differences in light intensity and will instinctively fly away when a shadow or other movement is detected.

== Lifecycle and reproduction ==
Under optimal growth conditions at , the &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; lifespan is about 50 days from egg to death. The developmental period for &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; varies with temperature, as with many ectothermic species. The shortest development time (egg to adult), seven days, is achieved at . Development times increase at higher temperatures (11 days at ) due to heat stress. Under ideal conditions, the development time at is days, at it takes 19 days and at it takes over 50 days. Under crowded conditions, development time increases, while the emerging flies are smaller. Females lay some 400 eggs (embryos), about five at a time, into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying mushrooms and sap fluxes. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is a holometabolous insect, so it undergoes a full metamorphosis. Their life cycle is broken down into four stages: embryo, larva, pupa, adult. The eggs, which are about 0.5 mm long, hatch after 12–15 hours (at ). The resulting larvae grow for about four days (at 25 °C) while molting twice (into second- and third-instar larvae), at about 24 and 48 hours after hatching. During this time, they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit, as well as on the sugar of the fruit itself. The mother puts feces on the egg sacs to establish the same microbial composition in the larvae&#x27;s guts that has worked positively for herself. Then the larvae encapsulate in the puparium and undergo a four-day-long metamorphosis (at 25 °C), after which the adults eclose (emerge).

Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, has been a significant model organism in embryonic development research. Many of its genes that regulate embryonic development and their mechanisms of action have been crucial in understanding the fundamental principles of embryonic development regulation in many multicellular organisms, including humans. Here are some important genes regulating embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster and their modes of action:

Maternal genes: These genes are encoded in the female fruit fly and are present in the early stages of embryo development. They determine the embryo&#x27;s main features and early development. For example, the gene called Bicoid regulates the formation of the embryo&#x27;s anterior end, and its absence leads to an embryo lacking a head.

Zygotic genes: These genes are activated in later stages of embryo development when the fruit fly embryo begins to produce its own genetic products. For example, the hunchback gene regulates the formation of segments in the embryo.

Homeotic genes: This gene family regulates segmentation and axial patterning in development. They act as regulatory factors that determine cell fate in embryonic development. For example, the gene called Antennapedia regulates the formation of anterior limbs in the embryo.

Morphogens: These are molecules that form gradients in embryonic development and regulate cell fate depending on their position in the gradient. For example, the Hedgehog morphogen regulates the differentiation of segments and segment identity in the fruit fly embryo.

These genes and their modes of action form a complex regulatory network that guides the embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster. They influence cell differentiation, segment formation, and axial patterning in the embryo, ultimately leading to the development of a fully formed adult fruit fly.

Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females. First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings. Soon after, the male positions himself at the rear of the female&#x27;s abdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia. Finally, the male curls his abdomen and attempts copulation. Females can reject males by moving away, kicking, and extruding their ovipositor. Copulation lasts around 15–20 minutes, during which males transfer a few hundred, very long (1.76 mm) sperm cells in seminal fluid to the female. Females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom-shaped spermathecae; sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization. A last male precedence is believed to exist; the last male to mate with a female sires about 80% of her offspring. This precedence was found to occur through both displacement and incapacitation. The displacement is attributed to sperm handling by the female fly as multiple matings are conducted and is most significant during the first 1–2 days after copulation. Displacement from the seminal receptacle is more significant than displacement from the spermathecae. Incapacitation of first male sperm by second male sperm becomes significant 2–7 days after copulation. The seminal fluid of the second male is believed to be responsible for this incapacitation mechanism (without removal of first male sperm) which takes effect before fertilization occurs. The delay in effectiveness of the incapacitation mechanism is believed to be a protective mechanism that prevents a male fly from incapacitating his own sperm should he mate with the same female fly repetitively. Sensory neurons in the uterus of female &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; respond to a male protein, sex peptide, which is found in semen. This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination. The signal pathway leading to this change in behavior has been determined. The signal is sent to a brain region that is a homolog of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus then controls sexual behavior and desire. Gonadotropic hormones in Drosophila maintain homeostasis and govern reproductive output via a cyclic interrelationship, not unlike the mammalian estrous cycle. Sex peptide perturbs this homeostasis and dramatically shifts the endocrine state of the female by inciting juvenile hormone synthesis in the corpus allatum.

&quot;D. melanogaster&quot; is often used for life extension studies, such as to identify genes purported to increase lifespan when mutated. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; is also used in studies of aging. Werner syndrome is a condition in humans characterized by accelerated aging. It is caused by mutations in the gene WRN that encodes a protein with essential roles in repair of DNA damage. Mutations in the &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; homolog of &quot;WRN&quot; also cause increased physiologic signs of aging, such as shorter lifespan, higher tumor incidence, muscle degeneration, reduced climbing ability, altered behavior and reduced locomotor activity.

===Meiosis===
Meiotic recombination in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; appears to be employed in repairing damage in germ-line DNA as indicated by the findings that meiotic recombination is induced by the DNA damaging agents ultraviolet light and mitomycin C.

=== Females ===
Females become receptive to courting males about 8–12 hours after emergence. Specific neuron groups in females have been found to affect copulation behavior and mate choice. One such group in the abdominal nerve cord allows the female fly to pause her body movements to copulate. Activation of these neurons induces the female to cease movement and orient herself towards the male to allow for mounting. If the group is inactivated, the female remains in motion and does not copulate. Various chemical signals such as male pheromones often are able to activate the group.

Also, females exhibit mate choice copying. When virgin females are shown other females copulating with a certain type of male, they tend to copulate more with this type of male afterwards than naïve females (which have not observed the copulation of others). This behavior is sensitive to environmental conditions, and females copulate less in bad weather conditions.
=== Males ===
&quot;D. melanogaster&quot; males exhibit a strong reproductive learning curve. That is, with sexual experience, these flies tend to modify their future mating behavior in multiple ways. These changes include increased selectivity for courting only intraspecifically, as well as decreased courtship times.

Sexually naïve &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; males are known to spend significant time courting interspecifically, such as with &quot;D. simulans&quot; flies. Naïve &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; will also attempt to court females that are not yet sexually mature, and other males. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; males show little to no preference for &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; females over females of other species or even other male flies. However, after &quot;D. simulans&quot; or other flies incapable of copulation have rejected the males&#x27; advances, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; males are much less likely to spend time courting nonspecifically in the future. This apparent learned behavior modification seems to be evolutionarily significant, as it allows the males to avoid investing energy into futile sexual encounters.

In addition, males with previous sexual experience modify their courtship dance when attempting to mate with new females—the experienced males spend less time courting, so have lower mating latencies, meaning that they are able to reproduce more quickly. This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over naïve males. This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages, as increased mating efficiency is extremely important in the eyes of natural selection.

=== Polygamy ===
Both male and female &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; flies act polygamously (having multiple sexual partners at the same time). In both males and females, polygamy results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies, more so in males than females. Evening activity consists of those in which the flies participate other than mating and finding partners, such as finding food. The reproductive success of males and females varies, because a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility. Mating with multiple partners provides no advantage over mating with one partner, so females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals. For males, however, mating with multiple partners increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring. This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment.

The difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous male flies can be explained with courtship. For polygamous flies, their reproductive success increases by having offspring with multiple partners, and therefore they spend more time and energy on courting multiple females. On the other hand, monogamous flies only court one female, and expend less energy doing so. While it requires more energy for male flies to court multiple females, the overall reproductive benefits it produces has kept polygamy as the preferred sexual choice.

The mechanism that affects courtship behavior in&quot; Drosophila&quot; is controlled by the oscillator neurons DN1s and LNDs. Oscillation of the DN1 neurons was found to be effected by sociosexual interactions, and is connected to mating-related decrease of evening activity.

== Model organism in genetics ==
&quot;D. melanogaster&quot; remains one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology. It is also employed in studies of environmental mutagenesis.

=== History of use in genetic analysis ===

&quot;D. melanogaster&quot; was among the first organisms used for genetic analysis, and today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best-known of all eukaryotic organisms. All organisms use common genetic systems; therefore, comprehending processes such as transcription and replication in fruit flies helps in understanding these processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.

Thomas Hunt Morgan began using fruit flies in experimental studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910 in a laboratory known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including sex-linked inheritance, epistasis, multiple alleles, and gene mapping.

&quot;D. melanogaster&quot; had historically been used in laboratories to study genetics and patterns of inheritance. However, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; also has importance in environmental mutagenesis research, allowing researchers to study the effects of specific environmental mutagens.

=== Reasons for use in laboratories ===

There are many reasons the fruit fly is a popular choice as a model organism:
* Its care and culture require little equipment, space, and expense even when using large cultures.
* It can be safely and readily anesthetized (usually with ether, carbon dioxide gas, by cooling, or with products such as FlyNap).
* Its morphology is easy to identify once anesthetized.
* It has a short generation time (about 10 days at room temperature), so several generations can be studied within a few weeks.
* It has a high fecundity (females lay up to 100 eggs per day, and perhaps 2000 in a lifetime).
* Males and females are readily distinguished, and virgin females can be easily identified by their light-colored, translucent abdomen, facilitating genetic crossing.
* The mature larva has giant chromosomes in the salivary glands called polytene chromosomes, &quot;puffs&quot;, which indicate regions of transcription, hence gene activity. The under-replication of rDNA occurs resulting in only 20% of DNA compared to the brain. Compare to the 47%, less rDNA in &quot;Sarcophaga barbata&quot; ovaries.
* It has only four pairs of chromosomes – three autosomes, and one pair of sex chromosomes.
* Males do not show meiotic recombination, facilitating genetic studies.
* Recessive lethal &quot;balancer chromosomes&quot; carrying visible genetic markers can be used to keep stocks of lethal alleles in a heterozygous state without recombination due to multiple inversions in the balancer.
* The development of this organism—from fertilized egg to mature adult—is well understood.
* Genetic transformation techniques have been available since 1987. One approach of inserting foreign genes into the Drosophila genome involves P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are transferred into the fly genome. Transgenic flies have already contributed to many scientific advances, e.g., modeling such human diseases as Parkinson&#x27;s, neoplasia, obesity, and diabetes.
* Its complete genome was sequenced and first published in 2000.
* Sexual mosaics can be readily produced, providing an additional tool for studying the development and behavior of these flies.

=== Genetic markers ===


Genetic markers are commonly used in &quot;Drosophila&quot; research, for example within balancer chromosomes or P-element inserts, and most phenotypes are easily identifiable either with the naked eye or under a microscope. In the list of a few common markers below, the allele symbol is followed by the name of the gene affected and a description of its phenotype. &quot;(Note: Recessive alleles are in lower case, while dominant alleles are capitalised.)&quot;
* Cy1: Curly; the wings curve away from the body, flight may be somewhat impaired
* e1: Ebony; black body and wings (heterozygotes are also visibly darker than wild type)
* Sb1: Stubble; bristles are shorter and thicker than wild type
* w1: White; eyes lack pigmentation and appear white
* bw: Brown; eye color determined by various pigments combined.
* y1: Yellow; body pigmentation and wings appear yellow, the fly analog of albinism

=== Classic genetic mutations ===
&quot;Drosophila&quot; genes are traditionally named after the phenotype they cause when mutated. For example, the absence of a particular gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot; will result in a mutant embryo that does not develop a heart. Scientists have thus called this gene &quot;tinman&quot;, named after the Oz character of the same name. Likewise changes in the &quot;Shavenbaby&quot; gene cause the loss of dorsal cuticular hairs in &quot;Drosophila sechellia&quot; larvae. This system of nomenclature results in a wider range of gene names than in other organisms.

* b: black- The black mutation was discovered in 1910 by Thomas Hunt Morgan. The black mutation results in a darker colored body, wings, veins, and segments of the fruit fly&#x27;s leg. This occurs due to the fly&#x27;s inability to create beta-alanine, a beta amino acid. The phenotypic expression of this mutation varies based on the genotype of the individual; for example, whether the specimen is homozygotic or heterozygotic results in a darker or less dark appearance. This genetic mutation is x-linked recessive.
* bw: brown- The brown eye mutation results from inability to produce or synthesize pteridine (red) pigments, due to a point mutation on chromosome II. 
* m: miniature- One of the first records of the &quot;miniature&quot; mutation of wings was also made by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1911. He described the wings as having a similar shape as the wild-type phenotype. However, their &quot;miniature&quot; designation refers to the lengths of their wings, which do not stretch beyond their body and, thus, are notably shorter than the wild-type length. He also noted its inheritance is connected to the sex of the fly and could be paired with the inheritance of other sex-determined traits such as &quot;white&quot; eyes. The wings may also demonstrate other characteristics deviant from the wild-type wing, such as a duller and cloudier color. &quot;Miniature&quot; wings are 1.5x shorter than wild-type but are believed to have the same number of cells. This is due to the lack of complete flattening by these cells, making the overall structure of the wing seem shorter in comparison. The pathway of wing expansion is regulated by a signal-receptor pathway, where the neurohormone bursicon interacts with its complementary G protein-coupled receptor; this receptor drives one of the G-protein subunits to signal further enzyme activity and results in development in the wing, such as apoptosis and growth.
* se: sepia- The eye color of the sepia mutant is sepia, a reddish-brown color. In wild-type flies, ommochromes (brown) and drosopterins (red) give the eyes the typical red color. The drosopterins are made via a pathway that involves a pyrimidodiazepine synthase, which is encoded on chromosome 3L. The gene has a premature stop codon in sepia flies, so that the flies cannot produce the pyrimidodiazepine synthase and thus no red pigment, so that the eyes stay sepia. The sepia allele is recessive and thus offspring from sepia flies and homozygous wild type flies, has red eyes. The sepia phenotype does not depend on the sex of the fly.
* v: vermilion- The vermilion mutants cannot produce the brown ommochromes leaving the red drosopterins so that the eyes are vermilion colored (a radiant red) compared to a wild-type &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;. The vermilion mutation is sex-linked and recessive. The gene that is defect lies on the X chromosome. The brown ommochromes are synthesised from kynurenine, which is made from tryptophane. Vermilion flies cannot convert tryptophane into kynurenine and thus cannot make ommochromes, either. Vermilion mutants live longer than wild-type flies. This longer life span may be associated with the reduced amount of tryptophan converted to kynurenine in vermilion flies.
* vg: vestigial- A spontaneous mutation, discovered in 1919 by Thomas Morgan and Calvin Bridges. Vestigial wings are those not fully developed and that have lost function. Since the discovery of the vestigial gene in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, there have been many discoveries of the vestigial gene in other vertebrates and their functions within the vertebrates. The vestigial gene is considered to be one of the most important genes for wing formation, but when it becomes over expressed the issue of ectopic wings begin to form. The vestigial gene acts to regulate the expression of the wing imaginal discs in the embryo and acts with other genes to regulate the development of the wings. A mutated vestigial allele removes an essential sequence of the DNA required for correct development of the wings.
* w: white- &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; wild type typically expresses a brick red eye color. The white eye mutation in fruit flies is caused due to the absence of two pigments associated with red and brown eye colors; peridines (red) and ommochromes (brown). In January 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan first discovered the white gene and denoted it as &quot;w&quot;. The discovery of the white-eye mutation by Morgan brought about the beginnings of genetic experimentation and analysis of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; Hunt eventually discovered that the gene followed a similar pattern of inheritance related to the meiotic segregation of the X chromosome. He discovered that the gene was located on the X chromosome with this information. This led to the discovery of sex-linked genes and also to the discovery of other mutations in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; The white-eye mutation leads to several disadvantages in flies, such as a reduced climbing ability, shortened life span, and lowered resistance to stress when compared to wild type flies. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; has a series of mating behaviors that enable them to copulate within a given environment and therefore contribute to their fitness. After Morgan&#x27;s discovery of the white-eye mutation being sex-linked, a study led by Sturtevant (1915) concluded that white-eyed males were less successful than wild-type males in terms of mating with females. It was found that the greater the density in eye pigmentation, the greater the success in mating for the males of Dr&quot;osophila melanogaster.&quot;
* y: yellow- The yellow gene is a genetic mutation known as Dmel\y within the widely used data base called FlyBase. This mutation can be easily identified by the atypical yellow pigment observed in the cuticle of the adult flies and the mouth pieces of the larva. The y mutation comprises the following phenotypic classes: the mutants that show a complete loss of pigmentation from the cuticle (y-type) and other mutants that show a mosaic pigment pattern with some regions of the cuticle (wild type, y2-type). The role of the yellow gene is diverse and is responsible for changes in behaviour, sex-specific reproductive maturation and, epigenetic reprogramming. The y gene is an ideal gene to study as it is visibly clear when an organism has this gene, making it easier to understand the passage of DNA to offspring.

== Genome ==
The genome of &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the FlyBase database) contains four pairs of chromosomes – an X/Y pair, and three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4. The fourth chromosome is relatively very small and therefore often ignored, aside from its important &quot;eyeless&quot; gene. The &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; sequenced genome of 139.5 million base pairs has been annotated and contains around 15,682 genes according to Ensemble release 73. More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA involved in gene expression control. Determination of sex in &quot;Drosophila&quot; occurs by the of X chromosomes to autosomes, not because of the presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination. Although the Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic, it contains at least 16 genes, many of which are thought to have male-related functions.

There are three transferrin orthologs, all of which are dramatically divergent from those known in chordate models.

=== Similarity to humans ===
A June 2001 study by National Human Genome Research Institute comparing the fruit fly and human genome estimated that about 60% of genes are conserved between the two species. About 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies, and 50% of fly protein sequences have mammalian homologs . An online database called &quot;Homophila&quot; is available to search for human disease gene homologues in flies and vice versa.

&quot;Drosophila&quot; is being used as a genetic model for several human diseases including the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The fly is also being used to study mechanisms underlying aging and oxidative stress, immunity, diabetes, and cancer, as well as drug abuse.

== Development ==

The life cycle of this insect has four stages: fertilized egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

Embryogenesis in &quot;Drosophila&quot; has been extensively studied, as its small size, short generation time, and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies. It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a syncytium.

During oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called &quot;ring canals&quot; connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.

After fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.

Nuclear division in the early &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their centrosomes and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.

The gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under morphogenesis).

The embryo undergoes well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.

During larval development, tissues known as imaginal discs grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages—unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a pupa, inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.

=== Developmental plasticity ===
Biotic and abiotic factors experienced during development will affect developmental resource allocation leading to phenotypic variation, also referred to as developmental plasticity. As in all insects, environmental factors can influence several aspects of development in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. Fruit flies reared under a hypoxia treatment experience decreased thorax length, while hyperoxia produces smaller flight muscles, suggesting negative developmental effects of extreme oxygen levels. Circadian rhythms are also subject to developmental plasticity. Light conditions during development affect daily activity patterns in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, where flies raised under constant dark or light are less active as adults than those raised under a 12-hour light/dark cycle.

Temperature is one of the most pervasive factors influencing arthropod development. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental. Most often lower developmental temperatures reduce growth rates which influence many other physiological factors. For example, development at 25 °C increases walking speed, thermal performance breadth, and territorial success, while development at 18 °C increases body mass, wing size, all of which are tied to fitness. Moreover, developing at certain low temperatures produces proportionally large wings which improve flight and reproductive performance at similarly low temperatures (&quot;See&quot; acclimation).

While certain effects of developmental temperature, like body size, are irreversible in ectotherms, others can be reversible. When &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; develop at cold temperatures they will have greater cold tolerance, but if cold-reared flies are maintained at warmer temperatures their cold tolerance decreases and heat tolerance increases over time. Because insects typically only mate in a specific range of temperatures, their cold/heat tolerance is an important trait in maximizing reproductive output.

While the traits described above are expected to manifest similarly across sexes, developmental temperature can also produce sex-specific effects in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; adults.
* Females- Ovariole number is significantly affected by developmental temperature in &quot;D. melanogaster.&quot; Egg size is also affected by developmental temperature, and exacerbated when both parents develop at warm temperatures (&quot;See&quot; Maternal effect). Under stressful temperatures, these structures will develop to smaller ultimate sizes and decrease a female&#x27;s reproductive output. Early fecundity (total eggs laid in first 10 days post-eclosion) is maximized when reared at 25 °C (versus 17 °C and 29 °C) regardless of adult temperature. Across a wide range of developmental temperatures, females tend to have greater heat tolerance than males.
* Males- Stressful developmental temperatures will cause sterility in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; males; although the upper temperature limit can be increased by maintaining strains at high temperatures (&quot;See&quot; acclimation). Male sterility can be reversible if adults are returned to an optimal temperature after developing at stressful temperatures. Male flies are smaller and more successful at defending food/oviposition sites when reared at 25 °C versus 18 °C; thus smaller males will have increased mating success and reproductive output.

== Sex determination ==
&quot;Drosophila&quot; flies have both X and Y chromosomes, as well as autosomes. Unlike humans, the Y chromosome does not confer maleness; rather, it encodes genes necessary for making sperm. Sex is instead determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. Furthermore, each cell &quot;decides&quot; whether to be male or female independently of the rest of the organism, resulting in the occasional occurrence of gynandromorphs.

Three major genes are involved in determination of &quot;Drosophila&quot; sex. These are &quot;sex-lethal&quot;, &quot;sisterless&quot;, and &quot;deadpan&quot;. &quot;Deadpan&quot; is an autosomal gene which inhibits &quot;sex-lethal&quot;, while &quot;sisterless&quot; is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of &quot;deadpan&quot;. An AAX cell has twice as much &quot;deadpan&quot; as &quot;sisterless&quot;, so &quot;sex-lethal&quot; will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough &quot;sisterless&quot; to inhibit the action of &quot;deadpan&quot;, allowing the &quot;sex-lethal&quot; gene to be transcribed to create a female.

Later, control by &quot;deadpan&quot; and &quot;sisterless&quot; disappears and what becomes important is the form of the &quot;sex-lethal&quot; gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the cDNA has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. &quot;Sex-lethal&quot; has been shown to affect the splicing of its own mRNA. In males, the third exon is included which encodes a stop codon, causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of &quot;sex-lethal&quot; causes this exon to be missed out; the other seven amino acids are produced as a full peptide chain, again giving a difference between males and females.

Presence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]). DSX-F causes transcription of Yolk proteins 1 and 2 in somatic cells, which will be pumped into the oocyte on its production.

== Immunity ==
The &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the &quot;toll&quot; and &quot;Imd&quot; pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. Other pathways including the stress response pathways JAK-STAT and P38, nutritional signalling via FOXO, and JNK cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; has an organ called the &quot;fat body&quot;, which is analogous to the human liver. The fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection, such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi, killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes. The cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells (hemocytes) in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages. Hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction.

The immune response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly&#x27;s transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, &quot;Drosophila&quot; differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others. &quot;Drosophila&quot; also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli. For instance, secreted PGRPs with amidase activity scavenge and degrade immunostimulatory DAP-type PGN in order to block Imd activation.

Unlike mammals, &quot;Drosophila&quot; have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response. However, the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies. As a result, the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effector function, as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results. Various genetic tools, protocols, and assays make &quot;Drosophila&quot; a classical model for studying the innate immune system, which has even included immune research on the international space station.
=== JAK-STAT signalling ===
Multiple elements of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; JAK-STAT signalling pathway bear direct homology to human JAK-STAT pathway genes. JAK-STAT signalling is induced upon various organismal stresses such as heat stress, dehydration, or infection. JAK-STAT induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), Turandots, and the putative antimicrobial peptide Listericin. The mechanisms through which many of these proteins act is still under investigation. For instance, the TEPs appear to promote phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria and the induction of the toll pathway. As a consequence, flies lacking TEPs are susceptible to infection by toll pathway challenges.
=== The cellular response to infection ===
Circulating hemocytes are key regulators of infection. This has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes, or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection. Flies treated like this fail to phagocytose bacteria upon infection, and are correspondingly susceptible to infection. These hemocytes derive from two waves of hematopoiesis, one occurring in the early embryo and one occurring during development from larva to adult. However Drosophila hemocytes do not renew over the adult lifespan, and so the fly has a finite number of hemocytes that decrease over the course of its lifespan. Hemocytes are also involved in regulating cell-cycle events and apoptosis of aberrant tissue (e.g. cancerous cells) by producing Eiger, a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes JNK signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis.

== Behavioral genetics and neuroscience ==
In 1971, Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer published &quot;Clock mutants of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;&quot;, a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal&#x27;s behavior. Wild-type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency of about a day (24 hours). They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms, as well as broken rhythms—flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or biological clock. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly&#x27;s central brain.

Since then, Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain, and other processes, such as longevity.

Following the pioneering work of Alfred Henry Sturtevant and others, Benzer and colleagues used sexual mosaics to develop a novel fate mapping technique. This technique made it possible to assign a particular characteristic to a specific anatomical location. For example, this technique showed that male courtship behavior is controlled by the brain. Mosaic fate mapping also provided the first indication of the existence of pheromones in this species. Males distinguish between conspecific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female-specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female&#x27;s tergites.

The first learning and memory mutants (&quot;dunce&quot;, &quot;rutabaga&quot;, etc.) were isolated by William &quot;Chip&quot; Quinn while in Benzer&#x27;s lab, and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic AMP, protein kinase A, and a transcription factor known as CREB. These molecules were shown to be also involved in synaptic plasticity in &quot;Aplysia&quot; and mammals.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2017 was awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, Michael W. Young for their works using fruit flies in understanding the &quot;molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm&quot;.

Male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound, and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized. In particular, the &quot;fruitless&quot; gene has several different splice forms, and male flies expressing female splice forms have female-like behavior and vice versa. The TRP channels nompC, nanchung, and inactive are expressed in sound-sensitive Johnston&#x27;s organ neurons and participate in the transduction of sound. Mutating the Genderblind gene, also known as CG6070, alters the sexual behavior of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, turning the flies bisexual.

Flies use a modified version of Bloom filters to detect novelty of odors, with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples, and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor.
=== Aggression ===
As with most insects, aggressive behaviors between male flies commonly occur in the presence of courting a female and when competing for resources. Such behaviors often involve raising wings and legs towards the opponent and attacking with the whole body. Thus, it often causes wing damage, which reduces their fitness by removing their ability to fly and mate.

==== Acoustic communication ====
In order for aggression to occur, male flies produce sounds to communicate their intent. A 2017 study found that songs promoting aggression contain pulses occurring at longer intervals. RNA sequencing from fly mutants displaying over-aggressive behaviors found more than 50 auditory-related genes (important for transient receptor potentials, Ca2+ signaling, and mechanoreceptor potentials) to be upregulated in the AB neurons located in Johnston&#x27;s organ. In addition, aggression levels were reduced when these genes were knocked out via RNA interference. This signifies the major role of hearing as a sensory modality in communicating aggression.

==== Pheromone signaling ====
Other than hearing, another sensory modality that regulates aggression is pheromone signaling, which operates through either the olfactory system or the gustatory system depending on the pheromone. An example is cVA, an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating. This male-specific pheromone causes an increase in male-male aggression when detected by another male&#x27;s gustatory system. However, upon inserting a mutation that makes the flies irresponsive to cVA, no aggressive behaviors were seen. This shows how there are multiple modalities for promoting aggression in flies.

==== Competition for food ====
Specifically, when competing for food, aggression occurs based on amount of food available and is independent of any social interactions between males. Specifically, sucrose was found to stimulate gustatory receptor neurons, which was necessary to stimulate aggression. However, once the amount of food becomes greater than a certain amount, the competition between males lowers. This is possibly due to an over-abundance of food resources. On a larger scale, food was found to determine the boundaries of a territory since flies were observed to be more aggressive at the food&#x27;s physical perimeter.

==== Effect of sleep deprivation ====
However, like most behaviors requiring arousal and wakefulness, aggression was found to be impaired via sleep deprivation. Specifically, this occurs through the impairment of Octopamine and dopamine signaling, which are important pathways for regulating arousal in insects. Due to reduced aggression, sleep-deprived male flies were found to be disadvantaged at mating compared to normal flies. However, when octopamine agonists were administered upon these sleep-deprived flies, aggression levels were seen to be increased and sexual fitness was subsequently restored. Therefore, this finding implicates the importance of sleep in aggression between male flies.

=== Vision ===
The compound eye of the fruit fly contains 760 unit eyes or ommatidia, and are one of the most advanced among insects. Each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-8), support cells, pigment cells, and a cornea. Wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells, which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light. Eye color genes regulate cellular vesicular transport. The enzymes needed for pigment synthesis are then transported to the cell&#x27;s pigment granule, which holds pigment precursor molecules.


Each photoreceptor cell consists of two main sections, the cell body and the rhabdomere. The cell body contains the nucleus, while the 100-μm-long rhabdomere is made up of toothbrush-like stacks of membrane called microvilli. Each microvillus is 1–2 μm in length and about 60 nm in diameter. The membrane of the rhabdomere is packed with about 100 million opsin molecules, the visual protein that absorbs light. The other visual proteins are also tightly packed into the microvilli, leaving little room for cytoplasm.

==== Opsins and spectral sensitivity ====

The genome of &quot;Drosophila&quot; encodes seven opsins, five of those are expressed in the omatidia of the eye. The photoreceptor cells R1-R6 express the opsin Rh1, which absorbs maximally blue light (around 480 nm), however the R1-R6 cells cover a broader range of the spectrum than an opsin would allow due to a sensitising pigment that adds two sensitivity maxima in the UV-range (355 and 370 nm). The R7 cells come in two types with yellow and pale rhabdomeres (R7y and R7p). The pale R7p cells express the opsin Rh3, which maximally absorbs UV-light (345 nm). The R7p cells are strictly paired with the R8p cells that express Rh5, which maximally absorbs violet light (437 nm). The other, the yellow R7y cells express a blue-absorbing screening pigment and the opsin Rh4, which maximally absorbs UV-light (375 nm). The R7y cells are strictly paired with R8y cells that express Rh6, which maximally absorbs UV-light (508 nm). In a subset of omatidia both R7 and R8 cells express the opsin Rh3.

However, these absorption maxima of the opsins where measured in white eyed flies without screening pigments (Rh3-Rh6), or from the isolated opsin directly (Rh1). Those pigments reduce the light that reaches the opsins depending on the wavelength. Thus in fully pigmented flies, the effective absorption maxima of opsins differs and thus also the sensitivity of their photoreceptor cells. With screening pigment, the opsin Rh3 is short wave shifted from 345 nm to 330 nm and Rh4 from 375 nm to 355 nm. Whether screening pigment is present does not make a practical difference for the opsin Rh5 (435 nm and 437 nm), while the opsin R6 is long wave shifted by 92 nm from 508 nm to 600 nm.

Additionally of the opsins of the eye, &quot;Drosophila&quot; has two more opsins: The ocelli express the opsin Rh2, which maximally absorbs violet light (~420 nm). And the opsin Rh7, which maximally absorbs UV-light (350 nm) with an unusually long wavelength tail up to 500 nm. The long tail disappears if a lysine at position 90 is replaced by glutamic acid. This mutant then absorbs maximally violet light (450 nm). The opsin Rh7 entrains with cryptochrome the circadian rhythm of &quot;Drosophila&quot; to the day-night-cycle in the central pacemaker neurons.

Each &quot;Drosophila&quot; opsin binds the carotenoid chromophore 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal via a lysine. This lysine is conserved in almost all opsins, only a few opsins have lost it during evolution. Opsins without it are not light sensitive. In particular, the Drosophila opsins Rh1, Rh4, and Rh7 function not only as photoreceptors, but also as chemoreceptors for aristolochic acid. These opsins still have the lysine like other opsins. However, if it is replaced by an arginine in Rh1, then Rh1 loses light sensitivity but still responds to aristolochic acid. Thus, the lysine is not needed for Rh1 to function as chemoreceptor.

=== Phototransduction ===
As in vertebrate vision, visual transduction in invertebrates occurs via a G protein-coupled pathway. However, in vertebrates, the G protein is transducin, while the G protein in invertebrates is Gq (dgq in &quot;Drosophila&quot;). When rhodopsin (Rh) absorbs a photon of light its chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, is isomerized to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal. Rh undergoes a conformational change into its active form, metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin activates Gq, which in turn activates a phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) known as NorpA.

PLCβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid found in the cell membrane, into soluble inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stays in the cell membrane. DAG, a derivative of DAG, or PIP2 depletion cause a calcium-selective ion channel known as transient receptor potential (TRP) to open and calcium and sodium flows into the cell. IP3 is thought to bind to IP3 receptors in the subrhabdomeric cisternae, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, and cause release of calcium, but this process does not seem to be essential for normal vision.

Calcium binds to proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) and an eye-specific protein kinase C (PKC) known as InaC. These proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response. In addition, proteins called arrestins bind metarhodopsin and prevent it from activating more Gq. A sodium-calcium exchanger known as CalX pumps the calcium out of the cell. It uses the inward sodium gradient to export calcium at a stoichiometry of 3 Na+/ 1 Ca++.

TRP, InaC, and PLC form a signaling complex by binding a scaffolding protein called InaD. InaD contains five binding domains called PDZ domain proteins, which specifically bind the C termini of target proteins. Disruption of the complex by mutations in either the PDZ domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling. For example, disruption of the interaction between InaC, the protein kinase C, and InaD results in a delay in inactivation of the light response.

Unlike vertebrate metarhodopsin, invertebrate metarhodopsin can be converted back into rhodopsin by absorbing a photon of orange light (580 nm).

About two-thirds of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; brain is dedicated to visual processing. Although the spatial resolution of their vision is significantly worse than that of humans, their temporal resolution is around 10 times better.

=== Grooming ===
&quot;Drosophila&quot; are known to exhibit grooming behaviors that are executed in a predictable manner. &quot;Drosophila&quot; consistently begin a grooming sequence by using their front legs to clean the eyes, then the head and antennae. Using their hind legs, &quot;Drosophila&quot; proceed to groom their abdomen, and finally the wings and thorax. Throughout this sequence, &quot;Drosophila&quot; periodically rub their legs together to get rid of excess dust and debris that accumulates during the grooming process.

Grooming behaviors have been shown to be executed in a suppression hierarchy. This means that grooming behaviors that occur at the beginning of the sequence prevent those that come later in the sequence from occurring simultaneously, as the grooming sequence consists of mutually exclusive behaviors. This hierarchy does not prevent &quot;Drosophila&quot; from returning to grooming behaviors that have already been accessed in the grooming sequence. The order of grooming behaviors in the suppression hierarchy is thought to be related to the priority of cleaning a specific body part. For example, the eyes and antennae are likely executed early on in the grooming sequence to prevent debris from interfering with the function of &quot;D. melanogaster&#x27;s&quot; sensory organs.

=== Walking ===

Like many other hexapod insects, &quot;Drosophila&quot; typically walk using a tripod gait. This means that three of the legs swing together while the other three remain stationary, or in stance. Specifically, the middle leg moves in phase with the contralateral front and hind legs. However, variability around the tripod configuration exists along a continuum, meaning that flies do not exhibit distinct transitions between different gaits. At fast walking speeds, the walking configuration is mostly tripod (3 legs in stance), but at slower walking speeds, flies are more likely to have four (tetrapod) or five legs in stance (wave). These transitions may help to optimize static stability. Because flies are so small, inertial forces are negligible compared with the elastic forces of their muscles and joints or the viscous forces of the surrounding air.

=== Flight ===
Flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called saccades. During these turns, a fly is able to rotate 90° in less than 50 milliseconds.

Characteristics of &quot;Drosophila&quot; flight may be dominated by the viscosity of the air, rather than the inertia of the fly body, but the opposite case with inertia as the dominant force may occur. However, subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible, the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies&#x27; turns to be damped viscously.
== Connectome ==

&quot;Drosophila&quot; is one of the few animals (&quot;C. elegans&quot; being another) where detailed neural circuits (a connectome) are available.

A high-level connectome, at the level of brain compartments and interconnecting tracts of neurons, exists for the full fly brain. A version of this is available online.

Detailed circuit-level connectomes exist for the lamina and a medulla column, both in the visual system of the fruit fly, and the alpha lobe of the mushroom body.

In May 2017 a paper published in bioRxiv presented an electron microscopy image stack of the whole adult female brain at synaptic resolution. The volume is available for sparse tracing of selected circuits. Since then, multiple datasets have been collected including a dense connectome of half the central brain of &quot;Drosophila&quot; in 2020, and a dense connectome of the entire female adult nerve cord in 2021. Generally, these datasets are acquired by sectioning the tissue (e.g. the brain) into thin sections (on order of ten or hundreds of nanometers). Each section is then imaged using an electron microscope and these images are stitched and aligned together to create a 3D image volume. The methods used in reconstruction and initial analysis of the such datasets followed. Due to advancements in deep learning, automated methods for image segmentation have made large scale reconstruction providing dense reconstructions of all the neurites within the volume. Furthermore, the resolution of electron microscopy illuminates ultrastructural variations between neurons as well as the location of individual synapses, thereby providing a wiring diagram of synaptic connectivity between all neurites within the given dataset.

In 2023, the complete map of a &quot;Drosophila&quot; larval brain at the synapse level, and an analysis of its architecture was published. The larval brain consists of 3016 neurons and 548,000 synaptic sites, whereas the adult brain has about 150,000 neurons and 150 million synapses.
==Misconceptions==
&quot;Drosophila&quot; is sometimes referred to as a pest due to its tendency to live in human settlements where fermenting fruit is found. Flies may collect in homes, restaurants, stores, and other locations. The name and behavior of this species of fly have led to the misconception that it is a biological security risk in Australia and elsewhere. While other &quot;fruit fly&quot; species do pose a risk, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; is attracted to fruit that is already rotting, rather than causing fruit to rot.

<text>The Cardigans are a Swedish rock band formed in Jönköping, Sweden in 1992. The main lineup of the band consisted of guitarist Peter Svensson, bassist Magnus Sveningsson, drummer Bengt Lagerberg, keyboardist Lars-Olof Johansson and lead singer Nina Persson. Post-hiatus shows since 2012 have been with Oskar Humlebo on guitar instead of Svensson.

With their debut album &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (1994) they gained a solid base in their home country and enjoyed some success abroad, especially in Japan. Their second album &quot;Life&quot; (1995) secured them an international reputation. Their popularity rose when their single &quot;Lovefool&quot;, from the album &quot;First Band on the Moon&quot; (1996), was included in the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;. Other singles included &quot;Erase/Rewind&quot; and &quot;My Favourite Game&quot; from the album &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (1998). After a two-year hiatus the band returned to recording, and released their fifth album &quot;Long Gone Before Daylight&quot; (2003), a mellower country-flavoured record. Their latest album, as of July 2024, is &quot;Super Extra Gravity&quot; (2005). After a 2006 tour, the band took a five-year break from musical activities before reuniting in 2012. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide.

==History==

===First years: 1992–1994===
Peter Svensson and Magnus Sveningsson, 
both heavy metal musicians, formed the group on 31 October 1992 in Jönköping, Sweden, with drummer Bengt Lagerberg, guitarist Mattias Alfheim and lead singer Nina Persson.

Living together in a small apartment, The Cardigans recorded a demo tape with Persson providing lead vocals on only one of the songs towards the end of the track list. A&amp;R man Ola Hermanson heard the demo and signed the band to his Trampolene imprint. While recording their first album in 1993, Alfheim left and was replaced by Lagerberg&#x27;s friend, Lars-Olof Johansson, who remained in the band ever since.
They released their debut album &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in Sweden and Japan in 1994; it was re-released internationally in 1997. The album included the Swedish radio hit &quot;Rise &amp; Shine&quot;, which was later voted the best of 1994 in a poll in &quot;Slitz&quot; magazine.

===Commercial success: 1995–2000===
The remainder of 1994 was spent touring Europe and recording &quot;Life&quot;, which was released worldwide in 1995. &quot;Life&quot; became an international success, selling more than a million copies and achieving platinum status in Japan. In 1996, &quot;Life&quot; was released under the label Minty Fresh in the US, but this release was essentially a compilation of tracks from &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

After their success with &quot;Life&quot;, The Cardigans signed with Mercury Records, under which they released &quot;First Band on the Moon&quot; worldwide in 1996. &quot;Lovefool&quot; was a hit worldwide, particularly in the US and Japan, where the album reached platinum status in three weeks. The album also achieved gold sales status in the US. &quot;Lovefool&quot; was shown on MTV in the late 1990s as a music video with clips from the 1996 hit film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. It was also featured in the film &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999).

In 1997, the band played themselves in an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as the featured entertainment at their college graduation party, hosted by Kelly Taylor&#x27;s dad. The band performed &quot;Lovefool&quot; and &quot;Been It.&quot; Their song &quot;Carnival&quot; was featured in the 1997 film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. The band was also asked to submit the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; but rejected the request due to exhaustion that would be exacerbated by the potential added workload; Persson has called her decision to turn down the offer &quot;one of my biggest mistakes.&quot;

1998&#x27;s &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was followed by a long hiatus during which the band members pursued solo side projects. The same year they also released a compilation album of rare B-sides, &quot;The Other Side of the Moon&quot; as a Japan-only release. The video of the song &quot;My Favourite Game&quot; was censored by MTV for showing reckless driving. Despite this, it went on to become their second global hit song. &quot;My Favourite Game&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the PlayStation video game &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot; in the intro movie on CD1. That year also saw their song &quot;Deuce&quot; appearing on &quot;The X-Files: The Album&quot;. Their song &quot;Erase/Rewind&quot; was featured in the 1999 films &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;. In 2018, German author Thorsten Nagelschmidt published a book titled &quot;Der Abfall der Herzen,&quot; a reference to the band&#x27;s song &quot;Junk of the Hearts&quot; featured on &quot;Gran Turismo.&quot;

In 1999, the Cardigans recorded a duet cover of Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; with Tom Jones for his album &quot;Reload&quot;.

===Back to spotlight and hiatus: 2002–2006===

The Cardigans returned in 2002 to record &quot;Long Gone Before Daylight&quot; (2003), a collection of songs mainly written by Persson and Svensson. &quot;Long Gone Before Daylight&quot; became one of the best selling albums in Sweden in 2003. After a two-year hiatus from their last album, it was released in Japan on 19 March 2003 and in Europe on 24 March 2003. Later it was also released in Canada (22 April 2003) and the United States (25 May 2004).

The album differs from the band&#x27;s earlier works. Their familiar &quot;happy&quot; pop sound takes on a change to pop songs with more of an American country music influence. It is a much darker album than their previous works, and quieter than &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. Indeed, even lead singer Nina Persson dyed her once light blonde hair to jet black, reflecting the band&#x27;s change of mood. The album was produced by Per Sunding after the group&#x27;s regular producer Tore Johanssen stepped down, feeling himself unable to provide the country sound the group wanted.

Criticism was generally mixed. Some found the change of direction welcome, and felt the band had matured, making songs that were even better than other experienced country-pop styled artists. Others missed the old pop sound, and accused the band of possibly being ashamed of their former &quot;happy&quot; pop sound. The first single of the album, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; was released on 17 February 2003. The second single was &quot;You&#x27;re the Storm&quot; released on 2 June 2003. The third and final single was &quot;Live and Learn&quot; released on 3 December 2003. In the summer of 2004, The Cardigans toured with Liz Phair, Katy Rose and Charlotte Martin on the Chicks With Attitude tour.

On 28 April 2005, the band&#x27;s &quot;iTunes Originals&quot; album was released through iTunes. On 19 October 2005, the band released their sixth album &quot;Super Extra Gravity&quot; to generally favourable reviews. &quot;Super Extra Gravity&quot; went straight to the #1 spot on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold (sales over 40,000). After the band finished promotional activities in Autumn 2006, the band entered an extended hiatus and devoted themselves to other projects.

===Reunion, touring and future: 2012–present===
In 2012, the Cardigans received a lucrative offer from Hultsfred Festival to perform the album &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; in full. After initial hesitation, the band decided to accept the offer &quot;as it felt like a good way of tearing us out of our strange new everyday life,&quot; according to Persson. Peter Svensson declined to participate, although he had no objection to the band touring without him. They recruited singer-songwriter Oskar Humlebo to fill in for Svensson, and asked their agent to seek more shows for them to play. Ultimately, the band made their live comeback with shows in Lund and Copenhagen ahead of Hultsfred, before playing in Poland, Finland, Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Japan, with a scheduled concert in Israel cancelled by the promoter. Most of these shows involved performing &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; in full, followed by an assortment of hits from their other albums.

Still with Humlebo in place of Svensson, the band played career-spanning sets when touring resumed during late 2013 with shows in Japan, China and Russia, followed by more dates in 2015 which took them to South Korea, Europe and Latin America. In interviews promoting her 2014 solo album &quot;Animal Heart&quot;, Persson suggested that the success of their most recent live dates opened the possibility for future Cardigans recordings, though there were no firm plans. &quot;It&#x27;s really fun to do greatest hits things, since there&#x27;s nothing else, but I think if we continue having this much fun we would like to make another record, because we like to create new things,&quot; said Persson. The band&#x27;s only scheduled show for 2016 was at Qstock (Oulu, Finland) on 29 July. In 2017, they performed in Stockholm, in Turku, and at the Yammatovo 3 festival in Croatia.

In June 2018, the band announced their only live shows of the year: a four-date UK tour in December to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; in which they would perform the album in full again. In an interview to promote the tour, Persson stated, &quot;There won&#x27;t be any more Cardigans records, I&#x27;m pretty sure. But we&#x27;ll keep doing little tours and shows as long as it&#x27;s fun, as long as we can do it well and feel that it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s current to us.&quot;

In May 2023, Nina Persson confirmed Peter Svensson would never rejoin the band, and that as a result there would be no new Cardigans albums. The idea of making new music without Svensson was overruled too. The band keeps on touring sporadically.

On September 6, 2024, the band released the two-volume B-sides compilation &quot;The Rest Of The Best.&quot;

==Solo projects==
During the band&#x27;s first break Nina Persson released an album as A Camp, and Peter Svensson and Bengt Lagerberg worked on the project Paus with help from Joakim Berg from Kent, and Magnus Sveningsson recorded as Righteous Boy.

In 2006, Sveningsson restarted their old label &quot;Trampolene&quot; and became an A&amp;R for it. The first signing was the Swedish popband &quot;The Animal Five&quot;, which was a minor success in Sweden and Germany.

Lagerberg and Johansson formed the group Brothers Of End, releasing a debut album &quot;The End&quot; in 2009, and a second album &quot;Mount Inside&quot; in 2011. A third album, &quot;Shakers Love&quot;, was released in 2014, and Nina Persson appeared on the track &quot;Heat&quot;.

In November 2006, Persson featured on &quot;The Cake Sale&quot;, an album set up by Oxfam Ireland. It contained nine tracks from some of Ireland&#x27;s leading artists. Proceeds from the album went to the fair trade campaign.

Persson also appeared on the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; album &quot;Send Away the Tigers&quot; (May 2007), providing guest vocals on the UK Chart #2 single &quot;Your Love Alone Is Not Enough&quot;. She shared vocals with Manics frontman James Dean Bradfield, who also appeared on stage with the band at the Glastonbury Festival 2007, and who has rated Peter Svensson as his second favourite guitarist.

In the band&#x27;s break of 2007, Persson recorded the second A Camp album &quot;Colonia&quot;, which was released in early 2009. A Camp supported the US release of &quot;Colonia&quot; with a tour, which began in New York City on 26 May and completed on 15 June in Los Angeles.

In 2010, Persson appeared on Danger Mouse &amp; Sparklehorse&#x27;s collaboration (Dark Night of the Soul) singing &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gone&quot; (with Mark Linkous).

Persson released the album &quot;Animal Heart&quot; under her own name in 2014.

<doc id="173213" wikidata="Q4939941" url="?curid=173213" title="Bolo (1987 video game)">
<text>Bolo is a video game initially created for the BBC Micro computer by Stuart Cheshire in 1987, and was later ported by Cheshire to the Apple Macintosh. Although offered for sale for the BBC Micro, this version is now regarded as lost. It is a networked multiplayer game that simulates a tank battlefield. Currently, a Windows version known as Winbolo remains in operation and continues to have a small but active player base. 

==Name==
According to the Bolo Frequently Asked Questions page: &quot;Bolo is the Hindi word for communication. &quot;Bolo&quot; is about computers communicating on the network, and more importantly about humans communicating with each other, as they argue, negotiate, form alliances, agree strategies, etc.&quot;

Another tank game with the same name was created for the Apple II in 1982. In the user manual, Cheshire wrote that this was &quot;an unfortunate coincidence&quot;.

Bolo is also the name for a class of self-aware tanks in a series of stories initially published in 1960 by science fiction writer Keith Laumer.

== Description ==
== Networking ==
The Macintosh version of Bolo supported up to sixteen concurrent networked players,
using AppleTalk over a Local Area Network,
or UDP over the Internet. All AppleTalk network connection types were supported, including LocalTalk, EtherTalk, TokenTalk, and AppleTalk Remote Access. The current Windows version continues to support 16 players, who join via an active games page or the game&#x27;s Discord channel.

<text>Compañía Dominicana de Aviación, usually shortened to Dominicana, was an airline based in the Dominican Republic and served as the flag carrier for the country.

==History==


Dominicana was established in 1944 in an effort to create a national airline aiming at the large number of Dominican citizens who emigrated to the United States, Puerto Rico and Spain. The initial fleet consisted of the Douglas C-47 and DC-6. During the 1950s, Dominicana launched a domestic route network to places such as Puerto Plata, La Romana and Santiago de los Caballeros, acquiring Curtiss C-46 Commando and Aviation Traders Carvair airplanes. In 1960, the airline was operating international nonstop passenger service between Ciudad Trujillo (the capitol of the Dominican Republic which was later renamed Santo Domingo) and Miami with Douglas DC-4 propliners and also nonstop between Ciudad Trujillo and San Juan, Puerto Rico with Douglas DC-3 and Curtiss C-46 prop aircraft. Later during the 1960s, Dominicana renewed its fleet with the Douglas DC-8, McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 727 jetliners. The route network was further expanded, with more destinations in the Americas and the Caribbean during the 1970s. At its height in the 1980s, Dominicana operated the Boeing 747 to European destinations like Madrid, Milan, and Frankfurt.

At the end of the decade, the airline&#x27;s economic situation worsened due to poor management, lack of innovation or cost-cutting culture, and the heavy maintenance costs of its aging fleet. More importantly, on the revenue side, government employees also sought to fly non-revenue, given the typical patronage in the Dominican Republic with many flights full of them often displacing paying passengers. Subsequently, the fleet and network were scaled back, leaving only the original routes like New York, Miami, Caracas, and San Juan. In an effort to save on maintenance costs, Dominicana began to operate leased aircraft (mostly Boeing 727s and also Airbus A300s). The financial situation further worsened into the 1990s, which coincided with a negative customer reputation (like lost or delayed luggage as well as unreliable schedules). In 1994, now also faced with Cat1 restrictions in the US, Dominicana wet-leased a Boeing 737-300 and a Boeing 757-200 from Mexican low-cost airline TAESA. Further aircraft were wet-leased from Capitol Air Express
Express One International, Atlantic Aviation and Carnival Air Lines. During Christmas of 1994, many Dominicana VFR passengers were stranded at JFK, MIA, and SJU when the airline was unable to provide necessary funding to lessors for heavily-booked Christmas flights (and, overbooked for the B727 the lessors were providing, since an A300 had been expected to be wet-leased). As a consequence of the outrage, in early 1995 the government of the Dominican Republic decided to shut down the airline. While the shutdown was originally only planned as a temporary measure to get re-organized, the company never became operational again, and was dissolved in 1999. The vice president at the time was quoted saying that &quot;Dominicans can fly APA International&quot; which was another &quot;local&quot; airline that benefited handsomely from Dominicana&#x27;s demise. While several attempts have been made to privatize the airline, no efforts came to fruition. American Airlines and later JetBlue dominated the market and the business case for a new Dominican flag carrier is relatively weak given the investment that would be required and the debts that would have to be honored in order to use the Dominicana name.

==Fleet==
Over the years, Dominicana operated the following aircraft types:

===Livery===
The most common Dominicana livery consisted of a metallic silver fuselage, with red and blue cheatlines going all the way from the cockpit to the tail painting, representing the colors in the Dominican flag. The &quot;Dominicana&quot; titles were written in black letters above the passenger windows.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 11 January 1948, a Dominicana Douglas C-47 Skytrain (registered HI-6) crashed into a mountain near Yamasá in bad weather conditions, killing all 30 passengers and two crew members on board, amongst them the baseball team of B.B.C Santiago. The aircraft had been on a scheduled flight from Barahona to Santiago de los Caballeros.
*On 17 July 1958 at 10:16 UTC, a Curtiss C-46 Commando aircraft (registered HI-16) operating Dominicana Flight 402 from Ciudad Trujillo (today&#x27;s Santo Domingo) to Miami crashed shortly after take-off due to an engine problem, killing the two pilots on board.
*On 23 June 1969 at 15:42 local time, a Dominicana Aviation Traders Carvair aircraft (registered HI-168), which was operating Flight 401 from Miami to Santo Domingo, crashed shortly after take-off from Miami International Airport, killing all four persons on board, as well as six people on the ground. The aircraft had suffered an engine failure during take-off run, on which the pilots were not able to react accordingly.
*On 15 February 1970 at approximately 18:30 local time, a Dominicana McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (registered HI-177) crashed into the sea some 3 kilometres off Santo Domingo, killing all 97 passengers and 5 crew members on board, making it the deadliest accident in the history of the Dominican Republic until the crash of Birgenair Flight 301 in 1996. The aircraft had just departed Las Américas International Airport for a scheduled flight to San Juan, when it suffered a dual engine failure.
*On 5 September 1993, a Dominicana Boeing 727-200 (registered HI-617CA) was destroyed in a fire at Las Américas Airport. The then 20 years old aircraft had been operating a scheduled flight from San Juan to Santo Domingo carrying 98 passengers and 7 crew members, when the cabin filled with smoke during disembarkation, which was caused by a fire due to electrical overheating. All people involved managed to leave the aircraft before it was completely engulfed by the flames.

<doc id="173222" wikidata="Q3293758" url="?curid=173222" title="Loyd Jowers">
<text>Loyd Jowers (November 20, 1926May 20, 2000) was an American restaurateur and the owner of Jim&#x27;s Grill, a restaurant near the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. For the first 25 years after the assassination of King, Jowers testified that he was in the restaurant at the time of the assassination, a fact supported by the other witnesses in the restaurant. 

In 1993, Jowers appeared on the ABC News program &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; and claimed to be part of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the U.S. government to kill King. According to Jowers, the alleged assassin, James Earl Ray, was a scapegoat, and was not the only person responsible for assassinating King. Jowers named a number of different people as the alleged assassins, including a black man who was in the area, a man named Raoul named by Ray to have been involved, and someone he could not identify before finally settling on the story that he hired Memphis police Lieutenant Earl Clark to fire the fatal shot. A Memphis civil trial in 1999 supported this claim, not having been shown evidence of Jowers&#x27; contradictions. In 2000, the United States Department of Justice released a 150-page report denying allegations that there was a conspiracy to assassinate King.

==Martin Luther King Jr. assassination==
In a 1993 episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, Jowers told reporter Sam Donaldson that he hired someone to kill King as a favor to a friend in the mafia, produce merchant Frank Liberto. Jowers said Liberto, who had died prior to the ABC interview, had paid him $100,000 to arrange the assassination. He did not name the person he claimed to have hired, but said it was not Ray.

===&quot;Coretta Scott King v. Loyd Jowers&quot;===
In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and &quot;other unknown co-conspirators&quot; for the murder of King. The King family was represented by attorney William Pepper, who had previously served as the attorney of James Earl Ray, King&#x27;s formerly accused assassin, in a televised, mock trial. According to The &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Pepper had &quot;for years claimed the assassination was the result of a vast conspiracy involving the FBI, CIA and the Army, organized crime and various state and local officials.&quot; After four weeks of testimony which involved over 70 witnesses and thousands of pages of new evidence, a Memphis jury unanimously found, on December 8, 1999, that Jowers was part of a conspiracy to kill King, and that the assassination plot also involved &quot;others, including governmental agencies.&quot;

At a press conference following the verdict, Coretta Scott King stated that &quot;there is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr... the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.&quot;

Following statements by Dexter King and other family members, Dexter was subsequently asked by a reporter, &quot;there are many people out there who feel that as long as these conspirators remain nameless and faceless there is no true closure, and no justice.&quot; He replied:

No, he [Mr. Lloyd Jowers] named the shooter. The shooter was the Memphis Police Department Officer, Lt. Earl Clark who he named as the killer. Once again, beyond that you had credible witnesses that named members of a Special Forces team who didn&#x27;t have to act because the contract killer succeeded, with plausible denial, a Mafia contracted killer.

The Memphis county prosecutor said on several occasions that Mr. Jowers&#x27; claims were without merit and that he was motivated to sell his story for a book or a movie. Ray&#x27;s lawyer claimed two sisters who worked at Jowers&#x27; restaurant would corroborate Jowers&#x27; claim, but both recanted their stories. One sister said that Jowers had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story; she in turn corroborated his story in order to get money to pay taxes. In a telephone conversation taped by authorities, Jowers&#x27; main witness stated that his story was false.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The trial relied heavily on second- and third-hand accounts, and the judge and jurors were often seen dozing off during testimony.&quot; John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis who was part of the criminal trial against James Earl Ray, said: &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr. Pepper&#x27;s version?&quot;

Gerald Posner, an investigative journalist who wrote the book &quot;Killing the Dream&quot; in which he makes the case that Ray was the killer, said after the verdict: &quot;It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.&quot;

===Justice Department investigation===
Prompted by the King family&#x27;s acceptance of some of the conspiracy theories, United States Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new investigation on August 26, 1998. On June 9, 2000, the United States Department of Justice released a 150-page report rejecting allegations that there was a conspiracy to assassinate King, including the findings of the Memphis civil court jury. The DOJ considered suggestions by the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979 and the district attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee in 1998 that Ray&#x27;s brothers may have been co-conspirators and stated that they &quot;found insufficient evidentiary leads remaining after 30 years to justify further investigation.&quot;

==Death==
On May 20, 2000, Jowers died of a heart attack at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Union City, Tennessee. He was reported to have suffered from lung cancer at the time of his death.

<text>Tula (, ) is the largest city and the administrative center of Tula Oblast in Russia, located south of Moscow. Tula is located in the northern Central Russian Upland on the banks of the Upa River, a tributary of the Oka. At the 2010 census, Tula had a population of 501,169, an increase from 481,216 in 2002, making it the 32nd-largest city in Russia by population.A primarily industrial city, Tula was a fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. The city was seized by Ivan Bolotnikov in 1606 during the Time of Troubles and withstood a four-month siege by the Tsar&#x27;s army. Historically, Tula has been a major centre for the manufacture of armaments. The Demidov family built the first armament factory in Russia in the city, in what would become the Tula Arms Plant, which still operates to this day.

Tula is home to the Klokovo air base, Tula State University, the Tula Kremlin, Tula State Museum of Weapons, and Kazanskaya Embankment. Tula has a historical association with the samovar, a metal container used to heat and boil water; the city was a major center of Russian samovar production. Yasnaya Polyana, the former home of the writer Leo Tolstoy, is located southwest of Tula. Additionally, Tula is known for its imprinted gingerbread (pryanik), which has been made in Tula since the 17th century.

==Etymology==
The name of the city is likely pre-Russian, probably of Baltic origin.

==History==

Tula was first mentioned in the &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot; (year 1146).

In the Middle Ages, Tula was a minor fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. As soon as it passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, a brick citadel, or kremlin, was constructed in 1514–1521. It was a key fortress of the Great Abatis Belt and successfully resisted a siege by the Tatars in 1552. In 1607, Ivan Bolotnikov and his supporters seized the citadel and withstood a four-months siege by the Tsar&#x27;s army. In the 18th century, some parts of the kremlin walls were demolished. Despite its archaic appearance, the five-domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin was built as late as 1764.

In 1712, Tula was visited by Peter the Great, who commissioned the Demidov blacksmiths to build the first armament factory in Russia. Several decades later, Tula was turned by the Demidovs into the greatest ironworking center of Eastern Europe. The oldest museum in the city, showcasing the history of weapons, was inaugurated by the Demidovs in 1724, and Nicholas-Zaretsky Church in the city houses their family vault. The first factory to produce samovars industrially was also established there in the course of the 18th century. After the Demidovs moved the center of their manufacture to the Urals, Tula continued as a center of heavy industry, particularly in the manufacture of matériel.

In the 1890s, Ivan Savelyev, a medical orderly, became the founder of social democracy in Tula and set up a workers&#x27; study circle.

During World War II, the city was important in the production of armaments. Tula became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between 24 October and 5 December 1941. According to Erik Durschmied in &quot;The Weather Factor: How Nature has Changed History&quot;, one German general reached the southwestern outskirts of Tula on 29–30 October 1941. 
The heavily fortified city held out, however, and Guderian&#x27;s Second Panzer Army was stopped near Tula. The city secured the southern flank during the Battle of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976. It is home to the Klokovo air base and the Tula Arms Plant.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Tula serves as the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Tula City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the territories of Tula City Under Oblast Jurisdiction and of Leninsky District are incorporated as Tula Urban Okrug.

(The saying is falsely ascribed to the writer and playwright Anton Chekhov, whose made a satirical portrait of one of his characters saying &quot;Taking your wife to Paris is the same as taking your own samovar to Tula&quot;.)

<text>In geometry, a normal is an object (e.g. a line, ray, or vector) that is perpendicular to a given object. For example, the normal line to a plane curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point.

A normal vector of length one is called a unit normal vector. A curvature vector is a normal vector whose length is the curvature of the object. 
Multiplying a normal vector by results in the opposite vector, which may be used for indicating sides (e.g., interior or exterior).

In three-dimensional space, a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at point is a vector perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at . The word &quot;normal&quot; is also used as an adjective: a line &quot;normal&quot; to a plane, the &quot;normal&quot; component of a force, the normal vector, etc. The concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality (right angles).

The concept has been generalized to differentiable manifolds of arbitrary dimension embedded in a Euclidean space. The normal vector space or normal space of a manifold at point formula_1 is the set of vectors which are orthogonal to the tangent space at formula_2
Normal vectors are of special interest in the case of smooth curves and smooth surfaces.

The normal is often used in 3D computer graphics (notice the singular, as only one normal will be defined) to determine a surface&#x27;s orientation toward a light source for flat shading, or the orientation of each of the surface&#x27;s corners (vertices) to mimic a curved surface with Phong shading.

The foot of a normal at a point of interest &quot;Q&quot; (analogous to the foot of a perpendicular) can be defined at the point &quot;P&quot; on the surface where the normal vector contains &quot;Q&quot;.
The &quot;normal distance&quot; of a point &quot;Q&quot; to a curve or to a surface is the Euclidean distance between &quot;Q&quot; and its foot &quot;P&quot;.

==Normal to space curves==


The normal direction to a space curve is:
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the radius of curvature (reciprocal curvature);
formula_5 is the tangent vector, 
in terms of the curve position formula_6 and arc-length formula_7:
:formula_8

==Normal to planes and polygons==
For a convex polygon (such as a triangle), a surface normal can be calculated as the vector cross product of two (non-parallel) edges of the polygon.

For a plane given by the general form plane equation formula_9 the vector formula_10 is a normal.

For a plane whose equation is given in parametric form 
formula_11
where formula_12 is a point on the plane and formula_13 are non-parallel vectors pointing along the plane, a normal to the plane is a vector normal to both formula_14 and formula_15 which can be found as the cross product formula_16

==Normal to general surfaces in 3D space==
If a (possibly non-flat) surface formula_17 in 3D space formula_18 is parameterized by a system of curvilinear coordinates formula_19 with formula_7 and formula_21 real variables, then a normal to &quot;S&quot; is by definition a normal to a tangent plane, given by the cross product of the partial derivatives
formula_22

If a surface formula_17 is given implicitly as the set of points formula_24 satisfying formula_25 then a normal at a point formula_24 on the surface is given by the gradient
formula_27
since the gradient at any point is perpendicular to the level set formula_28

For a surface formula_17 in formula_18 given as the graph of a function formula_31 an upward-pointing normal can be found either from the parametrization formula_32 giving
formula_33
or more simply from its implicit form formula_34 giving formula_35 
Since a surface does not have a tangent plane at a singular point, it has no well-defined normal at that point: for example, the vertex of a cone. In general, it is possible to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous.

===Orientation===

The normal to a (hyper)surface is usually scaled to have unit length, but it does not have a unique direction, since its opposite is also a unit normal. For a surface which is the topological boundary of a set in three dimensions, one can distinguish between two normal orientations, the inward-pointing normal and outer-pointing normal. For an oriented surface, the normal is usually determined by the right-hand rule or its analog in higher dimensions.

If the normal is constructed as the cross product of tangent vectors (as described in the text above), it is a pseudovector.

===Transforming normals===
When applying a transform to a surface it is often useful to derive normals for the resulting surface from the original normals.

Specifically, given a 3×3 transformation matrix formula_36 we can determine the matrix formula_37 that transforms a vector formula_38 perpendicular to the tangent plane formula_39 into a vector formula_40 perpendicular to the transformed tangent plane formula_41 by the following logic:

Write n′ as formula_42 We must find formula_43
formula_44

Choosing formula_37 such that formula_46 or formula_47 will satisfy the above equation, giving a formula_48 perpendicular to formula_49 or an formula_40 perpendicular to formula_51 as required.

Therefore, one should use the inverse transpose of the linear transformation when transforming surface normals. The inverse transpose is equal to the original matrix if the matrix is orthonormal, that is, purely rotational with no scaling or shearing.

==Hypersurfaces in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space==
For an formula_52-dimensional hyperplane in formula_53-dimensional space formula_54 given by its parametric representation
formula_55
where formula_56 is a point on the hyperplane and formula_57 for formula_58 are linearly independent vectors pointing along the hyperplane, a normal to the hyperplane is any vector formula_59 in the null space of the matrix formula_60 meaning formula_61 That is, any vector orthogonal to all in-plane vectors is by definition a surface normal. Alternatively, if the hyperplane is defined as the solution set of a single linear equation formula_62 then the vector formula_63 is a normal.

The definition of a normal to a surface in three-dimensional space can be extended to formula_64-dimensional hypersurfaces in formula_65 A hypersurface may be locally defined implicitly as the set of points formula_66 satisfying an equation formula_67 where formula_68 is a given scalar function. If formula_68 is continuously differentiable then the hypersurface is a differentiable manifold in the neighbourhood of the points where the gradient is not zero. At these points a normal vector is given by the gradient:
formula_70

The normal line is the one-dimensional subspace with basis formula_71

==Varieties defined by implicit equations in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space==
A differential variety defined by implicit equations in the formula_53-dimensional space formula_54 is the set of the common zeros of a finite set of differentiable functions in formula_53 variables
formula_75
The Jacobian matrix of the variety is the formula_76 matrix whose formula_77-th row is the gradient of formula_78 By the implicit function theorem, the variety is a manifold in the neighborhood of a point where the Jacobian matrix has rank formula_79 At such a point formula_80 the normal vector space is the vector space generated by the values at formula_1 of the gradient vectors of the formula_78 

In other words, a variety is defined as the intersection of formula_83 hypersurfaces, and the normal vector space at a point is the vector space generated by the normal vectors of the hypersurfaces at the point.

The normal (affine) space at a point formula_1 of the variety is the affine subspace passing through formula_1 and generated by the normal vector space at formula_2

These definitions may be extended to the points where the variety is not a manifold.

===Example===
Let &quot;V&quot; be the variety defined in the 3-dimensional space by the equations 
formula_87
This variety is the union of the formula_88-axis and the formula_89-axis.

At a point formula_90 where formula_91 the rows of the Jacobian matrix are formula_92 and formula_93 Thus the normal affine space is the plane of equation formula_94 Similarly, if formula_95 the &quot;normal plane&quot; at formula_96 is the plane of equation formula_97 

At the point formula_98 the rows of the Jacobian matrix are formula_92 and formula_100 Thus the normal vector space and the normal affine space have dimension 1 and the normal affine space is the formula_101-axis.

==Uses==
* Surface normals are useful in defining surface integrals of vector fields.
* Surface normals are commonly used in 3D computer graphics for lighting calculations (see Lambert&#x27;s cosine law), often adjusted by normal mapping.
* Render layers containing surface normal information may be used in digital compositing to change the apparent lighting of rendered elements.
* In computer vision, the shapes of 3D objects are estimated from surface normals using photometric stereo.
*The normal vector may be obtained as the gradient of the signed distance function.

==Normal in geometric optics==

The is the outward-pointing ray perpendicular to the surface of an optical medium at a given point. In reflection of light, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are respectively the angle between the normal and the incident ray (on the plane of incidence) and the angle between the normal and the reflected ray.

<doc id="173225" wikidata="Q558104" url="?curid=173225" title="Alan Lomax">
<text>Alan Lomax (; January 31, 1915 – July 19, 2002) was an American ethnomusicologist, best known for his numerous field recordings of folk music of the 20th century. He was a musician, folklorist, archivist, writer, scholar, political activist, oral historian, and filmmaker. Lomax produced recordings, concerts, and radio shows in the U.S. and in England, which played an important role in preserving folk music traditions in both countries, and helped start both the American and British folk revivals of the 1940s, 1950s, and especially the early 1960s. He collected material first with his father, folklorist and collector John Lomax, and later alone and with others. Lomax recorded thousands of songs and interviews for the Archive of American Folk Song, of which he was the director, at the Library of Congress on aluminum and acetate discs.

After 1942, when Congress terminated the Library of Congress&#x27;s funding for folk song collecting, Lomax continued to collect independently in Britain, Ireland, Caribbean region, Italy, Spain, and United States, using the latest recording technology, assembling an enormous collection of American and international culture. In March 2004, the material captured and produced without Library of Congress funding was acquired by the Library, which &quot;brings the entire seventy years of Alan Lomax&#x27;s work together under one roof at the Library of Congress, where it has found a permanent home.&quot; With the start of the Cold War, Lomax continued to advocate for a public role for folklore, even as academic folklorists turned inward. He devoted much of the latter part of his life to advocating what he called Cultural Equity, which he sought to put on a solid theoretical foundation through to his Cantometrics research (which included a prototype Cantometrics-based educational program, the Global Jukebox). In the 1970s and 1980s, Lomax advised the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Folklife Festival and produced a series of films about folk music, &quot;American Patchwork&quot;, which aired on PBS in 1991. In his late 70s, Lomax completed the long-deferred memoir &quot;The Land Where the Blues Began&quot; (1993), linking the birth of the blues to debt peonage, segregation, and forced labor in the American South.

Lomax&#x27;s greatest legacy is in preserving and publishing recordings of musicians in many folk and blues traditions around the U.S. and Europe. Artists Lomax is credited with discovering and bringing to a wider audience include blues guitarist Robert Johnson, protest singer Woody Guthrie, folk artist Pete Seeger, country musician Burl Ives, Scottish Gaelic singer Flora MacNeil, and country blues singers Lead Belly and Muddy Waters, among many others. &quot;Alan scraped by the whole time, and left with no money,&quot; said Don Fleming, director of Lomax&#x27;s Association for Culture Equity. &quot;He did it out of the passion he had for it, and found ways to fund projects that were closest to his heart&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lomax was born in Austin, Texas, in 1915, the third of four children born to Bess Brown and pioneering folklorist and author John A. Lomax. Two of his siblings also developed significant careers studying folklore: Bess Lomax Hawes and John Lomax Jr.

The elder Lomax, a former professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University and a celebrated authority on Texas folklore and cowboy songs, had worked as an administrator, and later Secretary of the Alumni Society, of the University of Texas.

Due to childhood asthma, chronic ear infections, and generally frail health, Lomax had mostly been home schooled in elementary school. In Dallas, he entered the Terrill School for Boys (a tiny prep school that later became St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas). Lomax excelled at Terrill and then transferred to the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Connecticut for a year, graduating eighth in his class at age 15 in 1930.

Owing to his mother&#x27;s declining health, however, rather than going to Harvard University as his father had wished, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin. A roommate, future anthropologist Walter Goldschmidt, recalled Lomax as &quot;frighteningly smart, probably classifiable as a genius&quot;, though Goldschmidt remembers Lomax exploding one night while studying: &quot;Damn it! The hardest thing I&#x27;ve had to learn is that I&#x27;m not a genius.&quot; At the University of Texas, Lomax read Nietzsche and developed an interest in philosophy. He joined and wrote a few columns for the school paper, &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; but resigned when it refused to publish an editorial he had written on birth control.

At this time he also he began collecting &quot;race&quot; records and taking his dates to black-owned nightclubs, at the risk of expulsion. During the spring term his mother died, and his youngest sister Bess, age 10, was sent to live with an aunt. Although the Great Depression was rapidly causing his family&#x27;s resources to plummet, Harvard came up with enough financial aid for the 16-year-old Lomax to spend his second year there. He enrolled in philosophy and physics and also pursued a long-distance informal reading course in Plato and the Pre-Socratics with University of Texas professor Albert P. Brogan. He also became involved in radical politics and came down with pneumonia. His grades suffered, diminishing his financial aid prospects.

Lomax, now 17, therefore took a break from studying to join his father&#x27;s folk song collecting field trips for the Library of Congress, co-authoring &quot;American Ballads and Folk Songs&quot; (1934) and &quot;Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly&quot; (1936). His first field collecting without his father was done with Zora Neale Hurston and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle in the summer of 1935. He returned to the University of Texas that fall and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, summa cum laude, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa in May 1936. Lack of money prevented him from immediately attending graduate school at the University of Chicago, as he desired, but he later corresponded with and pursued graduate studies with Melville J. Herskovits at Columbia University and with Ray Birdwhistell at the University of Pennsylvania.

Alan Lomax married Elizabeth Harold Goodman, then a student at the University of Texas, in February 1937. They were married for 12 years and had a daughter, Anne (later known as Anna). Elizabeth assisted him in recording in Haiti, Alabama, Appalachia, and Mississippi. Elizabeth also wrote radio scripts of folk operas featuring American music that were broadcast over the BBC Home Service as part of the war effort.

During the 1950s, after she and Lomax divorced, she conducted lengthy interviews for Lomax with folk music personalities, including Vera Ward Hall and the Reverend Gary Davis. Lomax also did important field work with Elizabeth Barnicle and Zora Neale Hurston in Florida and the Bahamas (1935); with John Wesley Work III and Lewis Jones in Mississippi (1941 and 42); with folksingers Robin Roberts and Jean Ritchie in Ireland (1950); with his second wife Antoinette Marchand in the Caribbean (1961); with Shirley Collins in Great Britain and the Southeastern U.S. (1959); with Joan Halifax in Morocco; and with his daughter. All those who assisted and worked with him were accurately credited on the resultant Library of Congress and other recordings, as well as in his many books, films, and publications.

===Assistant in charge as well as commercial records and radio broadcasts===
From 1937 to 1942, Lomax was Assistant in Charge of the Archive of Folk Song of the Library of Congress to which he and his father and numerous collaborators contributed more than ten thousand field recordings. A pioneering oral historian, Lomax recorded substantial interviews with many folk, blues, and jazz musicians, including Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Jelly Roll Morton, and Big Bill Broonzy. On one of his trips in 1941, he went to Clarksdale, Mississippi, hoping to record the music of Robert Johnson. When he arrived, he was told by locals that Johnson had died, but that another local musician, Muddy Waters, might be willing to record his music for Lomax. Using recording equipment that filled the trunk of his car, Lomax recorded Waters&#x27; music; it is said that hearing Lomax&#x27;s recording was the motivation that Waters needed to leave his farm job in Mississippi to pursue a career as a blues musician full-time, first in Memphis and later in Chicago.

As part of this work, Lomax traveled through Michigan and Wisconsin in 1938 to record and document the traditional music of that region. Over four hundred recordings from this collection are now available at the Library of Congress. &quot;He traveled in a 1935 Plymouth sedan, toting a Presto instantaneous disc recorder and a movie camera. And when he returned nearly three months later, having driven thousands of miles on barely paved roads, it was with a cache of 250 discs and 8 reels of film, documents of the incredible range of ethnic diversity, expressive traditions, and occupational folklife in Michigan.&quot;

In late 1939, Lomax hosted two series on CBS&#x27;s nationally broadcast &quot;American School of the Air&quot;, called &quot;American Folk Song&quot; and &quot;Wellsprings of Music&quot;, both music appreciation courses that aired daily in the schools and were supposed to highlight links between American folk and classical orchestral music. As host, Lomax sang and presented other performers, including Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Josh White, and the Golden Gate Quartet. The individual programs reached ten million students in 200,000 U.S. classrooms and were also broadcast in Canada, Hawaii, and Alaska, but both Lomax and his father felt that the concept of the shows, which portrayed folk music as mere raw material for orchestral music, was deeply flawed and failed to do justice to vernacular culture.

In 1940, under Lomax&#x27;s supervision, RCA made two groundbreaking suites of commercial folk music recordings: Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot; and Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Special and Other Southern Prison Songs&quot;. Though they did not sell especially well when released, Lomax&#x27;s biographer John Szwed calls these &quot;some of the first concept albums&quot;.

In 1940, Lomax and his close friend Nicholas Ray wrote and produced the 15-minute program &quot;Back Where I Came From&quot;, which aired three nights per week on CBS and featured folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson Rockefeller from the Pan American Union, and the president of the American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park.

Despite its success and high visibility, &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February 1941. On hearing the news, Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, &quot;Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country&#x27;s a getting to where it can&#x27;t hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change.&quot; Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture &quot;the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.&quot;

On December 8, 1941, as &quot;Assistant in Charge at the Library of Congress&quot;, he sent telegrams to fieldworkers in ten different localities across the United States, asking them to collect reactions of ordinary Americans to the bombing of Pearl Harbor the prior day and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States. A second series of interviews, called &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, was recorded in January and February 1942.

While serving in the United States Army in World War II, Lomax produced and hosted numerous radio programs in connection with the war effort. The 1944 &quot;ballad opera&quot;, &quot;The Martins and the Coys&quot;, broadcast in Britain (but not the U.S.) by the BBC, featuring Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Will Geer, Sonny Terry, Pete Seeger, and Fiddlin&#x27; Arthur Smith, among others, was released on Rounder Records in 2000.

In the late 1940s, Lomax produced a series of commercial folk music albums for Decca Records and organized a series of concerts at New York&#x27;s Town Hall and Carnegie Hall, featuring blues, calypso, and flamenco music. He also hosted a radio show, &quot;Your Ballad Man&quot;, in 1949 that was broadcast nationwide on the Mutual Radio Network and featured a highly eclectic program, such as gamelan music; Django Reinhardt; klezmer music; Sidney Bechet; Wild Bill Davison; jazzy pop songs by Maxine Sullivan and Jo Stafford; readings of the poetry of Carl Sandburg; hillbilly music with electric guitars; and Finnish brass bands. He also was a key participant in the V.D. Radio Project in 1949, creating a number of &quot;ballad dramas&quot; featuring country and gospel superstars, including Roy Acuff, Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe (among others), that aimed to convince men and women suffering from syphilis to seek treatment.

===Move to Europe and later life===
In December 1949, a newspaper printed a story, &quot;Red Convictions Scare &#x27;Travelers, that mentioned a dinner given by the Civil Rights Association to honor five lawyers who had defended people accused of being Communists. The article mentioned Alan Lomax as one of the sponsors of the dinner, along with C. B. Baldwin, campaign manager for Henry A. Wallace in 1948; music critic Olin Downes of &quot;The New York Times&quot;; and W. E. B. Du Bois, all of whom it accused of being members of Communist front groups. The following June, &quot;Red Channels&quot;, a pamphlet edited by former F.B.I. agents which became the basis for the entertainment industry blacklist of the 1950s, listed Lomax as an artist or broadcast journalist sympathetic to Communism. (Others listed included Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, Yip Harburg, Lena Horne, Langston Hughes, Burl Ives, Dorothy Parker, Pete Seeger, and Josh White.) That summer, Congress was debating the McCarran Act, which required the registration and fingerprinting of all &quot;subversives&quot; in the United States, restrictions of their right to travel, and detention in case of &quot;emergencies&quot;, while the House Un-American Activities Committee was broadening its hearings. Feeling sure that the Act would pass and realizing that his career in broadcasting was in jeopardy, Lomax, who was newly divorced and already had an agreement with Goddard Lieberson of Columbia Records to record in Europe, hastened to renew his passport, cancel his speaking engagements, and plan for his departure, telling his agent he hoped to return in January &quot;if things cleared up&quot;. He set sail on September 24, 1950, on board the steamer . Sure enough, in October, FBI agents were interviewing Lomax&#x27;s friends and acquaintances. Lomax never told his family exactly why he went to Europe, only that he was developing a library of world folk music for Columbia. Nor did he allow anyone to say he was forced to leave. In a letter to the editor of a British newspaper, Lomax took a writer to task for describing him as a &quot;victim of witch-hunting,&quot; insisting that he was in the UK only to work on his Columbia Project.

Lomax spent the 1950s based in London, from where he edited the 18-volume &quot;Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music&quot;, an anthology issued on newly invented LP records. He spent seven months in Spain, where, in addition to recording three thousand items from most of the regions of Spain, he made copious notes and took hundreds of photos of &quot;not only singers and musicians but anything that interested him – empty streets, old buildings, and country roads&quot;, bringing to these photos, &quot;a concern for form and composition that went beyond the ethnographic to the artistic&quot;. He drew a parallel between photography and field recording:

Recording folk songs works like a candid cameraman. I hold the mike, use my hand for shading volume. It&#x27;s a big problem in Spain because there is so much emotional excitement, noise all around. Empathy is most important in field work. It&#x27;s necessary to put your hand on the artist while he sings. They have to react to you. Even if they&#x27;re mad at you, it&#x27;s better than nothing.

When Columbia Records producer George Avakian gave jazz arranger Gil Evans a copy of the Spanish World Library LP, Miles Davis and Evans were &quot;struck by the beauty of pieces such as the &#x27;Saeta&#x27;, recorded in Seville, and a panpiper&#x27;s tune (&#x27;Alborada de Vigo&#x27;) from Galicia, and worked them into the 1960 album &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot;&quot;

For the Scottish, English, and Irish volumes, he worked with the BBC and folklorists Peter Douglas Kennedy, Scots poet Hamish Henderson, and with the Irish folklorist Séamus Ennis, recording among others, Margaret Barry and the songs in Irish of Elizabeth Cronin; Scots ballad singer Jeannie Robertson; and Harry Cox of Norfolk, England, and interviewing some of these performers at length about their lives. In 1953 a young David Attenborough commissioned Lomax to host six 20-minute episodes of the BBC TV series &quot;The Song Hunter&quot;, which featured performances by a wide range of traditional musicians from all over Britain and Ireland, as well as Lomax himself. In 1957, Lomax hosted a folk music show on BBC&#x27;s Home Service titled &quot;A Ballad Hunter&quot; and organized a skiffle group, Alan Lomax and the Ramblers (who included Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger, and Shirley Collins), which appeared on British television. His ballad opera &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; premiered December 1955 at Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop and featured Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliot. In Scotland, Lomax is credited with being an inspiration for the School of Scottish Studies, founded in 1951, the year of his first visit there.
Lomax and Diego Carpitella&#x27;s survey of Italian folk music for the &quot;Columbia World Library&quot;, conducted in 1953 and 1954, with the cooperation of the BBC and the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, helped capture a snapshot of a multitude of important traditional folk styles shortly before they disappeared. The pair amassed one of the most representative folk song collections of any culture. From Lomax&#x27;s Spanish and Italian recordings emerged one of the first theories explaining the types of folk singing that predominate in particular areas, a theory that incorporates work style, the environment, and the degrees of social and sexual freedom.

==Return to the United States==
Upon his return to New York in 1959, Lomax produced a concert, Folksong &#x27;59, at Carnegie Hall, featuring Arkansas singer Jimmy Driftwood; the Selah Jubilee Singers and Drexel Singers (gospel groups); Muddy Waters and Memphis Slim (blues); Earl Taylor and the Stoney Mountain Boys (bluegrass); Pete Seeger, Mike Seeger (urban folk revival); and the Cadillacs (a rock and roll group). The occasion marked the first time rock and roll and bluegrass were performed on the Carnegie Hall Stage. &quot;The time has come for Americans not to be ashamed of what we go for, musically, from primitive ballads to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs&quot;, Lomax told the audience. According to Izzy Young, the audience booed when he told them to lay down their prejudices and listen to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. In Young&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Lomax put on what is probably the turning point in American folk music...At that concert, the point he was trying to make was that Negro and white music were mixing, and rock and roll was that thing.&quot;

Alan Lomax had met 20-year-old English folk singer Shirley Collins while living in London. The two were romantically involved and lived together for some years. When Lomax obtained a contract from Atlantic Records to re-record some of the American musicians first recorded in the 1940s, using improved equipment, Collins accompanied him. Their folk song collecting trip to the Southern states, known colloquially as the Southern Journey, lasted from July to November 1959 and resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, Wade Ward, Charlie Higgins and Bessie Jones and culminated in the discovery of Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued under the title &quot;Sounds of the&quot; &quot;South&quot; and some were also featured in the Coen brothers&#x27; 2000 film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. Lomax wished to marry Collins but when the recording trip was over, she returned to England and married Austin John Marshall. In an interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Collins expressed irritation that &quot;The Land Where The Blues Began&quot;, Lomax&#x27;s 1993 account of the journey, barely mentioned her. &quot;All it said was, &#x27;Shirley Collins was along for the trip&#x27;. It made me hopping mad. I wasn&#x27;t just &#x27;along for the trip&#x27;. I was part of the recording process, I made notes, I drafted contracts, I was involved in every part&quot;. Collins addressed the perceived omission in her memoir, &quot;America Over the Water&quot;, published in 2004.

Lomax married Antoinette Marchand on August 26, 1961. They separated the following year and divorced in 1967.

In 1962, Lomax and singer and civil rights activist Guy Carawan, music director at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, produced the album &quot;Freedom in the Air: Albany Georgia, 1961–62&quot; for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee on Vanguard Records.

Lomax was a consultant to Carl Sagan for the Voyager Golden Record sent into space on the 1977 Voyager Spacecraft to represent the music of the earth. Music he helped choose included the blues, jazz, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll of Blind Willie Johnson, Louis Armstrong, and Chuck Berry; Andean panpipes and Navajo chants; Azerbaijani mugham performed by two balaban players, a Sicilian sulfur miner&#x27;s lament; polyphonic vocal music from the Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire, and the Georgians of the Caucasus; and a shepherdess song from Bulgaria by Valya Balkanska; in addition to Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and more. Sagan later wrote that it was Lomax &quot;who was a persistent and vigorous advocate for including ethnic music even at the expense of Western classical music. He brought pieces so compelling and beautiful that we gave in to his suggestions more often than I would have thought possible. There was, for example, no room for Debussy among our selections because Azerbaijanis play bagpipe-sounding instruments [balaban] and Peruvians play panpipes and such exquisite pieces had been recorded by ethnomusicologists known to Lomax.&quot;

==Death==
Alan Lomax died in Safety Harbor, Florida, on July 19, 2002, at the age of 87.

==Cultural equity==


As a member of the Popular Front and People&#x27;s Songs in the 1940s, Alan Lomax promoted what was then known as &quot;One World&quot; and today is called multiculturalism. In the late forties he produced a series of concerts at Town Hall and Carnegie Hall that presented flamenco guitar and calypso, along with country blues, Appalachian music, Andean music, and jazz. His radio shows of the 1940s and 1950s explored musics of all the world&#x27;s peoples.

Lomax recognized that folklore (like all forms of creativity) occurs at the local and not the national level and flourishes not in isolation but in fruitful interplay with other cultures. He was dismayed that mass communications appeared to be crushing local cultural expressions and languages. In 1950 he echoed anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski (1884–1942), who believed the role of the ethnologist should be that of advocate for primitive man (as indigenous people were then called), when he urged folklorists to similarly advocate for the folk. Some, such as Richard Dorson, objected that scholars shouldn&#x27;t act as cultural arbiters, but Lomax believed it was unethical to stand idly by as the magnificent variety of the world&#x27;s cultures and languages was &quot;grayed out&quot; by centralized commercial entertainment and educational systems. Although he acknowledged potential problems with intervention, he urged that folklorists with their special training actively assist communities in safeguarding and revitalizing their own local traditions.

Similar ideas had been put into practice by Benjamin Botkin, Harold W. Thompson, and Louis C. Jones, who believed that folklore studied by folklorists should be returned to its home communities to enable it to thrive anew. They have been realized in the annual (since 1967) Smithsonian Folk Festival on the Mall in Washington, D.C. (for which Lomax served as a consultant), in national and regional initiatives by public folklorists and local activists in helping communities gain recognition for their oral traditions and lifeways both in their home communities and in the world at large; and in the National Heritage Awards, concerts, and fellowships given by the NEA and various State governments to master folk and traditional artists.

In 1983, Lomax founded The Association for Cultural Equity (ACE). It is housed at the Fine Arts Campus of Hunter College in New York City and is the custodian of the Alan Lomax Archive. The Association&#x27;s mission is to &quot;facilitate cultural equity&quot; and practice &quot;cultural feedback&quot; and &quot;preserve, publish, repatriate and freely disseminate&quot; its collections. Though Alan Lomax&#x27;s appeals to anthropology conferences and repeated letters to UNESCO fell on deaf ears, the modern world seems to have caught up to his vision. In an article first published in the 2009 &quot;Louisiana Folklore Miscellany&quot;, Barry Jean Ancelet, folklorist and chair of the Modern Languages Department at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, wrote:

In 2001, in the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington of September 11, UNESCO&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Cultural Diversity declared the safeguarding of languages and intangible culture on a par with protection of individual human rights and as essential for human survival as biodiversity is for nature, ideas remarkably similar to those forcefully articulated by Alan Lomax many years before.

==FBI investigations==
From 1942 to 1979, Lomax repeatedly was investigated and interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), but nothing incriminating was discovered, and the investigation was abandoned. Scholar and jazz pianist Ted Gioia uncovered and published extracts from Alan Lomax&#x27;s 800-page FBI files. The investigation appears to have started when an anonymous informant reported overhearing Lomax&#x27;s father telling guests in 1941 about what he considered his son&#x27;s communist sympathies. Looking for leads, the FBI seized on the fact that, at the age of 17 in 1932 while attending Harvard University for a year, Lomax had been arrested in Boston, Massachusetts in connection with a political demonstration. In 1942 the FBI sent agents to interview students at Harvard&#x27;s freshman dormitory about Lomax&#x27;s participation in a demonstration that had occurred at Harvard ten years earlier in support of the immigration rights of one Edith Berkman, a Jewish woman, dubbed the &quot;red flame&quot; for her labor organizing activities among the textile workers of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and threatened with deportation as an alleged &quot;Communist agitator&quot;. Lomax had been charged with disturbing the peace and fined $25. Berkman, however, had been cleared of all accusations against her and was not deported. Nor had Lomax&#x27;s Harvard academic record been affected in any way by his activities in her defense. Nevertheless, the bureau continued trying vainly to show that in 1932 Lomax had either distributed communist literature or made public speeches in support of the Communist Party.

According to Ted Gioia:

Lomax must have felt it necessary to address the suspicions. He gave a sworn statement to an FBI agent on April 3, 1942, denying both of these charges. He also explained his arrest while at Harvard as the result of police overreaction. He was, he claimed, 15 at the time – he was actually 17 and a college student – and he said he had intended to participate in a peaceful demonstration. Lomax said he and his colleagues agreed to stop their protest when police asked them to, but that he was grabbed by a couple of policemen as he was walking away. &quot;That is pretty much the story there, except that it distressed my father very, very much&quot;, Lomax told the FBI. &quot;I had to defend my righteous position, and he couldn&#x27;t understand me and I couldn&#x27;t understand him. It has made a lot of unhappiness for the two of us because he loved Harvard and wanted me to be a great success there.&quot; Lomax transferred to the University of Texas the following year.

Lomax left Harvard, after having spent his sophomore year there, to join John A. Lomax and John Lomax, Jr. in collecting folk songs for the Library of Congress and to assist his father in writing his books. In withdrawing him (in addition to not being able to afford the tuition), the elder Lomax had probably wanted to separate his son from new political associates that he considered undesirable. But Alan had also not been happy there and probably also wanted to be nearer his bereaved father and young sister, Bess, and to return to the close friends he had made during his first year at the University of Texas.

In June 1942 the FBI approached the Librarian of Congress, Archibald McLeish, in an attempt to have Lomax fired as Assistant in Charge of the Library&#x27;s Archive of American Folk Song. At the time, Lomax was preparing for a field trip to the Mississippi Delta on behalf of the Library, where he made landmark recordings of Muddy Waters, Son House, and David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards, among others. McLeish wrote to Hoover, defending Lomax: &quot;I have studied the findings of these reports very carefully. I do not find positive evidence that Mr. Lomax has been engaged in subversive activities and I am therefore taking no disciplinary action toward him.&quot; Nevertheless, according to Gioia:

Yet what the probe failed to find in terms of prosecutable evidence, it made up for in speculation about his character. An FBI report dated July 23, 1943, describes Lomax as possessing &quot;an erratic, artistic temperament&quot; and a &quot;bohemian attitude&quot;. It says: &quot;He has a tendency to neglect his work over a period of time and then just before a deadline he produces excellent results.&quot; The file quotes one informant who said that &quot;Lomax was a very peculiar individual, that he seemed to be very absent-minded and that he paid practically no attention to his personal appearance.&quot; This same source adds that he suspected Lomax&#x27;s peculiarity and poor grooming habits came from associating with the &quot;hillbillies&quot; who provided him with folk tunes.

Lomax, who was a founding member of People&#x27;s Songs, was in charge of campaign music for Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s 1948 Presidential run on the Progressive Party ticket on a platform opposing the arms race and supporting civil rights for Jews and African Americans. Subsequently, Lomax was one of the performers listed in the publication Red Channels as a possible Communist sympathizer and was consequently blacklisted from working in U.S. entertainment industries.

A 2007 BBC news article revealed that in the early 1950s, the British MI5 had placed Lomax under surveillance as a suspected Communist. Its report concluded that although Lomax undoubtedly held &quot;left wing&quot; views, there was no evidence he was a Communist. Released September 4, 2007 (File ref KV 2/2701), a summary of his MI5 file reads as follows:

Noted American folk music archivist and collector Alan Lomax first attracted the attention of the Security Service when it was noted that he had made contact with the Romanian press attaché in London while he was working on a series of folk music broadcasts for the BBC in 1952. Correspondence ensued with the American authorities as to Lomax&#x27; suspected membership of the Communist Party, though no positive proof is found on this file. The Service took the view that Lomax&#x27; work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attaché, and that while his views (as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers) were undoubtedly left wing, there was no need for any specific action against him.

The file contains a partial record of Lomax&#x27; movements, contacts and activities while in Britain, and includes for example a police report of the &quot;Songs of the Iron Road&quot; concert at St Pancras in December 1953. His association with [blacklisted American] film director Joseph Losey is also mentioned (serial 30a).

The FBI again investigated Lomax in 1956 and sent a 68-page report to the CIA and the Attorney General&#x27;s office. However, William Tompkins, assistant attorney general, wrote to Hoover that the investigation had failed to disclose sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution or the suspension of Lomax&#x27;s passport.

Then, as late as 1979, an FBI report suggested that Lomax had recently impersonated an FBI agent. The report appears to have been based on mistaken identity. The person who reported the incident to the FBI said that the man in question was around 43, about 5 feet 9 inches and 190 pounds. The FBI file notes that Lomax stood tall, weighed 240 pounds and was 64 at the time:

Lomax resisted the FBI&#x27;s attempts to interview him about the impersonation charges, but he finally met with agents at his home in November 1979. He denied that he&#x27;d been involved in the matter but did note that he&#x27;d been in New Hampshire in July 1979, visiting a film editor about a documentary. The FBI&#x27;s report concluded that &quot;Lomax made no secret of the fact that he disliked the FBI and disliked being interviewed by the FBI. Lomax was extremely nervous throughout the interview.&quot;

The FBI investigation was concluded the following year, shortly after Lomax&#x27;s 65th birthday.

==Awards==
Alan Lomax received the National Medal of Arts from President Ronald Reagan in 1986; a Library of Congress Living Legend Award in 2000; and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Tulane University in 2001. He won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award in 1993 for his book &quot;The Land Where the Blues Began&quot;, connecting the story of the origins of blues music with the prevalence of forced labor in the pre-World War II South (especially on the Mississippi levees). Lomax also received a posthumous Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in 2003. &quot;Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax&quot; (Rounder Records, 8 CDs boxed set) won in two categories at the 48th annual Grammy Awards ceremony held on February 8, 2006 &quot;Alan Lomax in Haiti: Recordings For The Library Of Congress, 1936–1937&quot;, issued by Harte Records and made with the support and major funding from Kimberley Green and the Green foundation, and featuring 10 CDs of recorded music and film footage (shot by Elizabeth Lomax, then nineteen), a bound book of Lomax&#x27;s selected letters and field journals, and notes by musicologist Gage Averill, was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011.

==World music and digital legacy==
Brian Eno wrote of Lomax&#x27;s later recording career in his notes to accompany an anthology of Lomax&#x27;s world recordings:

[He later] turned his intelligent attentions to music from many other parts of the world, securing for them a dignity and status they had not previously been accorded. The &quot;World Music&quot; phenomenon arose partly from those efforts, as did his great book, &quot;Folk Song Style and Culture&quot;. I believe this is one of the most important books ever written about music, in my all time top ten. It is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious, comprehensible, and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it.

In January 2012, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that it would release Lomax&#x27;s vast archive in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an interactive multimedia educational computer project he called the Global Jukebox, which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of film, 3,000 videotapes, and 5,000 photographs. By February 2012, 17,000 music tracks from his archived collection were expected to be made available for free streaming, and later some of that music may be for sale as CDs or digital downloads.

As of March 2012 this has been accomplished. Approximately 17,400 of Lomax&#x27;s recordings from 1946 and later have been made available free online. This is material from Alan Lomax&#x27;s independent archive, begun in 1946, which has been digitized and offered by the Association for Cultural Equity. This is &quot;distinct from the thousands of earlier recordings on acetate and aluminum discs he made from 1933 to 1942 under the auspices of the Library of Congress. This earlier collection – which includes the famous Jelly Roll Morton, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, and Muddy Waters sessions, as well as Lomax&#x27;s prodigious collections made in Haiti and Eastern Kentucky (1937) – is the provenance of the American Folklife Center&quot; at the Library of Congress.

(Roberta Rand) This is as good a place as any to come into the narrative. Most of what I will add here are memories attached to personal facts found scattered between the months of the years 1996-1997. What happened during those months are not formally recorded anywhere (so far as I know ) - but the references to the comments made by Bob Dylan on August 24, 1997 at Wolf Trap to the audience and Alan Lomax, sitting in the audience - in the front row (disabled sitting row) can be found tucked in the corners of paragraphs across the Net. Here is the lead-up to those comments and how Alan Lomax happened to be in the audience that day. (I feel as if this should be a serial presentation with new facts added to the story every week.) It was not a planned meeting between them but serendipity. It was all: serendipity! I was just checking the summer schedule for Wolf Trap one day and noticed that Bob Dylan was going to be giving a performance and thought what a great afternoon it would be for Alan and me - and maybe we would invite Marie Funkhouser - a good friend who sometimes regaled Alan with some old songs after dinner. Lovely voice - beautiful person. Alan Lomax came into my life like a thunderstorm off of the Serengeti. It was serendipitous, unpredictable - but the way you like your weather : pleasant and moderate - it seldom got uncomfortably hot.

I was at the beginning of a new project supported by the National Agricultural Library (USDA, ARS) and was looking for a piece of software that had been touted as a solid solution to the puzzle of &quot;natural language queries,&quot; - new to us at the time. A friend at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) told me he knew where I could find it - at Hunter College, he said - and it could be found at his friend, Alan Lomax&#x27;s lab in New York. Alan could tell me more about it. It was just a train-ride-away! So, we booked two tickets on the Acela out of Union Station in Washington, D.C. to Port Authority, New York - and then walked to the Hunter College lab or the ACE. We had called ahead to set up the meeting. We were naive and unknowing - the two of us. But, curious and up for an adventure. I wish I could say I knew more about who Alan Lomax was- really was! Maybe my friend (whose name I cannot remember, I&#x27;m sorry to say) was telling me all about him - I cannot remember. I can say, when we knocked on the door to the Lab - it was answered by this wild-haired-big-energy-man - with a handshake of steel- was offered to us. 

On August 24, 1997, at a concert at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Virginia, Bob Dylan said about Lomax, who had helped introduce him to folk music and whom he had known as a young man in Greenwich Village:

There is a distinguished gentlemen here who came...I want to introduce him – named Alan Lomax. I don&#x27;t know if many of you have heard of him [Audience applause.] Yes, he&#x27;s here, he&#x27;s made a trip out to see me. I used to know him years ago. I learned a lot there and Alan...Alan was one of those who unlocked the secrets of this kind of music. So if we&#x27;ve got anybody to thank, it&#x27;s Alan. Thanks, Alan. 

In 1999 electronica musician Moby released his fifth album &quot;Play&quot;. It extensively used samples from field recordings collected by Lomax on the 1993 box set &quot;Sounds of the South: A Musical Journey from the Georgia Sea Islands to the Mississippi Delta&quot;. The album went on to be certified platinum in more than 20 countries.

In his autobiography &quot;Chronicles, Part One&quot;, Bob Dylan recollects a 1961 scene: &quot;There was an art movie house in the Village on 12th Street that showed foreign movies—French, Italian, German. This made sense, because even Alan Lomax himself, the great folk archivist, had said somewhere that if you want to go to America, go to Greenwich Village.&quot;

Lomax is portrayed by actor Norbert Leo Butz in &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;, the 2024 feature film about Bob Dylan&#x27;s early career.

<doc id="173229" wikidata="Q1253011" url="?curid=173229" title="Dov Ber of Mezeritch">
<text>Dov Ber ben Avraham of Mezeritch (; died December 4, 1772 O.S.), also known as the &quot;Maggid of Mezeritch&quot; or &quot;Mezeritcher Maggid&quot;, was a disciple of Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (the Baal Shem Tov), the founder of Hasidic Judaism, and was chosen as his successor to lead the early movement. Dov Ber is regarded as the first systematic exponent of the mystical philosophy underlying the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, and through his teaching and leadership, the main architect of the movement. 

He established his base in Mezhirichi (in Volhynia), which moved the centre of Hasidism from Medzhybizh (in Podolia), where he focused his attention on raising a close circle of disciples to spread the movement. After his death the third generation of leadership took their different interpretations and disseminated across appointed regions of Eastern Europe, rapidly spreading Hasidism beyond Ukraine, to Poland, Galicia and Russia.

His teachings appear in &quot;Magid Devarav L&#x27;Yaakov&quot;, &quot;Or Torah&quot;, &quot;Likutim Yekarim&quot;, &quot;Or Ha&#x27;emet&quot;, &quot;Kitvei Kodesh&quot;, &quot;Shemuah Tovah&quot;, and in the works authored by his disciples. His inner circle of disciples, known as the &quot;Chevraia Kadisha&quot; (&quot;Holy Brotherhood&quot;), included Rabbis Avraham HaMalach (his son), Nachum of Czernobyl, Elimelech of Lizhensk, Zusha of Hanipol, Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Boruch of Medzhybizh, Aharon (HaGadol) of Karlin, Chaim Chaykl of Amdur, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, Shmuel Shmelke of Nikolsburg, Shlomo Flam (the Lutzker Maggid), Asher Zebi of Ostrowo, Zev Wolf of Zhitomyr, and Shneur Zalman of Liadi.

==Name==
The most common transliterations are Dov-Ber, Dov Baer and DovBer; rarely used forms are Dob Ber or Dobh Ber, which often depend on the region in Eastern Europe where Jews resided and hence the influence of the local Yiddish dialects. The name דוב-בער &quot;Dov-Ber&quot; is traceable back to the , and . It is thus an example of a bilingual tautological name.

Dov Ber of Mezeritch was known as the &quot;Maggid&quot;—&quot;Preacher&quot; or literally &quot;Sayer,&quot; one who preaches and admonishes to go in God&#x27;s ways—of Mezritsh (the German form &quot;Meseritz&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;Mezeritch&quot;). Towards the end of his life he was also known as the &quot;Maggid&quot; of Rivne, the town where he was buried.

==Biography==
Dov Ber was born in Lokachi, Volhynia in 1710, according to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, though his year of birth is unknown and some sources place it around 1700. Little is known about him before he became a disciple of the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot;. A Hasidic legend states that, when he was five years old, his family home burst into flames. On hearing his mother weeping, he asked: &quot;Mother, do we have to be so unhappy because we have lost a house?&quot; She replied that she was mourning the family tree, which was destroyed, and is traced to King David by way of Rabbi Yohanan, the sandal-maker and master in the Talmud. The boy replied: &quot;And what does that matter! I shall get you a new family tree which begins with me!&quot;

When he was young, he reportedly lived in great poverty with his wife. One legend relates that when a child was born, they had no money to pay the midwife. His wife complained and the &quot;Maggid&quot; went outside to &quot;curse&quot; Israel. He went outside and said: &quot;O children of Israel, may abundant blessings come upon you!&quot; When his wife complained a second time, he went outside again and cried: &quot;Let all happiness come to the children of Israel—but they shall give their money to thorn bushes and stones!&quot; The baby was too weak to cry, and the &quot;Maggid&quot; sighed rather than &quot;cursing&quot;. Immediately the answer came, and a voice said: &quot;You have lost your share in the coming world.&quot; The &quot;Maggid&quot; replied: &quot;Well, then, the reward has been done away with. Now I can begin to serve in good earnest.&quot;

==Death==
He is buried in Hannopil, beside Zusha of Hanipol.

==Visit to Baal Shem Tov==
Dov Ber was originally a student of the Pnei Yehoshua later became an admirer of Isaac Luria&#x27;s system of &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, which was becoming popular at that time, and was aware of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, whose writings, then only in manuscript, were well known among the Polish mystics of the period. Dov Ber followed the Lurian school, living the life of an ascetic, fasting a great deal, praying intensely, and living in poverty. He is reported to have become a cripple as a result of poor nourishment.

One account has it that on account of his poor health he was persuaded to seek out the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; for a cure.
He arrived at the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s&quot; house, expecting to hear expositions of profound mysteries, but instead was told stories of the latter&#x27;s everyday life. Hearing only similar stories at each subsequent visit, Dov Ber decided to return home. Just as he was about to leave, he was summoned again to the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s&quot; house. The &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; opened an &quot;Eitz Chaim&quot; of Rabbi Chaim Vital (Rabbi Isaac Luria&#x27;s chief disciple), and asked him to explain a certain passage. Dov Ber did so to the best of his ability, but the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; declared that he had not understood the real meaning of the passage. Dov Ber reviewed it once more and insisted that his interpretation was correct. The Baal Shem Tov then proceeded to explain the passage himself. Legend has it that, as he spoke, the darkness suddenly gave way to light, and angels appeared and listened to the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s&quot; words. &quot;Your explanations,&quot; he said to Dov Ber, &quot;were correct, but your deductions were thoughts without any soul in them.&quot; This experience persuaded Dov Ber to stay with the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot;.

Dov Ber is reported to have learned from the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; to value everyday things and events, and to emphasize the proper attitude with which to study Torah. The mystical philosophy of the Baal Shem Tov rejected the emphasis on mortification of the body in Musar and Kabbalistic traditions, seeing the greater spiritual advantage in transforming the material into a vehicle for holiness, rather than breaking it. This could be achieved by the perception of the omnipresent Divine immanence in all things, from understanding the inner mystical Torah teachings of Hasidic thought. Under the guidance of the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot;, Dov Ber abandoned his ascetic lifestyle, and recovered his health, though his left foot remained lame. The Baal Shem Tov said that &quot;before Dov Ber came to me, he was already a pure golden menorah (candelebrum). All I needed to do was ignite it.&quot; Regarding his holiness, the Baal Shem Tov also reputedly said that if Dov Ber had not been lame, and had been able to ritually immerse in the mikvah, then he could have been able to bring the Mashiach.

==Hasidic leadership ==

Immediately after the death of the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; in 1760, his son Rabbi Tsvi became the next Rebbe. After only a year he gave up this position. Among the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov, two stood out as contenders to succeed him, Dov Ber and Yacov Yoseph of Polonne. Yacov Yoseph would later become the author of the first Hasidic book published (&quot;Toldos Yaacov Yosef&quot; in 1780), one of the most direct records of the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov. By collective consent, the &quot;Maggid&quot; assumed the leadership of Hasidism. In effect he became the architect of the Hasidic movement and is responsible for its successful dissemination.

The Maggid was housebound because of his poor physical condition. Jewish philosopher Solomon Maimon records an encounter with the Maggid in his memoirs, in which he passes a strong negative judgement on the Hasidic movement. He relates that the Maggid passed the entire week in his room, permitting only a few confidants to enter. He appeared in public only on Shabbat, dressed in white satin. On those occasions he prayed with people, and kept open house for anyone who wanted to dine with him. After the meal he would reportedly begin to chant, and placing his hand upon his forehead, would ask those present to quote any verse from the Bible. These served as texts for the Maggid&#x27;s subsequent sermon. Solomon Maimon wrote: &quot;He was such a master in his craft that he combined these disjointed verses into an harmonious whole.&quot; Historian David Assaf studied the sermons quoted by Maimon and found that they are indeed attributed to The Maggid in other sources, indicating that the meeting between them did in fact take place.

He attracted a remarkable group of scholarly and saintly disciples, including most of his fellow students of the Baal Shem Tov. The Baal Shem Tov had travelled across Jewish areas, reaching out to and inspiring the common folk, whose sincerity he cherished. He sought to revive the broken spirit of the simple Jews. At the same time, he would also seek out the great scholars of Talmud and Kabbalah, to win them over to Hasidism, to whom he taught the inner meaning of his teachings. Many Hasidic tales relate the stories of the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s travels, accompanied by his close disciples, and led by his non-Jewish wagon driver. Dov Ber, in contrast, set up his court in Mezhirichi, where his lameness restricted him, and devoted his main focus to articulating the mystical-philosophical system within the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s teachings to his close circle of disciples, who would lead the future movement. The simple folk were also able to visit during the Sabbath public attendancies of Dov Ber, and receive spiritual encouragement and comfort. The Maggid&#x27;s court became the spiritual seat and place of pilgrimage of the second generation of the Hasidic movement, and moved its centre north from the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s residence in Medzhybizh. This move benefited the growth of the movement, as it was closer to new territories in Galicia, Poland and Belarus to reach. It was also nearer to the centre of Rabbinic opposition in Lithuania, who perceived of the new movement as a spiritual threat. The disciples of Dov Ber related that:
With the move of Rabbi Dov Ber, the Shechina (Divine Presence) &quot;Packed up Her belongings and moved from Medzhybizh to Mezeritch, and all we can do is follow&quot;
The elite group of disciples, the &quot;Chevraya Kaddisha&quot; (&quot;Holy Society&quot;), included Rabbis Aharon of Karlin, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Elimelech of Lizhensk, Zusha of Hanipol, Shmelka (later Chief Rabbi of Nikolsburg), Pinchas Horowitz (later Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt-am-Main and author of profound Talmudic commentaries), and Shneur Zalman of Liadi (author of the &quot;Tanya&quot;, and by instructions of his master, author of an updated version of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; code of Jewish Law for the new movement). These disciples, being themselves great Talmudic authorities and well-versed in Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy, were successful in turning Hasidus into a vast movement.

==Opposition of the rabbis==
Hasidism spread rapidly as a result of Dov Ber&#x27;s powerful personality, gaining footholds in Volhynia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. The dissolution of the &quot;Four-Lands&quot; synod in 1764 proved favorable to its spread. The local rabbis were annoyed by the growth of the movement, but could not easily do anything about it. The &quot;Gaon of Vilna&quot; was the only rabbi whose reputation extended beyond the borders of Lithuania. When Hasidism appeared in Vilna, the Vilna Gaon enacted the first major excommunication against Hasidism, which was issued on April 11, 1772. The Vilna Gaon believed the movement was antagonistic to Talmudic rabbinism and was suspicious that it was a remnant of the recent Sabbatean movement. &quot;See&quot; Hasidim and Mitnagdim.

The Maggid&#x27;s pupils Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi tried to visit the Vilna Gaon to bring about reconciliation, but the Vilna Gaon declined to meet them. Lubavitch legend has it that had the Gaon met with these two Rabbis, the Mashiach (Messiah) would have come.

The ban issued at Vilna drew the eyes of the world toward Hasidism. Rabbi Dov Ber ignored the opposition, but it is blamed in part for his death in Mezhirichi on December 15, 1772.

==Views and teachings==
===Published writings===
The &quot;Maggid&quot; left no writings of his own. Many of his teachings were recorded by his disciples and appeared in anthologies &quot;MaggiD DebaraV le-Ya&#x27;akoV&quot; (מגיד דבריו ליעקב the last letters of which title spell &quot;Dov&quot;), known also under the title of &quot;Likkutei Amarim&quot; (&quot;Collected Sayings&quot;), published at Korets in 1780 (second edition with additions Korets, 1784), and frequently reprinted; &quot;Likkutim Yekarim&quot; (&quot;Precious Collections&quot;), published at Lemberg in 1792; &quot;Or Torah&quot; (the largest collection) published in Korets, 1804; &quot;Or Ha&#x27;emet&quot; published in Husiatin, 1899; &quot;Kitvei Kodesh&quot; (small collection) published in Lemberg. 1862; &quot;Shemu&#x27;ah Tovah&quot; (small collection) published in Warsaw. 1938. A number of manuscripts with additional teachings are in the National Library of the Hebrew University. They consist of excerpts from his sermons, transcribed and compiled by his students. The first to be published (&quot;Likkutei Amarim&quot;) was collated by his relative, Rabbi Shlomo Flam of Lutzk, who, as he himself notes, was unhappy with the manuscript but did not have time to edit it properly.

There is a great deal of overlapping between all these texts, but each contains teachings that do not appear in the others. Work and editing has been done on them: &quot;Maggid Devarav Layaakov&quot; was edited by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kohn (Jerusalem, 1961). Later, a critical edition was edited by Prof. Rivkah Shatz-Uffenheimer (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1976). Kehot Publishing of Chabad put out another edition edited by Rabbi Jacob Immanuel Schochet (Brooklyn, NY, 2008). These editions all contain introductions, annotations and indices. &quot;Or Torah&quot; has appeared in an annotated edition with introduction, commentaries, cross-references and indices, authored by Schochet (Brooklyn, NY, 2006). &quot;Likkutim Yekarim&quot; is in annotated edition by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kohn (Jerusalem, 1974).

===View of God===
For the &quot;Maggid&quot;, God manifests Himself in creation, which is only one aspect of His activity, and which is therefore in reality a self-limitation. Just as God in His goodness limited Himself, and thus descended to the level of the world and man, so it is the duty of the latter to strive to unite with God. The removal of the outer shell of mundane things, or &quot;the ascension of the [divine] spark,&quot; being a recognition of the presence of God in all earthly things, it is the duty of man, should he experience pleasure, to receive it as a divine manifestation, for God is the source of all pleasure.

===On the ecstasy of prayer===
Rabbi Dov Ber&#x27;s view of prayer was that it is the purpose of the life on earth to advance until the perfect union with God is attained. Thus the vegetable kingdom serves as food for the animal kingdom, in order that the lower manifestation of divinity, existing in the former, may be developed into a higher one. Man being the highest manifestation has a duty to attain the highest pinnacle in order to be united with God. The way to achieve this, he argued, is through prayer, in which man forgets himself and his surroundings, and concentrates all his thought and feeling upon union with God.

Like the Neo-Platonists, he said that when a man becomes so absorbed in the contemplation of an object that his whole power of thought is concentrated upon one point, his self becomes unified with that point. So prayer in such a state of real ecstasy, effecting a union between God and man, is extremely important, and may even be able to overcome the laws of nature.

===Role of the &quot;tzadik&quot;===
Rabbi Dov Ber taught that only the &quot;tzadik&quot; is able to remove all his thoughts from earthly things and concentrate completely on God. Because of his union with God, he is the connecting link between God and creation, and thus the channel of blessing and mercy. The love that men have for the &quot;tzadik&quot; provides a path to God. The duty of the ordinary mortal is therefore to love the &quot;tzadik&quot; and be a student of his. In this connection Hasidim cite the classical Jewish teaching that Scripture considers one who serves Torah scholars to be cleaving to the Almighty Himself.

<text>UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy) is a suite of computer programs and protocols allowing remote execution of commands and transfer of files, email and netnews between computers.

A command named is one of the programs in the suite; it provides a user interface for requesting file copy operations. The UUCP suite also includes (user interface for remote command execution), (the communication program that performs the file transfers), (reports statistics on recent activity), (execute commands sent from remote machines), and (reports the UUCP name of the local system). Some versions of the suite include / (convert 8-bit binary files to 7-bit text format and vice versa).

Although UUCP was originally developed on Unix in the 1970s and 1980s, and is most closely associated with Unix-like systems, UUCP implementations exist for several non-Unix-like operating systems, including DOS, OS/2, OpenVMS (for VAX hardware only), AmigaOS, classic Mac OS, and even CP/M.

==History==
UUCP was originally written at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by Mike Lesk. By 1978 it was in use on 82 UNIX machines inside the Bell system, primarily for software distribution. It was released in 1979 as part of Version 7 Unix.

The first UUCP emails from the U.S. arrived in the United Kingdom in 1979 and email between the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark started in 1980, becoming a regular service via EUnet in 1982.

The original UUCP was rewritten by AT&amp;T researchers Peter Honeyman, David A. Nowitz, and Brian E. Redman around 1983. The rewrite is referred to as &quot;HDB&quot; or &quot;HoneyDanBer&quot; uucp, which was later enhanced, bug fixed, and repackaged as &quot;BNU UUCP&quot; (&quot;Basic Network Utilities&quot;). 

Each of these versions was distributed as proprietary software, which inspired Ian Lance Taylor to write a new free software version from scratch in 1991.
&quot;Taylor UUCP&quot; was released under the GNU General Public License. Taylor UUCP addressed security holes which allowed some of the original network worms to remotely execute unexpected shell commands. Taylor UUCP also incorporated features of all previous versions of UUCP, allowing it to communicate with any other version and even use similar config file formats from other versions.

UUCP was also implemented for non-UNIX operating systems, most-notably DOS systems. Packages such as UUSLAVE/GNUUCP (John Gilmore, Garry Paxinos, Tim Pozar), UUPC/extended (Drew Derbyshire of Kendra Electronic Wonderworks) and FSUUCP (Christopher Ambler of IODesign), brought early Internet connectivity to personal computers, expanding the network beyond the interconnected university systems. FSUUCP formed the basis for many bulletin board system (BBS) packages such as Galacticomm&#x27;s Major BBS and Mustang Software&#x27;s Wildcat! BBS to connect to the UUCP network and exchange email and Usenet traffic. As an example, UFGATE (John Galvin, Garry Paxinos, Tim Pozar) was a package that provided a gateway between networks running Fidonet and UUCP protocols.

FSUUCP was the only other implementation of Taylor&#x27;s enhanced &#x27;i&#x27; protocol, a significant improvement over the standard &#x27;g&#x27; protocol used by most UUCP implementations.

==Technology==
Before the widespread availability of Internet access, computers were only connected by smaller local area networks within a company or organization. They were also often equipped with modems so they could be used remotely from character-mode terminals via dial-up telephone lines. UUCP used the computers&#x27; modems to dial out to other computers, establishing temporary, point-to-point links between them. Each system in a UUCP network has a list of neighbor systems, with phone numbers, login names and passwords, etc. When &quot;work&quot; (file transfer or command execution requests) is queued for a neighbor system, the program typically calls that system to process the work. The program can also poll its neighbors periodically to check for work queued on their side; this permits neighbors without dial-out capability to participate.

Over time, dial-up links were replaced by Internet connections, and UUCP added a number of new link layer protocols. These newer connections also reduced the need for UUCP at all, as newer application protocols developed to take advantage of the new networks. Today, UUCP is rarely used over dial-up links, but is occasionally used over TCP/IP. 
The number of systems involved, as of early 2006, ran between 1500 and 2000 sites across 60 enterprises. UUCP&#x27;s longevity can be attributed to its low cost, extensive logging, native failover to dialup, and persistent queue management.

===Sessions===
UUCP is normally started by having a user log into the target system and then running the UUCP program. In most cases, this is automated by logging into a known user account used for transfers, whose account&#x27;s shell has been set to . Thus, for automated transfers, another machine simply has to open a modem connection to the called machine and log into the known account.

When uucico runs, it will expect to receive commands from another UUCP program on the caller&#x27;s machine and begin a session. The session has three distinct stages:

# Initial handshake
# File request(s)
# Final handshake

====Initial handshake====
On starting, uucico will respond by sending an identification string, codice_1, where \20 is the control-P character, and \0 is a trailing null. The caller&#x27;s UUCP responds with codice_2, where &quot;options&quot; is a string containing zero or more Unix-like option switches. These can include packet and window sizes, the maximum supported file size, debugging options, and others.

Depending on the setup of the two systems, the call may end here. For instance, when the caller responds with their system name, the called system may optionally hang up if it does not recognize the caller, sending the codice_3 response string and then disconnecting.

====File requests====
If the two systems successfully handshake, the caller will now begin to send a series of file requests. There are four types:

:S causes a file to be Sent from the caller to the called system (upload). The from and to names are provided, allowing the filename to be changed on the receiver. When the S command is received on the called system, it responds with SY if it succeeded and it is ready to accept the file, or SNx if it failed, where x is a failure reason. If an SY is received by the caller, it begins uploading the file using the protocol selected during the initial handshake (see below). When the transfer is complete, the called system responds with CY if it successfully received the file, or CN5 if it failed.
:R is a Request for the called system to send a file to the caller (download). It is otherwise similar to S, using RY and RN to indicate the command was accepted and it will begin to send data or had a problem, and expecting a CY and CN5 from the caller at the end of the transfer.
:X uploads commands to be eXecuted on the called system. This can be used to make that system call another and deliver files to it. The called system responds with XY if it succeeded, or XN if it failed.
:H, for Hangup, indicates the caller is done. The called system responds with HY if it succeeded, or HN if it failed.

====Final handshake====
After sending an H command, the calling system sends a final packet (control-P, six ohs, null-terminator) and the called system responds with (control-P, seven ohs, null-terminator). Some systems will simply hang up on the successful reception of the H command and not bother with the final handshake.

===g-protocol===
Within the suite of protocols in UUCP, the underlying g-protocol is responsible for transferring information in an error-free form. The protocol originated as a general-purpose system for packet delivery, and thus offers a number of features that are not used by the UUCP package as a whole. These include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer, and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission. These extra features may not be available in some implementations of the UUCP stack.

The packet format consisted of a 6-byte header and then between zero and 4096 bytes in the payload. The packet starts with a single \020 (control-P). This is followed by a single byte, known as &quot;K&quot;, containing a value of 1 to 8 indicating a packet size from 32 to 4096 bytes, or a 9 indicating a control packet. Many systems only supported K=2, meaning 64 bytes. The next two bytes were a 16-bit checksum of the payload, not including the header. The next byte is the data type and finally, the last byte is the XOR of the header, allowing it to be checked separately from the payload.

The control byte consists of three bit-fields in the format TTXXXYYY. TT is the packet type, 0 for control packets (which also requires K=9 to be valid), 1 for alternate data (not used in UUCP), 2 for data, and 3 indicates a short packet that re-defines the meaning of K. In a data packet, XXX is the packet number for this packet from 0 to 7, and YYY is the last that was received correctly. This provides up to 8 packets in a window. In a control packet, XXX indicates the command and YYY is used for various parameters. For instance, transfers are started by sending a short control packet with TT=0 (control), XXX=7 and YYY the number of packets in a window, then sending another packet with XXX=6 and YYY as the packet length (encoded as it would be in K) and then a third packet that is identical to the first but XXX=5.

g-protocol uses a simple sliding window system to deal with potentially long latencies between endpoints. The protocol allows packets to size from 64 to 4096 8-bit bytes, and windows that include 1 to 7 packets. In theory, a system using 4k packets and 7 packet windows (4096x7) would offer performance matching or beating the best file-transfer protocols like ZMODEM. In practice, many implementations only supported a single setting of 64x3. As a result, the g-protocol has an undeserved reputation for poor performance. Confusion over the packet and window sizes led to the G-protocol, differing only in that it always used 4096x3. Taylor UUCP did not support G, but did support any valid requested window or packet size, so remote systems starting G would work fine with Taylor&#x27;s g, while two Taylor systems could negotiate even faster connections.

Telebit modems used protocol spoofing to improve the performance of g-protocol transfers by noticing end-of-packet markers being sent to the remote system and immediately sending an back to the local host, pretending that the remote system had already received the packet and decoded it correctly. This triggered the software stack to send the next packet, so rapidly that the transfer became almost continuous. The data between the two modems was error-corrected using a proprietary protocol based on MNP that ran over Telebit&#x27;s half-duplex connections much better than g-protocol would normally, because in the common 64x3 case the remote system would be sending a constant stream of s that would overflow the low-speed return channel. Combined with the modem&#x27;s naturally higher data rates, they greatly improved overall throughput and generally performed about seven times the speed of a 2400 bit/s modem. They were widely used on UUCP hosts as they could quickly pay for themselves in reduced long-distance charges.

===Other protocols===
UUCP implementations also include other transfer protocols for use over certain links.

f-protocol is designed to run over 7-bit error-corrected links. This was originally intended for use on X.25 links, which were popular for a time in the 1980s. It does not packetize data, instead, the entire file is sent as a single long string followed by a whole-file checksum. The similar x-protocol appears to have seen little or no use. d-protocol was similar to x, but intended for use on Datakit networks that connected many of Bell Labs offices.

t-protocol originated in the BSD versions of UUCP and like some similar ones, is designed to run over 8-bit error-free TCP/IP links. It has no error correction at all, and the protocol consists simply of breaking up command and file data into 512 or 1024-byte packets to easily fit within typical TCP frames.

e-protocol (&quot;e&quot; for Ethernet) was developed by Clem Cole at MASSCOMP and was widely released by Brian Redman in the later HoneyDanBer versions. It was developed and released before the t-protocol, but the t-protocol was more commonly used because the BSD version of UUCP was the dominant implementation. The e-protocol differs from the t-protocol only in that commands are not packetized and are instead sent as normal strings, while files are padded to the nearest 20 bytes.

==Mail routing==

The and capabilities could be used to send email between machines, with suitable mail user interfaces and delivery agent programs. A simple UUCP mail address was formed from the adjacent machine name, an exclamation mark (often pronounced &quot;bang&quot;), followed by the user name on the adjacent machine. For example, the address &quot;barbox!user&quot; would refer to user &quot;user&quot; on adjacent machine &quot;barbox&quot;.

Mail could furthermore be routed through the network, traversing any number of intermediate nodes before arriving at its destination. Initially, this had to be done by specifying the complete path, with a list of intermediate host names separated by bangs. For example, if machine &quot;barbox&quot; is not connected to the local machine, but it is known that &quot;barbox&quot; is connected to machine &quot;foovax&quot; which does communicate with the local machine, the appropriate address to send mail to would be &quot;foovax!barbox!user&quot;.

User &quot;barbox!user&quot; would generally publish their UUCP email address in a form such as &quot;…!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user&quot;. This directs people to route their mail to machine &quot;bigsite&quot; (presumably a well-known and well-connected machine accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine &quot;foovax&quot; to the account of user &quot;user&quot; on &quot;barbox&quot;. Publishing a full path would be pointless, because it would be different, depending on where the sender was. (e.g. Ann at one site may have to send via path &quot;gway!tcol!canty!uoh!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user&quot;, whereas from somewhere else, Bill has to send via the path &quot;pdp10!router22!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user&quot;). Many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites, providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender.

===Bang path===
An email address of this form was known as a bang path.
Bang paths of eight to ten machines (or &quot;hops&quot;) were not uncommon in 1981, and late-night dial-up UUCP links could cause week-long transmission times. Bang paths were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would often get lost. Some hosts went so far as to try to &quot;rewrite&quot; the path, sending mail via &quot;faster&quot; routes—this practice tended to be frowned upon.

The &quot;pseudo-domain&quot; ending .uucp was sometimes used to designate a hostname as being reachable by UUCP networking, although this was never formally registered in the domain name system (DNS) as a top-level domain. The uucp community administered itself and did not mesh well with the administration methods and regulations governing the DNS; .uucp works where it needs to; some hosts punt mail out of SMTP queue into uucp queues on gateway machines if a .uucp address is recognized on an incoming SMTP connection.

Usenet traffic was originally transmitted over the UUCP protocol, typically over dialup modems. At each receiving node, each Usenet article&#x27;s &quot;Path&quot; header line would have the current node&#x27;s name prepended to the path, separated by &quot;!&quot;. For example, an article that came in from node &quot;utzoo&quot; to node &quot;decvax&quot; with &quot;Path: utzoo!henry&quot; would have that line change to &quot;Path: decvax!utzoo!henry&quot;). Usenet software would then send a copy of each article to every neighbor node which had been configured to receive the newsgroup(s) that the article had been posted to -- unless that neighbor was already in the &quot;Path&quot; line. These paths were thus used to ensure that articles did not &quot;loop&quot; back to a node that already had them.

In general, like other older e-mail address formats, bang paths have now been superseded by the &quot;@ notation&quot;, even by sites still using UUCP. A UUCP-only site can register a DNS domain name, and have the DNS server that handles that domain provide MX records that cause Internet mail to that site to be delivered to a UUCP host on the Internet that can then deliver the mail to the UUCP site.

==UUCPNET and mapping==
UUCPNET was the name for the totality of the network of computers connected through UUCP. This network was very informal, maintained in a spirit of mutual cooperation between systems owned by thousands of private companies, universities, and so on. Often, particularly in the private sector, UUCP links were established without official approval from the companies&#x27; upper management. The UUCP network was constantly changing as new systems and dial-up links were added, others were removed, etc.

The &quot;UUCP Mapping Project&quot; was a volunteer, largely successful effort to build a map of the connections between machines that were open mail relays and establish a managed namespace. Each system administrator would submit, by e-mail, a list of the systems to which theirs would connect, along with a ranking for each such connection. These submitted map entries were processed by an automatic program that combined them into a single set of files describing all connections in the network. These files were then published monthly in a newsgroup dedicated to this purpose. The UUCP map files could then be used by software such as &quot;pathalias&quot; to compute the best route path from one machine to another for mail, and to supply this route automatically. The UUCP maps also listed contact information for the sites, and so gave sites seeking to join UUCPNET an easy way to find prospective neighbors.

==Connections with the Internet==
Many UUCP hosts, particularly those at universities, were also connected to the Internet in its early years, and e-mail gateways between Internet SMTP-based mail and UUCP mail were developed. A user at a system with UUCP connections could thereby exchange mail with Internet users, and the Internet links could be used to bypass large portions of the slow UUCP network. A &quot;UUCP zone&quot; was defined within the Internet domain namespace to facilitate these interfaces.

With this infrastructure in place, UUCP&#x27;s strength was that it permitted a site to gain Internet e-mail and Usenet connectivity with only a dial-up modem link to another cooperating computer. This was at a time when true Internet access required a leased data line providing a connection to an Internet &quot;Point of Presence&quot;, both of which were expensive and difficult to arrange. By contrast, a link to the UUCP network could usually be established with a few phone calls to the administrators of prospective neighbor systems. Neighbor systems were often close enough to avoid all but the most basic charges for telephone calls.

==Remote commands==
&quot;uux&quot; is remote command execution over UUCP. The uux command is used to execute a command on a remote system, or to execute a command on the local system using files from remote systems. The command is run by the daemon, which handles remote execution requests as simply another kind of file to batch-send to the remote system whenever a next-hop node is available. The remote system will then execute the requested command and return the result, when the original system is available. Both of these transfers may be indirect, via multi-hop paths, with arbitrary windows of availability. Even when executing a command on an always-available neighbor, uux is not instant.

==Decline==
UUCP usage began to die out with the rise of Internet service providers offering inexpensive SLIP and PPP services. The UUCP Mapping Project was formally shut down in late 2000.

The UUCP protocol has now mostly been replaced by the Internet TCP/IP based protocols SMTP for mail and NNTP for Usenet news.

In July 2012, Dutch Internet provider XS4ALL closed down its UUCP service, claiming it was &quot;probably one of the last providers in the world that still offered it&quot;; it had only 13 users at that time (prior to its shut-down it had refused requests from new users for several years).

==Current uses and legacy==
One surviving feature of UUCP is the chat file format, largely inherited by the Expect software package.

UUCP was in use over special-purpose high cost links (e.g. marine satellite links) long after its disappearance elsewhere, and still remains in legacy use. In addition to legacy use, in 2021 new and innovative UUCP uses are growing, especially for telecommunications in the HF band, for example, for communities in the Amazon rainforest for email exchange and other uses. A patch to Ian&#x27;s UUCP was contributed to UUCP Debian Linux package to adapt for the HERMES (High-Frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System) project, which provides UUCP HF connectivity.

In the mid 2000s, UUCP over TCP/IP (often encrypted, using the SSH protocol) was proposed for use when a computer does not have any fixed IP addresses but is still willing to run a standard mail transfer agent (MTA) like Sendmail or Postfix.

Bang-like paths are still in use within the Usenet network, though not for routing; they are used to record, in the header of a message, the nodes through which that message has passed, rather than to direct where it will go next. &quot;Bang path&quot; is also used as an expression for any explicitly specified routing path between network hosts. That usage is not necessarily limited to UUCP, IP routing, email messaging, or Usenet.

The concept of delay-tolerant networking protocols was revisited in the early 2000s. Similar techniques as those used by UUCP can apply to other networks that experience delay or significant disruption.

<text>Arno Schmidt (; 18 January 1914 – 3 June 1979) was a German author and translator. He is little known outside of German-speaking areas, in part because his works present a formidable challenge to translators. Although he does not belong to the popular authors in Germany, critics and writers often consider him to be one of the most important German-language writers of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Born in Hamburg, the son of a police constable, Schmidt moved in 1928, after the death of his father (1883–1928), with his mother (1894–1973), to her hometown of Lauban (in Lusatia, then Lower Silesia, now Poland) and attended secondary school in Görlitz as well as a trade school there. After finishing school, he was unemployed for some months and then, in 1934, began a commercial apprenticeship at a textile company in Greiffenberg. After finishing his apprenticeship he was hired by the same company as a stock accountant. Around this time, at his company, he met his future wife, Alice Murawski. The couple married on 21 August 1937; they had no children.

At the outset of World War II, in 1939, Schmidt was drafted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, where his mathematical skills led him to be assigned to the artillery corps. He first served in Alsace and after 1941 in fairly quiet Norway. In 1945, Schmidt volunteered for active front duty in Northern Germany, in order to be granted a brief home visit. As the war was obviously lost, he used this visit to organise his wife&#x27;s and his own escape to the west of Germany, in order to evade capture by the Red Army, which was known for its much harsher treatment of prisoners of war and German civilians. Schmidt gave himself up to British forces in Lower Saxony. As refugees, Schmidt and his wife lost almost all of their possessions, including their cherished book collection.

After an interlude as a British POW and later as an interpreter at a police school, Schmidt began his career as a freelance writer in 1946. Since Schmidt&#x27;s pre-war home in Lauban was now under Polish administration, Schmidt and his wife were among the millions of refugees moved by the authorities to numerous places in what was to become West Germany. During this time of uncertainty and extreme poverty, the Schmidts were sustained by CARE Packages his sister sent them from the US (his sister Lucie had emigrated to the US in 1939, together with her husband Rudy Kiesler, a Jewish German communist). Temporary accommodations led the Schmidts to Cordingen (near Bomlitz), Gau-Bickelheim, and Kastel (the latter two in the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate). In Kastel, he was accused in court of blasphemy and moral subversion, then still considered a crime in some of the Catholic regions of West Germany. As a result, Schmidt and his wife moved to the Protestant city of Darmstadt in Hesse, where the suit against him was dismissed. In 1958, the Schmidts moved to the small village of Bargfeld, where they were to stay for the rest of their lives, Schmidt dying in 1979, his wife Alice in 1983.

==Writing style and personal philosophy==
Schmidt was a strict individualist, almost a solipsist. Disaffected by his experience of Nazi Germany, he had an extremely pessimistic world view. In 1951&#x27;s &quot;Schwarze Spiegel&quot; (&quot;Dark Mirrors&quot;), he describes his utopia as an empty world after an anthropogenic apocalypse. Although he was not a deist in the conventional sense, he maintained that the world was created by a monster called Leviathan, whose predatory nature was passed on to humans. Still, he thought this monster could not be too powerful to be attacked, if it behoved humanity.

His writing style is characterised by a unique and witty style of adapting colloquial language, which won him quite a few fervent admirers. Moreover, he developed an orthography by which he thought to reveal the true meaning of words and their connections amongst each other. One of the most cited examples is the use of &quot;“Roh=Mann=Tick&quot;&quot; instead of &quot;Romantik&quot; (revealing romanticism as the craze of unsubtle men). The atoms of words holding the nuclei of original meaning he called Etyme (etyms).

==&quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot;==
His theory of etyms is developed in his magnum opus, &quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot; (), in which a middle-aged writer comments on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s works in a stream of consciousness, while discussing a Poe translation with a couple of translators and flirting with their teenage daughter. Schmidt also accomplished a translation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s works himself (1966–1973, together with Hans Wollschläger). Some critics even dismissed &quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot; as non-art, or sheer nonsense, and Schmidt himself as a &quot;psychopath&quot;. But Schmidt&#x27;s reputation as esoteric, and that of his work as non-art, has faded and he is now seen as an important, if highly eccentric, German writer of the 20th century.

==Other, minor works==
In the 1960s, he authored a series of plays for German radio stations presenting forgotten or little known and—in his opinion—vastly underrated authors, e.g. Johann Gottfried Schnabel, Karl Philipp Moritz, Leopold Schefer, Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow, and others. These &quot;plays&quot; are basically talks about literature with two or three participants plus voices for quotations (Schmidt lent his voice for his translations of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; quoted in &quot;Der Triton mit dem Sonnenschirm&quot; [1961]). Eleven of these so-called &quot;Radio-Essays&quot; were republished on 12 audio CDs in 2003.

==The final years==
1971 Schmidt was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Lars Gyllensten, a member of the Swedish Academy.
But as none of Schmidt&#x27;s works sold more than a few thousand copies (he openly admitted that he only wrote for the small handful of people who could appreciate his work), he lived in extreme poverty. During the last few years of his life, he was financially supported by the philologist and writer Jan Philipp Reemtsma, the heir of the German cigarette manufacturer Philipp F. Reemtsma. Schmidt&#x27;s final completed novel was &quot;Abend mit Goldrand&quot; (1975) which was praised by some critics for its verbal inventiveness, although many had a difficult time digesting the erotic themes of the book. He died in a hospital in Celle on 3 June 1979 after suffering a stroke.

==Posthumous legacy==
Dalkey Archive Press has reissued five volumes of Schmidt&#x27;s work translated by John E. Woods. The series includes &quot;Collected Novellas&quot;, &quot;Collected Stories&quot;, &quot;Nobodaddy&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Two Novels&quot;, and most recently, &quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The reissues were scheduled to coincide with &quot;Rediscovering Arno Schmidt events in the US, UK, and continental Europe.&quot;
The Arno Schmidt Foundation (&quot;Arno Schmidt Stiftung&quot;) in Bargfeld, sponsored by Jan Philipp Reemtsma, is publishing his complete works.

Schmidt is mentioned in the Roberto Bolaño novel 2666.

===Arno Schmidt Prize===
The Arno Schmidt Prize, awarded by the Arno Schmidt Foundation and awarded from 1981 to 1988, was endowed with DM 50,000 (about €25,000). The prize has only been awarded four times:
*1982: Hans Wollschläger
* 1984: Wolfgang Koeppen
* 1986: Peter Rühmkorf
* 1988: Karlheinz Deschner

After that the award was converted into the two-year Arno Schmidt scholarship, endowed with 36,000 euros.

===Arno Schmidt scholarship winners===
* 1992/1993: Ulrich Holbein

<doc id="173236" wikidata="Q371805" url="?curid=173236" title="MIX (abstract machine)">
<text>MIX is a hypothetical computer used in Donald Knuth&#x27;s monograph, &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot; (&quot;TAOCP&quot;). MIX&#x27;s model number is 1009, which was derived by combining the model numbers and names of several contemporaneous, commercial machines deemed significant by the author. Also, &quot;MIX&quot; read as a Roman numeral is 1009.

The 1960s-era MIX has since been superseded by a new (also hypothetical) computer architecture, MMIX, to be incorporated in forthcoming editions of &quot;TAOCP&quot;.

Software implementations for both the MIX and MMIX architectures have been developed by Knuth and made freely available (named &quot;MIXware&quot; and &quot;MMIXware&quot;, respectively). Several derivatives of Knuth&#x27;s MIX/MMIX emulators also exist. GNU MDK is one such software package; it is free and runs on a wide variety of platforms.

Their purpose for education is quite similar to John L. Hennessy&#x27;s and David A. Patterson&#x27;s DLX architecture, from &quot;Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware Software Interface&quot;.

== Architecture ==
MIX is a hybrid binary–decimal computer. When programmed in binary, each byte has 6 bits (values range from 0 to 63). In decimal, each byte has 2 decimal digits (values range from 0 to 99). Bytes are grouped into words of five bytes plus a sign. Most programs written for MIX will work in either binary or decimal, so long as they do not try to store a value greater than 63 in a single byte.

A word has the range −1,073,741,823 to 1,073,741,823 (inclusive) in binary mode, and −9,999,999,999 to 9,999,999,999 (inclusive) in decimal mode. The sign-and-magnitude representation of integers in the MIX architecture distinguishes between “−0” and “+0.” This contrasts with modern computers, whose two&#x27;s-complement representation of integer quantities includes a single representation for zero, but whose range for a given number of bits includes one more negative integer than the number of representable positive integers.

=== Registers ===
There are 9 registers in MIX:
* rA: Accumulator (full word, five bytes and a sign).
* rX: Extension (full word, five bytes and a sign).
* rI1, rI2, rI3, rI4, rI5, rI6: Index registers (two bytes and a sign).
* rJ: Jump address (two bytes, always positive).

A byte is assumed to be at least 6 bits. Most instructions can specify &quot;which&quot; of the &quot;fields&quot; (bytes) of a register are to be altered, using a suffix of the form &quot;(first:last)&quot;. The zeroth field is the one-bit sign.

MIX also records whether the previous operation overflowed, and has a one-trit comparison indicator (less than, equal to, or greater than).

=== Memory and input/output ===
The MIX machine has 4000 words of memory (each with 5 bytes and a sign), addressed from 0 to 3999. A variety of input and output devices are also included:
*Tape units (devices 0...7).
*Disk or drum units (devices 8...15).
*Card reader (device 16).
*Card punch (device 17).
*Line printer (device 18).
*Typewriter terminal (device 19).
*Paper tape (device 20).

=== Instructions ===
Each machine instruction in memory occupies one word, and consists of 4 parts: the address (2 bytes and the sign of the word) in memory to read or write; an index specification (1 byte, describing which rI index register to use) to add to the address; a modification (1 byte) that specifies which parts of the register or memory location will be read or altered; and the operation code (1 byte). All operation codes have an associated mnemonic.

MIX programs frequently use self-modifying code, in particular to return from a subroutine, as MIX lacks an automatic subroutine return stack. Self-modifying code is facilitated by the modification byte, allowing the program to store data to, for example, the address part of the target instruction, leaving the rest of the instruction unmodified.

MIX programs are typically constructed using the MIXAL assembly language; for an example, see the page.

== Implementations ==
MIX has been implemented in software by:
* Knuth&#x27;s &quot;MIXWare&quot; and the derived GNU MDK;
* 9front&#x27;s mix(1); and
* Hardware::Simulator::MIX on CPAN.

An implementation of MIX was created for the iCE40HX8K FPGA board in 2021.

<text>In organic chemistry, the Diels–Alder reaction is a chemical reaction between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene, commonly termed the dienophile, to form a substituted cyclohexene derivative. It is the prototypical example of a pericyclic reaction with a concerted mechanism. More specifically, it is classified as a thermally allowed [4+2] cycloaddition with Woodward–Hoffmann symbol [π4s + π2s]. It was first described by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928. For the discovery of this reaction, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. Through the simultaneous construction of two new carbon–carbon bonds, the Diels–Alder reaction provides a reliable way to form six-membered rings with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes. Consequently, it has served as a powerful and widely applied tool for the introduction of chemical complexity in the synthesis of natural products and new materials. The underlying concept has also been applied to π-systems involving heteroatoms, such as carbonyls and imines, which furnish the corresponding heterocycles; this variant is known as the hetero-Diels–Alder reaction. The reaction has also been generalized to other ring sizes, although none of these generalizations have matched the formation of six-membered rings in terms of scope or versatility. Because of the negative values of Δ&quot;H&quot;° and Δ&quot;S&quot;° for a typical Diels–Alder reaction, the microscopic reverse of a Diels–Alder reaction becomes favorable at high temperatures, although this is of synthetic importance for only a limited range of Diels–Alder adducts, generally with some special structural features; this reverse reaction is known as the retro-Diels–Alder reaction.

==Mechanism==
The reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction. It is believed to occur via a single, cyclic transition state, with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction. As such, the Diels–Alder reaction is governed by orbital symmetry considerations: it is classified as a [π4s + π2s] cycloaddition, indicating that it proceeds through the suprafacial/suprafacial interaction of a 4π electron system (the diene structure) with a 2π electron system (the dienophile structure), an interaction that leads to a transition state without an additional orbital symmetry-imposed energetic barrier and allows the Diels–Alder reaction to take place with relative ease.

A consideration of the reactants&#x27; frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) makes plain why this is so. (The same conclusion can be drawn from an orbital correlation diagram or a Dewar-Zimmerman analysis.) For the more common &quot;normal&quot; electron demand Diels–Alder reaction, the more important of the two HOMO/LUMO interactions is that between the electron-rich diene&#x27;s &quot;ψ&quot;2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with the electron-deficient dienophile&#x27;s π* as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). However, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components. In an inverse (reverse) electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction, electron-withdrawing substituents on the diene lower the energy of its empty &quot;ψ&quot;3 orbital and electron-donating substituents on the dienophile raise the energy of its filled π orbital sufficiently that the interaction between these two orbitals becomes the most energetically significant stabilizing orbital interaction. Regardless of which situation pertains, the HOMO and LUMO of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below. Since the reactants are in their ground state, the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light.

The &quot;prevailing opinion&quot; is that most Diels–Alder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism; the issue, however, has been thoroughly contested. Despite the fact that the vast majority of Diels–Alder reactions exhibit stereospecific, syn addition of the two components, a diradical intermediate has been postulated (and supported with computational evidence) on the grounds that the observed stereospecificity does not rule out a two-step addition involving an intermediate that collapses to product faster than it can rotate to allow for inversion of stereochemistry.

There is a notable rate enhancement when certain Diels–Alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol, and even in water. The reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent. Several explanations for this effect have been proposed, such as an increase in effective concentration due to hydrophobic packing or hydrogen-bond stabilization of the transition state.

The geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product. For intermolecular reactions especially, the preferred positional and stereochemical relationship of substituents of the two components compared to each other are controlled by electronic effects. However, for intramolecular Diels–Alder cycloaddition reactions, the conformational stability of the structure of the transition state can be an overwhelming influence.

===Regioselectivity===
Frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in Diels–Alder reactions of substituted systems. Calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components&#x27; frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents&#x27; resonance effects, as illustrated below.

In general, the regioselectivity found for both normal and inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction follows the ortho-para rule, so named, because the cyclohexene product bears substituents in positions that are analogous to the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions of disubstituted arenes. For example, in a normal-demand scenario, a diene bearing an electron-donating group (EDG) at C1 has its largest HOMO coefficient at C4, while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group (EWG) at C1 has the largest LUMO coefficient at C2. Pairing these two coefficients gives the &quot;ortho&quot; product as seen in case 1 in the figure below. A diene substituted at C2 as in case 2 below has the largest HOMO coefficient at C1, giving rise to the &quot;para&quot; product. Similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4. Examining the canonical mesomeric forms above, it is easy to verify that these results are in accord with expectations based on consideration of electron density and polarization.

In general, with respect to the energetically most well-matched HOMO-LUMO pair, maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination. In a more sophisticated treatment, three types of substituents (Z &quot;withdrawing&quot;: HOMO and LUMO lowering (CF3, NO2, CN, C(O)CH3), X &quot;donating&quot;: HOMO and LUMO raising (Me, OMe, NMe2), C &quot;conjugating&quot;: HOMO raising and LUMO lowering (Ph, vinyl)) are considered, resulting in a total of 18 possible combinations. The maximization of orbital interaction correctly predicts the product in all cases for which experimental data is available. For instance, in uncommon combinations involving X groups on both diene and dienophile, a 1,3-substitution pattern may be favored, an outcome not accounted for by a simplistic resonance structure argument. However, cases where the resonance argument and the matching of largest orbital coefficients disagree are rare.

===Stereospecificity and stereoselectivity===

Diels–Alder reactions, as concerted cycloadditions, are stereospecific. Stereochemical information of the diene and the dienophile are retained in the product, as a &quot;syn&quot; addition with respect to each component. For example, substituents in a &quot;cis&quot; (&quot;trans&quot;, resp.) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are &quot;cis&quot; (&quot;trans&quot;, resp.) on those same carbons with respect to the cyclohexene ring. Likewise, &quot;cis&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;- and &quot;trans&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;-disubstituted dienes give &quot;cis&quot; substituents at these carbons of the product whereas &quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;-disubstituted dienes give &quot;trans&quot; substituents:

Diels–Alder reactions in which adjacent stereocenters are generated at the two ends of the newly formed single bonds imply two different possible stereochemical outcomes. This is a stereoselective situation based on the relative orientation of the two separate components when they react with each other. In the context of the Diels–Alder reaction, the transition state in which the most significant substituent (an electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating group) on the dienophile is oriented towards the diene π system and slips under it as the reaction takes place is known as the &quot;endo&quot; transition state. In the alternative &quot;exo&quot; transition state, it is oriented away from it. (There is a more general usage of the terms &quot;endo&quot; and &quot;exo&quot; in stereochemical nomenclature.)

In cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent, or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents &quot;cis&quot; to each other, the outcome can often be predicted. In these &quot;normal demand&quot; Diels–Alder scenarios, the &quot;endo&quot; transition state is typically preferred, despite often being more sterically congested. This preference is known as the Alder endo rule. As originally stated by Alder, the transition state that is preferred is the one with a &quot;maximum accumulation of double bonds.&quot; &quot;Endo&quot; selectivity is typically higher for rigid dienophiles such as maleic anhydride and benzoquinone; for others, such as acrylates and crotonates, selectivity is not very pronounced.
The most widely accepted explanation for the origin of this effect is a favorable interaction between the π systems of the dienophile and the diene, an interaction described as a &quot;secondary orbital effect&quot;, though dipolar and van der Waals attractions may play a part as well, and solvent can sometimes make a substantial difference in selectivity. The secondary orbital overlap explanation was first proposed by Woodward and Hoffmann. In this explanation, the orbitals associated with the group in conjugation with the dienophile double-bond overlap with the interior orbitals of the diene, a situation that is possible only for the &quot;endo&quot; transition state. Although the original explanation only invoked the orbital on the atom α to the dienophile double bond, Salem and Houk have subsequently proposed that orbitals on the α and β carbons both participate when molecular geometry allows.

Often, as with highly substituted dienes, very bulky dienophiles, or reversible reactions (as in the case of furan as diene), steric effects can override the normal &quot;endo&quot; selectivity in favor of the &quot;exo&quot; isomer.

===The diene===

The diene component of the Diels–Alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic, and it can host many different types of substituents. It must, however, be able to exist in the s-&quot;cis&quot; conformation, since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction. Though butadienes are typically more stable in the s-&quot;trans&quot; conformation, for most cases energy difference is small (~2–5 kcal/mol).

A bulky substituent at the C2 or C3 position can increase reaction rate by destabilizing the s-&quot;trans&quot; conformation and forcing the diene into the reactive s-&quot;cis&quot; conformation. 2-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-buta-1,3-diene, for example, is 27 times more reactive than simple butadiene. Conversely, a diene having bulky substituents at both C2 and C3 is less reactive because the steric interactions between the substituents destabilize the s-&quot;cis&quot; conformation.

Dienes with bulky terminal substituents (C1 and C4) decrease the rate of reaction, presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile.

An especially reactive diene is 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-buta-1,3-diene, otherwise known as Danishefsky&#x27;s diene. It has particular synthetic utility as means of furnishing α,β–unsaturated cyclohexenone systems by elimination of the 1-methoxy substituent after deprotection of the enol silyl ether. Other synthetically useful derivatives of Danishefsky&#x27;s diene include 1,3-alkoxy-1-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadienes (Brassard dienes) and 1-dialkylamino-3-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadienes (Rawal dienes). The increased reactivity of these and similar dienes is a result of synergistic contributions from donor groups at C1 and C3, raising the HOMO significantly above that of a comparable monosubstituted diene.
Unstable (and thus highly reactive) dienes can be synthetically useful, e.g. &quot;o&quot;-quinodimethanes can be generated in situ. In contrast, stable dienes, such as naphthalene, require forcing conditions and/or highly reactive dienophiles, such as &quot;N&quot;-phenylmaleimide. Anthracene, being less aromatic (and therefore more reactive for Diels–Alder syntheses) in its central ring can form a 9,10 adduct with maleic anhydride at 80 °C and even with acetylene, a weak dienophile, at 250 °C.

===The dienophile===
In a normal demand Diels–Alder reaction, the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene; in an inverse-demand scenario, the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group. Dienophiles can be chosen to contain a &quot;masked functionality&quot;. The dienophile undergoes Diels–Alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule. A series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group. The end product cannot be made in a single DA step because equivalent dienophile is either unreactive or inaccessible. An example of such approach is the use of α-chloroacrylonitrile (CH2=CClCN). When reacted with a diene, this dienophile will introduce α-chloronitrile functionality onto the product molecule. This is a &quot;masked functionality&quot; which can be then hydrolyzed to form a ketone. α-Chloroacrylonitrile dienophile is an equivalent of ketene dienophile (CH2=C=O), which would produce same product in one DA step. The problem is that ketene itself cannot be used in Diels–Alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner (by [2+2] cycloaddition), and therefore &quot;masked functionality&quot; approach has to be used. Other such functionalities are phosphonium substituents (yielding exocyclic double bonds after Wittig reaction), various sulfoxide and sulfonyl functionalities (both are acetylene equivalents), and nitro groups (ketene equivalents).

==Variants on the classical Diels–Alder reaction==
===Hetero-Diels–Alder===
Diels–Alder reactions involving at least one heteroatom are also known and are collectively called hetero-Diels–Alder reactions. Carbonyl groups, for example, can successfully react with dienes to yield dihydropyran rings, a reaction known as the oxo-Diels–Alder reaction, and imines can be used, either as the dienophile or at various sites in the diene, to form various &quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic compounds through the aza-Diels–Alder reaction. Nitroso compounds (R-N=O) can react with dienes to form oxazines. Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate can be utilized as a dienophile to prepare Vince lactam.

===Lewis acid activation===
Lewis acids, such as zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, tin tetrachloride, or aluminium chloride, can catalyze Diels–Alder reactions by binding to the dienophile. Traditionally, the enhanced Diels-Alder reactivity is ascribed to the ability of the Lewis acid to lower the LUMO of the activated dienophile, which results in a smaller normal electron demand HOMO-LUMO orbital energy gap and hence more stabilizing orbital interactions.

Recent studies, however, have shown that this rationale behind Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels–Alder reactions is incorrect. It is found that Lewis acids accelerate the Diels–Alder reaction by reducing the destabilizing steric Pauli repulsion between the interacting diene and dienophile and not by lowering the energy of the dienophile&#x27;s LUMO and consequently, enhancing the normal electron demand orbital interaction. The Lewis acid binds via a donor-acceptor interaction to the dienophile and via that mechanism polarizes occupied orbital density away from the reactive C=C double bond of the dienophile towards the Lewis acid. This reduced occupied orbital density on C=C double bond of the dienophile will, in turn, engage in a less repulsive closed-shell-closed-shell orbital interaction with the incoming diene, reducing the destabilizing steric Pauli repulsion and hence lowers the Diels–Alder reaction barrier. In addition, the Lewis acid catalyst also increases the asynchronicity of the Diels–Alder reaction, making the occupied π-orbital located on the C=C double bond of the dienophile asymmetric. As a result, this enhanced asynchronicity leads to an extra reduction of the destabilizing steric Pauli repulsion as well as a diminishing pressure on the reactants to deform, in other words, it reduced the destabilizing activation strain (also known as distortion energy). This working catalytic mechanism is known as &quot;Pauli-lowering catalysis&quot;, which is operative in a variety of organic reactions.

The original rationale behind Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels–Alder reactions is incorrect, because besides lowering the energy of the dienophile&#x27;s LUMO, the Lewis acid also lowers the energy of the HOMO of the dienophile and hence increases the inverse electron demand LUMO-HOMO orbital energy gap. Thus, indeed Lewis acid catalysts strengthen the normal electron demand orbital interaction by lowering the LUMO of the dienophile, but, they simultaneously weaken the inverse electron demand orbital interaction by also lowering the energy of the dienophile&#x27;s HOMO. These two counteracting phenomena effectively cancel each other, resulting in nearly unchanged orbital interactions when compared to the corresponding uncatalyzed Diels–Alder reactions and making this not the active mechanism behind Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels–Alder reactions.

===Asymmetric Diels–Alder===
Many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the Diels–Alder reaction, such as the use of chiral auxiliaries, catalysis by chiral Lewis acids, and small organic molecule catalysts. Evans&#x27; oxazolidinones, oxazaborolidines, &quot;bis&quot;-oxazoline–copper chelates, imidazoline catalysis, and many other methodologies exist for effecting diastereo- and enantioselective Diels–Alder reactions.

=== Hexadehydro Diels–Alder ===
In the hexadehydro Diels–Alder reaction, alkynes and diynes are used instead of alkenes and dienes, forming an unstable benzyne intermediate which can then be trapped to form an aromatic product. This reaction allows the formation of heavily functionalized aromatic rings in a single step.

==Applications and natural occurrence==

The retro-Diels–Alder reaction is used in the industrial production of cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene is a precursor to various norbornenes, which are common monomers. The Diels–Alder reaction is also employed in the production of vitamin B6.

==History==
The Diels-Alder reaction was the culmination of several intertwined research threads, some near misses, and ultimately, the insightful recognition of a general principle by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder. Their seminal work, detailed in a series of 28 articles published in the &quot;Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie&quot; and &quot;Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft&quot; from 1928 to 1937, established the reaction&#x27;s wide applicability and its importance in constructing six-membered rings. The first 19 articles were authored by Diels and Alder, while the later articles were authored by Diels and various other coauthors. However, the history of the reaction extends further back, revealing a fascinating narrative of discoveries missed and opportunities overlooked.

Several chemists, working independently in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encountered reactions that, in retrospect, involved the Diels-Alder process but remained unrecognized as such.

* Theodor Zincke performed a series of experiments between 1892 and 1912 involving tetrachlorocyclopentadienone, a highly reactive diene analogue.
* In 1910, Sergey Lebedev systematically investigated thermal polymerization of three conjugated dienes (butadiene, isoprene and dimethylbutadiene), a process now recognized as a Diels-Alder self-reaction, providing a detailed analysis of the dimerization products and recognizing the importance of the conjugated system in the process. Five years earlier, Carl Harries studied the degradation of natural rubber, leading him to propose a cyclic structure for the polymer.
* Hermann Staudinger&#x27;s work with ketenes published in 1912 covered both [2+2] cycloadditions, where one molecule of a ketene reacted with an unsaturated compound to form a four-membered ring, and, importantly, [4+2] cycloadditions. In the latter case, two molecules of ketene combined with one molecule of an unsaturated compound (such as a quinone) to yield a six-membered ring. While not a classic Diels-Alder reaction in the typical sense of a conjugated diene and a separate dienophile, Staudinger&#x27;s observation of this [4+2] process, forming a six-membered ring, foreshadowed the later work of Diels and Alder. However, his focus remained primarily on the more common [2+2] ketene cycloaddition.
* Hans von Euler-Chelpin and K. O. Josephson, investigating isoprene and butadiene reactions in 1920, both observed products consistent with Diels-Alder cycloadditions, but didn&#x27;t go on to research it further.

* Perhaps the most striking near miss came from Walter Albrecht in early 1900s. Working in Johannes Thiele&#x27;s laboratory, Albrecht investigated the reaction of cyclopentadiene with para-benzoquinone. His 1902 doctoral dissertation clearly describes the formation of the Diels-Alder adduct, even providing (incorrect) structural assignments. However, influenced by Thiele&#x27;s focus on conjugation and partial valence, Albrecht in his 1906 publication interpreted the reaction as a 1,4-addition followed by a 1,2-addition, completely overlooking the cycloaddition aspect.

While these observations hinted at the possibility of a broader class of cycloaddition reactions, they remained isolated incidents, their significance not fully appreciated at the time, with none of the researchers even trying to generalize their findings.

It fell to Diels and Alder to synthesize these disparate threads into a coherent whole. Unlike the earlier researchers, they recognized the generality and predictability of the diene and dienophile combining to form a cyclic structure. Through their systematic investigations, exploring various combinations of dienes and dienophiles, they firmly established the &quot;diene synthesis&quot; as a powerful new synthetic method. Their meticulous work not only demonstrated the reaction&#x27;s scope and versatility but also laid the groundwork for future theoretical developments, including the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which would provide a deeper understanding of pericyclic reactions, including the Diels-Alder.

==Applications in total synthesis==
The Diels–Alder reaction was one step in an early preparation of the steroids cortisone and cholesterol. The reaction involved the addition of butadiene to a quinone.

Diels–Alder reactions were used in the original synthesis of prostaglandins F2α and E2. The Diels–Alder reaction establishes the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core. Activation by Lewis acidic cupric tetrafluoroborate was required.

A Diels–Alder reaction was used in the synthesis of disodium prephenate, a biosynthetic precursor of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.

A synthesis of reserpine uses a Diels–Alder reaction to set the &quot;cis&quot;-decalin framework of the D and E rings.

In another synthesis of reserpine, the &quot;cis&quot;-fused D and E rings was formed by a Diels–Alder reaction. Intramolecular Diels–Alder of the pyranone below with subsequent extrusion of carbon dioxide via a retro [4+2] afforded the bicyclic lactam. Epoxidation from the less hindered α-face, followed by epoxide opening at the less hindered C18 afforded the desired stereochemistry at these positions, while the &quot;cis&quot;-fusion was achieved with hydrogenation, again proceeding primarily from the less hindered face.

A pyranone was similarly used as the dienophile in the total synthesis of taxol. The intermolecular reaction of the hydroxy-pyrone and α,β–unsaturated ester shown below suffered from poor yield and regioselectivity; however, when directed by phenylboronic acid the desired adduct could be obtained in 61% yield after cleavage of the boronate with neopentyl glycol. The stereospecificity of the Diels–Alder reaction in this instance allowed for the definition of four stereocenters that were carried on to the final product.

A Diels–Alder reaction is a key step in the synthesis of (-)-furaquinocin C.

Tabersonine was prepared by a Diels–Alder reaction to establish &quot;cis&quot; relative stereochemistry of the alkaloid core. Conversion of the &quot;cis&quot;-aldehyde to its corresponding alkene by Wittig olefination and subsequent ring-closing metathesis with a Schrock catalyst gave the second ring of the alkaloid core. The diene in this instance is notable as an example of a 1-amino-3-siloxybutadiene, otherwise known as a Rawal diene.

(+)-Sterpurene can be prepared by asymmetric D-A reaction that featured a remarkable intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of an allene. The [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the thiophenyl group to give the sulfoxide as below proceeded enantiospecifically due to the predefined stereochemistry of the propargylic alcohol. In this way, the single allene isomer formed could direct the Diels–Alder reaction to occur on only one face of the generated &#x27;diene&#x27;.

The tetracyclic core of the antibiotic (-)-tetracycline was prepared with a Diels–Alder reaction. Thermally initiated, conrotatory opening of the benzocyclobutene generated the &quot;o&quot;-quinodimethane, which reacted intermolecularly to give the tetracycline skeleton. The dienophile&#x27;s free hydroxyl group is integral to the success of the reaction, as hydroxyl-protected variants did not react under several different reaction conditions.

Takemura et al. synthesized cantharidin in 1980 by Diels–Alder reaction, utilizing high pressure.

Synthetic applications of the Diels–Alder reaction have been reviewed extensively.

<text>Piaggio Group () is an Italian motor vehicle manufacturer, which produces a range of two-wheeled motor vehicles and compact commercial vehicles under five brands: Piaggio, Vespa, Aprilia, Moto Guzzi and Derbi. Its corporate headquarters are located in Pontedera, Italy. The company was founded by Rinaldo Piaggio in 1884, initially producing locomotives and railway carriages.

Piaggio Group&#x27;s subsidiaries employ a total of 7,053 employees and produced a total of 519,700 vehicles in 2014. The manufacturer has six research-and-development centres and operates in over 50 countries.

== History ==

In 1882, Enrico Piaggio purchased land in Sestri Ponente (Genoa) to set up a timber yard. Two years later, in 1884, his 20-year-old son, Rinaldo Piaggio (1864–1938), founded Piaggio &amp; C. The company initially built locomotives and railway carriages. In 1917, towards the end of World War I, Rinaldo Piaggio turned to the military sector: The company started to produce MAS anti-submarine motorboats, aeroplanes and seaplanes under Ansaldo, Macchi, Caproni, and Dornier licenses. Later the company progressed to vehicles constructed according to Piaggio&#x27;s own drawings.

Between 1937 and 1939 Piaggio achieved 21 world records with its aircraft and engines built at the company&#x27;s new factory in Pontedera, culminating in the four-engine Piaggio P.108 bomber.

Rinaldo died in 1938, by which time Piaggio was owned by multiple shareholders within the family, along with the entrepreneur Attilio Odero. Management of the company passed to his sons Enrico and Armando.

By 1940 Piaggio was manufacturing trains, nautical fittings, aircraft engines, aeroplanes, trucks, trams, buses, funiculars and aluminium windows and doors. The Pontedera plant was destroyed by Allied bombing and production activities were relocated to the Biella area.

After the war, Enrico Piaggio decided to diversify the company&#x27;s activities outside the aeronautical industry to address a perceived need for a modern, affordable mode of transport for the Italian mass market. The first attempt, based on a small motorcycle made for parachutists, was known as the MP5 and nicknamed the &quot;Paperino&quot; (the Italian name for Donald Duck) because of its strange shape. Ultimately Enrico Piaggio did not like it and asked Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio to redesign it.

D&#x27;Ascanio, an aeronautical engineer responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by Agusta, was not naturally enthusiastic about motorcycles, judging them to be uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. When asked to design a motorcycle for Ferdinando Innocenti, D&#x27;Ascanio had come up with a step through scooter design but D&#x27;Ascanio and Innocenti disagreed over use of a pressed steel frame rather than tubular, so D&#x27;Ascanio took his design to Piaggio. Innocenti would ultimately use D&#x27;Ascanio&#x27;s original design for their Lambretta scooter.

Piaggio asked D&#x27;Ascanio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The motorcycle had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver&#x27;s clothes dirty. The engineer&#x27;s drawings proved a significant departure from the Paperino. With the help of Mario D&#x27;Este he prepared the first Vespa project, manufactured at Piaggio newly rebuilt Pontedera headquarters in April 1946. Piaggio launched the Vespa (Italian for &quot;wasp&quot;) and within ten years more than a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, &quot;vespare&quot;, meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa.

In 2024, Piaggio celebrated 140 years with limited edition of &#x27;Vespa 140th of Piaggio,&#x27; with only 140 units available from April 18 to 21, 2024.

===Ownership===
Vespa thrived until 1992 when Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, son of Antonella Bechi Piaggio and Umberto Agnelli, became CEO. Agnelli was very successful in expanding production and modernising the offer. He died unexpectedly of cancer in 1997, aged 33. In 1999 Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio, but hopes for a quick sale were dashed by a failed joint venture in China. In Italy, Piaggio invested 15 million euros in a new motorcycle but dropped it after building a prototype. By the end of 2002, the company had run up 577 million Euros in debt on revenues of 945 million Euros, and booked a loss of 129 million Euros.

In 2003 Piaggio&#x27;s debt was reduced by a 100 million Euro investment made by IMMSI, a holding company of the Colaninno family. 150 million shares were also converted by creditor banks. Reflecting on his investment, Roberto Colaninno said,

&quot;A lot of people told me I was crazy. Piaggio wasn&#x27;t dying. It just needed to be treated better.&quot;&quot;

Colaninno became the new chairman of Piaggio, and Rocco Sabelli the managing director. Sabelli redesigned the production line according to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. Contrary to expectations, Colaninno did not sack a single worker; a move which helped seduce the company&#x27;s skeptical unions. &quot;Everyone in a company is part of the value chain,&quot; said Colaninno. All bonuses for blue-collar workers and management were based on the same criteria: profit margins and customer satisfaction. Air conditioning was installed in the factory for the first time, increasing productivity. He also gave the company&#x27;s engineers, who had been idled by the company&#x27;s financial crisis, deadlines for projects. They rolled out two world firsts in 2004: a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a sophisticated tilting scooter with two wheels in front and one in back to grip the road better.

One of Piaggio&#x27;s problems Colaninno couldn&#x27;t fix from the inside was its scale. Even though Piaggio was the European market leader, it was dwarfed by rivals Honda and Yamaha. A year after restoring Piaggio&#x27;s health, Colaninno directed Piaggio&#x27;s takeover of the Italian scooter and motorcycle manufacturer Aprilia, and with it the Aprilia-owned Moto Guzzi, a storied Italian manufacturer of motorcycles.

In 2006, Piaggio was floated on the Milan Stock Exchange, becoming a public company.

===Production===
In 1956, with production of the millionth Vespa scooter, Italy had its first mass-produced motorised vehicle. Taking advantage of increased cash flow thanks to the success of the Vespa, Piaggio developed other products, including the 1957 Vespa 400, a compact passenger car.

In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family, the owners of car maker Fiat SpA.

By 1960 Vespa had produced and sold 4 million units worldwide.

In 1964 the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions of Piaggio split to become two independent companies as a result of the wide ownership by Fiat in Italian industry. The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. The aircraft company Piaggio Aero was controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, who still hold 10% of Ferrari.

In 1969 Piaggio purchased the motorcycle company Gilera, one of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers (founded in 1909), famous for its sporting achievements and world titles in the Motorcycle World Championship.

In 1971 a steering wheel was added to the Piaggio Ape, a model first produced in 1948, culminating in the Ape Car. Four years later, in 1975, the company made the first prototype of an electric Ape.

In 1988 the Vespa reached 10 million units produced.

In 1996, on the fiftieth anniversary of the first model, Vespa passed 15 million units produced and the new 4-stroke Vespa ET, the first completely new Vespa for 18 years, was launched. Piaggio was still in poor financial health but its brand recognition remained strong, boosted by the appearance of the ET4 in several Hollywood films.

In 1999, in Baramati, production began on a three-wheeler Ape for the Indian market.

In 2000 Piaggio and Vespa returned to the United States with the opening of the first Vespa Boutique in Los Angeles. In that same year the Piaggio Historical Museum was inaugurated in Pontedera. The museum showcases the Piaggio Historical Archive, one of the most comprehensive company archives on the industrial history of Italy.

In 2001 the Piaggio Group acquired Derbi-Nacional Motor SA, an historical Spanish brand founded in 1922 that had won 18 world titles and was a continental leader in the small displacement motorbike segment. In the same year Gilera returned to the Motorcycle World Championship and immediately won the world title in the 125 category with Manuel Poggiali.

In April 2004 Piaggio and Chinese manufacturer Zongshen signed a memorandum of understanding for the creation of the “Zongshen Piaggio Foshan Motorcycle” joint venture with a plant in Foshan for the production of scooters for the Chinese market.

In 2004, at the end of December, the final contract for the acquisition of the Aprilia-Moto Guzzi Group was signed. The most important European two-wheeler group is born.

In 2007 Piaggio Group arrived in Vietnam. The Vinh Phuc plant includes R&amp;D, welding and painting activities, as well as final assembly of the scooters, with warehouse, testing, quality control and office areas.

In 2009 the Piaggio Mp3 Hybrid made its debut on the market which was first hybrid scooter in the world, integrating the conventional low-environmental-impact internal combustion engine with a zero-emission electric motor and combining the advantages of the two power trains.

In Baramati (State of Maharashtra), in 2012, the Piaggio Group&#x27;s new plant for the production of Vespa&#x27;s for the local market was opened.

In 2013 the PADC, Piaggio Advanced Design Center opened in Pasadena (California, United States). The Vespa 946 was also launched this year, along with the new Vespa Primavera, the latest evolution of the &quot;small body&quot; family.

In 2013 Vespa&#x27;s worldwide sales numbered almost 190,000 units; in 2004 the figure stood at 58,000. In ten years of continuous progression over 1.3 million new Vespas have been produced. Since 1946 over 18 million Vespas have been produced and sold.

In September 2017 Foton and Piaggio agreed to form a joint venture to develop and produce light commercial vehicle. Based on Foton chassis the new vehicle was sold by Piaggio Commercial Vehicle division globally apart from China. The vehicle is intended to be a successor of the Piaggio Porter and production was planned to start in mid-2019 in Pontedera (Italy) with all components produced by Foton in China.

==&quot;Cultural Project&quot; Piaggio==
Piaggio&#x27;s &quot;cultural project&quot; promotes the reconstruction and enhancement of the company&#x27;s heritage and is composed by three initiatives: the Piaggio Foundation, the Historical Archives and the Piaggio Museum. In 2003 the Museum and Archives were recognised as the Best Corporate Museum and Archive by winning the Italian prize &quot;Premio Impresa e Cultura&quot;. In 2016, under the patronage of the Italian Ministry of Culture, Piaggio received the Corporate Art Award from pptArt for its Corporate Museum.

===Electric scooters===
The new plug-in hybrid version of the Piaggio MP3 will be equipped with a 125 cc petrol engine and electric motor, which offers about and travels using battery power alone. This machine could be out in 2009.

Piaggio/Vespa are also developing hybrid electric scooters. There are two models in the works, based on the popular Vespa LX 50 and the beefier Piaggio X8 125.

At the Beijing Motor Show 2021, Piaggio unveiled the brand new electric scooter Piaggio 1. This model was produced in three versione: 1 base, 1+ and 1 Active.
The 1 base has a 1.4 kWh and 48V battery, a 1.2 kW engine, a torque of 85 Nm, a maximum speed of 45 km/h (it is therefore approved as a moped) and a range of 55 km. 
The 1+ version differs in the battery that rises to 2.3 kWh and the autonomy that reaches 100 kilometers.
The 1 Active model has the same 2.3 kWh battery, but the engine has a maximum power of 2 kW, the torque goes to 95 Nm and the speed rises to 60 km/h (motorcycle homologation), the average range is 85 km.
For all versions the charging times are 6 hours.
