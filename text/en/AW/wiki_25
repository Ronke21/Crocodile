<text>Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, activist, and politician who served as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977, and again from 1979 to 1985, as well as for Texas&#x27;s 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States, first as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988, and then as a candidate for the Republican Party in 2008 and 2012.

A self-described constitutionalist, Paul is a critic of several of the federal government&#x27;s policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and tax policy, as well as the military–industrial complex, the war on drugs, and the war on terror. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the Patriot Act and the NSA surveillance programs. In 1976, Paul formed the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), and in 1985 was named the first chairman of the conservative PAC Citizens for a Sound Economy, both free-market groups focused on limited government. He has been characterized as the &quot;intellectual godfather&quot; of the Tea Party movement, a fiscally conservative political movement started in 2007 and popularized in 2009 that is largely against most matters of interventionism.

Paul served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1968, and worked as an obstetrician-gynecologist from the 1960s to the 1980s. When his son, Rand Paul, was elected as a U.S. Senator from Kentucky, Paul became the first U.S. Representative in history to serve concurrently with a child in the Senate. He is a Senior Fellow and Distinguished Counselor of the Mises Institute, and has published a number of books and promoted the ideas of economists of the Austrian School, such as Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises, during his political campaigns. He has cited President Grover Cleveland as a preferred model of governance.

After the popularity and grassroots enthusiasm of his 2008 presidential bid, Paul announced in July 2011 that he would not seek reelection to Congress in order to focus on his 2012 bid for the presidency. Finishing in the top four with delegates in both races (while winning four states in the 2012 primaries), he refused to endorse the Republican nominations of John McCain and Mitt Romney during their respective 2008 and 2012 campaigns against Barack Obama. In May 2012, Paul announced that he would not be competing in any other presidential primaries but that he would still compete for delegates in states where the primary elections had already been held. At both the 2008 and 2012 Republican National Conventions, Paul received the second-highest number of delegates, behind only McCain and Romney, respectively.

Paul remained active after his retirement from electoral politics, giving speeches promoting libertarian and libertarian-conservative ideas on college campuses. He also continues to provide political commentary through &quot;The Ron Paul Liberty Report&quot;, a web show he co-hosts on YouTube. At 81, and despite not running, Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector in the 2016 presidential election, making him the oldest person to receive an Electoral College vote, as well as the second registered Libertarian presidential candidate in history to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972.

== Early life, education, and medical career ==
Ronald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Paul (née Dumont; 1908–2001). His paternal grandfather emigrated from Germany, and his paternal grandmother, a devout Christian, was a first-generation German American. Ron Paul has four brothers. As a junior at suburban Dormont High School, he was the 200-meter dash state champion. Paul went to Gettysburg College, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He graduated with a B.S. degree in Biology in 1957.

Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University&#x27;s School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology. One child that he helped deliver was famous Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla.

== Early congressional career (1976–1985) ==
While a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits his interest in the study of economics to them. When President Richard Nixon &quot;closed the gold window&quot; by ending American participation in the Bretton Woods System, thus ending on August 15, 1971, the U.S. dollar&#x27;s loose association with gold, Paul decided to enter politics, and became a Republican candidate for the United States Congress.

=== Elections ===
In 1974, incumbent Robert R. Casey defeated him for the 22nd district. President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey to the Federal Maritime Commission, and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. Gammage underestimated Paul&#x27;s popularity among local mothers: &quot;I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he&#x27;d delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner.&quot;

===Tenure===

Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the U.S. from 1873 to 1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.

During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch &quot;to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.&quot; CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.

Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that &quot;Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It&#x27;s difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.&quot; Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul&#x27;s departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.

== Libertarian Party and ventures ==

=== 1985–1997 ===
Following the loss of the 1984 senate race, Paul returned to his obstetrics practice and took part in a number of other business ventures. Along with his former congressional chief of staff, Lew Rockwell, Paul founded a for-profit enterprise, Ron Paul &amp; Associates, Inc. (RP&amp;A) in 1984, with Paul serving as president, Rockwell as vice president, Paul&#x27;s wife Carol as secretary, and daughter Lori Pyeatt as treasurer.
The company published a variety of political and investment-oriented newsletters, including &quot;Ron Paul Freedom Report&quot; and &quot;Ron Paul Survival Report&quot;, and by 1993 was generating revenues in excess of $900,000.

Paul also co-owned a mail-order coin dealership, &quot;Ron Paul Coins&quot;, for twelve years with Burt Blumert, who continued to operate the dealership after Paul resumed office in 1996. Paul spoke multiple times at the American Numismatic Association&#x27;s 1988 convention. He worked with his Foundation for Rational Economics and Education on such projects as establishing the National Endowment for Liberty, continuing publication of newsletters, and producing the &quot;At Issue&quot; public policy series that was broadcast on the Discovery Channel and CNBC.

=== 1988 presidential campaign ===

Paul left the Republican Party in 1987 and launched a bid for the presidency running on the Libertarian Party ticket. His candidacy was seen as problematic because of the party&#x27;s platform position of support for freedom of choice on abortions. Native American activist Russell Means, Paul&#x27;s rival for the nomination, emphasized that he was in favor of abortion rights. In a forum held prior to the nomination, Means dismissed the greater funds raised by Paul&#x27;s campaign, commenting that Means was receiving &quot;10 times more press&quot; than the former Congressman and was therefore &quot;100 times more effective&quot;.

On September 25, 1988, American psychologist and psychedelic advocate Timothy Leary held a fundraiser for Paul, who attended the event. Journalist Debra Saunders attended and wrote about her experience. In the 1988 presidential election, Paul was on the ballot in 46 states, scoring third in the popular vote with 432,179 votes (0.5%). Paul was kept off the ballot in Missouri, due to what the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; termed a &quot;technicality,&quot; and received votes there only when written in, just as he did in North Carolina.

According to Paul, his presidential campaign was about more than obtaining office; he sought to promote his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they&#x27;ll go home and talk to their parents.&quot; Paul considered running again for president in 1992, but instead chose to endorse Republican Pat Buchanan that year, and served as an adviser to Buchanan&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful presidential primary campaign against incumbent President George H. W. Bush.

== Later congressional career (1997–2013) ==

=== Elections ===
;1996 campaign
During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (the latter two of whom had run in the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles &quot;Lefty&quot; Morris in the fall election, despite Morris&#x27; criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published.

;1998–2013
In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.
In the 2008 Republican primary, he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden, with over 70 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote. On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election.

=== Tenure ===

;Legislation
Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law—a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%. The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009).

By amending other legislation, he helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification, International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens.

In November 1997, Paul was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Paul voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Paul voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted). Two days prior, on December 16, Paul had stated that he would vote to impeach based on Clinton&#x27;s military attacks in the Middle East, namely the 1998 bombing of Iraq and Operation Infinite Reach, and not necessarily the Lewinsky scandal, which he described as far less serious than the &quot;unconstitutionality of presidents waging wars&quot;.

;Affiliations
Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing &quot;liberty-minded, limited-government individuals&quot;. He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

=== Committee assignments ===
Paul served on the following committees and subcommittees.
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology (chairman)
** Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations

With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011. Paul&#x27;s congressional career ended on January 3, 2013, with the swearing in of the 113th Congress.

== 2008 presidential campaign ==


=== 2008 Republican primary campaign ===
Paul formally declared his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination on March 12, 2007, on C-SPAN. Few major politicians endorsed him, and his campaign was largely ignored by traditional media. However, he attracted an intensely loyal grassroots following, interacting through internet social media. In May 2007, shortly after the first televised primary debates, the blogs search engine site Technorati.com listed Paul&#x27;s name as the term most frequently searched for; and Paul&#x27;s campaign claimed that Paul had more YouTube channel subscribers than Barack Obama or any other candidate for president. Paul fundraised more money than any other Republican candidate in the fourth quarter of 2007, as the primary season headed into the Iowa caucuses.

Despite benefiting from campaign contributions from individual donors, and the supporters determined to keep his name a frequent topic of discussion on the internet, over the course of the campaign Paul was unable to translate the enthusiasm of his core supporters into large enough numbers of actual primary votes to unseat his rivals. Paul came in 5th place in both the January 4 Iowa caucuses (10% of votes cast) and the January 8 New Hampshire primary (8%). With the exception of the Nevada caucuses January 19, where he came in 2nd (14%) behind Mitt Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On Super Tuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) and Montana (25%, 2nd place).

By March, front-runner John McCain had secured enough pledged delegates to guarantee that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Mike Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, knew that it was now impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20—40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul&#x27;s supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one instance, Nevada&#x27;s state party leaders in response to Paul&#x27;s supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to prematurely shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.

On June 12, 2008, Paul withdrew his bid for the Republican nomination. He later said that one of the reasons he did not run in the general election as a third-party candidate, after losing the primaries, was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary. Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul&#x27;s Campaign for Liberty.

=== Endorsement after ending campaign ===

At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul announced his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said that each of them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties&#x27; candidates (McCain—Republican Party, or Obama—Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the &quot;charade&quot; that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.

Two weeks later, &quot;shocked and disappointed&quot; that Bob Barr (the Libertarian nominee) had pulled out of attending the press conference at the last minute and had admonished Paul for remaining neutral and failing to say which specific candidate Paul would vote for in the general election, Paul released a statement saying that he had decided to endorse Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate, for president. Paul withdrew from active campaigning in the last weeks of the primary election period. He received 42,426 votes, or 0.03% of the total cast, in the general election.

== 2012 presidential campaign ==

=== 2012 Republican primary campaign ===

Paul won several early straw polls for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and formed an official exploratory committee in late April 2011. He participated in the first Republican presidential debate on May 5, 2011 and on May 13, 2011, formally announced his candidacy in an interview on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. He placed second in the 2011 Ames Straw Poll, missing first by 0.9%. Paul indicated in a June 2011 interview that if nominated, he would consider former New Jersey Superior Court judge Andrew Napolitano as his running mate.

In December 2011, with Paul&#x27;s increased support, the controversy over racist and homophobic statements in several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention. During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually ignored by the media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls even when he was polling second.

====Iowa====
Ron Paul&#x27;s presidential campaign managers Jesse Benton, John Tate and Demetri Kesari were all found guilty of paying former Iowa state senator Kent Sorenson $73,000 to switch his support from Rep. Michele Bachmann to Paul. In court papers filed in August 2014, Sorenson said that he had been paid by both presidential campaigns for his endorsement and pled guilty to criminal charges stemming from the incident.

Paul came in third in the Iowa Republican Caucus held on January 3, 2012. Out of a turnout of 121,503 votes, Paul took 26,036 (21%) of the certified votes. Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney finished in a virtual tie for first place with 25% each, although Ron Paul had ultimately won Iowa at the Republican National Convention gathering 22 delegates to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 5. In the New Hampshire primary held on January 10, 2012, Paul received 23% of the votes and came in second after Romney&#x27;s 39%.

====South Carolina, Florida, and Nevada====

Paul&#x27;s results then declined, despite the withdrawal of candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry. He had fourth-place finishes in the next two primaries, on January 21 in South Carolina (with 13% of the vote) and on January 31 in Florida (where he received 7% of the vote).

On February 4, Paul finished third in Nevada with 18.8% of the vote. Three non-binding primaries were held on February 7; Paul took 3rd place in Colorado and Missouri with 13% and 12% of the vote, respectively. He fared better in Minnesota with 27%, finishing second to Rick Santorum. On May 14, Paul&#x27;s campaign announced that due to lack of funds (though despite financial backing from financiers Peter Thiel and Mark Spitznagel) he would no longer actively campaign for votes in the 11 remaining primary states, including Texas and California, that had not yet voted. He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states that had already voted.

====Alleged irregularities====
In June, a group of 132 supporters of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican Party National Convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. The suit alleged that there had been &quot;a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions&quot;, employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign&#x27;s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, he was not going to tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. He said, &quot;If they&#x27;re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we&#x27;ve been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.&quot;

=== Republican National convention ===
Paul declined to speak at the Republican National Convention as a matter of principle, saying that the convention planners had demanded that his remarks be vetted by the Romney campaign and that he make an unqualified endorsement of Romney. Paul had felt that &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be my speech... That would undo everything I&#x27;ve done in the last 30 years. I don&#x27;t fully endorse him for president.&quot; Many of Paul&#x27;s supporters and delegates walked out of the convention in protest over rules adopted by the convention that reduced their delegate count and that would make it harder for non-establishment candidates to win the party&#x27;s nomination in future elections. Supporters and media commentators had noted that the delegations from states where Paul had had the most support were given the worst seats in the convention hall, while delegations from regions with no electoral votes, such as the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico, were given prime seats at the front.

=== Endorsement after ending campaign ===
As in 2008, Paul ultimately refused to endorse the ticket selected by the Republican Party in 2012. He said that there was no essential difference between Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Obama, on the most critical policies: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in this business a long time and believe me there is essentially no difference from one administration to another no matter what the platforms... The foreign policy stays the same, the monetary policy stays the same, there&#x27;s no proposal for any real cuts and both parties support it.&quot; Paul received 26,204 write-in votes, or 0.02% of the total cast in the election.

== Political party identification ==
Throughout his entire tenure in Congress, Paul has represented his district as a member of the Republican Party; however, he has frequently taken positions in direct opposition to the other members and the leadership of the party, and he has sometimes publicly questioned whether he really belonged in the party. Paul voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower for president in 1956 when he was 21 years old. He had been a lifelong supporter of the Republican Party by the time he entered politics in the mid-1970s. He was one of the first elected officials in the nation to support Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign, and he actively campaigned for Reagan in 1976 and 1980. After Reagan&#x27;s election in 1980, Paul quickly became disillusioned with the Reagan administration&#x27;s policies. He later recalled being the only Republican to vote against Reagan budget proposals in 1981, aghast that &quot;in 1977, Jimmy Carter proposed a budget with a $38 billion deficit, and every Republican in the House voted against it. In 1981, Reagan proposed a budget with a $45 billion deficit—which turned out to be $113 billion—and Republicans were cheering his great victory. They were living in a storybook land.&quot; He expressed his disgust with the political culture of both major parties in a speech delivered in 1984 upon resigning from the House of Representatives to prepare for a (failed) run for the Senate, and he eventually apologized to his libertarian friends for having supported Reagan.
By 1987, Paul was ready to sever all ties to the Republican Party, as he explained in a blistering resignation letter: &quot;Since [1981] Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt. How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together? ... There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years.&quot; A month later, he announced he would seek the 1988 Libertarian Party nomination for president. During the 1988 campaign, Paul called Reagan &quot;a dramatic failure&quot; and complained that &quot;Reagan&#x27;s record is disgraceful. He starts wars, breaks the law, supplies terrorists with guns made at taxpayers&#x27; expense and lies about it to the American people.&quot; Paul predicted that &quot;the Republicans are on their way out as a major party,&quot; and he said that, although registered as a Republican, he had always been a libertarian at heart.

Paul returned to his private medical practice and managing several business ventures after losing the 1988 election; but by 1996, he was ready to return to politics, this time running on the Republican Party ticket again. He said that he had never read the entire Libertarian platform when he ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988, and that &quot;I worked for the Libertarians on my terms, not theirs.&quot; He added that in terms of a political label he preferred to call himself &quot;a constitutionalist. In Congress I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not the (Republican) platform.&quot; When he lost the Republican Party presidential primary election in 2008, Paul criticized the two major political parties, saying that there was no real difference between the parties and that neither of them truly intended to challenge the status quo. He refused to endorse the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for president, John McCain, and lent his support to third-party candidates instead.

In the 2012 presidential campaign, during which he acknowledged it was unlikely that he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, &quot;If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don&#x27;t want to change anything on foreign policy, they don&#x27;t want to cut anything, they don&#x27;t want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don&#x27;t want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me.&quot; On that same theme he said in another interview, &quot;I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I&#x27;d say, [all] we&#x27;ve done is for naught. So, let&#x27;s support anybody at all ... even if they disagree with everything that we do.&quot;

== Political positions ==


Paul has been described as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president. Other analyses have judged Paul much more moderate. The &quot;National Journal&quot;, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th-most-conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010. The &quot;National Journal&quot;&#x27;s analysis gave Paul a 2011 composite ideological rating of 54% liberal and 46% conservative.

The foundation of Paul&#x27;s political philosophy is the conviction that &quot;the proper role for government in America is to provide national defense, a court system for civil disputes, a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud, and little else.&quot; He has been nicknamed &quot;Dr. No&quot;, reflecting both his medical degree and his insistence that he will &quot;never vote for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution.&quot; In 2008, Paul spoke at the John Birch Society&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebration.

=== Foreign policy ===

An anti-war activist, Paul promotes a noninterventionist foreign policy and an end to American imperialism. He advocates withdrawal from the United Nations and from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for reasons of maintaining strong national sovereignty.

Paul voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists in response to the September 11 attacks, but suggested war alternatives such as authorizing the president to grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal targeting specific terrorists, in lieu of launching an Afghanistan invasion. An opponent of the Iraq War as well, and potential war with Iran, he has criticized neoconservatism and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing that both inadvertently cause terrorist reprisals against Americans, such as the 9/11 attacks. Paul has stated that &quot;Israel is our close friend&quot; and that it is not the place of the United States to &quot;dictate how Israel runs her affairs&quot;. Paul, a critic of the US&#x27;s implementation of most foreign aid, said in 2011 that &quot;it was our foreign aid that helped Mubarak retain power to repress his people in the first place.&quot;

Following the Orange Revolution protests in 2004, which led to Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s ouster from government, Paul accused the National Endowment for Democracy of having staged a coup in Ukraine. Paul supported the 2014 Crimean status referendum, for which he was called a friend of Vladimir Putin by The Atlantic, and has objected to sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War and foreign aid to Ukraine.

=== Domestic issues ===

Paul endorses constitutional rights, such as the right to keep and bear arms, and &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for political detainees. He was one of only three Republicans in the House to vote against the Patriot Act. Paul opposes federal use of torture, presidential autonomy, a national identification card, warrantless domestic surveillance, and the draft. He has also called for shutting down the TSA and moving matters of airline security to private businesses. Paul believes that the notion of the separation of church and state is currently misused by the court system: &quot;In case after case, the Supreme Court has used the infamous &#x27;separation of church and state&#x27; metaphor to uphold court decisions that allow the federal government to intrude upon and deprive citizens of their religious liberty.&quot; After the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Paul commented on the tactics used by governing forces into a harsh criticism that he has written as a &quot;military-style occupation of an American city&quot;.

=== Economic issues ===
Paul is a proponent of Austrian School economics; he has authored six books on the subject, and displayed pictures of Austrian School economists Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises (as well as of President Grover Cleveland and Chicago School economist Milton Friedman) on his office wall. He regularly voted against almost all proposals for new government spending, initiatives, or taxes; he cast two thirds of all the lone negative votes in the House during a 1995–1997 period.

Paul pledged never to raise taxes, and states he has never voted to approve a budget deficit. Paul believes that the country could abolish the individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies. On April 15, 2011, Paul was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against Representative Paul Ryan&#x27;s budget proposal, known as &quot;The Path to Prosperity&quot;.

Paul has consistently warned of hyperinflation and called for a return to the gold standard as far back as 1981. From 1999 until his retirement, he introduced bills into each Congress seeking to eliminate the Federal Reserve System in a single year, a position he outlines in his 2009 book &quot;End the Fed&quot;. Paul is a strong proponent of free trade, once saying that &quot;free trade is an answer to a lot of conflicts around the world&quot;. He rejects membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization as &quot;managed trade&quot;. He has also advocated for open trade and better relations with the country of Cuba. In addition, Paul argued in 2012 that &quot;as well intentioned as sanctions are, they almost always backfire and hurt the people.&quot;

Paul has described his interest in ending wars and lowering military spending as partly an &quot;economic issue&quot;, adding, &quot;We&#x27;d save a lot of money by not being engaged [in overseas conflict] like this.&quot;

=== Climate change ===

As a free-market environmentalist, Paul asserts private property rights in relation to environmental protection and pollution prevention. He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and has claimed that global warming is a hoax in a 2009 Fox Business interview.

=== Healthcare ===

Paul has stated, &quot;The government shouldn&#x27;t be in the medical business.&quot; He pushes to eliminate federal involvement with and management of health care, which he argues would allow prices to decrease due to the fundamental dynamics of a free market. He also opposes federal government influenza inoculation programs.

=== Immigration ===

Paul endorses increased border security and opposes welfare for illegal immigrants, birthright citizenship, and amnesty; he voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In a 2019 interview, Paul expressed disapproval of President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposed border wall along the southern US border, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t like walls. I don&#x27;t want to wall people in and wall people out.&quot;

=== Ballots and voting ===

Paul is an outspoken proponent of increased ballot access for third-party candidates. He has sought to repeal the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter law.

=== Secession ===

Paul has stated that secession from the United States &quot;is a deeply American principle&quot; and that &quot;If the possibility of secession is completely off the table there is nothing to stop the federal government from continuing to encroach on our liberties and no recourse for those who are sick and tired of it.&quot; Paul wrote the remarks in a post on his Congressional website in one of his final public statements as a member of Congress, noting that many petitions had been submitted to the White House calling for secession in the wake of the November 2012 election.

=== Social issues ===
Citing the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, Paul advocates states&#x27; rights to decide how to regulate social matters not cited directly by the Constitution. He opposes federal regulation of such matters as the death penalty (although he opposes capital punishment), of education, of drugs, and of marriage. Regarding same-sex marriage, he stated in 2011 that &quot;My personal opinion is government shouldn&#x27;t be involved. The whole country would be better off if individuals made those decisions and it was a private matter.&quot; He endorsed revising the military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy to concern mainly disruptive sexual behavior (whether heterosexual or homosexual). His abortion-related legislation, such as the Sanctity of Life Act in 2005, is intended to negate &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and to get &quot;the federal government completely out of the business of regulating state matters.&quot; Paul says his years as an obstetrician led him to believe that life begins at conception.

Paul was critical of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, arguing that it sanctioned federal interference in the labor market and did not improve race relations. He once remarked: &quot;The Civil Rights Act of 1964 not only violated the Constitution and reduced individual liberty; it also failed to achieve its stated goals of promoting racial harmony and a color-blind society&quot;. Paul opposes affirmative action.

Paul opposes the federal War on Drugs, and advocates that states should decide whether to regulate or deregulate drugs such as medical and recreational marijuana, and other substances. In 2001, he joined with Democratic Congressman Barney Frank in helping pass the States&#x27; Rights to Medical Marijuana Act (H.R. 2592), an attempt to stop the federal government from preempting states&#x27; medical marijuana laws. Paul again partnered with Frank in support of online gambling rights. In 2006, both strongly opposed H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act, and H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

In June 2018, Paul posted a tweet containing a racist cartoon and a caption which invoked the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory. The tweet read &quot;Are you stunned by what has become of American culture? Well, it&#x27;s not an accident. You&#x27;ve probably heard of &#x27;Cultural Marxism,&#x27; but do you know what it means?&quot; The tweet was later deleted with an apology, stating that a staff member had inadvertently posted what Paul described as an &quot;offensive cartoon&quot;. In August 2022, Paul expressed support for Republican state governments he described as &quot;fighting back against so-called &#x27;Woke&#x27; Capitalism&quot;.

== Post-congressional career ==

In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views. The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education. In the same month, he began to offer the &quot;Ron Paul Curriculum&quot;, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a &quot;free market and Christian&quot; perspective.

In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a &quot;great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret&quot;. In April 2015, Paul began appearing in infomercials for Stansberry &amp; Associates Investment Research, warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world&#x27;s currencies. In March 2017, Paul predicted a market downturn again.

Paul was a critic of President Trump&#x27;s plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don&#x27;t see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base. Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated. He continues to voice his disagreements regarding foreign policy, and more recently, regarding the events involving America and Iran.

In 2013, Paul established the Ron Paul Channel, an Internet broadcast. Its slogan was &quot;Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth&quot;. In 2015, Paul ended all relationships with the Ron Paul Channel in order to start a new Internet program, which he co-hosts with Daniel McAdams, called &quot;The Ron Paul Liberty Report&quot;. 

===2016 presidential election===
Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the 2016 Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding libertarian views. Paul expressed disappointment in former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson&#x27;s Libertarian Party nomination for president, and told independent voters that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who &quot;lean towards progressivism and liberalism&quot;, while emphasizing that he was not endorsing her.

Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector, South Texas College political science professor William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote, and the second Libertarian Party member to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972.

===2020 presidential election===
In the 2020 Democratic primary, Paul described Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard as &quot;the most intelligent&quot; and &quot;the very, very best&quot; option of the Democratic candidates, primarily for her views on foreign policy, adding, &quot;We probably wouldn&#x27;t agree with too much on economics.&quot;

===2024 presidential election===
In April 2023, in an episode of &quot;The Ron Paul Liberty Report&quot; titled &quot;President Kennedy?&quot;, Paul praised then-Democratic (later Independent) presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for his stances on noninterventionism, the pharmaceutical industry, and crony corporatism, saying &quot;[Kennedy&#x27;s] baggage is telling the truth&quot; and advocated for his participation in the major party presidential debates.

A few days before the election, Elon Musk expressed interest in having Paul join the proposed Department of Government Efficiency during a second Trump presidency, which Musk has suggested could help cut the U.S. federal budget by up to US$2 trillion. Paul responded that he was happy to discuss the idea with Musk, although declined any &quot;official position&quot; within the new department.

== Personal life ==
Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th birthday party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul&#x27;s son Randal (Rand) is the junior United States senator from the state of Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the &quot;Ron Paul Family Cookbook&quot;, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul&#x27;s political campaigns. His life and career is the subject of the 2012 film &quot;Ron Paul Uprising&quot;. Paul and his wife reside in Lake Jackson, Texas.

On September 25, 2020, Paul was hospitalized after slurring his words while speaking during a livestream event. Paul later posted a photo of himself in a hospital bed to his Twitter page, along with the statement &quot;I am doing fine. Thank you for your concern.&quot; In April 2021, following Paul&#x27;s absence from his daily show, the &quot;Ron Paul Liberty Report&quot;, his co-host Daniel McAdams revealed Paul&#x27;s daughter, Lori Pyeatt, had recently died.

<doc id="168717" wikidata="Q2454007" url="?curid=168717" title="Triple oppression">
<text>Triple oppression, also called double jeopardy, Jane Crow, or triple exploitation, is a theory developed by black socialists in the United States, such as Claudia Jones. The theory states that a connection exists between various types of oppression, specifically classism, racism, and sexism. It hypothesizes that all three types of oppression need to be overcome at once.

== History ==
Before the term &quot;triple oppression&quot; was coined, Black female scholars in the 19th century highlighted the unique challenges faced by Black women due to the intersecting oppressions of race and gender. As an abolitionist, Sojourner Truth affirmed the struggles she faced as a result of both her race and gender. At the 1851 Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, Truth delivered a speech that would become one of the most iconic moments in the fight for both abolition and women&#x27;s rights, titled “Ain’t I a Woman?” In her speech, Truth challenged the arguments that excluded women, especially Black women, from the fight for equality, emphasizing her strength and abilities against the stereotypes that belittled her. Truth also voiced opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment with the reasoning that more male power would lead to the greater oppression of black women. On May 9, 1867, during her speech at the First Annual Meeting of the American Equal Rights Association, she emphasized this point by stating, &quot;if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.&quot;

Moreover, suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton stated that black women would suffer from a &quot;triple bondage that man never knows&quot; if they did not receive voting rights when colored men did. Anna Julia Cooper discussed black women&#x27;s double enslavement through race and gender. Moreover, in 1904, activist Mary Church Terrell explored the unique discrimination faced by black women when she wrote about women of color&#x27;s discrimination as a result of both their race and gender.

According to scholar Eric McDuffie, the term &quot;triple exploitation&quot; was coined in the 1930s by activist and Communist Party member Louise Thompson Patterson to describe the oppression pertaining to class, race, and gender suffered specifically by black women.

Triple oppression was popularized during a time of transition when the Old Left as a movement was rendered powerless post-World War II. Communism, although prominent in earlier years, reached its highest peak in the political atmosphere in the 1960s. The Communist party was made up of immigrant members and foreign and the various coalitions formerly associated with the Socialist Party of America; those workers, many of whom were not fluent English-speakers, made little effort to include Black Americans and their rights even when both mirrored each other. As the Socialist Party was rising, still little effort was made to include many African-American members. Although leaders often were committed against racial segregation, many in the Socialist Party didn&#x27;t see the connection to racism and how it affected many in the United States. &quot;Some African Americans dissatisfied by Socialist attitudes and their unwillingness to speak up about racial issues, joined the Communist party; others went to the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB), which was known for being a radical black liberation organization.&quot; The Communist Party&#x27;s new concept introduced triple oppression focusing on Black women workers. This oppression is shown through, &quot;The most privileged group members marginalizes those who are multiply-burdened and obscures claims that cannot be understood as resulting from discrete sources of discrimination.&quot; The party focused on the blatant issues of race, class, and gender while including intersectionality. After much frustration from black citizens and a reformulation of the Communist party, many African Americans joined the party to further the goal of equality. Eventually after World War I and II, the communist party underwent many splits that caused the party to get smaller and eventually disappear. Many groups came out of this, including militant power movements like the Black Panther movement.

=== Claudia Jones ===
Erik S. McDuffie credits communist Louise Thompson Patterson with coining the term &quot;triple oppression,&quot; while Carole Boyce Davies argues that the concept of black women&#x27;s triple oppression was popularized within the Communist Party by party member Claudia Jones. Jones&#x27;s pivotal article critiquing the Party’s neglect of Black women synthesized her long-standing ideas on triple oppression.

Jones believed that black women&#x27;s triple oppression based on race, class, and gender preceded all other forms of oppression. Additionally, she theorized that by freeing black women, who are the most oppressed of all people, freedom would be gained for all people who suffer from race, class, and gender oppression. Jones saw that the Communist Party focused on the oppression of the white working-class male, and she criticized the party&#x27;s lack of recognition of the specific oppressions of black women in her article, &quot;An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman&quot; (1949).

Jones was sure to articulate a socialist feminism that took into account not just race, but the disparate struggles of all working women. Jones felt that black American women experienced a unique form of oppression that was not acknowledged by feminism. She argued that with the liberation of black women, black nationalism would be much more achievable. As she puts it, &quot;once Negro women undertake action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition is greatly enhanced.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s views influenced other Communist women and black female activists, such as Angela Davis and the Combahee River Collective. Davis writes about triple oppression in her book &quot;Women, Race and Class&quot; (1981), where she identifies white socialist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn as articulating the concept of &quot;triple jeopardy&quot; in 1948, quoting this passage: &quot;Every inequality and disability inflicted on American white women is aggravated a thousandfold among Negro women, who are triply exploited — as Negroes, as workers, and as women.&quot;

== Variations on Triple Oppression ==

=== Double Jeopardy by Frances Beal ===
Frances Beal introduced the term &quot;double jeopardy&quot; in her 1969 pamphlet, Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female. The term was coined to capture the unique dual oppressions faced by Black women, who were marginalized not only by racism but also by sexism. She argued that this dual oppression could not be fully understood by examining either race or gender alone. Instead, the intersection of these two identities created a distinct form of discrimination that mainstream feminist and civil rights movements overlooked.

While the primary focus of Beal&#x27;s work is on the dual perspectives of oppression of racism and sexism, she also highlights that economic factors are crucial for understanding the overall impact of double jeopardy. She critiques capitalism, reproductive rights, and political socialization, as they exacerbate the challenges faced by Black women in various aspects of their lives, including employment, income, and access to resources.

==== Multiple Jeopardy: Beyond Double Jeopardy ====
According to Deborah K. King, racism, sexism, and classism are widely accepted as the major facets of the status of black women. King believes that double jeopardy and triple jeopardy do not fully explain the relationship between the different oppressions faced by black women. Thus, King coined the term &quot;multiple jeopardy&quot; in &quot;Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology.&quot; This concept addresses the limitations of double or triple jeopardy models, which view different forms of prejudice as additive. Instead, multiple jeopardy suggests that these prejudices are interdependent and have a multiplicative effect. As such, King believes that different oppressions interact with each other rather than acting independently.

King&#x27;s theory of multiple jeopardy further expands this discussion by highlighting the interconnectedness of various forms of oppression, emphasizing the matrix of domination. By acknowledging the multiple consequences of homophobia and heterosexism for LGBTQ+ individuals, King&#x27;s framework provides a deeper understanding of how these overlapping oppressions shape the experiences of marginalized groups.

==== Critiquing Double and Multiple Jeopardy ====
Jim Sidanius and colleagues have pointed out that while it is true that subordinate group women (e.g. black women) do experience both racism and sexism, racism tends to be primarily directed at subordinate group males (e.g. black men) and that the empirical evidence supports the idea that the worst outcomes are generally found in subordinate group males, not females as predicted by the double jeopardy hypothesis.

=== Jane Crow ===
Pauli Murray coined the term Jane Crow in 1947 to highlight that gender-based oppression, drawn from her own experiences at Howard University. Jane Crow was coined as a metaphor for the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local regulations enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that enforced racial segregation and targeted African Americans.

While Jim Crow referred to race-based discrimination, Jane Crow highlighted the gender-based oppression that Black women faced, underscoring the dual challenges of racial and gender discrimination. Murray used this similarity of name between Jim Crow and Jane to emphasize that both had a similar harmful impact on Black women despite the differences in names, highlighting the intertwined nature of both forms of oppression.

== Intersectionality ==
Intersectionality is the sister of triple oppression while describing the various divisions of human beings. It deconstructs categories such as race, class, and gender. The idea of triple oppression dives into these different categories, race, class, and gender, by developing an understanding of how each works together often through injustices. Barbara Smith relates this combination by stating, &quot;The concept of the simultaneity of oppression is still the crux of a Black feminist understanding of political reality and, I believe, one of the most significant ideological contributions of Black feminist thought.&quot; Both intersectionality and triple oppression show the neglect and subordination of many experiences of Black women and these played a vital role in the multitude of movements that prospered out of this.

=== Black women and Intersectionality ===
Black women experience triple oppression on a wide scale level, multiple scholars argue. Scholar Rajendra Chapagain in work titled &quot; African American women, racism and triple oppression&#x27; discusses this, stating &quot;to be Black and female is to suffer from triple oppression&quot;. Chapagain refers to sexism racism and classism.

The theory of intersectionality suggests that different aspects of a person&#x27;s network and society puts them at either an advantage or disadvantage. It is able to explain many of the implications of various forms of oppression - including colonialism and slavery - on Black women in different facets of life. They experience oppression that are able to intersect, amplifying their impact. Coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, its systematic nature is what many argue is the cause of such widespread misrepresentation. Her work on Intersectionality and Intersectional feminism discusses these overlapping systems. Research by Ntombenhle Torkington entitled &#x27;Black migrant women and health&#x27; discusses how these forms have been able to infiltrate into the sector of health for Black women, noting how the correlation between oppression and treatment does exists. It also shows how because of it, they are at a clear disadvantage health wise.

This is able to be reflected in other areas of life, one of which being the class system and the exploitation of Black women in industries ranging vastly. This causes further repercussions including areas like income, access to communal resources and other societal privileges, as the theory reflects. Scholar Recep, in a reading of feminist literature through triple a oppression lens, describes this as the result of the &quot;pursuit for power&quot;.

Feminist and African-American scholar Moya Bailey argues the systematic &quot;hatred&quot; of Black women is based on &quot;simultaneous and interlocking oppression&quot; in her book, &#x27;What is Misogynoir?&quot; Though mainly looking at the link between race and gender, the aspect of class is something that is able to become noteworthy due to its extended consequences. She discusses how the constant devaluing and commodification of Black women and their bodies is something that has long had an effect on the community.

== In various contexts ==

=== Political participation in South Africa ===
In &quot;Gender, Social Location, and Feminist Politics in South Africa&quot; (1991), Shireen Hassim discusses how triple oppression negatively affects South African women&#x27;s participation in politics. She argues that the rhetoric surrounding triple oppression at the time of the article&#x27;s publication focuses too hard on the &quot;additive relation between these different dimensions of oppression,&quot; and not enough on their interdependent and intersecting facets. Black women workers&#x27; struggles are often disregarded as one identity gets the most political attention. Race is politically prioritized, so that gender is seen as less important within the patriarchy, among both women and men. Hassim argues that women&#x27;s issues exist as political agendas only within broader ones, such as labor movements and resistance to racism. Discouraged by the unreliability created by feminism&#x27;s bad reputation in South Africa, black women focus less on women&#x27;s issues and more on anti-apartheid and labor issues, where they may receive more support.

Hassim goes on to explain that because of the intersections between capitalism and patriarchy, labor, as a gendered issue, creates a &quot;double shift&quot; that discourages women from participating politically, because they are too busy juggling their roles as &quot;wage-earners and managers of families&quot;. As women are &quot;isolat[ed]...in the household&quot;, they are robbed of the opportunity to develop &quot;a common consciousness of oppression or exploitation.&quot; If they cannot gather, women cannot organize. Hassim argues that it is a combination of patriarchal values that empower men and employment obligations in domestic and other service-based jobs that limit women&#x27;s ability to become active in campaigns that would benefit them only: women&#x27;s rights campaigns.

=== Employment opportunities for Mexican-Americans ===
Denise Segura argues that the social inequality women of color face cannot be properly explained by an analysis any one of the facets that constitute triple oppression, because their subordination in social hierarchies is relative to men, white people, and higher-income strata. Chicana, or Mexican-American, women are subject to inequality in the home as well as in social contexts, such as the labor force. The relegation of women and minorities to traditionally low-paying jobs has made it so that Chicanas do not have many options for work outside of agriculture or domesticity, areas characterized by low wages and, therefore, low status. Discrimination based on race and gender and a reluctance to acculturate inhibit occupational mobility. Cultural cues and high fertility also encourage Mexican-American women to remain in the home and bear children instead of participating in the work force. The combination of race and gender bias and the inability to obtain white-collar jobs form the basis for the triple oppression felt by Mexican-American women. In turn, triple oppression limits Chicanas&#x27; employment opportunities to low wages, lower than her male (Chicano) and white (women) counterparts, and &quot;secondary&quot; jobs e.g. clerical and factory jobs, effectively solidifying their status at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

=== Asian-American activism ===
Adrienne Ann Winans and Judy Tzu-Chun Wu argue that &quot;othered&quot; groups, such as racial minorities, suffer from poor job prospects because of their &quot;designat[ion] as outsiders.&quot; Groups marginalized by legal status and patriarchal values often find only low-paying work with little to no benefits or job security. Poor employment opportunities contribute to an intersectional subordination that includes legal status, gender, and race. Asian-American women&#x27;s organizational efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to counter such phenomena proved to facilitate them. According to Winans and Wu, female activists recognized a bias within their own activism circles which &quot;relied on female labor but privileged male leadership.&quot; Other manifestations of triple oppression in the Asian-American community are the exploitation of immigrant female workers, and gender roles that prescribe a duty to the &quot;double shift.&quot; Within the double shift, women are expected to not only procreate but also rear the products of their unions &quot;and&quot; contribute to the work force at the same time, a feat not demanded of their male counterparts.

=== Queer communities ===
While the term &quot;triple oppression&quot; has typically been reserved to describe the plights of working women of color, the phenomenon of three intersecting social burdens has plagued gay men of color. Diaz et al.&#x27;s 1999 study, published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;, found that the combined impact of homophobia, racism, and poverty cause adverse psychological effects in Latino men, including low self-esteem, depression, sleeping problems, anxiety, and social alienation. A factor that does not arise in typical analyses of triple oppression is HIV incidence, but this study concludes that HIV status as a source of social discrimination to the likes of race and class correlates with higher psychological symptoms. Gay men may benefit from male privilege, but in any case, they too can experience a measure of oppression in the form of systemic homophobia, with incidents of violence, belittlement, familial disapproval, job discrimination and police harassment.

=== Catalan countries ===
Catalan nationalist left-wing feminists have theorised a &quot;triple oppression&quot; characterisation of the status of working-class Catalan women. Their perspective points out to capitalism, Spanish nationalism and patriarchy as three interlocking domination systems.

<doc id="168724" wikidata="Q2605613" url="?curid=168724" title="Ultimate Play the Game">
<text>Ashby Computers and Graphics Limited, trading as Ultimate Play the Game, was a British video game developer and publisher, founded in 1982, by ex-arcade video game developers Tim and Chris Stamper. Ultimate released a series of successful games for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX and Commodore 64 computers from 1983 until 1987. Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles &quot;Jetpac&quot; and &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures using a technique termed Filmation. &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as &quot;seminal ... revolutionary&quot; (&quot;GamesTM&quot;), &quot;one of the most successful and influential games of all time&quot; (&quot;X360&quot;), and &quot;probably ... the greatest single advance in the history of computer games&quot; (&quot;Edge&quot;).

By the time of the label&#x27;s last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft platforms such as Xbox and Microsoft Windows. In 2006, Rare revived the &quot;Ultimate Play the Game&quot; name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of &quot;Jetpac&quot; named &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;. In 2015, several Ultimate titles were collected and released as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One.

==History==
===Early history and rise===
Ultimate Play the Game was founded in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982 by Tim and Chris Stamper, their friend John Lathbury, and Tim&#x27;s girlfriend (later wife) Carole Ward. Other members of the Stamper family were also involved in the early running and support of the company, which was initially located in a house next to the family-run newsagent. Both Tim and Chris had worked in arcade game development including, according to one report, Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gyruss&quot;, and claimed to be &quot;the most experienced arcade video game design team in Britain&quot; until tiring of working for others and leaving to start Ashby Computers and Graphics. This led to ACG&#x27;s initial trade being in creating arcade conversion kits, before moving into the home computer software market developing games under the Ultimate Play the Game name. Ashby released four arcade games: &quot;Blue Print&quot; for Bally-Midway, and &quot;Grasspin&quot;, &quot;Dingo&quot; and &quot;Saturn&quot; for Jaleco.

Ultimate&#x27;s first game was &quot;Jetpac&quot; in May 1983 for the 16K Spectrum. In a 1983 interview, Tim Stamper said that they deliberately targeted 16K machines as their smaller size meant development time was much shorter, claiming they could produce two 16K games in one month, or one 48K game. Jetpac was a huge commercial success selling more than 300,000 copies providing the fledgling company with a turnover in excess of £1 million.

This was followed by three further 16K releases, &quot;Pssst&quot; in June, &quot;Tranz Am&quot;, and &quot;Cookie&quot;, before Ultimate stepped up to the 48K Spectrum. &quot;Jetpac&quot;, &quot;Pssst&quot;, &quot;Tranz Am&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot; were four of only ten games ever to be released on the 16K ROM format for use with the ZX Interface 2. They were also republished on cassette, with distinctive silver inlay cards, by Sinclair Research.

Ultimate&#x27;s first 48K releases were &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot; – a sequel to &quot;Jetpac&quot; – and &quot;Atic Atac,&quot; both of which were released in late 1983. Both games were very well received by the gaming press, &quot;CRASH magazine&quot; in particular praising what Ultimate had managed to do with the extra memory Lunar Jetman used. In 1984 came &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, the first in the &quot;Sabreman&quot; series, and the first release at a recommended retail price of £9.95. The price of Ultimate titles had previously been just £5.50, which was typical for Spectrum arcade-style games at the time. This increase was to discourage piracy, with the idea being that if customers paid more for a game they would be less inclined to give away copies. This coincided with the introduction of the distinctive Ultimate &quot;big box&quot; packaging (used with all further Spectrum releases until &quot;Gunfright&quot;, and with various releases on other platforms), which the company felt might also help justify the price increase and encourage gamers to buy the game rather than copy it. The strategy paid off as &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; went on to sell over 350,000 copies on the Spectrum alone. This was followed by the release in late 1984 of the next two instalments in the Sabreman series, &quot;Underwurlde&quot; quickly followed by &quot;Knight Lore&quot;. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was something of a revolution in the home computer game market, using a forced-perspective isometric viewpoint branded Filmation, the style of which would be extensively copied in other games, notable examples being &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; from Ocean Software. In a 1988 interview with &quot;CRASH&quot;, Tim Stamper claimed that &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, and some of its Filmation follow-up &quot;Alien 8&quot;, was actually completed before &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; but Ultimate decided that it could have a potentially negative effect on sales of the comparatively primitive &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, so it was postponed until late 1984. More recent research into the code of both games has suggested this may have been an exaggeration as the coding routines found in &quot;Knight Lore&quot; are far more optimised.

Ultimate won the Golden Joystick Award for Best Software House in both 1983 and 1984.

Ultimate was criticised somewhat in the gaming media for their repeated use of the Filmation technique in subsequent games &quot;Alien 8&quot;, &quot;Nightshade&quot;, &quot;Gunfright&quot; and &quot;Pentagram&quot;, though &quot;Nightshade&quot; and &quot;Gunfright&quot; used Filmation II, a variation on the engine, resulting in a similar visual style, but significantly different gameplay, with scrolling around a large world and arcade-like play, rather than the room-based puzzles of the earlier Filmation titles.

===Decline===
With the consistent success of Ultimate&#x27;s releases there were rumours of a buyout by Ocean, until it was announced in 1985 that the Stamper brothers had sold a minority stake in the company to US Gold, who would continue to release games under the Ultimate label. Later titles such as &quot;Martianoids&quot; and &quot;Bubbler&quot; were not seen by the gaming press as being up to Ultimate&#x27;s previously high standards and sales fell. US Gold released no new Ultimate games after &quot;Bubbler&quot; in 1987. A final Sabreman game, &quot;Mire Mare&quot;, was trailed in earlier Sabreman games and was mentioned by &quot;Sinclair User&quot; as being next up for release, but was quietly dropped during development. In late 1988, Rare bought back the rights sold to US Gold and were reported to be developing games again. Future releases were to have included &quot;Solar Jetman&quot;, which would eventually appear only on the Nintendo Entertainment System, although home computer conversions for the Commodore 64, Amiga, and Atari ST were completed by Storm Software, but not released.

===Rare Limited===
Shortly before the US Gold buyout, the name of another company, &quot;Rare Limited&quot;, began appearing on the credits of Ultimate releases. This was in fact another company set up by the Stampers to develop for Ultimate, but not be subject to any Ultimate takeover. Rare (initially under the banner &quot;Rare: Designs on the Future&quot;) would evolve, after Ultimate&#x27;s demise, into a prolific developer for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This led Nintendo to purchase a stake in the company, whose success was furthered with such classic SNES and Nintendo 64 releases as &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. In 2002 Rare was purchased outright by Microsoft for US$377 million, a record fee for a video game developer, and currently develops games for the Xbox One console. At the end of 2006 Tim and Chris Stamper left Rare to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot;, ending a 24-year involvement in developing home video games.

===The Ultimate name in subsequent years===
The 1997 Nintendo 64 game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; contains a ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Ultimate-developed games hidden on the cartridge. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare and was deactivated in the final version, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches. In 2004, Rare revived Ultimate&#x27;s Sabreman franchise with the release of &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. A new version of &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; for the Xbox was also rumoured, though it was never released or even officially announced. A racing game based on the Ultimate/Rare universe titled &quot;Sabreman Stampede&quot; was also in development, but was canceled. In 2007, Rare released the fourth game of the &quot;Jetman&quot; series, &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;, for Xbox Live Arcade.

On 8 December 2006 and 16 January 2007 respectively, Rare&#x27;s owners Microsoft Corporation filed US and EU trademark claims on the Ultimate Play the Game name and logo. The registered purpose is &quot;entertainment services, namely, providing an on-line computer game&quot;. Emulated versions of seven Ultimate titles were later included as part of the 2015 game compilation &quot;Rare Replay&quot; for Xbox One.

==Relationship with the press and fans==
===Press===

Ultimate had a reputation for secrecy that has continued to a lesser extent with successor Rare. Due to the small number of staff employed at Ultimate in the early days, the company had no time to speak to the press or attend trade events. The British computer gaming press even complained over how difficult it was to get hold of them. As Tim Stamper later said:
This press blackout soon worked to the company&#x27;s advantage. Due to their reputation for producing high quality products, along with speculation in the press and amongst gamers, anticipation for each release was high. This was helped along by the full-page advertisements placed in magazines showing the cover art of the game in question, but no shots or description of the game itself. These ads would be run prior to and for several months after the release date. The magazines were not able to preview the games; the review copies, usually sent out just before general release, would be the first opportunity for anyone to see them. Not talking to the press worked for Ultimate and it soon became policy. When a journalist reviewing &quot;Nightshade&quot; for &quot;CRASH&quot; magazine asked Ultimate what the object of the game was, and how large the play area was, they responded with, respectively, &quot;oh, we can&#x27;t tell you that&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s pretty large&quot;.

====Lunar Jetman&#x27;s trailer====
This air of mystery was increased when &quot;CRASH&quot; magazine published a reader&#x27;s photograph of &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot; featuring Jetman&#x27;s moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible existence of a trailer (as depicted on the game&#x27;s cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game&#x27;s release, and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it. The Stampers shrugged off questions about whether this screen shot was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot;″s code does not contain graphics for a trailer.

===Fans===
Ultimate were one of the first developers to have their own fanbase focused on the company and brand as much as the games themselves. They received so much fan mail at their peak that a full-time employee had to be taken on to deal with up to 60 letters per day. They were known for their positive attitude to fans, always replying to letters and responding to requests for merchandise by sending posters, sweatshirts and caps free of charge. The Stampers later stated that they were more interested in creating the games than making money from merchandising. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; has suggested that besides the quality of the games, Ultimate&#x27;s popularity arose from a combination of &quot;superb presentation&quot; as well as the company&#x27;s &quot;air of mystique&quot; giving it a &quot;secretive yet cool vibe&quot;.

==Other platforms==
The main series of games produced by Ultimate were all released on the ZX Spectrum, with most from &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; onward also on the Amstrad CPC and MSX, and most early games up to and including &quot;Nightshade&quot; also on the BBC Micro. Only three of these (&quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, &quot;Underwurlde&quot; and &quot;Nightshade&quot;) were released on the other major platform of the time, the Commodore 64, however a series of C64-exclusive titles were published by Ultimate:

:* &quot;The Staff of Karnath&quot; (1984)
:* &quot;Entombed&quot; (1985)
:* &quot;Imhotep&quot; (1985)
:* &quot;Blackwyche&quot; (1985)
:* &quot;Outlaws&quot; (1985)
:* &quot;Dragon Skulle&quot; (1985)

&quot;The Staff of Karnath&quot;, &quot;Entombed&quot;, &quot;Blackwyche&quot; and &quot;Dragon Skulle&quot; all concern the adventures of Sir Arthur Pendragon.

==Authorship==
The company&#x27;s secretive tendencies also extended to the question of who wrote the games. Whereas most games of the time would list those responsible on the cassette inlay cards or even on the front of the box (one notable example, &quot;Football Manager&quot;, even going as far as to feature a picture of author Kevin Toms on the front of the box), no Ultimate title ever mentioned any names at all, and the authorship of some of them remains unclear.

The Ultimate titles up to &quot;Gunfright&quot; were produced primarily by Tim and Chris Stamper; Tim provided the graphics and Chris the programming, along with fellow founders John Lathbury (coding) and Carol Ward (graphic design). Tim also created the cover art for the games, including the famous Ultimate Play the Game logo. The Stampers retained the major creative roles until the purchase by US Gold, who brought in their own programming teams to create &quot;Martianoids&quot; and &quot;Bubbler&quot;. The exact authorship of &quot;Pentagram&quot; and &quot;Cyberun&quot; is known only to those involved; often considered US Gold games, they are both possibly Stamper games. This remains a possibility as although Chris Stamper has said in an interview, &quot;What was the last one we developed as a team? It was &quot;Gunfright&quot;, I think&quot;, Ultimate had already admitted to developing games in an order different from that of their release, as with &quot;Knight Lore&quot; and &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;.

The authorship of the Commodore 64 titles was at the time even more uncertain. The conversions of existing Spectrum games &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, &quot;Underwurlde&quot; and &quot;Nightshade&quot; were handled by Firebird, who hired Mr Micro, Softstone, and PSI, respectively, to develop the titles. &quot;Imhotep&quot; was submitted to Ultimate in a virtually complete form by author Manuel Caballero, who had previously written &quot;Batty Builders&quot; and &quot;Firefleet&quot;. Ultimate did not make any announcements regarding the authorship of the other Commodore games, but an article by Martyn Carroll revealed how Frank Gasking of &quot;Games that weren&#x27;t 64&quot; managed to identify the creators as Dave and Robert (Bob) Thomas based on a message that appears on the final screen of &quot;Dragon Skulle&quot;. These two brothers were also the creators of the previous three games of the series &quot;The Staff of Karnath&quot;, &quot;Entombed&quot; and &quot;Blackwyche&quot;. In an interview with the brothers in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine, they revealed they also authored &quot;Outlaws&quot;, in just six weeks, so Ultimate would have something for the Commodore 64 for Christmas.

<text>Erik of Pomerania ( 1381/1382 – 24 September 1459) ruled over the Kalmar Union from 1396 until 1439. He was initially co-ruler with his great-aunt Margaret I until her death in 1412. Erik is known as Erik III as King of Norway (1389–1442), Erik VII as King of Denmark (1396–1439) and has been called Erik XIII as King of Sweden (1396–1434, 1436–39). Erik was ultimately deposed from all three kingdoms of the union, but in 1449 he inherited one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania and ruled it as duke until his death in 1459. His epithet &quot;of Pomerania&quot; was a pejorative intended to insinuate that he did not belong in Scandinavia.

==Succession background==

Erik was born in either 1381 or 1382 in Darłowo (formerly Rügenwalde), Pomerania, Poland. Named Bogusław (Bogislaw) at birth, he was the son of Wartislaw VII, Duke of Pomerania, and Maria of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Bogislaw&#x27;s great-aunt Margaret I, who ruled the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, wanted her realm to be unified and peaceful, and so made provisions in the event of her death. She chose Bogislaw as her heir and successor.

In 1389, Bogislaw was brought to Denmark to be raised by Queen Margaret. His name was changed to the more Nordic-sounding &quot;Erik&quot;. On 8 September 1389, he was hailed as King of Norway at the Ting in Trondheim. He may have been crowned King of Norway in Oslo in 1392, but this is disputed.

Erik&#x27;s father Wartislaw died between November 1394 and 23 February 1395. When Wartislaw died, his thrones were all attained by Erik as the heir.

In 1396, Erik was proclaimed as king in Denmark and then in Sweden. On 17 June 1397, he was crowned king of the three Nordic countries in the cathedral of Kalmar. At the same time, a union treaty was drafted, declaring the establishment of what has become known as the Kalmar Union. Queen Margaret, however, remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the three kingdoms until her death in 1412.

==Marriage==

In 1402, Queen Margaret entered into negotiations with King Henry IV of England about the possibility of an alliance between the Kingdom of England and the Nordic union. The proposal was for a double wedding, whereby, King Erik would marry King Henry&#x27;s second daughter, Philippa of England, and Henry IV&#x27;s heir Henry, Prince of Wales, would marry Erik&#x27;s sister, Catherine of Pomerania (c. 1390–1426).

The double wedding did not come off, but Erik&#x27;s wedding to Philippa of England was successfully negotiated. On 26 October 1406, he married the 12-year-old Philippa in Lund. The wedding was accompanied by a purely defensive alliance with England. After Philippa&#x27;s death later in 1430, Erik replaced her with her former lady-in-waiting, Cecilia, who became his royal mistress and later his morganatic spouse. The relationship was a public scandal and is mentioned in the royal council&#x27;s official complaints about the King.

==Reign==


During the early period of his reign, King Erik made Copenhagen a royal possession in 1417, thereby assuring its status as the capital of Denmark. He also usurped the rights of Copenhagen Castle from the Bishop of Roskilde, and from then on, the castle was occupied by him.

From contemporary sources, Erik appears as intelligent, visionary, energetic, and a firm character. That he was also a charming and well-spoken man of the world was shown by his great European tour of the 1420s. Negatively, he seems to have had a hot temper, a lack of diplomatic sense, and an obstinacy that bordered on mulishness. Erik was described by the future Pope Pius II as having &quot;a beautiful body, reddish yellow hair, a ruddy face, and a long narrow neck … alone, without assistance, and without touching the stirrups, he jumped upon a horse, and all women were drawn to him, especially the Empress, in a feeling of longing for love&quot;.

From 1423 until May 1425, Erik went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After arriving there, he was dubbed Knight of the Holy Sepulchre by the Franciscan Custos of the Holy Land, and subsequently himself dubbed his pilgrim fellows, among them, Ivan Anz Frankopan. During his absence, Queen Philippa served as regent of the three kingdoms from Copenhagen.

Almost the whole of Erik&#x27;s sole rule was affected by his long-standing conflict with the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein. He tried to regain South Jutland (Schleswig) which Queen Margaret had been winning, but he chose a policy of warfare instead of negotiations. The result was a devastating war that not only ended without conquests, but also led to the loss of the South Jutlandic areas that he had already obtained. During this war, he showed much energy and steadiness, but also a remarkable lack of adroitness. In 1424, a verdict of the Holy Roman Empire by Sigismund, King of Germany, recognising Erik as the legal ruler of South Jutland, was ignored by the Holsteiners. The long war was a strain on the Danish economy as well as on the unity of the north.

Perhaps Erik&#x27;s most far-ranging act was the introduction of the Sound Dues (&quot;Øresundtolden&quot;) in 1429, which was to last until 1857. It consisted of the payment of sound dues by all ships wishing to enter or leave the Baltic Sea passing through the Sound. To help enforce his demands, Erik built Krogen, a powerful fortress at the narrowest point in the Sound, in the early 1400s. This resulted in the control of all navigation through the Sound, and thus secured a large stable income for his kingdom that made it relatively rich, and which made the town of Elsinore flower. It showed his interest in Danish trade and naval power, but also permanently challenged the other Baltic powers, especially the Hanseatic cities against which he also fought. From 1426 to 1435, he was at war with the German Hanseatic League and Holstein. When the Hanseats and Holsteiners attacked Copenhagen in 1428, King Erik was absent from the city at Sorø Abbey and did not return, so Queen Philippa managed the defense of the capital.

During the 1430s, the King&#x27;s policy fell apart. In 1434, the farmers and mine workers of Sweden began a national and social rebellion which was soon used by the Swedish nobility in order to weaken the power of the King. The Engelbrekt rebellion (1434–1436) was led by Swedish nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson (c. 1390 – 4 May 1436). The Swedes had been affected by the war with the Hanseatic League (1426–35) which affected trade and disturbed Swedish exports with Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania. The rebellion caused erosion within the unity of the Kalmar Union, leading to the temporary expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden. In Norway, a subsequent rebellion in 1436 was led by Amund Sigurdsson Bolt (1400–1465). It resulted in a siege of Oslo and Akershus Castle but ended in a ceasefire. In 1438 a new rebellion led by Hallvard Graatop errupted, in Eastern Norway, but this rebellion was also put down.

Erik had to yield to the demands of both the Holsteiners and the Hanseatic League. In April 1435, he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein. Under the terms of the peace agreement, Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues and the Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein.

==Coup d&#x27;état==
When the Danish nobility subsequently opposed his rule and refused to ratify his choice of Bogislaw IX, Duke of Pomerania as the next king of Denmark, Erik left Denmark in response and took up permanent residence at Visborg Castle in Gotland, which led to his deposition through coup d&#x27;état by the National Councils of Denmark and Sweden in 1439.

In 1440, Erik was succeeded by his nephew Christopher of Bavaria, who was chosen for the thrones of both Denmark and Sweden. Initially the Norwegian Riksråd remained loyal to Erik and wanted him to remain king of Norway. In September 1439, Erik had given Sigurd Jonsson the title of &quot;drottsete&quot;, under which he was to rule Norway in the King&#x27;s name. But with the King isolated in Gotland, the Norwegian nobility also felt compelled to depose Erik through a coup d&#x27;état in 1440, and he was formally deposed in 1442, when Sigurd Jonsson stepped down as &quot;drottsete&quot;, and Christopher was elected king.

At the death of King Christopher in 1448, the next monarch was Erik&#x27;s kinsman, Christian of Oldenburg (the son of Erik&#x27;s earlier rival, Count Theodoric of Oldenburg), who succeeded to the throne of Denmark, while Karl Knutsson Bonde succeeded to the throne of Sweden. A rivalry ensued between Karl and Christian for the throne of Norway. In 1450, Karl was forced to relinquish the throne of Norway in favour of King Christian.

==Duke of Pomerania==
For ten years, Erik lived in Gotland where he fought against the merchant trade in the Baltic. 
From 1449 to 1459, Erik succeeded Bogislaw IX as Duke of Pomerania and ruled Pomerania-Rügenwalde, a small partition of the Duchy of Pomerania-Stolp (Polish: Księstwo Słupskie), as &quot;Erik I&quot;. He died in 1459 at Darłowo Castle
(German: &quot;Schloss Rügenwalde&quot;), and was buried in the Church of St. Mary&#x27;s at Darłowo in Pomerania.

The Burgermeister of Kiel to King Christian III of Denmark wrote that Erik encouraged a joint expedition by Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst to investigate the Northwest Passage. Their voyage after Erik&#x27;s death is alleged to have reached Greenland and engaged in combat with the Inuit.

==Titles and styles==
Erik&#x27;s full title was: &quot;King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Pomerania&quot;.

<text>Roman à clef (, ) (French for &quot;novel with a key&quot;) is a novel about real-life events that is overlaid with a façade of fiction. The fictitious names in the novel represent real people and the &quot;key&quot; is the relationship between the non-fiction and the fiction. This metaphorical key may be produced separately—typically as an explicit guide to the text by the author—or implied, through the use of epigraphs or other literary techniques.

Madeleine de Scudéry created the &quot;roman à clef&quot; in the 17th century to provide a forum for her thinly veiled fiction featuring political and public figures. An author might choose the &quot;roman à clef&quot; as a means of satire, of writing about controversial topics, reporting inside information on scandals without giving rise to charges of libel, the opportunity to turn the tale the way the author would like it to have gone, the opportunity to portray autobiographical experiences without having to expose the author as the subject, avoiding incrimination that could be used as evidence in civil, criminal or disciplinary proceeding, the ability to change the background and personalities of key participants and the settling of scores.

Biographically inspired works have also appeared in other literary genres and art forms, notably the .

<doc id="168729" wikidata="Q3576797" url="?curid=168729" title="The Pursuit of Love">
<text>The Pursuit of Love is a novel by Nancy Mitford, first published in 1945. It is the first in a trilogy about an upper-class English family in the interwar period focusing on the romantic life of Linda Radlett, as narrated by her cousin, Fanny Logan. Although a comedy, the story has tragic overtones.

The book was an immediate best-seller and sold 200,000 copies within a year of publication.

Mitford wrote two sequels to the novel, &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (1949) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot; (1960). Her penultimate novel, &quot;The Blessing&quot; (1951), also makes references to &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and characters from &quot;The Blessing&quot; later appear in &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The narrator is Fanny, whose mother (called the &quot;Bolter&quot; for her habit of serial monogamy) and father have left her to be brought up by her aunt Emily and the Davey, whom Emily marries early in the novel. Fanny also spends holidays with her uncle, Matthew Radlett, her aunt, Sadie and numerous cousins at Alconleigh. Linda, the second Radlett daughter, is Fanny&#x27;s best friend and the main character of the novel. The early chapters recount the Radlett children&#x27;s bizarre upbringing, including their contrasting obsessions with hunting and preventing cruelty to animals, and the activities of their secret society, the &quot;Hons&quot;. The Radlett daughters receive little in the way of formal education, and as Linda grows older she is increasingly consumed by a desire for romantic love and marriage.

Louisa, the eldest Radlett child, makes her début and quickly becomes engaged to John Fort William, a Scottish peer more than twenty years her senior. Linda finds Lord Fort William an unromantic choice of husband, but is deeply jealous that Louisa is getting married. Linda becomes bored and depressed, awaiting her own coming-out party. During this time she makes friends with Lord Merlin, a neighbouring landlord who is a wealthy, charming aesthete with many fashionable friends. Merlin brings Tony Kroesig, heir to a wealthy banking family, as a last-minute guest to Linda&#x27;s coming-out ball. Linda falls in love with Tony, but their relationship is rocky from the start. Linda&#x27;s father Matthew disapproves of Tony&#x27;s German ancestry (he believes that all foreigners are fiends) and is furious when Linda and Fanny sneak away to Oxford to have luncheon with Tony. Linda and Tony eventually marry despite the strong disapproval of their families.

Linda very quickly realises that she has made a serious mistake, but she keeps up a pretence of having a happy marriage. Linda and Tony have one child, Moira, to whom Linda takes an instant dislike. Linda almost dies during Moira&#x27;s birth, and her doctors strongly advise her to have no more children. Moira is soon abandoned to the care of her paternal grandparents. During this time, Fanny marries a young man called Alfred and begins a family of her own; she therefore sees Linda less frequently.

After nine years of marriage, Linda leaves Tony for Christian Talbot, an ardent Communist. Christian is kind but vague, and ultimately uninterested in individuals, preferring to focus on the plight of the working class. Linda&#x27;s divorce and remarriage cause a rift between her and her parents, but after some months they reconcile. Linda and Christian go to France to work with Spanish refugees in Perpignan during the Spanish Civil War, where they meet Linda&#x27;s old friend Lavender Davis, an efficient young woman also volunteering to help the refugees. Linda realises that Christian and Lavender are falling in love with one another and that they would be a better pairing. Linda decides to leave Christian and leave France.

On the way back to England, Linda runs out of money in Paris and meets Fabrice de Sauveterre, a wealthy French duke. Linda becomes his mistress and lives with him in Paris for eleven months. During this time she cultivates a great interest in clothes, which Fabrice encourages and finances, but most of her happiness is the result of the fact that she has finally found the love of her life. When World War II breaks out, Fabrice persuades Linda to return to England alone, for he has work to do in the French Resistance. During the war, he is able to visit Linda in England once. She becomes pregnant.

Meanwhile, for safety during the London Blitz, Fanny, Louisa and their children are living at Alconleigh, along with Matthew, Sadie, Emily, Davey, the &quot;Bolter&quot; and her new lover Juan (whom Matthew calls &quot;Gewan&quot;). When Linda&#x27;s house in London is bombed, she also goes to stay at Alconleigh. The Bolter sees Linda as a younger version of herself, which Linda resents, because she is certain that she has found the love of her life in Fabrice and will not run off from any more husbands. Fanny is also expecting a baby, and she and Linda give birth to their sons on the same day. Linda dies in childbirth, as the doctors had warned; around this same time, Fabrice is killed in the war. Fanny and her husband adopt Linda&#x27;s child and name him Fabrice.

==Adaptations==
In 1980 &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; were adapted into an eight part miniseries by ITV under the title &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;.

A second adaptation of &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; by the BBC and WGBH Boston was released in 2001 as the two-part drama &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;. Tom Hooper directed the screenplay adapted by Deborah Moggach from the novels.

In 2019 the BBC announced plans for another adaptation, &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; directed by Emily Mortimer and starring Lily James and Emily Beecham. The miniseries began filming in 2020; it was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and premiered on BBC One in May 2021.

In 2022 India Knight published the novel &quot;Darling&quot;, an updating of The Pursuit of Love set in modern times featuring many of the same characters.

<doc id="168730" wikidata="Q239074" url="?curid=168730" title="Sepultura">
<text>Sepultura (, &quot;grave&quot;) is a Brazilian heavy metal band formed in Belo Horizonte in 1984 by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera. They were a major force in the groove metal, thrash metal, and death metal genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their later experiments drawing influence from alternative metal, world music, nu metal, hardcore punk and industrial metal. Sepultura is also considered part of the second wave of thrash metal acts from the late 1980s to early-to-mid-1990s.

Sepultura has released fifteen studio albums to date. The band released their debut album &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; in 1986, followed a year later by their second album &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;; the latter caught the attention of several record labels, including Roadrunner Records, with whom Sepultura signed in 1988. Their third album, and Roadrunner debut, &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; (1989) garnered the band its first breakthrough outside of Brazil. The next three albums—&quot;Arise&quot; (1991), &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; (1993) and &quot;Roots&quot; (1996)—cemented Sepultura&#x27;s reputation as one of the most successful heavy metal bands of the 1990s. The band has sold over three million units in the United States and almost 20 million worldwide, gaining multiple gold and platinum records around the globe, including in countries as diverse as France, Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Cyprus, and their native Brazil.

Sepultura has undergone several membership changes throughout its -year career, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Their &quot;classic&quot; lineup, which lasted for nearly a decade, consisted of Max, Igor, bassist Paulo Jr. and guitarist Andreas Kisser. Since Igor&#x27;s departure in 2006, there have been no original members left in the band. Although Paulo Jr. joined Sepultura shortly after its formation in late 1984 and is the longest serving member, he did not perform on any of the band&#x27;s studio albums until &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;. Kisser, who replaced onetime guitarist Jairo Guedz, has appeared on every Sepultura album since &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;; he also recorded bass guitar until &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;. Their current lineup consists of Paulo Jr., Kisser, singer Derrick Green (who replaced Max in 1997), and drummer Greyson Nekrutman. In March 2024, after four decades together, the band began what has been announced as a year-and-a-half-long farewell tour, after which they will disband.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot; and &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; (1984–1986)===
Sepultura was formed in 1984 in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais. The band was founded by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera, the impoverished sons of Vânia, a model, and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian diplomat whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial ruin. Graciliano&#x27;s death deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Vol. 4&quot; the very same day. They chose the band name Sepultura, the Portuguese word for &quot;grave&quot;, when Max translated the lyrics of the Motörhead song &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;. The brothers were previously in a covers band.

The brothers&#x27; early influences included Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, and heavy metal and hard rock artists of the late 1970s/early 1980s, such as Van Halen, Iron Maiden, Motörhead, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and V8, as well as hardcore punk bands Terveet Kädet, Rattus, and Discharge. They would travel to a record shop in São Paulo that mixed tapes of then-latest records by American bands. Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to Venom. As Igor Cavalera put it:

The Cavalera brothers started listening to more extreme metal bands at the time such as Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Kreator, Sodom, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, and Exciter. They also had influences on Brazilian metal from bands like Stress, Sagrado Inferno, and Dorsal Atlântica. By 1984, they had dropped out of school. After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, lead vocalist Wagner Lamounier, and bassist Paulo Jr. Lamounier departed in March 1985 after disagreements with the band and went on to become the leader of the pioneering Brazilian black metal band Sarcófago. After his departure, Max took over the vocal duties and Jairo Guedz was invited to join the band as lead guitarist.

After a year of performing, Sepultura was signed to Cogumelo Records in 1985. Later that year, they released &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;, a split EP with fellow Brazilian band Overdose. It was recorded and self-produced in just two days. The band recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Morbid Visions&quot;, in August 1986. It contained their first hit, &quot;Troops of Doom&quot;, which gained some media attention. The band then decided to relocate to the larger city of São Paulo.

===&quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; and &quot;Arise&quot; (1987–1992)===

In early 1987, Guedz quit the band. He was replaced by São Paulo-based guitarist Andreas Kisser, and they released their second studio album, &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, in October of that year. The album reflected a stylistic change towards a more thrash metal-oriented sound while retaining the death metal elements of &quot;Morbid Visions&quot;. &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; displayed improved production and performance, and became a minor critical sensation across Europe and America as a much sought-after import. The band sent tapes to the United States that made radio playlists during a time when they were struggling to book gigs because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style. Sepultura gained attention from Roadrunner Records, who signed them in the spring of 1988 and released &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; internationally before seeing the band perform in person. About the deal with Roadrunner, Max Cavalera recalled to &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, &quot;We were finally going to get a real label, real producer, real studio. Things were happening...and it was up to us to write the best material possible. And I think that charged everybody up and we went into the jam room with an attitude of let&#x27;s not fuck around. This is our shot. You only get so many shots in this life, and you gotta make it count.&quot;

During a May 2018 interview with teenyrockers.com, Kisser noted that Sepultura would not have been possible without family support, not only from his own family, but also from the families of Max and Igor, and Paulo Jr.

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;, was released in April 1989. The album was recorded towards the end of 1988 in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro while the band communicated through translators with American producer Scott Burns. It was an immediate success and became known in thrash metal circles as a classic on the order of Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. It was hailed by &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums, as well as gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records. AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time.&quot; A long European and American tour furthered the band&#x27;s reputation, despite the fact that they were still very limited English speakers. Sepultura&#x27;s first live dates outside of Brazil included opening for Sodom on their &quot;Agent Orange&quot; tour in Europe; following this was Sepultura&#x27;s first U.S. show, which was held on October 31, 1989 at the Ritz in New York City, opening for King Diamond. The band filmed its first video for the song &quot;Inner Self&quot;, which received considerable airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, giving Sepultura their first exposure in North America. Touring in support of &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; continued throughout most of 1990, including three shows in Brazil with Napalm Death, European dates with Mordred and a North American tour with Obituary and Sadus.

In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the Rock in Rio II festival. The band relocated from their native Brazil to Phoenix, Arizona in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded their fourth studio album &quot;Arise&quot; at Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida. By the time the album was released in March 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single &quot;Dead Embryonic Cells&quot; was a success, and the title track gained additional attention when its video was banned in America by MTV due to its apocalyptic religious imagery; it did, however, get some airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; as did the music videos for &quot;Dead Embryonic Cells&quot; and &quot;Desperate Cry&quot;. &quot;Arise&quot; was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching No. 119.

Sepultura toured relentlessly throughout 1991 and 1992 in support of &quot;Arise&quot;; its touring cycle began in May 1991 with a European trek with Sacred Reich and Heathen, followed by the New Titans on the Bloc tour in North America that included support from Sacred Reich, Napalm Death and Sick of It All. They also played with several other bands, including Slayer, Testament, Motörhead, Kreator, White Zombie, Type O Negative and Fudge Tunnel, and alongside Alice in Chains, Sepultura supported Ozzy Osbourne on the latter&#x27;s tour for &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Max Cavalera married the band&#x27;s manager Gloria Bujnowski during this period. The &quot;Arise&quot; tour concluded in December 1992 with a North American tour, where the band (along with Helmet) supported Ministry on their &quot;Psalm 69&quot; tour.

===&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, Nailbomb and &quot;Roots&quot; (1993–1996)===
Sepultura&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, was released in September 1993. Supported by the singles &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot;, &quot;Territory&quot; and &quot;Slave New World&quot;, this was their only album to be released in North America by Epic Records, and the first of two albums by Sepultura to be certified gold by RIAA. It saw a departure from their death metal style, adding influences of groove metal, industrial and hardcore punk. While &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; is not a death metal album, it does include elements of thrash metal music. AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and wrote that, &quot;&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; ranks as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.&quot; The band supported the album by embarking on a year-long tour, starting with a headlining European run with Paradise Lost, followed by a North American tour with Fudge Tunnel, Fear Factory and Clutch. They were also one of the supporting acts (along with Biohazard and Prong) for Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; tour in North America, and then opened for the Ramones in South America and toured Australia and New Zealand with Sacred Reich. By the time the &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; tour ended in November 1994, Sepultura was one of the most successful heavy metal bands of the day.

Also in 1994, Max and Igor collaborated with Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel to form Nailbomb. They released an even more industrial-oriented album, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, the same year. The group performed its only proper gig for nearly two decades at Dynamo Open Air in 1995, and the performance was released as &quot;Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide&quot;. Nailbomb was disbanded shortly afterward.

Sepultura&#x27;s sound change continued with their sixth album, &quot;Roots&quot;, which was released in 1996. On this album, the band experimented with elements of the music of Brazil&#x27;s indigenous peoples, and adopted a slower, down-tuned sound. The album was hailed as a modern-day heavy metal classic and a major influence on the then-nascent nu metal scene. AllMusic gave it a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;&quot;Roots&quot; consolidates Sepultura&#x27;s position as perhaps the most distinctive, original heavy metal band of the 1990s.&quot; Also in 1996, Sepultura performed &quot;War (Guerra)&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

===Departure of Max Cavalera, Derrick Green joins and &quot;Against&quot; (1996–2000)===
In August 1996, Sepultura played on the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock main stage alongside Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, Biohazard, and Fear Factory. The band was suddenly a three-piece with Andreas Kisser taking over on lead vocals after Max Cavalera left the concert site earlier in the day upon learning of the death of his stepson Dana Wells in a car accident. After Wells&#x27; funeral was finished, Max returned and continued to tour with Sepultura. A few months after Wells&#x27; death, the band had a meeting with Max and said that they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was Max&#x27;s wife and Dana&#x27;s mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was giving preferential treatment to Max while neglecting the rest of the band. Max, who was still coming to terms with the death of Wells, felt betrayed by his bandmates for wanting to get rid of Bujnowski and abruptly quit the band. Max Cavalera&#x27;s final performance with Sepultura was at the Brixton Academy in England on December 16, 1996. 


Following Max Cavalera&#x27;s departure, the remaining members of Sepultura remained a three-piece for eight months and worked on new material, with Kisser handling vocals. In November 1997, the band announced that they were actively searching for a new vocalist. Among those who auditioned were Chuck Billy of Testament, Phil Demmel of Machine Head and Vio-lence, Marc Grewe of Morgoth, Jorge Rosado of Merauder, and a then-unknown Jason &quot;Gong&quot; Jones. American musician Derrick Green (from Cleveland, Ohio) was selected as the band&#x27;s new frontman. Sepultura played their first show with Green to a handful of their fan club members at their rehearsal space in Brazil in February 1998. The band played their first public show under the pseudonym &quot;Troops of Doom&quot; on July 8, 1998, at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, where they were supported by Human Waste Project (the band&#x27;s last show at the time), Tura Satana and Spineshank. The first album with the new line-up was &quot;Against&quot;, which was released in 1998. The album was critically and commercially less successful than previous albums and sold considerably fewer copies than the self-titled debut album by Max Cavalera&#x27;s then-new band Soulfly. In a retrospective review AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that &quot;there are enough flashes of the old Sepultura brilliance to suggest that great things are still to come.&quot;

===&quot;Nation&quot; and &quot;Roorback&quot; (2001–2005)===
Sepultura&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Nation&quot; (2001), sold poorly. It would be their last studio album with Roadrunner Records. AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he&#x27;s singing about more than just &#x27;one nation, Sepulnation&#x27;; he&#x27;s suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for.&quot; In an interview, Derrick Green said that, &quot;Every song will be related to the idea of building this nation. We will have our own flags, our own anthem.&quot; A recording of Max Cavalera&#x27;s last live show with Sepultura, titled &quot;Under a Pale Grey Sky&quot;, was released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records.

After recording an EP of covers, &quot;Revolusongs&quot; (2002), the band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Roorback&quot;, in 2003. Despite receiving greater critical acclaim than its predecessors, sales remained low. It was their first album with SPV Records. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003&#x27;s excellent &quot;Roorback&quot; should put them to rest for good. Green is passionate and focused throughout the album — he has no problem going that extra mile — and the writing is consistently strong.&quot; In 2005, the band played in Dubai for the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival. In November of that year, a live double DVD/double CD package, &quot;Live in São Paulo&quot;, was released. This was the first official live album from the band.

===&quot;Dante XXI&quot;, departure of Igor Cavalera, and &quot;A-Lex&quot; (2006–2010)===

Sepultura&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Dante XXI&quot;, was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Convicted in Life&quot; and &quot;Ostia&quot;. AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, &quot;Overall, &quot;Dante XXI&quot; is easily one of Sepultura&#x27;s strongest releases to feature Green on vocals.&quot;

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom had recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited lineup would play on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. However, this was denied by Kisser and the reunion did not occur. Instead, Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of &quot;Dante XXI&quot; and was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella, leaving the band without any of its original members. After leaving Sepultura, Igor and Max formed Cavalera Conspiracy.

The band was one of the featured musical guests at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 on November 13. They performed a cover of &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;ve Lost You&quot; from the album &quot;A-Lex&quot;. The 9th annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas and aired on Univision. Sepultura also appeared in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen motors commercial that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that &quot;it&#x27;s the first time you&#x27;ve seen Sepultura like this. And a Sedan like this one too&quot;. The Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, as opposed to its heavy metal style, to say that &quot;you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage.&quot;

Sepultura released the album &quot;A-Lex&quot; on January 26, 2009. This was the first Sepultura album to include neither of the Cavalera brothers, with bassist Paulo Jr. as the sole remaining member from the band&#x27;s debut album. &quot;A-Lex&quot; is a concept album based on the book &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The album was recorded at Trama Studios in São Paulo, Brazil, with producer Stanley Soares. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;Personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years – and that vitality is alive and well on the superb A-Lex.&quot; In the same year Andreas Kisser contributed his recipe for &quot;Churrasco in Soy Sauce&quot; to &quot;Hellbent for Cooking: The Heavy Metal Cookbook&quot;, stating in the recipe that he prefers his meat &quot;medium-rare&quot;. Sepultura supported Metallica on January 30 and 31, 2010, at Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil. The two concerts were attended by 100,000 people. The band filmed a concert DVD in 2010. Sepultura played at Kucukciftlik Park, Istanbul, on April 27, 2010. On August 8, 2010, visited the UK to play at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone.

===&quot;Kairos&quot; and &quot;The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart&quot; (2010–2015)===

On July 6, 2010, it was announced that Sepultura were signed with Nuclear Blast Records, and would release their first album for the label in 2011. The band confirmed that there would be no reunion of the classic lineup. By the end of 2010, the band began writing new material and entered the studio to begin recording their 12th album with producer Roy Z (Judas Priest, Halford, Iron Maiden&#x27;s Bruce Dickinson, Helloween and Andre Matos). On March 1, 2011, Sepultura had completed recording the album, entitled &quot;Kairos&quot;, which was released in June 2011.

The album includes cover versions of Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Just One Fix&quot; and The Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;Firestarter&quot;, both of which are available as bonus tracks on various special-edition releases. Sepultura played on the Kairos World Tour and at Wacken Open Air 2011. Drummer Jean Dolabella left the band and was replaced by then-20-year-old Eloy Casagrande in November 2011, who had previously played in Brazilian heavy metal singer Andre Matos&#x27; solo band and in the Brazilian post-hardcore band Gloria. In November and December 2011, Sepultura participated the Thrashfest Classics tour alongside thrash metal bands like Exodus, Destruction, Heathen and Mortal Sin.

In May 2012, guitarist Andreas Kisser told Metal Underground that Sepultura would soon &quot;start working on something new with Eloy&quot; and see if they could &quot;get ready for new music early next year&quot;. In an interview at England&#x27;s Bloodstock Open Air on August 10, 2012, Kisser revealed that Sepultura would be filming a live DVD with the French percussive group Les Tambours du Bronx. He also revealed that the band was &quot;already thinking about new ideas&quot; for their next album and would &quot;have something new going on&quot; in 2013.

On December 10, 2012, producer Ross Robinson, who produced Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; album, tweeted: &quot;Oh, didn&#x27;t mention.. Spoke to Andreas, it&#x27;s on. My vision, smoke &quot;Roots&quot;&quot;, suggesting he would be producing the band&#x27;s next album. This was later confirmed, as well as an announcement that the album would be co-produced by Steve Evetts. Former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo made a guest appearance on the album.

On January 25, 2013, it was announced that author Jason Korolenko was working on &quot;Relentless – 30 Years of Sepultura&quot;, which is described in a press release as &quot;the only book-length biography to cover the band&#x27;s entire 30-year career.&quot; &quot;Relentless&quot; was published on October 8, 2014, in Poland under the title &quot;Brazylijska Furia,&quot; and the English language edition was published via Rocket 88 on December 4, 2014. The Brazilian edition, titled &quot;Relentless – 30 Anos de Sepultura&quot;, was scheduled for publication via Benvira in early 2015. The French language edition of &quot;Relentless&quot; was published in France on October 19, 2015.

On July 19, 2013, it was revealed that the title of the band&#x27;s thirteenth album was &quot;The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart&quot;. In September 2013, they performed at Rock in Rio with Brazilian rock/MPB artist Zé Ramalho – this line-up was named &quot;Zépultura&quot;, a portmanteau of both artists&#x27; names.

===&quot;Machine Messiah&quot; and &quot;Quadra&quot; (2016–2023)===
After spending more than two years of touring in support of &quot;The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart&quot;, Sepultura entered the studio in mid-2016 to begin recording their fourteenth studio album, with Jens Bogren as the producer. The resulting album, &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;, was released on January 13, 2017. Sepultura promoted the album with a series of world tours, including supporting Kreator on their &quot;Gods of Violence&quot; tour in Europe in February–March 2017, and along with Prong, they supported Testament on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; tour in North America in April–May 2017. The band also toured Europe in February–March 2018 with Obscura, Goatwhore and Fit for an Autopsy, and Australia in May with Death Angel.

The first official Sepultura documentary, &quot;Sepultura Endurance&quot;, was premiered in May 2017 and released on June 17. Max and Igor declined to be interviewed for the film and also refused to allow early material of the band to be used.

In an August 2018 interview at Wacken Open Air, Kisser confirmed that Sepultura had begun the songwriting process of their fifteenth studio album, and stated later that month that it would not be released before 2020. The band began recording the album, again with producer Bogren, in August 2019 for a tentative February 2020 release.

In October 2019, during their performance at Rock in Rio 8, the band announced the name and revealed the cover for their fifteenth studio album, which was named &quot;Quadra&quot;. They also debuted the lead single, titled &quot;Isolation&quot;, which is also the opening track for the album. On November 8, they released the studio version of &quot;Isolation&quot; and announced that &quot;Quadra&quot; would be released on February 7, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sepultura had not been able to tour or play any shows in support of &quot;Quadra&quot; for over two years after its release. They played their first show in two years at Circo Voador in Rio de Janeiro on February 12, 2022. The band promoted &quot;Quadra&quot; by touring North America with Sacred Reich, Crowbar and Art of Shock, and Europe with the two-thirds of the North American leg (only Sacred Reich and Crowbar remaining); due to the COVID-19 situation, the tours had been rescheduled to two years from March and April 2020 and a year from the fall of 2021 respectively. Drummer Bruno Valverde of Angra was brought to fill in for Eloy Casagrande on the last three dates of the US tour, as the latter could not perform due to a leg injury. Due to a &quot;family emergency&quot;, Kisser was temporarily filled in by Jean Patton of Project46 on the summer 2022 European tour; the reason behind this &quot;family emergency&quot; situation turned out to be Kisser&#x27;s wife Patricia&#x27;s battle with colon cancer, which she died from on July 3. The band also co-headlined the Klash of the Titans tour in North America with Kreator during the spring of 2023, with Death Angel and Spiritworld as the supporting acts.

Sepultura released a quarantine collaboration album on August 13, 2021, titled &quot;SepulQuarta&quot;, which includes contributions by members of Megadeth, Testament, Anthrax, System of a Down, Trivium and Sacred Reich.

In a July 2022 interview, frontman Derrick Green confirmed that Sepultura would begin working on their next studio album after the end of the &quot;Quadra&quot; tour, in 2024 at the earliest. Kisser later indicated that the band was not expected to release another studio album before at least 2025 or for &quot;a few years&quot;.

===40th anniversary and farewell tour (2023–present)===
In August 2023, Kisser revealed that Sepultura would be celebrating its 40th anniversary as a band in 2024 with a &quot;special tour&quot;, which he said would not include a reunion with Max and Igor Cavalera, and commemorate this anniversary with a live album.

On December 8, 2023, Sepultura announced that they would be embarking on a farewell tour in 2024 in celebration of their 40th anniversary. It was set to run for 18 months, indicating that they were set to disband in 2025; however, Kisser has indicated that the tour will continue into 2026. When asked about the band &quot;departing via a conscious and planned death on this farewell tour&quot;, Kisser explained, &quot;There were a few factors, including the fortieth anniversary. Surviving the pandemic gave us new perspective, and then two years ago my wife passed away from cancer. It made me realise that dying can bring new possibilities for life. Live in the present, there might not be a tomorrow.&quot; The first show of the tour took place at the Arena Hall in Belo Horizonte on March 1, 2024.

Kisser has said that he would be open to reuniting with any former members (particularly the Cavalera brothers) for one final show. Despite initially saying that he was open to reuniting with Sepultura, Max Cavalera ruled out this possibility in a July 2024 interview with &quot;Metal Injection&quot;, explaining, &quot;The more the time passes by, the more I feel that I don&#x27;t need to [reunite with Sepultura]. Like I said, the real reunion is between myself and Igor, and I did that. It&#x27;s pure magic and amazing what we&#x27;re doing right now. You kind of have to realise if we end up doing a Sepultura reunion, it&#x27;s almost like we can&#x27;t go back to the Cavalera thing, you know? It won&#x27;t really make sense.&quot;

Three days before the farewell tour began, it was announced that Casagrande had quit the band on February 6, 2024, to join &quot;another project&quot;, later revealed to be Slipknot. He later stated that one of the reasons he left Sepultura was because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to stop playing drums at the age of 33.&quot; Casagrande was replaced by former Suicidal Tendencies drummer Greyson Nekrutman.

In November 2024, Kisser revealed that Sepultura would release an EP with four new songs.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
Sepultura has been influenced by a variety of music, including heavy metal and hard rock bands such as Rush, Queen, Kiss, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Venom, Celtic Frost, Twisted Sister, Triumph, Whitesnake and Corrosion of Conformity, thrash metal bands Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, Overkill, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and Sacrifice, and death metal bands Possessed and Death. They were also influenced by punk bands such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Terveet Kädet, Rattus, Black Flag, the Dead Kennedys, Kaaos, Discharge, S.O.D., Amebix, Sick of It All, Agnostic Front, the Cro-Mags, Gorilla Biscuits and New Model Army, as well as early U2. Kisser has affirmed that &quot;without Slayer, Sepultura would never be possible.&quot;

Sepultura&#x27;s music comes in a wide range of heavy metal musical styles. The band has been described mainly as thrash metal and death metal, and considered one of the primary inventors of the latter genre. Another genre that the band has been commonly categorized under is groove metal. The band later on started experimenting with elements of other musical genres such as hardcore punk, industrial metal, alternative metal, world music and nu metal. The band&#x27;s first EP &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot; and debut album &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; were influenced by first-wave black metal such as Venom and Celtic Frost. Additionally, both records have been referred to as blackened death metal. Sepultura put more emphasis on the thrash metal part of their sound starting with &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, and by &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; and &quot;Arise&quot;, had abandoned black metal entirely.

Elements of Latin music, samba and Brazilian folk and tribal music have also been incorporated into Sepultura&#x27;s metal style, particularly on &quot;Roots&quot;. &quot;Roots&quot; was partly recorded with the indigenous Xavante tribe in Mato Grosso, and incorporates percussion, rhythms, chanting and lyrical themes inspired by the collaboration.

Looking back on the band&#x27;s career arc in a 2016 article on Max and Igor Cavalera&#x27;s retrospective Return to Roots tour (in commemoration of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary), &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; contributor Saby Reyes-Kulkarni observed that, &quot;Before &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, the overwhelming majority of metal had a &#x27;white&#x27; feel to it. Sepultura changed that forever. And with &quot;Roots,&quot; the band went a step further, asserting once and for all that the genre can accommodate native stylings from any culture, much like jazz had done for decades prior.&quot;

MTV called Sepultura the most successful Brazilian heavy metal band in history and &quot;perhaps the most important heavy metal band of the &#x27;90s.&quot; In 1993, Robert Baird of &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; wrote that the band played &quot;machine-gun-tempo mayhem&quot; and that the members &quot;love to attack organized religion and repressive government.&quot;

A number of bands have cited Sepultura as an influence, including Slipknot, Korn, Hatebreed, Alien Weaponry, Krisiun, Gojira, Between the Buried and Me, Bullet for My Valentine, Xibalba, Vein, Toxic Holocaust, Children of Bodom, Code Orange, Puya, and Nails.

<doc id="168737" wikidata="Q2316071" url="?curid=168737" title="Rusted Root">
<text>Rusted Root is an American worldbeat rock band formed in 1990 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by singer-guitarist Michael Glabicki, bassist Patrick Norman and percussionist Liz Berlin. The band got its start as the house band playing a weekly gig in Jack&#x27;s Back Room on Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Side. The band achieved fame in 1994 with its platinum-selling album &quot;When I Woke&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Send Me on My Way&quot;. The song has been featured prominently in many films and commercials. Rusted Root has sold more than three million albums. After releasing &quot;The Movement&quot; in 2012 and touring through 2015, the band went on an indefinite hiatus, with principal songwriter and vocalist Michael Glabicki forming the group Uprooted with former members of Rusted Root and continuing to tour with that group into the early 2020s.

==Musical style and influences==
The band&#x27;s style is a fusion of acoustic, rock, world and other styles of music, with a strong percussion section that draws from African, Latin American, Indian and Native American influences. Michael Glabicki has acknowledged the popular success of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;So&quot; as an influence on his decision to incorporate worldbeat into his own music. The band&#x27;s lyrical content varies but often talks about Christianity and Judaism. The group&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;The Movement&quot;, was fan funded.

<doc id="168738" wikidata="Q273538" url="?curid=168738" title="Uvula">
<text>The uvula (: uvulas or uvulae), also known as the palatine uvula or staphyle, is a conic projection from the back edge of the middle of the soft palate, composed of connective tissue containing a number of racemose glands, and some muscular fibers. It also contains many serous glands, which produce thin saliva. It is only found in humans.

==Structure==

===Muscle ===

The muscular part of the uvula () shortens and broadens the uvula. This changes the contour of the posterior part of the soft palate. This change in contour allows the soft palate to adapt closely to the posterior pharyngeal wall to help close the nasopharynx during swallowing.

Its muscles are controlled by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve.

===Variation===
A bifid or uvula is a split or cleft uvula. Newborns with cleft palate often also have a split uvula. The bifid uvula results from incomplete fusion of the palatine shelves but it is considered only a slight form of clefting. Bifid uvulas have less muscle in them than a normal uvula, which may cause recurring problems with middle ear infections. While swallowing, the soft palate is pushed backwards, preventing food and drink from entering the nasal cavity. If the soft palate cannot touch the back of the throat while swallowing, food and drink can enter the nasal cavity. Splitting of the uvula occurs infrequently but is the most common form of mouth and nose area cleavage among newborns. Bifid uvula occurs in about 2% of the general population, although some populations may have a high incidence, such as Native Americans who have a 10% rate.

Bifid uvula is a common symptom of the rare genetic syndrome Loeys–Dietz syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm.

==Function==
During swallowing, the soft palate and the uvula move together to close off the nasopharynx, and prevent food from entering the nasal cavity.

It has also been proposed that the abundant amount of thin saliva produced by the uvula serves to keep the throat well lubricated.

It has a function in speech as well. In many languages, a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants, are articulated by creating a constriction of airflow between the uvula and the back of the tongue. The voiced uvular trill, written in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. It has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech organ.

Stimulation of the uvula also causes the gag reflex to initiate. This is often a problem for people with uvula piercings, and a common method of inducing vomiting.
It also acts as a food sensor/guard that aids in breathing between mouthfuls, stopping small pieces of food from being inhaled, leading to choking.

==Clinical significance==

===Inflammation===

At times, the mucous membrane around the uvula may swell, causing the uvula to expand 3–5 times its normal size. This condition is known as uvulitis. When the uvula touches the throat or tongue, it can cause sensations like gagging or choking, although there is no foreign matter present. This can cause problems with breathing, talking, and eating.

There are many theories about what causes the uvula to swell, including dehydration (e.g. from arid weather); excessive smoking or other inhaled irritants; snoring; allergic reaction; or a viral or bacterial infection. An aphthous ulcer which has formed on the uvula can also cause swelling and discomfort.

If the swelling is caused by dehydration, drinking fluids may improve the condition. If the cause is a bacterial infection, gargling salt water may help. However, it can also be a sign of other problems. Some people with a history of recurring uvulitis carry an epinephrine autoinjector to counteract symptoms of an attack. A swollen uvula is not normally life-threatening and subsides in a short time, typically within a day.

===Snoring and sleep apnea===
The uvula can also contribute to snoring or heavy breathing during sleep; having an elongated uvula can cause vibrations that lead to snoring. In some cases this can lead to sleep apnea, which may be treated by removal of the uvula or part of it if necessary, an operation known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (commonly referred to as UPPP, or UP3). However, this operation can also cause sleep apnea if scar tissue forms and the airspace in the velopharynx is decreased. The success of UPPP as a treatment for sleep apnea is unknown, but some research has shown 40–60% effectiveness in reducing symptoms. Typically apnea subsides for the short term, but returns over the medium to long term, and sometimes is worse than it was before the UPPP.

===Velopharyngeal insufficiency===
In a small number of people, the uvula does not close properly against the back of the throat, causing a condition known as velopharyngeal insufficiency. This causes &quot;nasal&quot; (or more properly &quot;hyper-nasal&quot;) speech, where extra air comes down the nose, and the speaker is unable to say certain consonants, such as pronouncing like .

===Nasal regurgitation===
During swallowing, the soft palate and the uvula move superiorly to close off the nasopharynx, preventing food from entering the nasal cavity. When this process fails, the result is called &quot;nasal regurgitation&quot;. It is common in people with VPI, the myositides, and neuromuscular disease. Regurgitation of fluids in this way may also occur if a particularly high volume of liquid is regurgitated, or during vigorous coughing, for example being caused by the accidental inhalation of water. Due to the action of coughing preventing the uvula from blocking the nasopharynx, liquid may be expelled back through the nose.

==Society and culture==
In some parts of Africa, including Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the uvula or a section of it is ritually removed by a traditional healer. In this case, the uvula may be noticeably shortened. It is not thought to contribute to velopharyngeal inadequacy, except in cases where the tonsils have also been removed.

==History==

===Etymology===
In Latin, &quot;&quot; means &quot;little grape&quot;, the diminutive form of &quot;&quot; &quot;grape&quot; (of unknown origin). A swollen uvula was called &quot;ūva&quot;.

<text>In radio, longwave, long wave or long-wave, and commonly abbreviated LW, refers to parts of the radio spectrum with wavelengths longer than what was originally called the medium-wave broadcasting band. The term is historic, dating from the early 20th century, when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of longwave (LW), medium-wave (MW), and short-wave (SW) radio bands. Most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been considered &#x27;ultra-short&#x27; (i.e. VHF, UHF, and microwave).

In contemporary usage, the term &quot;longwave&quot; is not defined precisely, and its intended meaning varies. It may be used for radio wavelengths longer than 1,000 m i.e. frequencies up to 300 kilohertz (kHz), including the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU&#x27;s) low frequency (LF, 30–300 kHz) and very low frequency (VLF, 3–30 kHz) bands. Sometimes the upper limit is taken to be higher than 300 kHz, but not above the start of the medium wave broadcast band at 520 kHz.

In Europe, Africa, and large parts of Asia (International Telecommunication Union Region 1), where a range of frequencies between 148.5 and 283.5 kHz is used for AM broadcasting in addition to the medium-wave band, the term &quot;longwave&quot; usually refers specifically to this broadcasting band, which falls wholly within the low frequency band of the radio spectrum (30–300 kHz). The &quot;Longwave Club of America&quot; (United States) is interested in &quot;frequencies below the AM broadcast band&quot; (i.e., all frequencies below 520 kHz).

== Propagation ==
Because of their long wavelength, radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon, following the contour of the Earth. This mode of propagation, called &quot;ground wave&quot;, is the main mode in the longwave band. The attenuation of signal strength with distance by absorption in the ground is lower than at higher frequencies, and falls with frequency. Low frequency ground waves can be received up to from the transmitting antenna. Very low frequency waves below 30 kHz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances, can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet, and are used by the military to communicate with submerged submarines.

Low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere (the actual mechanism is one of refraction), although this method, called &quot;skywave&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; propagation, is not as common as at higher frequencies. Reflection occurs at the ionospheric E layer or F layers. Skywave signals can be detected at distances exceeding from the transmitting antenna.

==Non-broadcast use==
===Non-directional beacons===
Non-directional beacons transmit continuously for the benefit of radio direction finders in marine and aeronautical navigation. They identify themselves by a callsign in Morse code. They can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 kHz. In North America, they occupy 190–535 kHz. In ITU Region 1 the lower limit is 280 kHz.

===Time signals===
There are institutional broadcast stations in the range that transmit coded time signals to radio clocks. For example:
*WWVB in Colorado, United States, on 60 kHz, 70 kW ERP
*DCF77 in Frankfurt, Germany, on 77.5 kHz, 50 kW
*JJY in Japan, on 40 &amp; 60 kHz, 50 kW
*RBU 66.66 kHz in Taldom transmitter, Russia, 10 kW
*BPC in Shangqiu, China, 68.5 kHz, 90 kW
*MSF time and 60 kHz frequency standard transmitted from Anthorn in the UK, 17 kW ERP.
*ALS162 from Allouis, France, on 162 kHz, 800 kW

Radio-controlled clocks receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers. They use long-wave, rather than short-wave or medium-wave, because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the Earth, so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location.

Longwaves travel by groundwaves that hug the surface of the Earth, unlike mediumwaves and shortwaves. Those higher-frequency signals do not follow the surface of the Earth beyond a few kilometers, but can travel as skywaves, &#x27;bouncing&#x27; off different layers of the ionosphere at different times of day. These different propagation paths can make the time lag different for every signal received. The delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter (when the coded time was correct) and when the signal is received by the clock (when the coded time is slightly late) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light through the air, which is also very nearly constant. Since the time lag is essentially the same, a single constant shift forward from the time coded in the signal can compensate for all long-wave signals received at any one location from the same time signal station.

===Submarine communication===
The militaries of the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, United States, Germany, India and Sweden use frequencies below 50 kHz to communicate with submerged submarines.

===Amateur radio===
In the ITU Radio Regulations the band 135.7–137.8 kHz is allocated (on a secondary basis) to Amateur radio worldwide, subject to a power limit of 1 watt EIRP. Many countries&#x27; regulators license amateurs to use it.

===LowFER===
In North America during the 1970s, the frequencies 167, 179, and 191 kHz were assigned to the short-lived Public Emergency Radio of the United States.

Nowadays, in the United States, Part 15 of FCC regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 kHz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 watt, with an antenna at most 15 meters (49 feet) high; this is called Low Frequency Experimental Radio (LowFER). The 190–435 kHz band is used for navigational beacons.

Frequencies from 472–479 kHz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630 m band, part of the now-defunct maritime band, but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band.

===Historic===
Swedish station SAQ, located at the Varberg Radio Station facility in Grimeton, is the last remaining operational Alexanderson alternator long-wave transmitter. Although the station ended regular service in 1996, it has been maintained as a World Heritage Site, and makes at least two demonstration transmissions yearly, on 17.2 kHz.

==Broadcasting ==
Longwave is used for broadcasting only within ITU Region 1. The long-wave broadcasters are located in Europe, North Africa and Mongolia. 

Typically, a larger geographic area can be covered by a long-wave broadcast transmitter compared to a medium-wave one. This is because ground-wave propagation suffers less attenuation due to ground conductivity at lower frequencies.

Many countries have stopped using LW for broadcasting because of low audience figures, a lack of LW on new consumer receivers, increasing interference levels, the energy inefficiency of AM and high electricity costs at transmitters. 

In 2014 and 2015 Russia closed all of its LW broadcast transmitters. 

As of 2024 more than half of LW frequencies are unoccupied and some of the remaining services are scheduled for closure. BBC Radio 4 (UK) announced that it will stop distinct programming for LW broadcasts in 2024 in an effort to transition listeners to other means of listening. A closure date for LW broadcasts has not yet been announced. The radio teleswitch service for electricity meters is broadcast with the long wave signal. In October 2024 the Radio Teleswitch Taskforce said that it will end on 30 June 2025.

===Carrier frequencies===
With the adoption of the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975, long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 kHz; ranging from 153 to 279 kHz. One exception was a French-language station, Europe 1 in Germany, which retained its prior channel spacing until the long-wave service was terminated in 2019. Other exceptions are all Mongolian transmitters, which are 2 kHz above the internationally recognized channels.

Until the 1970s, some long-wave stations in northern and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union operated on frequencies as high as 433 kHz.

Some radio broadcasters, for instance Droitwich transmitting station in the UK, derive their carrier frequencies from an atomic clock, allowing their use as frequency standards. Droitwich also broadcasts a low bit-rate data channel, using narrow-shift phase-shift keying of the carrier, for Radio Teleswitch Services.

===Long-distance reception===
Because long-wave signals can travel very long distances, some radio amateurs and shortwave listeners engage in an activity called DXing. DXers attempt to listen in to far away transmissions, and they will often send a reception report to the sending station to let them know where they were heard. After receiving a report, the sending station may mail the listener a QSL card to acknowledge this reception.

Reception of long-wave signals at distances in excess of have been verified.

<text>Truly, Madly, Deeply is a 1990 British fantasy drama film made for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Screen Two&quot; series, by BBC Films, Lionheart and Winston Pictures. The film, written and directed by Anthony Minghella, stars Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman.

==Plot==
Nina, an interpreter, is beside herself with grief at the recent death of her boyfriend, Jamie, a cellist. When she is on the verge of despair, Jamie reappears as a &quot;ghost&quot; and the couple are reunited. Nina is ecstatic.

But Jamie tells her about his days while she is at work, and one dialogue suggests she should embrace the life around her; one of these is about a memorial plaque in a park about a dead child and how parents who read it feel an immediate, compelling need to hug their children.

The returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviours she&#x27;d have little patience for – turning up the central heating to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back &quot;ghost friends&quot; to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates.

She meets Mark, a psychologist, to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie&#x27;s continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centered behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, &quot;Was it always like this?&quot; Over Nina&#x27;s objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on.

Towards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, &quot;Well?&quot; and Jamie responds, &quot;I think so... Yes.&quot; At this point the central conceit of the movie has become clear: Jamie came back specifically to help Nina get over him by tarnishing her idealized memory of him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Minghella said he wrote the script specifically as &quot;a vehicle for [Stevenson] to express all her talents. She plays piano, likes dancing and has a quirky side to her which she usually can&#x27;t express in the classical parts she is asked for.&quot; The title comes from a word game played by the main characters, in which they challenge each other to by turns repeat and add to a series of adverbs describing the depths of their mutual affection. The working title for the film was &#x27;Cello&#x27;, a reference not only to the cello within the film, but also to the Italian word &#x27;cielo&#x27; for heaven. The film was made-for-TV, and produced in a 28-day shooting schedule for just $650,000.

It was shot on location in London and Bristol, with external shots in Highgate and on the South Bank. Stevenson said in 2012 that it was the favourite role of her career, commenting that the shoot was like a party.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere on 10 November 1990 at the National Film Theatre as part of the London Film Festival with the title &quot;Cello&quot;.

==Reception==
The film was critically successful, winning several awards including a BAFTA for best original screenplay. (Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson received Best Actor and Best Actress, and Anthony Minghella Most Promising Newcomer, from the 1991 Evening Standard British Film Awards.) It became a hit in the American arthouse circuit and Minghella subsequently was offered work by every major studio in Hollywood. The film&#x27;s combination of serious themes with comic scenes, music and strong performances from the actors was noted by critics. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a &quot;Ghost&quot; for grownups&quot; (a common comparison because of the shared theme of lovers returning as ghosts and the concurrent releases of the films) and considered the film to reveal &quot;some truths that are, the more you think about them, really pretty profound&quot;.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Largely thanks to charming performances from Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson, &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; is an afterlife romance with infectious spirit.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted mean score of 72 out of 100 based on 16 reviews.

<text>The River Tay (, ; probably from the conjectured Brythonic &quot;Tausa&quot;, possibly meaning &#x27;silent one&#x27; or &#x27;strong one&#x27; or, simply, &#x27;flowing&#x27;) is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in Great Britain. The Tay originates in western Scotland on the slopes of Ben Lui (), then flows easterly across the Highlands, through Loch Dochart, Loch Iubhair and Loch Tay, then continues east through Strathtay (see Strath), in the centre of Scotland, then southeasterly through Perth, where it becomes tidal, to its mouth at the Firth of Tay, south of Dundee. It is the largest river in the United Kingdom by measured discharge. Its catchment is approximately , the Tweed&#x27;s is and the Spey&#x27;s is .

The river has given its name to Perth&#x27;s Tay Street, which runs along its western banks for .

==Course==


The Tay drains much of the lower region of the Highlands. It originates on the slopes of Ben Lui (&quot;Beinn Laoigh&quot;), around from the west coast town of Oban, in Argyll and Bute. In 2011, the Tay Western Catchments Partnership determined as its source (as based on its &#x27;most dominant and longest&#x27; tributary) a small lochan on Allt Coire Laoigh south of the summit. The river has a variety of names in its upper catchment: for the first few miles it is known as the River Connonish; then the River Fillan; the name then changes to the River Dochart until it flows into Loch Tay at Killin.

The River Tay emerges from Loch Tay at Kenmore, and flows from there to Perth which, in historical times, was its lowest bridging point. Below Perth the river becomes tidal and enters the Firth of Tay. The largest city on the river, Dundee, lies on the north bank of the Firth. On reaching the North Sea, the River Tay has flowed from west to east across central Scotland.

The Tay is unusual amongst Scottish rivers in having several major tributaries, notably the Earn, the Isla, the River Tummel, the Almond and the Lyon.

A flow of was recorded on 17 January 1993, when the river rose above its usual level at Perth, and caused extensive flooding in the city. Were it not for the hydro-electric schemes upstream which impounded runoff, the peak would have been considerably higher. The highest flood recorded at Perth occurred in 1814, when the river rose above its usual level, partly caused by a blockage of ice under Smeaton&#x27;s Bridge.

Several places along the Tay take their names from it, or are believed to have done so:
*Broughty - &quot;Bruach Tatha&quot;, Bank of the Tay
*Taymouth - Near the mouth of Loch Tay.
*Tayside - A former Scottish Government region

==Nature and conservation==

The river is of high biodiversity value and is both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. The SAC designation notes the river&#x27;s importance for salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;), otters (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), brook lampreys (&quot;Lampetra planeri&quot;), river lampreys (&quot;Lampetra fluviatilis&quot;), and sea lampreys (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;). The Tay also maintains flagship population of freshwater pearl mussel (&quot;Margaritifera margaritifera&quot;). Freshwater pearl mussels are one of Scotland&#x27;s most endangered species and the country hosts two-thirds of the world&#x27;s remaining stock.

The Tay is internationally renowned for its salmon fishing and is one of the best salmon rivers in western Europe, attracting anglers from all over the world. The lowest of the Tay, including prestigious beats like Taymount or Islamouth, provides most of the cream of the Tay. The largest rod-caught salmon in Britain, caught on the Tay by Georgina Ballantine in 1922, weighing , retains the British record. The river system has salmon fisheries on many of its tributaries including the Earn, Isla, Ericht, Tummel, Garry, Dochart, Lyon and Eden. Dwindling catches include a 50% reduction in 2009 so the Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board ordered a catch-and-release policy for females all season, and for males until May, beginning in the January 2010 fishing season. Research by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation has shown that the number of salmon dying at sea has doubled or trebled over the past 20 years, possibly due to overfishing in the oceans where salmon spend two years before returning to freshwater to spawn. The widespread collapse in Atlantic salmon stocks suggests that this is not solely a local problem in the River Tay.

A section of the Tay surrounding the town of Dunkeld is designated as a national scenic area (NSA), one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The River Tay (Dunkeld) NSA covers 5,708 ha.

The first sustained and significant population Eurasian beaver (&quot;Castor fiber&quot;) living wild in Scotland in over 400 years became established on the river Tay catchment in Scotland as early as 2001, and has spread widely in the catchment, numbering from 20 to 100 individuals in 2011. These beavers were likely to be either escapees from any of several nearby sites with captive beavers, or were illegally released, and were originally targeted for removal by Scottish Natural Heritage in late 2010. Proponents of the beavers argued that no reason exists to believe that they are of &quot;wrong&quot; genetic stock. In early December 2010, the first of the wild Tayside beavers was trapped by Scottish Natural Heritage on the River Ericht in Blairgowrie, Perthshire and was held in captivity in Edinburgh Zoo, dying within a few months. In March 2012 the Scottish Government reversed the decision to remove beavers from the Tay, pending the outcome of studies into the suitability of re-introduction.

As part of the study into re-introduction, a trial release project was undertaken in Knapdale, Argyll, alongside which the population of beavers along the Tay was monitored and assessed. Following the conclusion of the trial re-introduction, the Scottish Government announced in November 2016 that beavers could remain permanently, and would be given protected status as a native species within Scotland. Beavers will be allowed to extend their range naturally. To aid this process and improve the health and resilience of the population a further 28 beavers will be released in Knapdale between 2017 and 2020, however there are no plans at present to release further beavers into the Tay.

==Transport==

In the 19th century, the Tay Rail Bridge was built across the firth at Dundee as part of the East Coast Main Line, which linked Aberdeen in the north with Edinburgh and London to the south. The bridge, designed by Sir Thomas Bouch, officially opened in May 1878. On 28 December 1879 the bridge collapsed as a train passed over. The entire train fell into the firth, with the loss of 75 passengers and train crew. The event was commemorated in a poem, The Tay Bridge Disaster (1880), written by William McGonagall, a notoriously unskilled Scottish poet. The critical response to his article was enhanced as he had previously written two poems celebrating the strength and certain immortality of the Tay Bridge. A second much more well received poem was published in the same year by the German writer Theodor Fontane. A. J. Cronin&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1931), includes a scene involving the Tay Bridge Disaster, and the 1942 filmed version of the book recreates the bridge&#x27;s catastrophic collapse. The rail bridge was rebuilt, with the replacement bridge opening on 11 June 1887.

A passenger and vehicle ferry service operated across the River Tay between Craig Pier, Dundee and Newport-on-Tay in Fife. In Dundee, the ferries were known as &quot;the Fifies&quot;. The last vessels to operate the service were PS &quot;B. L. Nairn&quot; and two more modern ferries equipped with Voith Schneider Propellers, MVs &quot;Abercraig&quot; and &quot;Scotscraig&quot;. The service was discontinued on the opening of the Tay Road Bridge on 18 August 1966. The Tay Road Bridge carries the A92 road between Dundee and southern Fife.

The Jubilee Bridge is a -long bridge over the Tay that carries the A9 road near Dunkeld. That bridge will be doubled as part of the upgrade program by 2028 (initially 2025).

==Cultural references==
The Tay bridge is the subject of William McGonagall&#x27;s poems &quot;Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay&quot; and &quot;The Tay Bridge Disaster&quot;, and in the German poet Theodor Fontane&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;Die Brück&#x27; am Tay&quot;. Both deal with the Tay bridge disaster of 1879, seeing the bridge&#x27;s construction as a case of human hubris and expressing an uneasiness towards the fast technological development of mankind.

The river is mentioned in passing in the Steeleye Span song &quot;The Royal Forester&quot;. Symphonic power metal band Gloryhammer mentioned the river in some of their songs as &quot;&quot;silvery Tay&quot; or &quot;mighty river Tay&quot;&quot;. Many Rolls-Royce civil aero-engines are named after British rivers, one of which is the Rolls-Royce Tay.

<text>The palate () is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals. It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. A similar structure is found in crocodilians, but in most other tetrapods, the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separated. The palate is divided into two parts, the anterior, bony hard palate and the posterior, fleshy soft palate (or velum).

==Structure==
===Innervation===
The maxillary nerve branch of the trigeminal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the palate.

===Development===
The hard palate forms before birth.

===Variation===
If the fusion is incomplete, a cleft palate results.

==Function in humans==
When functioning in conjunction with other parts of the mouth, the palate produces certain sounds, particularly velar, palatal, palatalized, postalveolar, alveolopalatal, and uvular consonants.

==History==
===Etymology===
The English synonyms palate and palatum, and also the related adjective palatine (as in palatine bone), are all from the Latin &quot;palatum&quot; via Old French &quot;palat&quot;, words that like their English derivatives, refer to the &quot;roof&quot; of the mouth.

The Latin word &quot;palatum&quot; is of unknown (possibly Etruscan) ultimate origin and served also as a source to the Latin word meaning palace, &quot;palatium&quot;, from which other senses of palatine and the English word palace derive, and not the other way round.

As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of taste, palate can also refer to this sense itself, as in the phrase &quot;a discriminating palate&quot;. By further extension, the flavor of a food (particularly beer or wine) may be called its palate, as when a wine is said to have an oaky palate.

<doc id="168753" wikidata="Q1172427" url="?curid=168753" title="Data haven">
<text>A data haven, like a corporate haven or tax haven, is a refuge for uninterrupted or unregulated data. Data havens are locations with legal environments that are friendly to the concept of a computer network freely holding data and even protecting its content and associated information. They tend to fit into three categories: a physical locality with weak information-system enforcement and extradition laws, a physical locality with intentionally strong protections of data, and virtual domains designed to secure data via technical means (such as encryption) regardless of any legal environment.

Tor&#x27;s onion space, I2P (both hidden services), HavenCo (centralized), and Freenet (decentralized) are four models of modern-day virtual data havens.

==Purposes of data havens==
Reasons for establishing data havens include access to free political speech for users in countries where censorship of the Internet is practiced.

Other reasons can include:
* Whistleblowing
* Distributing software, data or speech that violates laws such as the DMCA
* Copyright infringement
* Circumventing data protection laws
* Online gambling
* Pornography
* Cybercrime

==History of the term==
The 1978 report of the British government&#x27;s Data Protection Committee expressed concern that different privacy standards in different countries would lead to the transfer of personal data to countries with weaker protections; it feared that Britain might become a &quot;data haven&quot;. Also in 1978, Adrian Norman published a mock consulting study on the feasibility of setting up a company providing a wide range of data haven services, called &quot;Project Goldfish&quot;.

Science fiction novelist William Gibson used the term in his novels &quot;Count Zero&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, as did Bruce Sterling in &quot;Islands in the Net&quot;. The 1990s segments of Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; concern a small group of entrepreneurs attempting to create a data haven.

<doc id="168758" wikidata="Q1190487" url="?curid=168758" title="O'Connell Street">
<text>O&#x27;Connell Street () is a street in the centre of Dublin, Ireland, running north from the River Liffey. It connects the O&#x27;Connell Bridge to the south with Parnell Street to the north and is roughly split into two sections bisected by Henry Street. The Luas tram system runs along the street.

During the 17th century, it was a narrow street known as Drogheda Street, named after Henry Moore, 1st Earl of Drogheda. It was widened in the late 18th century by the Wide Streets Commission and renamed Sackville Street (&quot;Sráid Saicfil&quot;) after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. In 1924, it was renamed in honour of nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell, whose statue by John Henry Foley stands at the lower end of the street facing O&#x27;Connell Bridge.

The street has played an important part in Irish history and features several important monuments, including statues of O&#x27;Connell and trade union leader James Larkin, as well as the Spire of Dublin. It formed the backdrop to one of the 1913 Dublin lock-out gatherings, the 1916 Easter Rising, the Irish Civil War of 1922, the destruction of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in 1966 and the Dublin riots of 2006 and 2023. In the late 20th century, a comprehensive plan was begun to restore the street to its original 19th-century character.

==Location==
O&#x27;Connell Street is located on the north side of Dublin city, and runs northwards from O&#x27;Connell Bridge towards Parnell Square. The street is approximately long and wide, with two broad carriageways at either side of a central pathway occupied by various monuments and statues. It has previously been part of the N1, a major road from Dublin to Belfast. There are two Luas tram stops along the street, O&#x27;Connell GPO and O&#x27;Connell Upper. The street has a number of bus stops for Dublin Bus and other bus companies, with many cross-city and north-bound services stopping there.

O&#x27;Connell Street evolved from the earlier 17th-century Drogheda Street, laid out by Henry Moore, 1st Earl of Drogheda. It was a third of the width of the present-day O&#x27;Connell Street, located on the site of the modern eastern carriageway and extending from Parnell Street to the junction with Abbey Street.

===Sackville Street (Gardiner&#x27;s Mall)===
In the 1740s, the banker and property developer Luke Gardiner acquired the upper part of Drogheda Street extending down to Henry Street as part of a land deal. He demolished the western side of Drogheda Street creating an exclusive elongated residential square long and wide, thus establishing the scale of the modern-day thoroughfare.

A number of properties were built along the new western side of the street, while the eastern side had many mansions, the grandest of which was Drogheda House rented by the sixth Earl of Drogheda and sat on the corner of Cathedral Street. Gardiner also laid out a mall down the central section of the street, lined with low granite walls and obelisks. It was planted with trees a few years later. He titled the new development Sackville Street after the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Lionel Cranfield Sackville, Duke of Dorset. It was also known as &#x27;Sackville Mall&#x27;, and &#x27;Gardiner&#x27;s Mall&#x27;. However, due to the limited lands owned by the Gardiners in this area, the Rotunda Hospital sited just off the street at the bottom of Parnell Square – also developed by the family – was not built on axis with Sackville Street, terminating the vista. It had been Gardiner&#x27;s intention to connect the new street through to the river, however, he died in 1755, with his son Charles taking over the estate.

Work did not start until 1757 when the city&#x27;s planning body, the Wide Streets Commission, obtained a financial grant from Parliament. For the next 10 years work progressed in demolishing a myriad of dwellings and other buildings, laying out the new roadway and building new terraces. The Wide Streets Commission had envisaged and realised matching terraces of unified and proportioned façades extending from the river. Because of a dispute over land, a plot on the northwest of the street remained vacant; this later became the General Post Office (GPO) which opened in 1814. 

In 1764, an English traveller named John Bush visited Dublin and made the following assessment of the street: &quot;There are on this side (north of the Liffey) many spacious and regular streets: one in particular in the north-east part of the town. Sackville-Street, about 70 feet wide or nearly, with a mall enclosed with a low wall...&quot;. Bush, however, bemoaned the failures of the builder for not having aligned the street with the Rotunda Hospital at its northern end.

The street became a commercial success upon the opening of Carlisle Bridge, designed by James Gandon, in 1792 for pedestrians and in 1795 for all traffic.

==19th century==

Sackville Street prospered in the 19th century, though there was some difference between the Upper and Lower streets. Lower Sackville Street became successful as a commercial location; its terraces are ambitiously lined with purpose-designed retail units. Consequently, a difference between the two ends of the street developed: the planned lower end is successful and bustling next to the river, and the upper end features a mixture of less prominent businesses and old townhouses. Upon his visit to Dublin in 1845, William Makepeace Thackeray observed the street was &quot;broad and handsome&quot; but noted the upper section featured less distinctive architecture and had a distinct lack of patronage.
During the 19th century, Sackville Street changed in character from the Wide Streets Commission design into a boulevard of individual buildings. One of the world&#x27;s first purpose-built department stores was such a building: Delany&#x27;s New Mart &#x27;Monster Store&#x27; which opened in 1853 was later purchased by the Clery family. It also housed the Imperial Hotel. Across the road, another elaborate hotel was built next to the GPO: the Hotel Metropole, in a high-French style. Similarly, the Gresham Hotel opened on numbers 21 and 22 in 1817 to the north of the street in adjoining Georgian townhouses and was later remodelled, as it became more successful.
As the fortunes of Upper Sackville Street began to improve in the second half of the century, other businesses began to open such as the Turkish baths built at the rear of Reynold&#x27;s Hotel, and opened in 1869 as the renamed Hammam Family Hotel and Turkish Baths. Standard Life Assurance built their flagship Dublin branch on the street, while the Findlater family opened a branch of their successful chain close to Parnell Street, as did Gilbey&#x27;s Wine Merchants. The thoroughfare also became the centre of the Dublin tramways system, with many of the city&#x27;s trams converging at the Nelson Pillar. By 1900, Sackville Street had become an important location for shopping and business, which led to it being called &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Main Street&quot;.

During the 19th century, the street began to be known as &quot;O&#x27;Connell Street&quot; though this was considered by some to be a &quot;nationalist&quot; name. Dublin Corporation was anxious as early as the 1880s to change the name but faced considerable objections from residents and business owners on the street. With the unveiling of the O&#x27;Connell Monument on the street in 1882 and subsequent renaming of the Carlisle Bridge as O&#x27;Connell Bridge in his honour, it marked &quot;an important move away from commemorating only members of the Castle administration or the British royal family&quot; in the street, according to a 2003 report commissioned by Dublin City Council.

Despite objections, the Corporation passed a resolution to rename the street in December 1884, but in 1885, aggrieved locals, with the Attorney General of Ireland arguing their case, secured a Court order holding that the Corporation lacked the powers to make such a change. The necessary powers were granted in 1890, but it may have been felt best to allow the new name to become popular; over the years the name O&#x27;Connell Street gradually gained popular acceptance, and the name was changed officially, without any protest, in 1924.

==Easter Rising and Independence==
On 31 August 1913, O&#x27;Connell Street saw the worst incident in the Dublin lock-out, a major dispute between workers and the police. During a speech given by workers&#x27; rights activist James Larkin, police charged through the attending crowd and arrested him. The crowd began to riot, resulting in two deaths, 200 arrests and numerous injuries.
During the Easter Rising of 1916, Irish republicans seized the General Post Office and proclaimed the Irish Republic, leading to the street&#x27;s bombardment for a number of days by the gunboat &quot;Helga&quot; of the Royal Navy and several other artillery pieces which were brought up to fire on the north of the street. The thoroughfare also saw sustained small arms and sniper fire from surrounding areas. By Saturday, the rebels had been forced to abandon the GPO, which was burning, and held out in Moore Street until they surrendered.

Much of the street was reduced to rubble, the damaged areas including the whole eastern side of the street as far north as Cathedral Street, and the terrace in between the GPO and Abbey Street on the western side. In addition, during the chaos that accompanied the rebellion, the inhabitants of the nearby slums looted many of the shops on O&#x27;Connell Street. The events had a disastrous impact on the commercial life of the inner city, causing around £2.5 million worth of damage. Some businesses were closed up to 1923 or never reopened.

In the immediate aftermath of the Rising, the destruction of the street resulted in the majority of major claims to the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee. The Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act 1916 was drafted with the aim of controlling the nature of reconstruction in the local area. The aim was to rebuild in a coherent and dignified fashion, using the opportunity to modernise the nature of commercial activity. Under the act, the city was to approve all construction and reject anything that would not fit with the street&#x27;s character. The reconstruction was supervised and by City Architect Horace T. O&#x27;Rourke. With the exception of its Sackville Street façade and portico, the General Post Office was destroyed. A new GPO was subsequently built behind the 1818 façade. Work began in 1924, with the Henry Street side the first to be erected with new retail units at street level, a public shopping arcade linking through to Princes Street, and new offices on the upper floors. The Public Office underneath the portico on O&#x27;Connell Street reopened in 1929.
O&#x27;Connell Street saw another pitched battle in July 1922, on the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, when anti-treaty fighters under Oscar Traynor occupied the street after pro-treaty Irish National Army troops attacked the republican garrison in the nearby Four Courts. Fighting lasted from 28 June until 5 July, when the National Army troops brought artillery up to point-blank range, under the cover of armoured cars, to bombard the Republican-held buildings. Among the casualties was Cathal Brugha, shot at close range. The effects of the week&#x27;s fighting were largely confined to the northern end of the street, with the vast majority of the terrace north of Cathedral Street to Parnell Square being destroyed, as well as a few buildings on the north-western side. In total, around three-quarters of the properties on the street were destroyed or demolished between 1916 and 1922. As a result, only one Georgian townhouse remains on the street into the 21st century.

Because of the extensive destruction and rebuilding, most of the buildings on O&#x27;Connell Street date from the early 20th century. The only remaining original building still standing is No. 42, which has been owned by the Royal Dublin Hotel since 1972. This house was originally the home of the State physician and professor of anatomy at Trinity College, Robert Robinson and later Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Catholic Commercial Club. The building dates from 1752 and was designed by Richard Cassels. There were plans to incorporate the house into the hotel to provide additional bars and function space in 1975 and 1978, but the work was never carried out. Permission was sought in 1982 to demolish the house, but this was refused. Apart from the GPO building, other significant properties rebuilt after the hostilities include the department store Clerys which reopened in August 1922. and the Gresham Hotel which reopened in 1927.

==Regeneration==
Despite improvements to the street&#x27;s architectural coherence between 1916 and 1922, the street has since suffered from a lack of planning. Like much of Dublin of that time, property speculators and developers were allowed to construct what were widely accepted to be inappropriately designed buildings, often entailing the demolition of historic properties in spite of its Conservation Area status. Frank McDonald dates the turn in the Street&#x27;s fortune as the blowing up of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar, contending that the loss of the pillar led to a decline in the character and overall cohesion of the area. The loss of the Pillar was also the loss of a significant landmark, a meeting place, and a popular tourist spot on the north side of the city. Several Victorian and 1920s buildings were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the earliest examples was the demolition of two house facades by CIÉ in 1961 to make way for the passenger information bureau. The new structure has a glazed curtain wall with stained glass panels by Evie Hone. Another demolition was of Gilbey&#x27;s at the northern end of the street. This building featured a high Victorian romanesque facade, a porch, and a crested roof. It was demolished in March 1973, with two stone heads of Gladstone and Palmerston salvaged and set in above the new entrance. Originally designed as a mixed development with retail and offices, the entire building was rented by Dublin City Council from 1975, and then set out the ground floor as a sound-proofed council chamber.

The Metropole and Capitol cinemas next to the GPO were demolished in 1973, McDonald noting this removed the central social hub of O&#x27;Connell Street. As well as being cinemas, the Capitol had lounges, meeting rooms, cafes and a restaurant, while the Metropole had a ballroom, restaurants and bars. The site was levelled and redeveloped for British Home Stores. It occupied the site, with Mothercare and Habitat, until 1992 when it closed the store. It was then taken over by a branch of Penney&#x27;s. Findlater&#x27;s grocer and wine merchant&#x27;s premises on the corner of O&#x27;Connell Street and Cathal Brugha Street was demolished in 1972 and replaced with a five-storey office block with retail at ground level. This is among the newer buildings that disrupted the proportions that had been strictly enforced across the streetscape by O&#x27;Rourke during the reconstruction in the 1920s.

Among the last intact Wide Streets Commission buildings on the street dating from the 1780s, numbers 40 and 41 were demolished in 1968 to make way for the Royal Dublin Hotel. Designed by Patrick Carr, it was the first hotel built in Dublin since the Gresham in the 1920s and opened in 1970. This hotel was in turn demolished after its closure in 2008 and has remained a vacant site. Along with the other vacant site beside the former Carlton Cinema, and the Carlton itself have been part of a plan to develop the site as a large shopping centre that would connect with Moore Street. The so-called &quot;Carlton site&quot; encompasses almost six acres facing onto O&#x27;Connell, Moore, Parnell and Henry Streets. This vacant site immediately to the right of the Carlton was Gill&#x27;s bookshop and a branch of Penney&#x27;s until 1979 when it was purchased by the Bank of Ireland. Gill&#x27;s was destroyed by fire while vacant and later collapsed in September 1979, leading to both buildings being levelled. Many of the older buildings were replaced with fast-food restaurants, shops and offices, that continue to be the main features along O&#x27;Connell Street in the 21st century.The street was given attention with Dublin City Council&#x27;s O&#x27;Connell Street Integrated Area Plan (IAP) which was unveiled in 1998 with the aim of restoring the street to its former status. The plan was designed to go beyond simple cosmetic changes, and introduce control of the wider area beyond the street&#x27;s buildings, including pedestrian and vehicle interaction, governance and preservation of architecture. Work on the plan was delayed, and reached approval in June 2003.

The main features of the plan included the widening of footpaths and a reduction in road space, removing and replacing all trees, a new plaza in front of the GPO, and new street furnishings including custom-designed lampposts, litter bins and retail kiosks. The plan included the Spire of Dublin project, Dublin&#x27;s tallest sculpture; constructed between December 2002 and January 2003, occupying the site of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar. Numerous monuments were restored, including those of late 19th century Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell, radical early 20th-century labour leader Jim Larkin, prominent businessman and nationalist MP Sir John Grey, and the most challenging of all: the conservation of the O&#x27;Connell Monument standing guard at the southern entrance to the thoroughfare. This project was worked on for a number of months by an expert team of bronze and stone conservators before being unveiled in May 2005.

All public domain works were completed in June 2006, finalising the principal objective of the IAP at a cost of €40 million. The loss of mature trees during this work has been cited as exposing and further highlighting the issues with the streetscape. Work was disrupted by a riot centred on the street which erupted on 25 February 2006. A protest against a planned Loyalist march degenerated into vandalism and looting, with building materials from the works in progress being used as weapons and for smashing windows and fixtures.

O&#x27;Connell Street has been designated an Architectural Conservation Area and an Area of Special Planning Control. This means that no buildings can be altered without Dublin City Council&#x27;s permission, and fast food outlets, takeaways, cafes and amusement arcades are strictly controlled.

In June 2015, Clerys suddenly closed after it was bought out by investment group Natrium Ltd, with the loss of over 400 jobs. In 2019, plans were announced to turn the premises into a four-star hotel.

The street is used as the main route of the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, and as the setting for the 1916 Commemoration every Easter Sunday. It also serves as a major bus route artery through the city centre. The modern tram, the Luas, has undergone an extension and trams now run once again through O&#x27;Connell Street. It only travels in one direction, the return loop, to link the system at St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, runs via Marlborough Street, parallel with and east of O&#x27;Connell Street.

==Flora and fauna==
In his 1937 book &quot;The Way That I Went&quot;, Irish naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger noted that &quot;undoubtedly the most interesting zoological feature that Dublin has to offer is the Wagtail roost on O&#x27;Connell Street&quot;. Early in the winter of 1929, a number of pied wagtails settled in a London plane tree on the north side of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar. The next autumn, approximately two thousand of the same species of bird re-appeared, occupying three or four adjacent trees in the same area. Praeger noted that &quot;...so large a colony in such apparently unsuitable surroundings is remarkable&quot;.

==Statues==

Current and former monuments on O&#x27;Connell Street from south to north include:

Daniel O&#x27;Connell: designed and sculpted by John Henry Foley and completed by his assistant Thomas Brock. Construction began in 1866 and the monument was unveiled in 1883.

William Smith O&#x27;Brien: by Thomas Farrell. Originally erected in 1870 on an island at the O&#x27;Connell Bridge entrance to D&#x27;Olier Street, it was moved to O&#x27;Connell Street in 1929.
Sir John Gray: by Thomas Farrell. Both the plinth and statue were carved entirely of white Sicilian marble, it was unveiled in 1879. Gray was the proprietor of the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; newspaper and as a member of Dublin Corporation was responsible for the construction of the Dublin water supply system based on the Vartry Reservoir.

James Larkin: by Oisín Kelly. A bronze statue atop a Wicklow granite plinth, the monument was unveiled in 1980.

Anna Livia: by Eamonn O&#x27;Doherty. Constructed in granite and unveiled on 17 June 1988, it became quickly known by its nickname &quot;The Floosy in the Jacuzzi&quot;. It was removed in 2001 as part of the reconstruction plans for O&#x27;Connell Street and moved to the Croppies&#x27; Acre Memorial Park in 2011.

Nelson&#x27;s Pillar, a 36.8 m (121 ft) granite Doric column erected in 1808 in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson, formerly stood at the centre of the street on the site of the present-day Spire of Dublin. Blown up by republican activists in 1966, the site remained vacant until the erection of the Spire in 2003.

Father Theobald Mathew: by Mary Redmond. The foundation stone was laid in 1890, and the monument was unveiled in 1893. In 2016, the statue was removed to cater for the Luas tram extension to the north of the city. It was restored in 2018 to a new location near The Spire.

Charles Stewart Parnell: &quot;Parnell Monument&quot; by Irish-American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The 37 ft high obelisk sits on a Galway granite pylon, was organised by John Redmond and paid for through public subscription and was unveiled in 1911 at the junction with Parnell Street, just south of Parnell Square.

<text>The Spire of Dublin, alternatively titled the Millennium Spire or the Monument of Light (), is a large, stainless steel, pin-like monument in height, located on the site of the former Nelson&#x27;s Pillar (and prior to that a statue of William Blakeney) on O&#x27;Connell Street, the main thoroughfare of Dublin, Ireland.

==History==

Following the bombing of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar by former IRA members in 1966, and subsequent controlled demolition six days later of what was left, the site remained vacant for years as no decision could be reached on a suitable replacement. Eventually, the &quot;Anna Livia&quot; monument was installed on the site to celebrate the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations.

In 1998, as part of a planned multi-million euro re-development of O&#x27;Connell Street (as well as a memorial to the upcoming millennium and the aspirations of Ireland in the midst of its Celtic Tiger economic boom), a competition was launched to find a replacement for Nelson&#x27;s Pillar. O&#x27;Connell Street had been in decline for a number of years due to the proliferation of fast-food restaurants, the opening of bargain shops using cheap plastic shop fronts, and proliferation of derelict sites along both sides of the road. The re-development plan, which was aimed for completion by 2004, hoped to move the street &quot;away from the image of fast-food restaurants, to (that of) a &#x27;family&#x27; place to go&quot;. As part of the project to improve the overall streetscape, a new granite plaza was promised and the number of trees in the central reservation, which had overgrown and obscured views and monuments, was reduced dramatically. This was controversial, as the trees had been growing for a century. Statues were cleaned and in some cases relocated. Shop owners were required to replace plastic signage and frontage with more attractive designs. Traffic was re-directed where possible away from the street and the number of traffic lanes was reduced to make it more appealing to pedestrians. The centrepiece of this regeneration was to be the replacement monument for Nelson&#x27;s Pillar.
The Spire, or &quot;Spire of Light&quot;, was chosen from a large number of submissions in an international competition by a committee chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Joe Doyle. Following an appeal by an objector, the plans were taken to the High Court, meaning that the monument was not ready for the Millennium celebrations in the year 2000. On 28 December 2000, after an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) had been carried out, Environment Minister Noel Dempsey announced that construction of the Monument of Light, or &quot;The Spike&quot;, had been approved and that construction of the monument would take nineteen months to complete. The announcement constituted a defeat for An Taisce, Ireland&#x27;s non-governmental organisation active in the areas of the environment and built heritage, which had called for the spire&#x27;s height to be reduced. Dempsey noted that Dublin Corporation had previously failed to complete an EIS in its haste to complete the monument quickly.

The spire was designed by Ian Ritchie of Ian Ritchie Architects, who sought an &quot;Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology&quot;. The contract was awarded to SIAC-Radley JV and it was manufactured by Radley Engineering of Dungarvan, County Waterford, and erected by SIAC Construction Ltd &amp; GDW Engineering Ltd. The &quot;Anna Livia&quot; monument was eventually moved away to make room for the Spire in 2001.

In December 2015, to coincide with the Irish premier of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, a large temporary Lightsaber hilt was installed at the base of the Spire to light the Spire blue at night.

In May 2024, &quot;The Portal&quot; was opened. It created a visual bridge connecting Dublin and New York with a live videostream of The Spire shown to New Yorkers, while the portal in New York was broadcast from the Flatiron Building.

==Construction==
The first section was installed on 18 December 2002. Construction of the sculpture was delayed because of difficulty in obtaining planning permission and environmental regulations. The Spire consists of eight hollow stainless steel cone sections, the longest being , which were installed on 21 January 2003. It is an elongated cone of diameter at the base, narrowing to at the top. The total weight of the eight sections amounts to 133.15 tonnes. It features two tuned mass dampers inside the fifth section from the bottom, designed by engineers Arup, to counteract sway. The steel underwent shot peening to alter the quality of light reflected from it.

The pattern around the base of the Spire is based on a core sample of rock formation taken from the ground where the spire stands and the DNA double helix. The pattern was applied by bead blasting the steel through rubber stencil masks whose patterns were created by water jet cutting based on core sample drawings supplied by the contractor. The design around the lower part of the Spire was created by the architects making a 3D pattern model combining the core sample and double helix and then digitally translated to a 2D image drawing supplied to the contractor and used by specialists for cutting the masking material.

At dusk, the base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated through 11,884 holes through which light-emitting diodes shine.

==Reception==
Some opposition initially greeted the monument. Supporters compare it to other initially unpopular urban structures such as the Eiffel Tower, while detractors complain that the Spire has little architectural or cultural connection to the city. Irish intellectual Desmond Fennell believed that the Spire symbolised Ireland&#x27;s diminishing sense of nationhood, writing that &#x27;on reflection [on the Spire], I recognised that it was at least an honest statement of the Republic&#x27;s state of mind after its prudent self-effacement during the Northern War and during the past-effacing enrichment of the Celtic Tiger boom. It stood for, represented, and said nothing.&quot;

Complaints were also aired about the danger posed by the monument to low-flying aircraft, as well as the absence of a Christian message. It has inspired a number of nicknames, as is common with public art in Dublin, including the stiletto in the ghetto, the pin in the bin, the stiffy by the Liffey, the spire in the mire, or the spike.

==Award nominations==
The monument has been nominated for the following awards:
*2003 British Construction Industry International Award finalist
*2004 RIBA National Award &amp; Stirling Prize shortlist
*2005 Mies Van der Rohe Prize list

<doc id="168760" wikidata="Q148443" url="?curid=168760" title="Fraktur">
<text>Fraktur () is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand. It is designed such that the beginnings and ends of the individual strokes that make up each letter will be clearly visible, and often emphasized; in this way it is often contrasted with the curves of the Antiqua (common) typefaces where the letters are designed to flow and strokes connect together in a continuous fashion. The word &quot;Fraktur&quot; derives from Latin (&quot;a break&quot;), built from , passive participle of (&quot;to break&quot;), which is also the root for the English word &quot;fracture&quot;. In non-professional contexts, the term &quot;Fraktur&quot; is sometimes misused to refer to &quot;all&quot; blackletter typefaces while Fraktur typefaces do fall under that category, not all blackletter typefaces exhibit the Fraktur characteristics described above.

Fraktur is often characterized as &quot;the German typeface&quot;, as it remained popular in Germany and much of Eastern Europe far longer than elsewhere. Beginning in the 19th century, the use of Fraktur versus Antiqua (seen as modern) was the subject of controversy in Germany. The Antiqua–Fraktur dispute continued until 1941, when the Nazi government banned Fraktur typefaces. After Nazi Germany fell in 1945, Fraktur was unbanned, but it failed to regain widespread popularity.

==Characteristics==
Besides the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet, Fraktur usually includes the Eszett in the form, vowels with umlauts, and the long s . Some Fraktur typefaces also include a variant form of the letter r known as the r rotunda, and many include a variety of ligatures which are left over from cursive handwriting and have rules for their use. Most older Fraktur typefaces make no distinction between the majuscules and (where the common shape is more suggestive of a ), even though the minuscules and are differentiated.

One difference between the Fraktur and other blackletter scripts is that in the lower case , the left part of the bow is broken, but the right part is not. In Danish texts composed in Fraktur, the letter was already preferred to the German and Swedish in the 16th century.

In the Latvian variant of Fraktur, used mainly until the 1920s, there are additional characters used to denote Latvian letters with diacritical marks. Stroked letters , , , , are used for palatalized consonants (, , , , ) stroked variants of and distinguish voiced and unvoiced sibilants or affricates ( for voiced [z], for unvoiced [s], [ž] / [š], [dž] / [č]), while accents (, , , , , ) together with digraphs (, etc.) are used for long vowels (, , , , ). Stroked variants of are also used in pre-1950 Sorbian orthography.

==Origin==
The first Fraktur typeface arose in the early 16th century, when Emperor Maximilian I commissioned the design of the &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot; woodcut by Albrecht Dürer and had a new typeface created specifically for this purpose, designed by Hieronymus Andreae. Fraktur types for printing were established by the Augsburg publisher at the issuance of a series of Maximilian&#x27;s works such as his &quot;Prayer Book&quot; (, 1513) or the illustrated &quot;Theuerdank&quot; poem (1517).

Fraktur quickly overtook the earlier Schwabacher and Textualis typefaces in popularity, and a wide variety of Fraktur fonts were carved and became common in the German-speaking world and areas under German influence (Scandinavia, Estonia, Latvia, Central Europe). In the 18th century, the German Theuerdank Fraktur was further developed by the Leipzig typographer Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf to create the typeset Breitkopf Fraktur. While over the succeeding centuries, most Central Europeans switched to Antiqua, German speakers remained a notable holdout.

== Use ==

Typesetting in Fraktur was still very common in the early 20th century in all German-speaking countries and areas, as well as in Norway, Estonia, and Latvia, and was still used to a very small extent in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, even though other countries typeset in Antiqua. Some books at that time used related blackletter fonts such as Schwabacher; however, the predominant typeface was the Normalfraktur, which came in slight variations.

From the late 18th century to the late 19th century, Fraktur was progressively replaced by Antiqua as a symbol of the classicist age and emerging cosmopolitanism in most of the countries in Europe that had previously used Fraktur. This move was hotly debated in Germany, a controversy known as the Antiqua–Fraktur dispute. The shift affected mostly scientific writing in Germany, whereas most belletristic literature and newspapers continued to be printed in Fraktur.

The Fraktur typefaces remained in use in Nazi Germany, when they were initially represented as true German script; official Nazi documents and letterheads employed the font, and the cover of Hitler&#x27;s used a hand-drawn version of it. However, more modernized fonts of the type such as Tannenberg were in fact the most popular typefaces in Nazi Germany, especially for running text as opposed to decorative uses such as in titles. These fonts were designed in the early 20th century, mainly the 1930s, as grotesque versions of blackletter typefaces. The Nazis heavily used these fonts themselves, although the shift remained controversial; in fact, the press was at times scolded for its frequent use of &quot;Roman characters&quot; under &quot;Jewish influence&quot; and German émigrés were urged to use only &quot;German script&quot;. On 3 January 1941, the Nazi Party ended this controversy by switching to international scripts such as Antiqua. Martin Bormann issued a circular (the &quot;normal type decree&quot;) to all public offices which declared Fraktur (and its corollary, the -based handwriting) to be (Jewish letters) and prohibited their further use. German historian Albert Kapr has speculated that the regime viewed Fraktur as inhibiting communication in the occupied territories during World War II.

The Reichsgesetzblatt used Fraktur until the end of 1941.

===After 1941===
Even with the abolition of Fraktur, some publications included elements of it in headlines. More often, some ligatures (such as &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ck&quot;) from Fraktur were used in Antiqua-typed editions up to the offset type period. Fraktur saw a brief resurgence after the war, but thereafter fell out of common use.

Fraktur is today used mostly for decorative typesetting: for example, a number of traditional German newspapers such as the , as well as the Norwegian , still print their name in Fraktur on the masthead (as indeed do some newspapers in other European countries and the U.S.) and it is also popular for pub signs and the like. In this modern decorative use, the traditional rules about the use of long s and short and of ligatures are often disregarded.

Individual Fraktur letters are sometimes used in mathematics, which often denotes associated or parallel concepts by the same letter in different fonts. For example, a Lie group is often denoted by &quot;G&quot;, while its associated Lie algebra is formula_1. A ring ideal might be denoted by formula_2 (or formula_3 if a prime ideal) while an element is formula_4. The Fraktur formula_5 is also sometimes used to denote the cardinality of the continuum, that is, the cardinality of the real line. In model theory, formula_6 is used to denote an arbitrary model, with &quot;A&quot; as its universe. 

Fraktur is still used among traditional Anabaptists to print German texts, while Kurrent is used as hand writing for German texts. Groups that use both forms of traditional German script are the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Hutterites, and traditional Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites who live mostly in Latin America today.

==Typeface samples==
In the figures below, the German sentence that appears after the names of the fonts (Walbaum-Fraktur in Fig. 1 and Humboldtfraktur in Fig. 2 reads, . It means &quot;Victor chases twelve boxers across the Sylt dike&quot; and contains all 26 letters of the alphabet plus the umlauted glyphs used in German, making it an example of a pangram.

==Unicode==
Unicode does not encode Fraktur as a separate script. Instead, Fraktur is considered a &quot;presentation form&quot; of the Latin alphabet. Thus, the additional ligatures that are required for Fraktur typefaces will not be encoded in Unicode: support for these ligatures is a font engineering issue left up to font developers.

There are, however, two sets of Fraktur symbols in the Unicode blocks of Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols, Letterlike Symbols, and Latin Extended-E. The long s, ß, and the umlauted vowels are not encoded, as the characters are meant to be used in mathematics and phonetics, so they are not suitable for typesetting German-language texts.

==LaTeX==
Modern LaTeX implementations (XeTeX, LuaTeX) can utilize a Fraktur font the usual way using the package.

For traditional implementations (pdfTeX and older), the command defined in the , or package is available. This command does not use Unicode to typeset letters in fraktur: it has its own method.

For example, produces formula_7. Or, in a real example,

<doc id="168762" wikidata="Q2914190" url="?curid=168762" title="Haram (site)">
<text>Haram () is one of several similar words originating from the triliteral Semitic root Ḥ-R-M. The word literally means &quot;sanctuary,&quot; commonly used by Muslims to refer to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and Prophet Mohammad&#x27;s Mosque. There are certain rules which Muslims within these two areas must follow.

Another meaning of the word which was used in the past but has since fallen out of use, include an &quot;inviolable/protected zone,&quot; referring to an area in which the number of residing families was limited, attributed to the idea of carrying capacity and early forms of nature reserves, and to the prayer hall of the mosque.

==Etymology==
The Arabic language has two separate words, &quot;ḥaram&quot; () and &quot;ḥarām&quot; () both derived from the same triliteral Semitic root &quot;Ḥ-R-M&quot;. Both of these words can mean &quot;forbidden&quot; and/or &quot;sacred&quot; in a general way, but each has also developed some specialized meanings (&quot;ḥarām&quot; most often means &quot;forbidden by law&quot;). A third related word derived from the same root, that is &quot;ḥarīm&quot; (), most directly corresponds to English &quot;harem&quot;. This article covers the word &quot;ḥaram&quot; (with short vowels in the singular form).

==In Islam==

===Protected zone===

As used in Islamic urban planning, the word &quot;ḥaram&quot; means &quot;inviolate zone&quot;, an important aspect of urban planning in Muslim civilization. Such protected areas were sanctuaries, or places where contending parties could settle disputes peacefully. Towns were usually built near a river which provided drinking and domestic water (upstream) and carried away waste and sewage (downstream). Muslims claim to have introduced the idea of carrying capacity, and clearly sometimes did limit the number of families in any given town. The harams were typically positioned to ensure access to parkland and nature (which were given another name, hima), to restrict urban sprawl, protect water-courses and watersheds and oases. In this respect the rules strongly resembled modern zoning laws, with the same purposes.

The distinction between &quot;haram&quot; and &quot;hima&quot; is thought by some modern scholars to have been necessary due to a different means of deciding which regions were to have restrictions - the selection of haram was considered to be more up to the community while the selection of hima had more to do with natural characteristics of the region, which were considered to be best respected by jurists. This idea probably arises from two different obligations of the Muslim to respect the &quot;ijmaʿ&quot; (consensus of neighbors within Islam) and practice &quot;Khilafah&quot; (Stewardship of nature under Allah). It may or may not reflect actual means of decision making historically. As a protected and inviolate zone, &quot;haram&quot; is also employed referring to the consecrated space in a mosque where rituals and prayer take place: it is the prayer hall.

===Holy site===
&quot;Ḥaram&quot; can also mean a site of high sanctity. The two sites whose Islamic sanctity are unchallengeably the highest of all are &quot;Al-Masjid al-Haram&quot; in Mecca (which is called &quot;Ḥaraman Āminan&quot; (, &quot;Sanctuary (which is) Secure&quot;) in the Quran (28:57; 29:67), and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina, so the Arabic dual form &quot;al-ḥaramān&quot; () or &quot;al-ḥaramayn&quot; () refers to these two places, both of which are in the Hejazi region of the Arabian Peninsula. Since 1986, the Saudi monarchy has disclaimed all royal titles except &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Sanctuaries&quot; or &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; (, ).

In addition, the term &quot;ḥaram&quot; is commonly used to refer to certain other holy sites, such as the Masjid Al-Aqsa (, ) in Jerusalem — though over the protests of some, such as Ibn Taymiyyah, who declared that the only places which could be legitimately called &quot;ḥaram&quot; were Mecca, Medina, and probably also the valley of Wajj in Taif, thus rejecting other places like Hebron and even Jerusalem. In fact, one of the Islamic names of Jerusalem, &quot;thālith al-ḥaramayn&quot; (, literally &quot;the third of the two holy places&quot;) resolves the tension between the unchallengeable pre-eminence of Mecca and Medina versus the desire to recognize Jerusalem as having a special status in Islam in a somewhat paradoxical manner. Jerusalem, being home to Masjid Al-Aqsa (one of the few mosques that are mentioned by name in the Quran, and consequently one of the most important mosques) is normally seen as being holy in its own right.

<text>A ḥima ( &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;inviolate zone&quot; or &quot;private pasture&quot;, refers to an area set aside for the conservation of natural capital, typically fields, wildlife and forests - contrast ḥaram, which defines an area protected for more immediate human purposes.

==Background==
According to the Quran, a Muslim has a specific obligation to practice stewardship over nature, and each species of animals is said to be &quot;its own nation&quot;. &quot;Human beings are God&#x27;s representatives on earth. This means that if they are not charged with maintaining the world, or rending to it, they must at least not destroy it&quot;.

The selection of ḥimas was thus a religious rather than community obligation, and was often undertaken by the ulema.

There are five types of ḥima:
# areas where grazing of domestic animals is prohibited
# areas where grazing is restricted to certain seasons
# beekeeping reserves where grazing is restricted during flowering
# forest areas where cutting of trees is forbidden
# reserves managed for the welfare of a particular village, town or tribe (see also &quot;ḥaram&quot;, although that term usually refers more to water protection measures)

There are good examples of ḥima in the Middle East, some adopted by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

==In The Hadiths==
Directly referenced is Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 49, stating: Narrated An-Nu&#x27;man bin Bashir: I heard Allah&#x27;s Messenger (pbuh) saying, &quot;Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them are doubtful (unclear) things, and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these unclear things, he saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these unclear things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (the private pasture) of someone else, and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah (SwtA) on earth is His illegal things (ie, His forbidden things). Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (ie, reformed), the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoiled, the whole body gets spoiled and that is the heart.&quot;

<text>The Navigation Acts, or more broadly the Acts of Trade and Navigation, were a long series of English laws that developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce with other countries and with its own colonies. The laws also regulated England&#x27;s fisheries and restricted foreign—including Scottish and Irish—participation in its colonial trade. While based on earlier precedents, they were first enacted in 1650 and 1651 under the Commonwealth.

The system was re-enacted and broadened with the Restoration by the Navigation Act 1660, and further developed and tightened by the Navigation Acts of 1663, 1673, and 1696. Upon this basis during the 18th century, the Acts were modified by subsequent amendments, changes, and the addition of enforcement mechanisms and staff. Additionally, a major change in the very purpose of the Acts in the 1760s—that of generating a colonial revenue, rather than only regulating the Empire&#x27;s trade—would help lead to major rebellions, and significant changes in the implementation of the Acts themselves.

The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships, required the employment of English and colonial mariners for 75% of the crews, including East India Company ships. The Acts prohibited colonies from exporting specific, , products to countries other than Britain and those countries&#x27; colonies, and mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain.

Overall, the Acts formed the basis for English (and later) British overseas trade for nearly 200 years, but with the development and gradual acceptance of free trade, the Acts were eventually repealed in 1849. The laws reflected the European economic theory of mercantilism which sought to keep all the benefits of trade inside their respective Empires, and to minimize the loss of gold and silver, or profits, to foreigners through purchases and trade. The system would develop with the colonies supplying raw materials for British industry, and in exchange for this guaranteed market, the colonies would purchase manufactured goods from or through Britain.

The major impetus for the first Navigation Act was the ruinous deterioration of English trade in the aftermath of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and the associated lifting of the Spanish embargoes on trade between the Spanish Empire and the Dutch Republic. The end of the embargoes in 1647 unleashed the full power of the Amsterdam Entrepôt and other Dutch competitive advantages in European and world trade. Within a few years, English merchants had practically been overwhelmed in the Baltic and North sea trade, as well as trade with the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Levant. Even the trade with English colonies (partly still in the hands of the royalists, as the English Civil War was in its final stages and the Commonwealth of England had not yet imposed its authority throughout the English colonies - see English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms) was by Dutch merchants. English direct trade was crowded out by a sudden influx of commodities from the Levant, Mediterranean and the Spanish and Portuguese empires, and the West Indies via the Dutch entrepôt, carried in Dutch ships and for Dutch account.

The obvious solution seemed to be to seal off the English markets to these unwanted imports. A precedent was the Act the Greenland Company had obtained from Parliament in 1645 prohibiting the import of whale products into England, except in ships owned by that company. This principle was now generalized. In 1648 the Levant Company petitioned Parliament for the prohibition of imports of Turkish goods &quot;...from Holland and other places but directly from the places of their growth.&quot; Baltic traders added their voices to this chorus. In 1650 the Standing Council for Trade and the Council of State of the Commonwealth prepared a general policy designed to impede the flow of Mediterranean and colonial commodities via Holland and Zeeland into England.

Following the 1696 act, the Acts of Trade and Navigation were generally obeyed, except for the Molasses Act 1733, which led to extensive smuggling because no effective means of enforcement was provided until the 1760s. Stricter enforcement under the Sugar Act 1764 became one source of resentment among merchants in the American colonies towards Great Britain. This, in turn, helped push the American colonies to rebel in the late 18th century, even though the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the &quot;costs imposed on [American] colonists by the trade restrictions of the Navigation Acts were small.&quot;

==Historical precedents==
Some principles of English mercantile legislation pre-date both the passage of the Navigation Act 1651 and the settlement of England&#x27;s early foreign possessions. A 1381 Act passed under King Richard II provided &quot;that, to increase the navy of England, no goods or merchandises shall be either exported or imported, but only in ships belonging to the King&#x27;s subjects.&quot; The letters patent granted to the Cabots by Henry VII in 1498 stipulated that the commerce resulting from their discoveries must be with England (specifically Bristol). Henry VIII established a second principle by statute: that such a vessel must be English-built and a majority of the crew must be English-born. Legislation during the reign of Elizabeth I also dealt with these questions and resulted in a large increase in English merchant shipping. Soon after actual settlements had been made in America, these early requirements illustrate the English theory then held regarding the governmental control of maritime commerce.

With the establishment of overseas colonies a distinct colonial policy began to develop, and the principles embodied in the early Navigation and Trade Acts also had some more immediate precedents in the provisions of the charters granted to the London and Plymouth Company, in the various royal patents later bestowed by Charles I and Charles II, as well as in the early regulations concerning the tobacco trade, the first profitable colonial export. An Order in Council of 24 October 1621 prohibited the Virginia colony to export tobacco and other commodities to foreign countries. The London Company lost its charter in 1624; the same year a proclamation, followed by Orders in Council, prohibited the use of foreign ships for the Virginia tobacco trade. These early companies held the monopoly on trade with their plantation; this meant that the commerce developed was to be England&#x27;s. The Crown&#x27;s purpose was to restrict to England the future commerce with America; it is well shown in the patent granted by Charles I to William Berkeley in 1639, by which the patentee was &quot;to oblige the masters of vessels, freighted with productions of the colony, to give bond before their departure to bring same into England ... and to forbid all trade with foreign vessels, except upon necessity.&quot;

As early as 1641 some English merchants urged that these rules be embodied in an act of Parliament, and during the Long Parliament, movement began in that direction. The &quot;Ordinance for Free Trade with the plantations in New England&quot; was passed in November 1644. In 1645, both to conciliate the colonies and to encourage English shipping, the Long Parliament prohibited the shipment of whalebone, except in English-built ships; they later prohibited the importation of French wine, wool, and silk from France. More generally and significantly on 23 January 1647, they passed the &quot;Ordinance granting privileges for the encouragement of Adventurers to plantations in Virginia, Bermudas, Barbados, and other places of America&quot;; it enacted that for three years no export duty be levied on goods intended for the colonies, provided they were forwarded in English vessels. Adam Anderson noted that this law also included &quot;security being given here, and certificates from thence, that the said goods be really exported thither, and for the only use of the said plantations&quot;. He concluded: &quot;Hereby the foundation was laid for the navigation acts afterward, which may be justly termed the Commercial of Britain.&quot;

The English were well aware of their inferior competitive trading position. Three acts of the Rump Parliament in 1650 and 1651 are notable in the historical development of England&#x27;s commercial and colonial programs. These include the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament on 1 August 1650, to advance and regulate the nation&#x27;s trade. The instructions to the named commissioners included consideration of both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufacturers, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, but also the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. This act&#x27;s statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions were followed by the October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the first Navigation Act the following October. These acts formed the first definitive expression of England&#x27;s commercial policy. They represent the first attempt to establish a legitimate control of commercial and colonial affairs, and the instructions indicate the beginnings of a policy which had the prosperity and wealth of England exclusively at heart. The 1650 Act prohibiting trade with royalist colonies was broader, however, because it provided that all foreign ships were prohibited from trading with any English plantations, without license, and it was made lawful to seize and make prizes of any ships violating the act. This Act, sometimes referred to as the Navigation Act 1650, was hastily passed as a war measure during the English Civil Wars, but it was followed by a more carefully conceived Navigation Act 1651 the following year.

==Navigation Act 1651==

The Navigation Act 1651, long titled &quot;An Act for increase of Shipping, and Encouragement of the Navigation of this Nation,&quot; was passed on 9 October 1651 by the Rump Parliament led by Oliver Cromwell. It authorized the Commonwealth to regulate England&#x27;s international trade, as well as the trade with its colonies. It reinforced long-standing principles of national policy that English trade and fisheries should be carried in English vessels.

The Act banned foreign ships from transporting goods from Asia, Africa or America to England or its colonies; only ships with an English owner, master and a majority English crew would be accepted. It allowed European ships to import their own products, but banned foreign ships from transporting goods to England from a third country elsewhere in the European sphere. The Act also prohibited the import and export of salted fish in foreign ships, and penalized foreign ships carrying fish and wares between English posts. Breaking the terms of the act would result in the forfeiture of the ship and its cargo. These rules specifically targeted the Dutch, who controlled much of Europe&#x27;s international trade and even much of England&#x27;s coastal shipping. It excluded the Dutch from essentially all direct trade with England, as the Dutch economy was competitive with, not complementary to the English, and the two countries, therefore, exchanged few commodities. This Anglo-Dutch trade, however, constituted only a small fraction of total Dutch trade flows.

Passage of the act was a reaction to the failure of the English diplomatic mission (led by Oliver St John and Walter Strickland) to The Hague seeking a political union of the Commonwealth with the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, after the States of Holland had made some cautious overtures to Cromwell to counter the monarchical aspirations of stadtholder William II of Orange. The stadtholder had suddenly died, however, and the States were now embarrassed by Cromwell taking the idea too seriously. The English proposed the joint conquest of all remaining Spanish and Portuguese possessions. England would take America and the Dutch would take Africa and Asia. But the Dutch had just ended their war with Spain and already taken over most Portuguese colonies in Asia, so they saw little advantage in this grandiose scheme and proposed a free trade agreement as an alternative to a full political union. This again was unacceptable to the English, who would be unable to compete on such a level playing field, and was seen by them as a deliberate affront. The Act is often mentioned as a major cause of the First Anglo-Dutch War, and though there were others, it was only part of a larger English policy to engage in war after the negotiations had failed. The English naval victories in 1653 (the Battles of Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen) showed the supremacy of the Commonwealth navy in home waters. However, farther afield the Dutch predominated and were able to close down English commerce in the Baltic and the Mediterranean. Both countries held each other in a stifling embrace.

The Treaty of Westminster (1654) ended the impasse. The Dutch failed to have the Act repealed or amended, but it seems to have had relatively little influence on their trade. The Act offered England only limited solace. It could not limit the deterioration of England&#x27;s overseas trading position, except in the cases where England herself was the principal consumer, such as the Canaries wine trade and the trade in Puglian olive oil. In the trade with America and the West Indies, the Dutch kept up a flourishing &quot;smuggling&quot; trade, thanks to the preference of English planters for Dutch import goods and the better deal the Dutch offered in the sugar trade. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands offered a loophole (through intercolonial trade) wide enough to drive a shipload of Virginian tobacco through.

==Post-Restoration Navigation Acts to 1696==
Like all laws of the Commonwealth period, the 1651 act was declared void on the Restoration of Charles II, having been passed by &#x27;usurping powers&#x27;. Nonetheless, with benefits of the act widely recognized, Parliament soon passed new legislation which enlarged its scope. While the act of 1651 applied only to shipping, or the ocean carrying business, the 1660 act was the most important piece of commercial legislation as it related to shipbuilding, to navigation, to trade, and to the benefit of the merchant class. The 1660 act is generally considered to be the basis of the &quot;Navigation Acts&quot;, which (with later amendments, additions and exceptions) remained in force for nearly two centuries. The navigation acts entitled colonial shipping and seamen to enjoy the full benefits of the otherwise exclusively English provisions. &quot;English bottoms&quot; included vessels built in English plantations, particularly in America. There were no restrictions put in the way of English colonists who might wish to build or trade in their own ships to foreign plantations or other European countries besides England, provided they did not violate the enumerated commodity clause. Some of the most important products of colonial America, including grain of all sorts and the fisheries of New England, were always non-enumerated commodities.

===Navigation Act 1660===
The Navigation Act 1660 , long-titled &quot;An Act for the Encourageing and increasing of Shipping and Navigation&quot;, was passed on 13 September by the Convention Parliament and confirmed by the Cavalier Parliament on 27 July 1661. The act broadened and strengthened restrictions under Cromwell&#x27;s earlier act. Colonial imports and exports were now restricted to ships &quot;as doe truly and without fraud belong onely to the people of England ... or are of the built of and belonging to&quot; any of the English possessions. Additionally, ships&#x27; crews now had to be 75% English, rather than just a majority, and ship captains were required to post a bond to ensure compliance and could recoup the funds upon arrival. The penalty for non-compliance was the forfeiture of both the ship and its cargo. The act provides that violations of the navigation act were to be tried in &quot;any court of record,&quot; but it also authorizes and strictly requires all commanders of ships of war to seize non-English ships and deliver them to the Court of Admiralty.

The act specified seven colonial products, known as &quot;enumerated&quot; commodities or items, that were to be shipped from the colonies only to England or other English colonies. These items were tropical or semi-tropical produce that could not be grown in the mother country, but were of higher economic value and used in English competitive manufacturing. The initial products included sugar, tobacco, cotton wool, indigo, ginger, fustic, or other dyeing woods. Previously only tobacco export had been restricted to England. Additional enumerated items would be included in subsequent navigation acts, for example the cocoa bean was added in 1672, after drinking chocolate became the fashion.

In a significant bow to English merchants and to the detriment of numerous foreign colonists, section two of the act declared that &quot;no alien or person not born within the allegiance of our sovereign lord the King, his heirs and successors, or naturalized or made a free denizen, shall... exercise the trade or occupation of a merchant or factor in any of the said places&quot; (i.e. lands, islands, plantations, or territories belonging to the King in Asia, Africa, or America), upon pain of forfeiting all goods and chattels.


Passage of the Navigation Act 1660 act was immediately followed by the Customs Act 1660 , which established how the customs duties would be collected by the government, as well as for subsidies (tunnage and poundage) for royal expenses. These acts of revenue, previously established under the Commonwealth, were similarly reauthorized with the restoration. The 1660 customs act was tightened by the Customs Act 1662 . It also emphatically defines &quot;Englishmen&quot; under the Navigation Acts: &quot;Whereas it is required by the [Navigation Act 1660] that in sundry cases the Master and three-fourths of the Mariners are to be English, it is to be understood that any of His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects of England, Ireland, and His Plantations are to be accounted English and no others.&quot;

Other acts relating to trade were passed in the same session of Parliament and reiterated previous acts. These include the Exportation Act 1660 , which bans the export of wool and wool-processing materials, and the Tobacco Planting and Sowing Act 1660 , which prohibits growing tobacco in England and Ireland. The former act was intended to encourage domestic woolen manufacturing by increasing the availability of domestic raw materials; the latter act was passed to limit competition with the colonies and protect the plantations&#x27; main crop, as well as to protect this regulated royal revenue stream. With the kingdoms of England and Scotland still separate, passage of the English act lead to the passage of a similar navigation act by the Parliament of Scotland. After the Act of Union 1707, Scottish ships, merchants, and mariners enjoyed the same privileges.

===Navigation Act 1663===
The Navigation Act 1663 (15 Cha. 2. c. 7), long-titled &quot;An Act for the Encouragement of Trade&quot;, also termed the Encouragement of Trade Act 1663 or the Staple Act, was passed on 27 July. This strengthening of the navigation system now required all European goods, bound for America and other colonies, had to be trans-shipped through England first. In England, the goods would be unloaded, inspected, approved, duties paid, and finally, reloaded for the destination. This trade had to be carried in English vessels (&quot;bottoms&quot;) or those of its colonies. Furthermore, imports of the &#x27;enumerated&#x27; commodities (such as tobacco and cotton) had to be landed and taxes paid before continuing to other countries. &quot;England&quot;, as used here, includes Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed, though those places were little involved in colonial trade. The mercantile purpose of the act was to make England the for all European products bound for the colonies, and to prevent the colonies from establishing an independent import trade. This mandated change increased shipping times and costs, which in turn, increased the prices paid by the colonists. Due to these increases, some exemptions were allowed; these included salt intended for the New England and Newfoundland fisheries, wine from Madeira and the Azores, and provisions, servants and horses from Scotland and Ireland.

The most important new legislation embedded in this Act, as seen from the perspective of the interests behind the East India Company, was the repeal of legislation which prohibited export of coin and bullion from England overseas. This export was the real issue behind the Act, as silver was the main export article by the East India Company into India, exchanging the silver into cheap Indian gold. This change had major implications for the East India Company, for England and for India. The majority of silver in England was exported to India, creating enormous profits for the individual participants, but depriving the Crown of England of necessary silver and taxation. Much of the silver exported was procured by English piracy directed against Spanish and Portuguese merchant ships bringing silver from their colonies in the Americas to Europe. It was later revealed that the Act passed Parliament due to enormous bribes paid by the East Indian Company to various influential members of Parliament.


An act tightening colonial trade legislation, and sometimes referred to as the Navigation Act 1670, is the Tobacco Planting and Plantation Trade Act 1670 (22 &amp; 23 Cha. 2. c. 26). This act imposes forfeiture penalties of the ship and cargo if enumerated commodities are shipped without a bond or customs certificate, or if shipped to countries other than England, or if ships unload sugar or enumerated products in any port except in England. The act requires the governors of American plantations to report annually to customs in London a list of all ships loading any commodities there, as well as a list of all bonds taken. The act states that prosecutions for a breach of the navigation acts should be tried in the court of the high admiral of England, in any of the vice-admiralty courts, or in any court of record in England, but while the act again hints at the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, it does not explicitly provide for them. In a move against Ireland, the act additionally repealed the ability of Ireland (in the 1660 act) to obtain the necessary bond for products shipped to overseas colonies.

The specifically anti-Dutch aspects of the early acts were in full force for a relatively short time. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War the English had to abandon the Baltic trade and allowed foreign ships to enter the coasting and plantation trade. Following the war, which ended disastrously for England, the Dutch obtained the right to ship commodities produced in their German hinterland to England as if these were Dutch goods. Even more importantly, as England accepted the concept of neutrality, it conceded the principle of &quot;free ships make free goods&quot; which provided freedom from molestation by the Royal Navy of Dutch shipping on the high seas during wars in which the Dutch Republic was neutral. This more or less gave the Dutch freedom to conduct their &quot;smuggling&quot; unhindered as long as they were not caught red-handed in territorial waters controlled by England. These provisions were reconfirmed in the Treaty of Westminster (1674) after the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

===Navigation Act 1673===
The so-called Navigation Act 1673 (25 Cha. 2. c. 7), long-titled &quot;An Act for the of the Greeneland and Eastland Trades, and for the better the Plantation Trade&quot; became enforceable at various dates in that year; the act is short titled the Trade Act 1672. The act was intended to increase English capability and production in the northern whale fishery (more accurately in Spitsbergen), as well as in the eastern Baltic and North Sea trade, where the Dutch and Hansa dominated commerce and trade. The act also closed a significant loophole in the enumerated goods trade as a result of the active inter-colonial trade.

To promote whaling and production of its oil and whalebone etc., the act relaxed the 1660 act&#x27;s restrictions on foreigners, allowing up to half the crew, if on English ships, and dropped all duties on these products for the next ten years. It also allowed foreign residents and foreigners to participate in this trade if imported to England in English ships. Colonial ships and crews engaged in this trade had to pay a low duty, with foreign ships paying a high duty. To promote the eastern trade then monopolized by the chartered and poorly performing Eastland Company, the act opened their trade with Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to foreigners and English alike. It also allowed any Englishman to be admitted into the Eastland Company on paying a minor fee. The act was a mortal blow to Eastland&#x27;s royal charter.

To better secure their own plantation trade from considerable illegal indirect trade in enumerated products to Europe, by way of legal inter-colonial trade, the act instituted that customs duties and charges should be paid on departure from the colonies, if traveling without first obtaining the bond required to carry the goods to England. The purpose of the act was to stop the carrying of plantation goods to another plantation with their subsequent shipment to a foreign country on the grounds that the 1660 act&#x27;s requirements had been fulfilled. This change was a considerable advance toward the systematic execution of the previous acts, and increased much needed royal revenue given the recent Stop of the Exchequer. To better collect the customs revenue the act established that these were now to be levied and collected by the Commissioners of Customs in England. Also, if a ship arrived with insufficient funds to pay the duties, customs official could accept an equivalent proportion of the goods as payment instead.
===Navigation Act 1696===
The so-called Navigation Act 1696 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 22), long-titled &quot;An Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abuses in the Plantation Trade&quot;, became effective over in the next few years, due to its far reaching provisions; the act is short-titled the Plantation Trade Act 1695. It contains new restrictions on colonial trade, and several different administrative provisions to strengthen enforcement and consolidate the earlier acts.

In tightening the wording of the 1660 act, and after noting the daily &quot;great abuses [being] committed ... by the artifice and cunning of ill disposed persons&quot;, this act now required that no goods or merchandise could be imported, exported, or carried between English possessions in Africa, Asia and America, or shipped to England, Wales, or Berwick upon Tweed, except in &quot;what is or shall bee of the Built of England or of the Built of Ireland or the said Colonies or Plantations and wholly owned by the People thereof ... and navigated with the Masters and Three-Fourths of the Mariners of the said Places onely&quot;. To enforce this change, the act required the registration of all ships and owners, including an oath that they have no foreign owners, before the ship would be considered English-built. Exceptions were introduced for foreign-built ships taken as prize, or those employed by the navy for importing naval stores from the plantations. The deadline for the registration of ships was extended by the Registering of Ships Act 1697 (9 Will 3 c. 42) In a significant tightening of the navigation enforcement system, section 6 of the act establishes that violations are to be tried &quot;in any of His Majesties Courts att Westminster or [in the Kingdome of Ireland or in the Court of Admiralty held in His Majesties Plantations respectively where such Offence shall bee committed att the Pleasure of the Officer or Informer or in any other Plantation belonging to any Subject of England]&quot;... Revenue generated was to be split in thirds between the King, the Governor, and the one who informed and sued.

Previously, most of the customs collection and enforcement in the colonies was performed by the governor or his appointees, commonly known as the &quot;naval officer,&quot; but evasion, corruption and indifference were common. The 1696 act now required all current governors and officers to take an oath that all and every clause contained in the act be &quot;punctually and bona fide observed according to the true intent and meaning&quot;. Governors nominated in the future were required to take this oath before assuming office. To tighten compliance among colonial customs officials, the act required that all current and future officers give a security bond to the Commissioners of the Customs in England to undertake the &quot;true and faithfull performance of their duty&quot;. Additionally, the act gave colonial customs officers the same power and authority as of customs officers in England; these included the ability to board and search ships and warehouses, load and unload cargoes, and seize those imported or exported goods prohibited or those for which duties should have been paid under the acts. Commissioners of the treasury and of the customs in England would now appoint the colonial customs officials. Due to colonial &quot;doubts or misconstructions&quot; concerning the bond required under the 1660 act, the 1696 act now mandated that no enumerated goods could be loaded or shipped until the required bond was obtained. The act was followed by a special instruction about the oaths and proprietary governors who weren&#x27;t directly under royal control to post a bond to comply; this was considered by the Board of Trade and issued on 26 May 1697.

Since the colonies previously had passed much of their own legislation and appointments, the act included several sections to tighten English control over the colonies generally. The act mandated that all colonial positions of trust in the courts or related to the treasury must be native born subjects of England, Ireland or the colonies. It also enacted that all laws, bylaws, usages or customs in current or future use in the plantations, which are found to be repugnant to the navigation acts in any way, are to be declared illegal, null and void. The act additionally declared that all persons or their heirs claiming any right or property &quot;in any Islands or Tracts of Land upon the Continent of America by Charter or Letters Patent shall not in the future alienate, sell or dispose of any of the Islands, Tracts of Land, or Proprieties other than to the Natural Born Subjects of England, Ireland, Dominion of Wales or Town of Berwick upon Tweed without the License and Consent of His Majesty&quot;. Colonial-born subjects were not mentioned. Such a sale must be signified by a prior Order in Council.

With this act the government did start to institute admiralty courts and staff them in more and new places; this established &quot;a more general obedience to the Acts of Trade and Navigation.&quot; John Reeves, who wrote the handbook for the Board of Trade, considered the 1696 act to be the last major navigation act, with relatively minor subsequent acts. The system established by this act, and upon previous acts, was where the Navigation Acts still stood in 1792, though there would be major policy changes followed by their reversals in the intervening years.

==Navigation Acts 1696–1760==
===Molasses Act 1733===
The 1733 Molasses Act levied heavy duties on the trade of sugar from the French West Indies to the American colonies, forcing the colonists to buy the more expensive sugar from the British West Indies instead. The law was widely flouted, but efforts by the British to prevent smuggling created hostility and contributed to the American Revolution. The Molasses Act was the first of the Sugar Acts. The Act was set to expire in 1763, but in 1764 it was renewed as the Sugar Act, which caused further unrest among the colonists.
==Repeal==
The Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849 under the influence of a &quot;free trade&quot; philosophy. The Navigation Acts were passed under the economic theory of mercantilism, under which wealth was to be increased by restricting colonial trade to the mother country rather than through free trade. By 1849 &quot;a central part of British import strategy was to reduce the cost of food through cheap foreign imports and in this way to reduce the cost of maintaining labour power&quot; (van Houten). Repealing the Navigation Acts along with the Corn Laws eventually served this purpose (towards the end of the century).

==Effects on Britain==
The Acts caused Britain&#x27;s (before 1707, England&#x27;s) shipping industry to develop in isolation. However, it had the advantage to British shippers of severely limiting the ability of Dutch ships to participate in the carrying trade to Britain. By reserving British colonial trade to British shipping, the Acts may have significantly assisted in the growth of London as a major entry port for American colonial wares at the expense of Dutch cities. The maintenance of a certain level of merchant shipping and of trade generally also facilitated a rapid increase in the size and quality of the Royal Navy, which eventually (after the Anglo-Dutch Alliance of 1689 limited the Dutch navy to three-fifths of the size of the English one) led to Britain becoming a global superpower, which it remained until the mid-20th century. That naval might, however, never limited Dutch trading power – because the Dutch enjoyed enough leverage over overseas markets and shipping resources (combined with a financial power that was only overtaken by Britain during the 18th century) to enable them to put enough pressure on Britain to prevent them from sustaining naval campaigns long enough to wrest maritime concessions from the Dutch.

==Effects on American colonies==
The Navigation Acts, while enriching Britain, caused resentment in the colonies and contributed to the American Revolution. The Navigation Acts required all of a colony&#x27;s imports to be either bought from Britain or resold by British merchants in Britain, regardless of the price obtainable elsewhere. In the 1772 &quot;Gaspee&quot; affair, colonists attacked and burned a British navy ship enforcing the Navigation Acts off the coast of Rhode Island.

Historian Robert argues that the impact of the Acts on the economies of the Thirteen Colonies was minimal; the cost was about £4 per £1,000 of income per year. The average personal income was about £100 per year. However, says that although the net burden imposed by the Acts was small in size, their overall impact on the shape and growth rate of the economy was significant since the Acts differentially affected different groups, helping some and hurting others.

Walton concludes that the political friction caused by the Acts was more serious than the negative economic impact, especially since the merchants most affected were politically the most active. The Navigation Acts were also partially responsible for an increase in piracy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: merchants and colonial officials would buy goods captured by pirates below market value, and colonial governors such as New York&#x27;s Fletcher would commission privateers who openly admitted they intended to turn pirate.

 points out that the political issue is what would have been the future impact of the Acts after 1776 as the colonial economy matured and was blocked by the Acts from serious competition with British manufacturers. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 89 percent of economists and historians would generally agree that the &quot;costs imposed on [American] colonists by the trade restrictions of the Navigation Acts were small.&quot;

 notes that timber was not one of the &quot;enumerated commodities&quot; included in the Acts, and so New Englanders could continue the wine islands commerce in timber that began around 1642 without upsetting England. By the 1660s, the wine islands region, namely Madeira, was the dominant trading partner in timber with the New England colonies.

==Effect on Ireland==
The acts were resented in Ireland and damaged its economy, as they permitted the importation of English goods into Ireland tariff-free and simultaneously imposed tariffs on Irish exports travelling in the opposite direction. Other clauses completely prohibited the exportation of certain goods to Britain or even elsewhere, resulting in the collapse of those markets. The Wool Act 1699, for example, forbade any exports of wool from Ireland (and from the American colonies) so as to maximise the English trade.

&quot;Free trade or a Speedy Revolution&quot; was a slogan of the Irish Volunteers in the late 18th century.

<text>César de Choiseul, 1st Duke of Choiseul, comte du Plessis-Praslin (1602 – 23 December 1675) was a Marshal of France and French diplomat, generally known for the best part of his life as the Maréchal (Marshal) du Plessis-Praslin.

A member of the illustrious House of Choiseul, which arose in the valley of the Upper Marne in the 10th century and divided into many branches, three of them whose names (&quot;Hostel&quot;, &quot;Praslin&quot; and &quot;du Plessis&quot;) were borne, at one time or another, by César. Entering the army at the age of fourteen as proprietary colonel of an infantry regiment, he shared almost all the exploits of the French Royal Army during the reign of Louis XIII. He took part in the Siege of La Rochelle as well as in the defence of the Isle of Ré and Isle of Oléron against the English under the Duke of Buckingham, and accompanied the French forces to Italy in 1629.

In 1630 he became the French ambassador to the court of Duke Victor Amadeus I of Savoy, and engaged in diplomatic and administrative work in Italy until 1635, when the Franco-Spanish War broke out. In the war that followed, Plessis-Praslin distinguished himself in various battles and sieges in Italy, including the action called the &quot;Route de Quiers&quot; and the celebrated four-cornered operations round Turin. In 1640 he became governor of Turin, and in 1642 lieutenant-general, and after further service in Italy he became a Marshal of France (1645) and second in command in Catalonia, where he took Roses.

During the first war of the Fronde (1648–1649), he assisted Condé in the brief siege of Paris (January 1649); and in the second war of the Fronde (1650–1653), remaining loyal to the queen regent Anne of Austria and the court party, he won his greatest triumph when he defeated an army of rebels and Spaniards led by Turenne at the Battle of Rethel (or Blanc-Champ) in 1650.

He then held high office at the court of Louis XIV, became minister of state in 1652, and in November 1665 was created duc de Choiseul. He was concerned in some of the negotiations between Louis and Charles II of England which led to the treaty of Dover (1670), and died in Paris on 23 December 1675.

Food historians generally attribute the &quot;invention&quot; of praline to Lassagne, officer of the table to Marechal du Plessis, duke of Choiseul-Praslin

==Plot==
After their boss is killed during a bank robbery, London gangsters Brian Hope and Charlie McManus desire to lead more peaceful lives in Brazil, disapproving of their new younger and more brash boss, Casey. While planning to rob a local Triad gang of their ill-gotten drug money, Brian meets and falls in love with a waitress, Faith. During the robbery, Brian and Charlie betray their fellow gangsters, Abbott and Morley, steal the money and flee, but are forced to abandon their car when it runs out of petrol and seek refuge in a nearby nunnery during the ensuing gunfight. Faith, who had tried to warn Brian beforehand, is shot in the wrist by Abbott, while one of the triads is shot and hospitalised. After this, Casey places a bounty on Brian and Charlie&#x27;s heads.

Disguising themselves as nuns, Brian and Charlie introduce themselves to the Sister Superior, Liz, as Sisters Inviolata and Euphemia, respectively. Faith, having witnessed the gunfight and Brian and Charlie fleeing into the nunnery, follows them and poses as a mature student to get inside. Her gunshot wound is exposed and she is taken to the infirmary. Brian pays her a secret visit and claims he is married in order to end their relationship for her safety. When Faith intends to go to church and confess, Charlie distracts the priest, Father Seamus, while Brian poses as him. Faith admits she still loves Brian, but Brian convinces Faith to keep silent. On her way out, she is abducted by the Triads and interrogated. She directs them to Casey and they set her free, but bumps into a lamppost and hits her head on the road, ending up in the hospital, where one Triad has infiltrated the staff as a cleaner. Brian and Charlie acquire tickets to Brazil, despite Brian&#x27;s desire to take Faith with them.

Brian decides to tell Faith the truth, but discovers she has not returned to the nunnery. They go to her flat and only barely escape from Abbott and Morley, who had been sent to retrieve her by Casey. They sneak back into the nunnery and manage to slip into their spare habits after accidentally waking up an eccentric nun, Sister Mary. In conversation, Brian learns that Faith is in the hospital, with her father and brother who are protecting her from the gang. He visits her, but she is heartbroken, believing that Brian no longer loves her. They wake up and leave for the airport the next morning, but are caught and exposed by Sister Mary. In desperation, they steal a utility and drive to the airport pursued by Sisters Liz and Mary, Morley and Abbott, and eventually Casey and the Triads. Brian forces Charlie to go to the hospital, where Brian tells Faith the truth while Charlie stalls the gangsters. They manage to escape the hospital with Faith and Casey is arrested, though one briefcase of money is lost during the chase. Sister Liz and Sister Mary find the lost briefcase and, ignoring the police concerns, decide to use it to fund a drug rehabilitation clinic. Sister Liz then leads the nuns in prayer, thanking God for sending them Sisters Euphemia and Inviolata, and asking him to, &quot;keep on eye on them, won&#x27;t you? They need you.&quot;

Brian, Charlie and Faith reach the airport and check-in, when an airport policeman warns the attendant about Brian and Charlie. They board the flight on board a British Airways Boeing 747-200 jumbo jet, disguised as attendants and successfully escape the UK for Brazil.

==Production==
Filming of the convent exterior took place at St. Michael &amp; All Angels Church on Priory Avenue, Chiswick, west London. Interior shots were done at former Royal Masonic School for Boys at Bushey in Hertfordshire. Other locations include White City, Putney and other parts of central London.

==Release==
The film opened in the United States first on 16 March 1990. It opened at the Odeon Haymarket in London on 4 May 1990 before opening nationwide in the UK on 25 May 1990.
==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was criticised in the United States for its lack of depth and excessive use of nuns for humour. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 42% rating based on reviews from 26 critics, with an average rating of 4.6/10.

Roger Ebert asked, &quot;Why do filmmakers so often insist that nuns are funny? I&#x27;ll bet there are some psychological reasons buried around here somewhere.&quot; Ebert and Gene Siskel had also ridiculed Fox&#x27;s advertising campaign for the film; in retaliation, Fox&#x27;s president of marketing, Bob Harper, announced that they would be barred from press screenings of future films released by the company, though he backed down after only three weeks under pressure from the Chicago Film Critics Association (of which neither Siskel nor Ebert was a member). Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that as far as drag comedies go, the film &quot;has some bawdy class—but only because of its casting&quot;.

Vincent Canby wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;&quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; is a great leveler. It makes everyone in the audience feel a rascally 8 years old, the age at which whoopee cushions (when they work) seem the greatest invention since firecrackers.&quot; Owen Gleiberman wrote in one of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; first issues that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t a madcap-hysterical, end-of-the-empire drag farce; it doesn&#x27;t hash over what Monty Python did definitively over 20 years ago. It&#x27;s a cleverly directed caper comedy about two crooks on the lam, and it has its fair share of chuckles.&quot;

===Box office===

The film was successful in the US on limited release, making $658,835 in its first screenings at 76 theatres. &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; grossed US$10,959,015, according to Box Office Mojo.

It made £3.2 million at the UK box office.

== Home media ==

The distribution rights for &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; were initially held by Anchor Bay Entertainment for DVD release in the United Kingdom. The original DVD was made available on 8 April 2002. A second printing was released on 10 October 2005 under its subsidiary &#x27;Bay View&#x27;, while a third and final release came from Anchor Bay, alongside &quot;Time Bandits&quot; in a &#x27;Double Disc Box Set&#x27; on 6 February 2006. After which, the then Optimum Releasing (now StudioCanal UK) released the film on 4 January 2010. Arrow Films currently hold distribution rights to the film as all previous releases are now out-of-print. Arrow released &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; to DVD on 27 June 2016, with a reissue distributed on 17 April 2019.

<text>Kayahan Açar (29 March 1949 – 3 April 2015) was a Turkish pop music singer-songwriter. He was an accomplished composer, consistently ranking among the best-selling Turkish musicians of all time. Kayahan composed all of his own material and released more than eight best-selling albums during a career spanning three decades. Kayahan released a number of compact cassettes, CDs and albums and had major singles. He represented Turkey in Eurovision Song Contest 1990 with &quot;Gözlerinin Hapsindeyim&quot;.

==Early years==
Kayahan Açar was born in İzmir, Turkey on 29 March 1949. He spent his childhood and young adulthood years in Ankara before moving to Istanbul.
==Career==
He became known for his songs &quot;Geceler&quot; (&quot;Nights&quot;), &quot;Kar Taneleri&quot; (&quot;Snow Flakes&quot;), &quot;Esmer Günler&quot; (&quot;Brunette Days&quot;), which were sung by Nilüfer, all becoming later classical.

His album &quot;Yemin Ettim&quot; (I Swore), released on 3 June 1991, became a bestseller. He coined a motto &quot;Yolu sevgiden geçen herkesle bir gün bir yerde buluşuruz&quot; (One day, we will meet everyone somewhere, whose path goes through love&quot;. He wrote and composed also songs for children, and appeared in television shows for children.

On 30 April 1992, he released the album &quot;Odalarda Işıksızım&quot; (Lightless in the Rooms). Ten songs of Kayahan in the album titled &quot;Son Şarkılarım&quot; (My Last Songs), released by the label Raks Müzik in March 1993, became very successful. He continued his career with the albums &quot;Benim Penceremden&quot; (&quot;From My Window&quot;), released in January 1995. The song &quot;Allah&#x27;ım Neydi Günahım&quot; (&quot;God, What Was My Sin?&quot;) has been sung by many singers, and brought him great success. With this album, he introduced to the music world a new, young and talented singer, İpek Tüter, whom he married later in 1999.

Kayahan&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Canımın Yaprakları&quot; (&quot;Leaves of My Life&quot;) had eight songs and expressed &quot;Allah kimseyi sevgisiz bırakmasın&quot; (May God not leave anyone without love), emphasizing the concept &quot;love&quot; with &quot;Sevgisiz hiçbir şey yapılmaz. Herşeyin başı sevgidir&quot; (Nothing can be done without love. The beginning of everything is love). The next year, he released the album &quot;Emrin Olur&quot; (Your Call). His ninth album &quot;Beni Azad Et&quot; (Set Me Free) came out in April 1999, and featured nine songs, some of them becoming hits. Among them was a song, &quot;Gömeç&quot;, the name of a seaside resort in Balıkesir Province, where he has a residence with a special music studio and where he spent most of his summer time. The album &quot;Gönül Sayfam&quot; (My Soul&#x27;s Page), released 26 November 2000, containing the songs &quot;17 Ağustos&quot; (17 August) commemorating the earthquake of 17 August 1999 and &quot;Ninni&quot; (Lullaby) for his new-born daughter Aslı Gönül. In &quot;Ne Oldu Can&quot; (What Happened Dear), released 17 December 2002, Kayahan emphasized the importance of the musicians and artists with his song &quot;Bugün Aslında Bayram&quot; (Today Is Indeed, Feastday), he wrote in memory of the late singer-songwriter Barış Manço.

Kayahan received his first important award &quot;Altın Portakal&quot; (Golden Orange) with the song &quot;Geceler&quot; (Nights) at the 1986 International Mediterranean Music Contest. He represented Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 with his song &quot;Gözlerinin Hapsindeyim&quot; (I&#x27;m captive in your eyes), which came 17th. In 2003, he was honored with the Altın Kelebek (Golden Butterfly), and the MÜYAP (Music Producers Association) award for the bestselling-success of the album &quot;Ne Oldu Can&quot;. He released &quot;Kelebeğin Şansı&quot; (The Luck of the Butterfly) in 2005, and &quot;Biriciğime&quot; (To My One and Only) on 15 March 2007. He performed many concerts in Turkey and abroad. For his open-air concert held at Kızılay Square in Ankara on the occasion of the Republic Day in 1992, a crowd of about 160,000 people came together. Kayahan performed many relief benefit concerts to create or increase awareness about the environment.

==Personal life==
Açar was married three times. He made his first marriage to Nur in 1973. From this marriage, which lasted 18 years long, he became father of a daughter Beste (Turkish for music composition), born in 1975. Beste was runner-up for Miss Turkey in 1995. Kayahan remarried to Lale Yılmaz in 1992. The couple divorced in 1993. In 1999, at age fifty, he remarried to his third and current wife 1976-born İpek Tüter. In August 2000, İpek gave birth to their daughter Aslı Gönül.

==Illness and death==
In 1990, Kayahan was diagnosed with soft-tissue cancer. He caught the same disease in 2005 again. The illness repeated in 2014, and he was under treatment for cancer.

Kayahan died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on 3 April 2015, aged 66, in a hospital in Istanbul. He had been battling small-cell lung cancer since one-and-half years. He had overcome the disease twice before. After a Valentine&#x27;s Day concert he lately performed with Nilüfer on 14 February 2015, he bid a public farewell to his fans.

He was buried in Kanlıca Cemetery, which overlooks Bosphorus, following a memorial ceremony in Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall, and the religious funeral service at Teşvikiye Mosque, attended also by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a great number of renowned musicians. He was survived by his wife İpek Açar, and daughters Aslı Gönül and Beste.

==Tribute==
Turkish musicians contributed to and sang for a tribute album, &quot;Kayahan&#x27;ın En İyileri No.1&quot; to celebrate his music and legacy. Of the popular Turkish artists, taking part were Tarkan, Sezen Aksu, Sıla, Nilüfer, Gülşen, Ajda Pekkan, Mustafa Ceceli, Emre Aydın among several others.

<text>Jonathan Adam Lynn (born 3 April 1943) is an English stage and film director, producer, writer, and actor. He directed the comedy films &quot;Clue&quot;, &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot;, &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, and &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot;. He also co-created and co-wrote the television series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

==Early life==
Lynn was born in Bath, Somerset, the son of physician Robin Lynn and sculptor Ruth Helen (née Eban), whose first cousin on her mother&#x27;s side was the neurologist Oliver Sacks. Another cousin, Caroline Sacks, married Nicholas Samuel, 5th Viscount Bearsted. Lynn was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, between 1954 and 1961, after which he studied law at Pembroke College, Cambridge. (His maternal uncle, Israeli statesman Abba Eban, had also studied at Cambridge in the 1930s.) There he participated in the Cambridge University Footlights Club revue &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; (appearing with the revue in 1964 on Broadway and on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;).

==Career==
===Acting===
Lynn&#x27;s first West End appearance was in a stage production of &quot;Green Julia&quot;, for which he was nominated for the 1965 Plays and Players Award as Most Promising New Actor. In 1967, he played Motel the tailor in the original West End production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (production recorded by CBS Records). From the late 1960s, Lynn was appearing in and writing television sitcoms, including the television comedy series &quot;Twice a Fortnight&quot; with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Tony Buffery.

Lynn played the Irish medical student Danny Hooley in the second series of the television comedy &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; in 1970. He wrote some episodes for &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;, &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;, &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot; and &quot;Doctor on the Go&quot;. As a TV actor, his most memorable roles included Beryl&#x27;s boyfriend Robert in early series of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, the role of Harold in Jack Rosenthal&#x27;s 1976 television film &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot;, and the role of Ted Margolis in Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;The Knowledge&quot; (1979). He had a bit-part as a window cleaner in the BBC television series &quot;The Good Life&quot;. His film appearances have included roles in &quot;Prudence and the Pill&quot; (1968), &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; (1971), &quot;Romance with a Double Bass&quot; (1974), and &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot; (1990).

Lynn is a guest instructor at HB Studio.

===Screenwriting===
Lynn&#x27;s first (co-written) screenplay was for &quot;The Internecine Project&quot;, which was released in 1974. For television he wrote episodes for the &quot;Doctor&quot; TV series and &quot;On the Buses&quot; and wrote for Harry Worth and George Layton before eventually, in partnership with Antony Jay, writing &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. His later writing credits include the first two films he directed, &quot;Clue&quot; (1985) and &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; (1990). He is also known for his co-writing, co-producing, and co-directing of the revived &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; series produced by the BBC on Gold in 2013.

===Books===
Lynn co-authored the books &quot;The Complete Yes Minister&quot;, as well as &quot;The Complete Yes Prime Minister&quot;, which spent 106 weeks on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; top 10 fiction list. Both were ranked number one on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; list, including in December 1986 when the books were ranked number one and number two respectively. He also wrote the 1993 novel &quot;Mayday&quot;. In 2011 Lynn wrote a non-fiction work entitled &quot;Comedy Rules&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper called the book &quot;a charming memoir, full of amusing and insightful anecdotes about the many entertainers Lynn has worked with&quot; and described it as a combination of autobiography and how-to manual for comedy. The paper wrote further: &quot;By dovetailing different types of book, Lynn cleverly avoids the pitfalls of both genres. Because it&#x27;s ostensibly a sort of how-to book, there are no boring childhood reminiscences. Because it&#x27;s also a kind of autobiography, his no-nonsense dos and don&#x27;ts are springboards for entertaining yarns, rather than academic discourse.&quot;

===Plays===
Lynn won praise for his direction of the 2010 London stage version of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, which he co-wrote as well.

In 2016 Lynn&#x27;s play &quot;The Patriotic Traitor&quot; was published. Its subject is the relationship of Philippe Pétain to Charles de Gaulle. In the words of the blurb, ‘Two giants of the twentieth century who loved each other like father and son until they found themselves on opposing sides in World War II. In 1945 de Gaulle had his oldest friend tried for treason. Their complex relationship – noble, comic and absurd – changed history.’ 

Lynn also co-wrote the stage play of &quot;Clue&quot;, together with Hunter Foster, Eric Price and Sandy Rustin.

===Producing===
Lynn also produced six episodes of the new &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; television series, was executive producer of &quot;He&#x27;s Such a Girl&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and was a producer for &quot;Trial and Error&quot;. It also received an exclusive production agreement with Columbia Pictures Television in 1992.

==Awards==
Lynn&#x27;s work on the &quot;Minister&quot; series earned him three BAFTAs, two Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and two Pye Television Writers Awards, and he won the ACE Award for Best Written Comedy Series. The Campaign for Freedom of Information also recognized Lynn with a special award for his work on the show. Lynn was a recipient of a Diamond Jubilee Award for Political Satire in 2010. He received an NAACP Image Award for the 2003 film &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot;.

<doc id="168783" wikidata="Q1074080" url="?curid=168783" title="Music of Turkey">
<text>The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of Greek, Armenian, Albanian, Polish, Azeri and Jewish communities, among others. Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this, however, western-style pop music lost popularity to arabesque in the late 1970s and 1980s, with even its greatest proponents, Ajda Pekkan and Sezen Aksu, falling in status. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock, electronica, hip-hop, rap and dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop and arabesque genres, which many believe have become too commercial.

== Classical music ==


Ottoman court music has a large and varied system of modes or scales known as makams, and other rules of composition. A number of notation systems were used for transcribing classical music, the most dominant being the Hamparsum notation in use until the gradual introduction of western notation.

A specific sequence of classical Turkish musical forms becomes a &quot;fasıl&quot;, a suite consisting of an instrumental prelude (&quot;peṣrev&quot;), an instrumental postlude (&quot;saz semaisi&quot;), and in between, the main section of vocal compositions which begins with and is punctuated by instrumental improvisations, called taksim. A full fasıl concert would include four different instrumental forms and three vocal forms, including a light classical song, &quot;şarkı&quot;. A strictly classical fasıl (in the early 19th-century style) remains in the same makam throughout, from the introductory taksim and usually ending in a dance tune or &quot;oyun havası&quot;. However shorter &quot;şarkı&quot; compositions, precursors to modern day songs, are a part of this tradition, many of them extremely old, dating back to the 14th century; many are newer, with late 19th century songwriter Haci Arif Bey being especially popular.

;Composers and Performers

Other famous proponents of this genre include Sufi Dede Efendi, Prince Cantemir, Baba Hamparsum, Kemani Tatyos Efendi, Sultan Selim III and Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent. The most popular modern Turkish classical singer is Münir Nurettin Selçuk, who was the first to establish a lead singer position. Other performers include Bülent Ersoy, Zeki Müren, Müzeyyen Senar and Zekai Tunca.

=== Musical instruments ===
Traditional instruments in Turkish classical music today include tambur -generally use as &quot;tanbur&quot; - long-necked plucked lute, ney end-blown flute, kemençe bowed fiddle, oud plucked short-necked unfretted lute, kanun plucked zither, violin, and in Mevlevi music, küdüm drum and a harp.

=== Ottoman harem music: Belly dance ===


From the makams of the royal courts to the melodies of the royal harems, a type of dance music emerged that was different from the &quot;oyun havası&quot; of fasıl music. In the Ottoman Empire, the harem was that part of a house set apart for the women of the family. It was a place in which non-family males were not allowed. Eunuchs guarded the sultan&#x27;s harems, which were quite large, including several hundred women who were wives and concubines. There, female dancers and musicians entertained the women living in the harem. Belly dance was performed by women for women. This female dancer, known as a &quot;rakkase&quot;, which is the Arabic word for &quot;female dancer&quot;, hardly ever appeared in public.

This type of harem music was taken out of the sultan&#x27;s private living quarters and to the public by male street entertainers and hired dancers of the Ottoman Empire, the male &quot;rakkas&quot;. These dancers performed publicly for wedding celebrations, feasts, festivals, and in the presence of the sultans.

Modern oriental dance in Turkey is derived from this tradition of the Ottoman rakkas. Some mistakenly believe that Turkish oriental dancing is known as Çiftetelli due to the fact that this style of music has been incorporated into oriental dancing by Greeks, illustrated by the fact that the Greek belly dance is sometimes mistakenly called Tsifteteli. However, Çiftetelli is now a form of folk music, with names of songs that describe their local origins, whereas rakkas, as the name suggests, is from Arabic which means &quot;male dancer&quot;. Dancers are also known for their adept use of finger cymbals as instruments, also known as zils.

=== Romani influences ===

Romani are known throughout Turkey for their musicianship. Their urban music brought echoes of classical Turkish music to the public via the &quot;meyhane&quot; or taverna. This type of &quot;fasıl&quot; music (a style, not to be confused with the fasıl form of classical Turkish music) with food and alcoholic beverages is often associated with the underclass of Turkish society, though it also can be found in more respectable establishments in modern times.

Roma have also influenced the fasıl itself. Played in music halls, the dance music (&quot;oyun havası&quot;) required at the end of each fasıl has been incorporated with Ottoman &quot;rakkas&quot; or belly dancing motifs. The rhythmic ostinato accompanying the instrumental improvisation (&quot;ritimli taksim&quot;) for the bellydance parallels that of the classical &quot;gazel&quot;, a vocal improvisation in free rhythm with rhythmic accompaniment. Popular musical instruments in this kind of fasıl are the clarinet, violin, kanun, and darbuka. Clarinetist Mustafa Kandıralı is a well-known fasil musician.

=== Military music ===

The Janissary bands or &quot;Mehter Takımı&quot; are considered to be the oldest type of military marching band in the world. Individual instrumentalists were mentioned in the Orhun inscriptions, which are believed to be the oldest written sources of Turkish history, dating from the 8th century. However, they were not definitively mentioned as bands until the 13th century. The rest of Europe borrowed the notion of military marching bands from Turkey from the 16th century onwards.

=== Turkish influence on Western classical music ===
Musical relations between the Turks and the rest of Europe can be traced back many centuries, and the first type of musical Orientalism was the Turkish Style. European classical composers in the 18th century were fascinated by Turkish music, particularly the strong role given to the brass and percussion instruments in Janissary bands.

Joseph Haydn wrote his &quot;Military Symphony&quot; to include Turkish instruments, as well as some of his operas. Turkish instruments were included in Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony Number 9&quot;, and he composed a &quot;Turkish March&quot; for his &quot;Incidental Music to The Ruins of Athens, Op. 113&quot;. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote the &quot;Ronda alla turca&quot; in his &quot;Sonata in A major&quot; and also used Turkish themes in his operas, such as the &quot;Chorus of Janissaries&quot; from his Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782). This Turkish influence introduced the cymbals, bass drum, and bells into the symphony orchestra, where they remain. Jazz musician Dave Brubeck wrote his &quot;Blue Rondo á la Turk&quot; as a tribute to Mozart and Turkish music. 

=== Western Influence on Turkish classical music ===


While the European military bands of the 18th century introduced the percussion instruments of the Ottoman janissary bands, a reciprocal influence emerged in the 19th century in the form of the Europeanisation of the Ottoman army band. In 1827, Giuseppe Donizetti, the elder brother of the renowned Italian opera composer Gaetano Donizetti, was invited to become Master of Music to Sultan Mahmud II. A successor of Donizetti was the German musician Paul Lange, formerly music lecturer at the American College for Girls and at the German High School, who took over the position of Master of the Sultan&#x27;s Music after the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and kept it until his death in 1920. A son of Paul Lange was the Istanbul-born American conductor Hans Lange. The Ottoman composer Leyla Saz (1850–1936) provides an account of musical training in the Imperial Palace in her memoirs. As the daughter of the Palace surgeon, she grew up in the Imperial harem where girls were also given music lessons in both Turkish and Western styles.

After the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of a Turkish republic, the transfer of the former Imperial Orchestra or &quot;Mızıka-ı Hümayun&quot; from Istanbul to the new capital of the state Ankara, and renaming it as the Orchestra of the Presidency of the Republic, &quot;Riyaset-i Cumhur Orkestrası&quot;, signaled a Westernization of Turkish music. The name would later be changed to the Presidential Symphony Orchestra or &quot;Cumhurbaşkanlığı Senfoni Orkestrası&quot;.

Further inroads came with the founding of a new school for the training of Western-style music instructors in 1924, renaming the Istanbul Oriental Music School as the Istanbul Conservatory in 1926, and sending talented young musicians abroad for further music education. These students include well-known Turkish composers such as Cemal Reşit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun, Necil Kazım Akses and Hasan Ferit Alnar, who became known as the Turkish Five. The founding of the Ankara State Conservatory with the aid of the German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith in 1936 showed that Turkey in terms of music wanted to be like the West.

However, on the order of the founder of the republic, Atatürk, following his philosophy to take from the West but to remain Turkish in essence, a wide-scale classification and archiving of samples of Turkish folk music from around Anatolia was launched in 1924 and continued until 1953 to collect around 10,000 folk songs. Hungarian composer Béla Bartók visited Ankara and south-eastern Turkey in 1936 within the context of these works.

By 1976, Turkish classical music had undergone a renaissance and a state musical conservatory in Istanbul was founded to give classical musicians the same support as folk musicians. Modern-day advocates of Western classical music in Turkey include Fazıl Say, İdil Biret, Suna Kan, the Önder Sisters and the Pekinel sisters.

== Early Years of The Republic ==
After the Turkish War of Independence ended in 1923, and the borders were drawn, there was a social and political revolution under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. This revolution opted to Westernize the way of living in Turkey. By 1929, all public and commercial communications were made in the Latin alphabet, completely taking the written Ottoman Turkish language out of circulation. A new constitution was written, one that was modeled after the French. This new constitution was designed to make the new Republic of Turkey into a secular, modern, nation-state. Every aspect of the revolution, from major policy changes to clothing reforms, was made in accordance with the Kemalist Ideology. All affairs were carried out followed by a chain of military command for the purpose of reaching the level of Western civilization. Both religious and Turkish classical music was impacted by this top to bottom revolution.

On November 1, 1934 Atatürk made a speech in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Alaturca music was banned on radios, public places as well as private properties. Here is the excerpt from the speech, concerning Turkish music, &quot;Folks, we all know how sensitive we, the Turkish, are towards the matters of our cultural legacy…. I am aware what kind of progress that my people want to see within fine arts delivered by the new generation of artists, and musicians. If you ask me, what would be most efficient and quick to tackle first within the fine arts is Turkish Music. The music we are made to listen to these days is far from being a point of pride for Turkish people. We must all know this. We must take our great nation&#x27;s idioms, stories, experiences and compose them, but only complying to the general rules of music. I wish that the Ministry of Cultural Affairs take this matter seriously, and work alongside the law-makers of our country.&quot;

Right after this speech, on November 2, 1934, The Department of Publishing and Press banned Alaturca music, knowing what Mustafa Kemal meant when he said &quot;… but only complying to the general rules of music…&quot; was that the only acceptable type of music available to the public will be music following the principles of western tonal music. The Turkish composers, who were educated abroad in the beginning of the century and came back to Turkey, were assigned to teach classical Turkish musicians the western way of writing and playing music. The Presidential Symphony Orchestra, established back in 1924 started giving weekly free performances in schools specifying in Music Education. New instruments like pianos, trumpets, and saxophones were bought for cultural centers in villages, not just in Istanbul, but in many places like Bursa, Çorum, Gümüşhane, and Samsun.

Along with the radical ideology change, and the sudden application of these new ideas came an obvious tear in the fabric of the society. People who couldn&#x27;t listen to Turkish music on Turkish Radio sought out the next best thing and started listening to the Arabic Radio. There are records of Turkish people calling into Egyptian, Crimean, and Haifan radio stations requesting Turkish songs they were used to listening to, since The Middle East already consumed and re-created a lot of Turkish Music since the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the middle of the millennium.
Turkish people started listening to other nations&#x27; version of Turkish songs. This cleared the way for the Arabesque music to become hugely popular in the 70s. Today, there are still prolific and popular Arabesque musicians in Turkey. The ban in the early years of the Republic is exactly why Arabesque Music became a cultural phenomenon.

== Folk music ==
Folk music or &quot;Türkü&quot; generally deals with subjects surrounding daily life in less grandiose terms than the love and emotion usually contained in its traditional counterpart, Ottoman court music.

Most songs recount stories of real-life events and Turkish folklore, or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets. Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals and special festivals.

Regional folk music generally accompanies folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. For example, at marriage ceremonies in the Aegean guests will dance the Zeybek, while in other Rumeli regions the upbeat dance music Çiftetelli is usually played, and in the southeastern regions of Turkey the Halay is the customary form of local wedding music and dance. Greeks from Thrace and Cyprus that have adopted çiftetelli music sometimes use it synonymously to mean Oriental dance, which indicates a misunderstanding of its roots. Çiftetelli is a folk dance, differing from a solo performance dance of a hired entertainer.

The regional mood also affects the subject of the folk songs, e.g. folk songs from the Black Sea are lively in general and express the customs of the region. Songs about betrayal have an air of defiance about them instead of sadness, whereas the further south travelled in Turkey the more the melodies resemble a lament.

As this genre is viewed as a music of the people, musicians in socialist movements began to adapt folk music with contemporary sounds and arrangements in the form of protest music.

In the 70s and 80s, modern bards following the aşık tradition such as Aşik Veysel and Mahsuni Şerif moved away from spiritual invocations to socio-politically active lyrics.

Other contemporary progenitors took their lead such as Zülfü Livaneli, known for his mid-80s innovation of combining poet Nazım Hikmet&#x27;s radical poems with folk music and rural melodies, and is well regarded by left-wing supporters in politics.

In more recent times, saz orchestras, accompanied with many other traditional instruments and a merger with arabesque melodies have kept modern folk songs popular in Turkey.

=== Folk instruments ===
Folk instruments range from string groups as bağlama, bow instruments such as the kemençe (a type of stave fiddle), and percussion and wind, including the zurna, ney and davul. Regional variations place importance on different instruments, e.g. the darbuka in Rumeli and the kemençe around the Eastern Black Sea region. The folklore of Turkey is extremely diverse. Nevertheless, Turkish folk music is dominantly marked by a single musical instrument called saz or bağlama, a type of long-necked lute. Traditionally, saz is played solely by traveling musicians known as &quot;ozan&quot; or religious Alevi troubadours called &quot;aşık&quot;.

Due to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the bağlama has influenced various cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean, e.g. the Greek baglamas. In Turkish bağlamak means &#x27;to tie&#x27; as a reference to the tied, movable frets of the instrument. Like many other plucked lutes, it can be played with a plectrum (i.e., pick), with a fingerpicking style, or strummed with the backs of fingernails. The zurna and davul duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations.

=== Folk literature ===
A large body of folk songs are derived from minstrels or bard-poets called &quot;ozan&quot; in Turkish. They have been developing Turkish folk literature since the beginning of 11th century. The musical instrument used by these bard-poets is the saz or bağlama. They are often taught by other senior minstrels, learning expert idioms, procedures, and methods in the performance of the art. These lessons often take place at minstrel meetings and the coffeehouses they frequent. Those bard-poets who become experts or &quot;alaylı&quot; then take apprentices for themselves and continue the tradition.

A minstrel&#x27;s creative output usually takes two major forms. One, in musical rhyming contests with other bards, where the competition ends with the defeat of the minstrel who cannot find an appropriate quatrain to the rhyme and two, storytelling. These folk stories are extracted from real life, folklore, dreams and legends. One of the most well-known followings are those bards that put the title &quot;aşık&quot; in front of their names.

=== Arabesque ===

Arabic music had been banned in Turkey in 1948, but starting in the 1970s immigration from predominantly southeastern rural areas to big cities and particularly to Istanbul gave rise to a new cultural synthesis. This changed the musical makeup of Istanbul. The old tavernas and music halls of fasıl music were to shut down in place of a new type of music. These new urban residents brought their own taste of music, which due to their locality was largely middle eastern. Musicologists derogatively termed this genre as arabesque due to the high-pitched wailing that is synonymous with Arabic singing.

Its mainstream popularity rose so much in the 1980s that it even threatened the existence of Turkish pop, with rising stars such as Müslüm Gürses and İbrahim Tatlıses. The genre has underbeat forms that include Ottoman forms of belly-dancing music known as &quot;fantazi&quot; from singers like Gülben Ergen and with performers like Serdar Ortaç who added Anglo-American rock and roll to arabesque music.

It is not really accurate to group Arabesk with folk music. It owes little to folk music, and would be more accurately described as form of popular music based on the makam scales found in Ottoman and Turkish classical music. Though Arabesk was accused of having been derived from Arabic music, the scales (makam) used identify it as music, that, though influenced by both Arabic and Western music, is much more Turkish in origin.

=== Religious music ===
==== Islamic Recitation ====
&quot;Islamic Recitation,&quot; a term associated with mainstream religion in Turkey, includes the &quot;azan&quot; (call-to-prayer), &quot;Kur&#x27;an-ı Kerim&quot; (Koran recitation), &quot;Mevlit&quot; (Ascension Poem), and &quot;ilahi&quot; (hymns usually sung in a group, often outside a mosque). On musical grounds, mosque music in large urban areas often resembles classical Turkish music in its learned use of makam and poetry, e.g., a Mevlit sung at Sultan Ahmet mosque in Istanbul. Dervish/Sufi music is rarely associated with a mosque. Kâni Karaca was a leading performer of mosque music in recent times.

==== Alevi influences: The Aşık (Ashik) traditions ====
It is suggested that about a fifth of the Turkish population are &quot;Alevis&quot;, whose folk music is performed by a type of travelling bard or &quot;ozan&quot; called &quot;aşık&quot;, who travels with the saz or baglama, an iconic image of Turkish folk music. These songs, which hail from the central northeastern area, are about mystical revelations, invocations to Alevi saints and Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law, Ali, whom they hold in high esteem. In Turkish aşık literally means &#x27;in love&#x27;. Whoever follows this tradition has the &quot;Aşık&quot; assignation put before their names, because it is suggested that music becomes an essential facet of their being, for example as in Aşık Veysel.

Middle Anatolia is home to the bozlak, a type of declamatory, partially improvised music by the bards. Neşet Ertaş has so far been the most prominent contemporary voice of Middle Anatolian music, singing songs of a large spectrum, including works of premodern Turkoman aşıks like Karacaoğlan and Dadaloğlu and the modern aşıks like his father, the late Muharrem Ertaş. Around the city of Sivas, aşık music has a more spiritual bent, afeaturing ritualized song contests, although modern bards have brought it into the political arena.

==== Sufi influences: The Mevlevi traditions ====
Followers of the Mevlevi Order or &quot;whirling dervishes&quot; are a religious &quot;sufi&quot; sect unique to Turkey but well known outside of its boundaries.

Dervishes of the Mevlevi sect simply dance a &quot;sema&quot; by turning continuously to music that consists of long, complex compositions called &quot;ayin&quot;. These pieces are both preceded and followed by songs using lyrics by the founder and poet Mevlana Jelaleddin Rumi. With the musical instrument known as the ney at the forefront of this music, internationally well-known musicians include Necdet Yasar, Niyazi Sayin, Kudsi Ergüner and Ömer Faruk Tekbilek.

=== Regional folk styles ===
Minorities and indigenous peoples have added and enhanced Turkish folk styles, while they have adopted Turkish folk traditions and instruments. Folk songs are identifiable and distinguished by regions.

==== Aegean and Rumeli regions ====
Rumelia (or &quot;Trakya&quot;) refers to the region of Turkey which is part of Southeast Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the northern part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). Folk songs from this region share similarities with Balkan, Albanian and Greek folk musics, especially from the ethnic minorities and natives of Thrace. Cypriot folk music also shares folk tunes with this region, e.g. the Çiftetelli dance. These types of folk songs also share close similarities with Ottoman court music, suggesting that the distinction between court and folk music was not always so clear. However, folk songs from Istanbul may have been closely influenced by its locality, which would include Ottoman rakkas and court music.

Cities like İzmir share similar motifs, such as the zeybek dance.

==== Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions ====
Central Asian Turkic peoples from the Caspian Sea and areas have had a huge influence in the purest forms of Turkish folk music, most notably from the Azeris and Turkmen.

Pontic Greeks on the eastern shore of the Black Sea or &quot;Karadeniz&quot; regions have their own distinct Greek style of folk music, motifs from which were used with great success by Helena Paparizou. The diaspora of Greek speaking Pontic people from that region introduced Pontic music to Greece after 1924 population exchange between Turkey and Greece. The region&#x27;s dance style uses unique techniques like odd shoulder tremors and knee bends. Folk dances include the gerasari, trygona, kots, omal, serra, kotsari and tik.

==== Southeastern regions ====
Southeastern regions carry influences from Turkmen music, Zaza motifs and Armenian music. These usually include epic laments.

==Kanto (Cantare music)==

Italian theater and opera have had a profound effect on Turkish culture in the past century. Like the terminology of seamanship, the terminology of music and theater is derived from Italian. In the argot of the improvisational theater of Istanbul the stage was called &quot;sahano&quot;, the backstage was referred to as &quot;koyuntu&quot;, backdrops depicting countryside were &quot;bosko&quot;, the applause was &quot;furi&quot; and the songs sung between the acts and plays were called &quot;kanto&quot;.

The improvised pieces were stage adaptations of the Karagöz (shadow puppet) and Ortaoyunu (traditional form of Turkish theatre performed in the open) traditions, although in a much more simplified form. The themes explored in these traditional theater arts as well as their stock characterizations and stereotypes were used as the framework for the new extemporaneous performances of the tuluat (improvised) theater.

As with their Italian counterparts, the Turkish troupes employed songs and music before the show and between the acts to pique people&#x27;s interest and draw in customers.

Kanto: songs sung between the acts as solos or duets, based on traditional eastern makam (modes) but performed on western instruments.

Kanto: &quot;first the introduction, then the lyrics, shake your shoulders to a violin, solo, cock your head and shimmy in oriental dance style, leap around like a partridge, then slowly disappear behind the curtain.&quot;

Kanto: the irreplaceable unifying feature of ali Turkish tuluat theater. We can divide kanto into two periods. The division, particularly in terms of musical structure, is very clear between the early kanto and the kanto of the Post-Republic period. It is further possible to identify two styles within the early period. Galata and Direklerarası (both neighbourhoods of Old Istanbul).

Kanto first took root in the musical theaters of Galata, a part of town frequented by sailors, rowdies and roustabouts. Ahmed Rasim Bey paints a vivid picture of the Galata theaters in his 1922 memoir entitled &quot;Fuhş-i Atik&quot; (&quot;Prostitution in the Old Days&quot;):

Direklerarası was a little off the beaten track and in comparison to Galata was a more refined center of entertainment. Direklerarası was said to be quite lively at night during the month of Ramadan (Ramazan in Turkish) and certainly once its attraction was its family atmosphere. It was here that the troupes of Kel Hasan and Abdi Efendi and later that of Neshid enjoyed a great popularity. It was under the influence of these masters that kanto experienced its golden years.

The troupes orchestra would be made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play popular songs of the day and marches in front of the theatre about an hour before the show to drum up interest. This intermission or Antrak music ended up with the well-known Izmir March, a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as the musicians went in and took their places at the side of the stage.

The kanto singers of the period were also composers. Set to extraordinarily simple melodies which were the fashion of the day, the lyrics relied heavily of tensions between men and women as well as reflecting topical events. The compositions were in such fundamental makams as Rast, Hüzzam, Hicaz, Hüseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and by their creators, artists such as Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni. Küçük and Büyük Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin. That kanto brought an erotic element to the stage performance was an important aspect and one that should not be overlooked or separated out.

Art and cultural life gained new dimensions with the changes brought about by the 1923 formation of the Turkish Republic. It was a period of rapid transformation and its effects were widespread. Turkish women had finally won the freedom to appear on the stage, breaking the monopoly previously held by Rûm (Istanbul Greek) and Armenian women who performed in musical and non-musical theatre. Institutions like Darulbedayi (Istanbul City Theatre) and Darulelhan (Istanbul Conservatory of Music) had long been turning out trained artists.

Western lifestyles and Western-style art put pressure on the traditional Turkish formats and these were swept off to the side. The operetta, the tango, then later the Charleston and the foxtrot overshadowed kanto. Kanto&#x27;s popularity began to fade, the city&#x27;s centers of entertainment shifted, and the theaters of Galata and Direklerarası were closed down. Turkish female artists were unreceptive to kanto&#x27;s inherent ribairy and chose to keep their distance from it.

Around 1935, there was a revival of interest in the kanto form. Although rather far from its fundamental principles, a new type of kanto was once again popular.

It is important to point out that kanto had now moved from the stage to the recording studio. While the subjects dealt with in the lyrics were still the same old quarrels between men and women, mixed in with satirical takes on fashion and current events, the songs were being written with the 78 rpm phonograph in mind. So much so that every record label hired their own kanto composers—and rather famous ones at that. With Columbia at the fore, record labels commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rıza Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalı Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, Cümbüş Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by cümbüş (a fretlees banjo like instrument) the ud (a fretless) lute, and calpara (castenets). Foxtrot, Charleston and rumba rhythms dominated. The tunes were being written and sung more tor listening than tor dancing. Female soloists include Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Beşiktaşlı Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets.

Among the topics explored by the new kantocu (singer or composer of kanto) perhaps the most frequent subject of satire was the new role of women brought about by the formation of the Republic. Songs like Sarhoş Kızlar (Drunken Girls) or Şoför Kadınlar (Women Drivers) were sung seemingly in revenge for all the suffering they had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society. Songs such as Bereli Kız (The Girl with the Beret) and Kadın Asker Olursa (If Women Were Soldiers) were full of mockery and ridicule.

The early period kanto were largely nourished by Istanbul culture. It was much the same in the Post-Republican period. The city&#x27;s large and diverse population provided both the characters and the events that were the mainstay of kanto. Kanto was heavily influenced by musical theatre. Roman (gypsy) music and culture, which was itself the subject of satire, left its mark on kanto form. Another major influence was Rum music. The importance of the Istanbul Rum, who were so fond of entertainment and of singing and playing, must not be underestimated. It is a natural and inevitable result of cultural exchange. As it was, almost all the kanto singers were either Rum or Armenian, artists like Pepron, Karakas, Haim, Samran and Peruz who performed during the period following 1903.

Eventually kanto became more of a definition, a generalized genre than a musical term. Any tune that was outside of the day&#x27;s musical conventions, anything light that appealed to current trends and tastes, was labeled kanto. Any music played with different instruments that was free rhythmic or somehow novel was labeled kanto; it was the product of the middie-class, urban culture of Istanbul.

Kanto has been viewed as a forerunner of today&#x27;s pop culture.

== Popular music ==

Popular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Turkish musicality after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, either due to attempts of national modernization from 1924 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves.

=== Mainstream pop ===

Turkish pop music had its humble beginnings in the late 1950s with Turkish cover versions of a wide range of imported popular styles, including rock and roll, tango, and jazz. As more styles emerged, they were also adopted, such as hip hop, heavy metal and reggae.

The self-named &quot;superstar&quot; of the &quot;arrangement&quot; (aranjman) era of the 70s was Ajda Pekkan and Aydzhan Bekir who also debuted, along with Enrico Macias, at Olympia, Paris, while MFÖ (Mazhar, Fuat, Özkan) was the celebrated group of the pop scene with an outstanding dexterity in their use of Turkish prosody and their success of amalgamating Western and Turkish cultural ingredients and perspectives. Also one of the most renowned Turkish pop stars of the last decades is probably Sezen Aksu. She contributed considerably to the unique Turkish pop sound of this period, allowing it gain ground from its humble beginnings in the early 50s and 60s to the popular genre it is today. She was also one of the strongest advocates for Turkey to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. Her one-time vocalist and later protégé Sertab Erener won the contest in 2003.

The biggest male pop stars in Turkey are arguably Tarkan, Mustafa Sandal and Kenan Doğulu. Tarkan achieved chart success in Europe and Latin America with his single &quot;Şımarık&quot;, also composed by Sezen Aksu, which has been covered by numerous artists. Mustafa Sandal has also enjoyed chart success in Europe with his 2005 single &quot;İsyankar&quot;, which peaked at number 4 and went gold.

=== Turkish hip hop ===
Turkish hip hop or &quot;oriental hip hop&quot; is a creation of the Turkish migrant worker community in Germany, which some suggest was a suitable outlet for a young generation disillusioned with Germany&#x27;s treatment of its migrant class. In 1995, the Turkish-German community produced a major hip hop crew named Cartel which caused controversy in Turkey and Germany for its revolutionary lyrics. Hip hop now enjoys wide popularity among the younger generation in Turkey. Ceza, Dr.Fuchs (formerly &quot;Nefret&quot;) and Sagopa Kajmer, Sansar Salvo, Pit10, Şehinşah, Hayki, Saian, Allâme are popular figures of contemporary rap music in Turkey.

=== Anatolian rock ===
The Turkish rock scene began in the mid- to late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Turkish fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Anatolian rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of Turkish rock. Barış Manço, Cem Karaca and Erkin Koray are the best known performers; Moğollar and Kurtalan Ekspres are the best known groups of older classical Anatolian rock music.

===Islamic anasheed===
Islamic anasheed are also very popular among some of the Turkish people. The most popular artist in Turkey is the British Azeri, Sami Yusuf, a concert in Istanbul drew an audience of over 200,000, his biggest concert so far around the world. He is one of the most notable singers of anasheed, and can speak in many different languages, which includes Turkish. To date he has performed at sell out concerts in over 30 countries across the world from Istanbul to Casablanca, United States to Germany. Some albums selling more than a million copies in comparison to western music. In Jan 2009 Sami travelled to Turkey where he was invited by Emine Erdoğan, wife of the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to attend a rally in support of peace in Gaza. Another popular Turkish singer is Feridun Özdemir, who mainly sings of God and true faith. His records are most successful in the anasheed genre.

===Heavy metal and industrial===
Heavy metal and industrial groups from Turkey include Pentagram (known as Mezarkabul outside Turkey) and Almora. Individual musicians in these genres include Ogün Sanlısoy and Hayko Cepkin.

===Underground black metal and death metal===
Underground black metal and death metal bands known from Turkey are Witchtrap, Ehrimen, Satanized, Godslaying Hellblast, Burial Invocation, Deggial, Decaying Purity.

=== Turkish Trance ===

Trance is a rare musical genre in Turkey but it also has specific listeners. This genre gained when the first Turkish trance music composed by Murtaza Khojami and the song named for &quot;Yalnızlık Düşünceler&quot; with mixed criticism.

=== Pop-rock and rock ===
As a singular phenomenon amidst popular currents since the mid-1970s, Bülent Ortaçgil appeared as an urban songwriter/musician with a distinct musical quality, and became a role model for aspiring young musicians. He was the only Turkish musician for whom a tribute album was compiled that included several prominent performers from a wide gamut of different genres.

Other recent rock bands with a more Western sound who have enjoyed mainstream success include maNga, Duman and Mor ve Ötesi. Şebnem Ferah, Özlem Tekin and Teoman are examples of individual rock artists with substantial fan bases. Turkey also boasts numerous large-scale rock festivals and events. Annual rock festivals in Turkey include Barışarock, H2000 Music Festival, Rock&#x27;n Coke, and RockIstanbul.

=== Underground and club music ===
There are many clubs across Turkey, especially across its Aegean region. The alternative music scene however is derived mostly from Istanbul&#x27;s thriving underground club scene that sees DJs merging the past with the present, using traditional motifs with new age sounds and electronic music. Mercan Dede is one of Turkey&#x27;s most successful DJs, mixing trance with historical and mystic Sufi songs. Another worldwide recognized name from the underground music scene of Turkey is Mert Yücel. Yücel was responsible for the first house music album to be released in Turkey. He also had worldwide acclaimed and respected releases on US and UK dance labels. He is one of the key names defining the underground house sound emerging from Istanbul.

=== Musical influence of Syrian refugees and other immigrants ===
The influx of immigrants and refugees from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Central Asian, and African countries has affected the Turkish musical landscape, particularly in Istanbul. Bands such as Country for Syria, and Saktat explicitly blend the music of different refugee communities in Istanbul to create a mix of Turkish, Arab, Greek, Persian, and Western influences. Busking has played an important role in the development of this style.

== Music industry ==

The Turkish music industry includes a number of fields, ranging from record companies to radio stations and community and state orchestras. Most of the major record companies are based in Istanbul&#x27;s region of &quot;Unkapanı&quot; and they are represented by the &quot;Turkish Phonographic Industry Society&quot; (MÜ-YAP). The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. Record companies may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances.

In recent years, the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music and general piracy; many musicians and MÜ-YAP have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music. On 13 June 2006 it was reported that MÜ-YAP and The Orchard, the world&#x27;s leading distributor and marketer of independent music, had reached an agreement on digital global distribution, representing approximately 80% of the Turkish music market.

There is not a substantial singles market in Turkey. It is album orientated, although popular singers such as Yonca Evcimik and Tarkan have released singles with success. Most music charts not related to album sales, measure popularity by music video feedback and radio airplay.

Turkish radio stations often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. With the introduction of commercial radio and television in the early 1990s ending the monopoly of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), a multitude of radio and TV stations were opened by newspaper media moguls. These media chains sponsor award ceremonies such as the &quot;Kral TV&quot; awards for music, but most accredited music awards are based on sales given out by industry societies such as MÜ-YAP and the Magazine Journalists Society (MJS).

Though major record companies dominate the Turkish industry, an independent music industry (&quot;indie music&quot;) does exist. Indie music is mostly based around local record labels with limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen to.

Perhaps the most successful Turkish name associated with indie music outside of Turkey is Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records. His promotion of some of the most famous R&amp;B and soul artists in North America and his contribution to the American music industry has earned a place in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, together with his brother Nesuhi.

==Music education==

Music has a place in education in Turkey, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band or social clubs and communities for Turkish classical or folk music, known as . Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school&#x27;s drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs &quot;Mehter&quot; marches at school festivals. However, class time given to music in schools is restricted, and a large proportion of Turkish children and adults seem to have limited musical ability, e.g. they are unable to join a melody singing at the same pitch.

Higher education in the field of music in Turkey is mostly based around large universities, connected to state music academies and conservatories. A conservatory is usually a department of a university, not a separate institution. While many students join conservatories at the usual university entrance age, some conservatories also include a &#x27;Lise&#x27; (Lycee), in effect a specialist music school for children aged 14 to 18 years. Conservatories often have a musicology department, and do research on many styles of music especially the Turkish traditional genres, while also keeping a database of sounds in their sound libraries.

== Holidays and festivals ==
Music is an important part of several Turkish holidays and festivals, especially playing a major part in the springtime celebration of Newroz and religious festivities such as Ramadan. New year is a traditional time for the belly dancer and weddings are celebrated with upbeat tunes, while funerals are mourned with musical laments. Patriotic songs like the national anthem, &quot;The Independence March&quot;, are a major part of public holiday celebrations such as National Independence &amp; International Children&#x27;s Day celebrations on 23 April and 30 August Victory Day celebrations, a holiday that marks Turkish independence. Music also plays a role at many regional festivals that aren&#x27;t celebrated nationwide, for example a music and dance parade and festival in Zonguldak.

Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir are also home to numerous music festivals which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal. Some music festivals are strictly local in scope, including few or no performers with a national reputation, and are generally operated by local promoters. Recently large soft drink companies have operated their own music festivals, such as Rock&#x27;n Coke and Fanta parties, which draw huge crowds.

<text>Beatrice Wood (March 3, 1893 – March 12, 1998) was an American artist and studio potter involved in the Dada movement in the United States; she founded and edited &quot;The Blind Man&quot; and &quot;Rongwrong&quot; magazines in New York City with French artist Marcel Duchamp and writer Henri-Pierre Roché in 1917. She had earlier studied art and theater in Paris, and was working in New York as an actress. She later worked at sculpture and pottery. Wood was characterized as the &quot;Mama of Dada&quot;.

She partially inspired the character of Rose DeWitt Bukater in James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 film, &quot;Titanic&quot; after the director read Wood&#x27;s autobiography while developing the film. Beatrice Wood died nine days after her 105th birthday in Ojai, California.

==Childhood==

Beatrice Wood was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of wealthy socialites. After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the family moved to New York. Despite her parents&#x27; strong opposition, Wood insisted on pursuing a career in the arts. Eventually her parents agreed to let her study painting. Because she was fluent in French, they sent her to Paris, where she studied acting at the Comédie-Française and art at the prestigious Académie Julian.

The onset of World War I forced Wood to return to the United States. She continued acting with a French Repertory Company in New York City, performing more than sixty roles in two years. She worked for several years performing on the stage.

==Dada and the Avant-garde==

Wood&#x27;s involvement in the Avant Garde began with her introduction to Marcel Duchamp. He and his friend Henri-Pierre Roché, a man fourteen years her senior, met her in New York in 1916 while she was visiting the composer Edgard Varèse, who was hospitalized with a broken leg. The three worked together to create &quot;The Blind Man&quot; and subsequently &quot;Rongwrong&quot;, magazines that were two of the earliest manifestations of the Dada art movement in the United States. The publication was intended to defend the submission of a urinal by Duchamp who had submitted it under the name R. Mutt to the First Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in April 1917. Wood wrote the oft-quoted statement that appeared in the publication as an unsigned editorial: &quot;As for plumbing, that is absurd. The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges.&quot; Wood also submitted to the exhibition and her piece &quot;&#x27;Un peu d&#x27;eau dans du savon&quot;&#x27;, which she had made alongside Duchamp in his studio, was accepted and was displayed. The work was the image of a nude female figure rising from her bath, but because Wood attached an actual piece of soap to what she called the &quot;tactical position&quot;, the work drew a great deal of attention and critical reaction.

===Roché, Duchamp, and &quot;Jules et Jim&quot;===

Though she was most involved with Roché, the two often spent time with Duchamp, creating a kind of love triangle. This was not, however, the inspiration for Roché&#x27;s 1953 novel, (or the 1962 film adaptation by François Truffaut). &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; was based on the triangle involving Roché, German writer Franz Hessel, and Helen Grund, who married Hessel. Roché alluded to the Wood-Roché-Duchamp triangle in his unfinished novel, &quot;Victor&quot;. Wood herself saw little resemblance between &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; and her relationship with Roché and Duchamp, writing in her 1985 autobiography, &quot;I Shock Myself&quot;:
===Arensbergs and their circle===

Wood met the art patrons Walter and Louise Arensberg, who became her lifelong friends. From 1915 through 1920, they held regular gatherings at their apartment at 33 West 67th Street in Manhattan in which artists, writers, and poets were invited to gather, where they were given drinks, hors d&#x27;oeuvres, and engaged in intellectual discussions. Besides Duchamp, Roché, and her, the group included many other artists of the avant-garde: Edgard Varese, Charles Sheeler, Joseph Stella, Man Ray and Francis Picabia. Wood&#x27;s relationship with these artists and others associated with the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century, earned her the designation as &quot;Mama of Dada&quot;.

==Drawings==

Marcel Duchamp encouraged her to draw, inviting her to use his studio as a place in which to work. She later illustrated her autobiography, &quot;I Shock Myself&quot;. She signed her early drawings &quot;Bea&quot;, her name in French, but after taking up pottery, she signed most of her work as &quot;Beato&quot;, her nickname. In 2014, a series of her drawings were exhibited as part of the permanent collection of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in Santa Barbara, California

==Sculpture==

Figures were an important part of the artist&#x27;s work during the 1930s and 40s. She explored both vessel forms and sculpture throughout her career. As her skills increased, Wood consciously retained a naive, illustrative style to communicate her commentaries on life and love. She called these works her &quot;sophisticated primitives&quot;. This approach makes clear her love of all types of non-Western folk and primitive art.

==Ceramics career==

While on a trip to hear J. Krishnamurti speak in the Netherlands, Wood bought a pair of baroque plates with a luster glaze. She wanted to find a matching teapot to go along with it, but was unsuccessful. Deciding to make the teapot herself, she enrolled in a ceramic class at Hollywood High School. Throughout her long career in ceramics, she never did make the matching teapot. This hobby turned into a passion which lasted another sixty years, and she studied with a number of leading ceramists including Gertrude and Otto Natzler. Ultimately, Wood developed a signature style of glazing, an all-over, in-glaze luster that draws the metallic salts to the surface of the glaze by starving the kiln of oxygen.

===Collections===
Wood&#x27;s work is held in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, among others.

==Ojai and longevity==

In 1947, Wood felt her career was established enough for her to build a home. She settled in Ojai, California, in 1948 to be near the Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti. She became a lifelong member of the Theosophical Society—Adyar. These associations greatly influenced her artistic philosophies. She also taught and lived on the same land as the Happy Valley School, now known as Besant Hill School.

At the age of 90, Wood became a writer, having been encouraged by her friend Anais Nin. Her best-known book is her autobiography, &quot;I Shock Myself&quot; (1985). When asked the secret to her longevity, she responded, &quot;I owe it all to art books, chocolates, and young men.&quot; Wood was a lifelong vegetarian who abstained from alcohol and smoking.

==Legacy and honors==

*In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution named Wood an &quot;Esteemed American Artist&quot;.
*Wood left her home and studio to the Happy Valley Foundation. In 2005, the foundation asked Kevin Virgil Wallace to transform it into The Beatrice Wood Center for the Arts.

==Films inspired by Wood==

*&quot;Beatrice Wood: Mama of Dada&quot;: This documentary, by film maker Tom Neff, was released as a 16 mm film in Los Angeles on March 3, 1993, to coincide with Wood&#x27;s 100th birthday.
*Wood partially inspired the 101-year-old character of &quot;Rose&quot; in James Cameron&#x27;s epic 1997 film, &quot;Titanic&quot;. According to Cameron, Bill Paxton&#x27;s wife had loaned him a copy of &quot;I Shock Myself&quot;. As he started reading it, he realized that

According to her obituary in the &quot;Ojai Valley News&quot;, Wood awarded the &quot;Fifth Annual Beatrice Wood Film Award&quot; to Cameron.

==Diaries==
Beatrice Wood kept daily journals for 85 years. In 2011, Francis M. Naumann and his wife, Marie T. Keller, edited a selection of her journals involving her life in the world of art.

<doc id="168789" wikidata="Q180973" url="?curid=168789" title="Tannenberg Memorial">
<text>The Tannenberg Memorial () was a monument to the German soldiers of the Battle of Tannenberg and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes during World War I, as well as the medieval Battle of Tannenberg of 1410. The victorious German commander &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Paul von Hindenburg became a national hero and was later interred at the site.

Dedicated by Hindenburg in 1924, on the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Tannenberg near Hohenstein (now Olsztynek, Poland), the structure, which was financed by donations, was built by the architects Johannes and Walter Krüger of Berlin, and completed in 1927. The octagonal layout with eight towers, each 20 metres high, was influenced by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II&#x27;s Castel del Monte and Stonehenge.

When &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; Hindenburg died in 1934, his coffin and that of his wife, who had died in 1921, were placed there despite his wishes to be buried at his family plot in Hanover. Adolf Hitler ordered that the monument be redesigned and renamed &quot;Reichsehrenmal Tannenberg&quot;. As the Red Army approached in 1945, German troops removed Hindenburg&#x27;s remains and partly demolished key structures. In 1949, the Polish authorities razed the site, leaving few traces.

==Concept and design==
The memorial embraced the Anglo/French concept of the Unknown Soldier. In doing so, the architects anticipated the concept of &quot;Totenburgen&quot; (Fortresses of the Dead) housing mass graves of soldiers. This ideology was debated in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. The architects imagined the memorial to be a new &quot;völkisch&quot; &quot;community of the dead&quot; and incorporated the burial of 20 unknown German soldiers from the Eastern Front into the project concept.

The memorial was built in a prominent place in a shape reminiscent of the castles of the Teutonic Knights. The monument&#x27;s location on a hilltop was accentuated by massive earthworks and landscaping designed to look as if nature alone had shaped the site. The design influenced other projects undertaken by architects and builders during the era.

==Opening and dedication==
A gathering of thousands came to the dedication of the newly finished memorial on 18 September 1927. The 80-year-old Hindenburg was dressed in the uniform of a Colonel-in-chief of a Masurian regiment to which he had been appointed by the Emperor (who had since abdicated). His speech was deemed highly nationalistic and in keeping with the times for the Weimar Republic, but was not well received outside Germany since it denied German responsibility for the war. An extract from the speech was later carved into a bronze plaque by the Nazi regime and installed in one of the towers of the memorial. A line of veterans, ten kilometers long and resplendent in Imperial uniforms, paid homage to Hindenburg and the 20 unknown German soldiers from the 1914 battle who were interred at the memorial.

==Inn==
The architects had also built an inn nearby in traditional East Prussian style. The numbers of visitors did not meet expectations initially but during the Nazi era the numbers were such that the inn required an extension.

==Nazi era==
In August 1933, the German government held a massive ceremony at the memorial to commemorate the anniversary of the battle; 1,500 cars transited through the Polish Corridor. Among those attending were Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring, Franz von Papen and Erich Koch, East Prussia&#x27;s &quot;gauleiter&quot;.

A year later, the monument again came to prominence on the death of Paul von Hindenburg. Hindenburg had requested a simple service and that he be interred next to his wife (who had died in 1921) in Hanover. However, Hitler decided to seize the opportunity for propaganda and instructed Albert Speer to ensure that the day was spectacular. It began with the transportation of the deceased president in the dark of night, on a gun carriage, from Hindenburg&#x27;s East Prussian estate, Neudeck. Following a torch-lit route and escorted by infantry and cavalry, the cortège made its way to Hohenstein.

==Modernisation of the memorial==

Following Hindenburg’s interment, the memorial once again became a national shrine. To add to the theatre, the government of the Reich again called upon the architectural firm of Krüger in Berlin and using the Stonehenge parallel again; above the entrance, a giant stone (symbolically from Königsberg) was placed, with the Field Marshal&#x27;s name inscribed upon it. This stone was so large that railway bridges had to be strengthened to aid its transportation. Two giant stone soldiers (as if on guard) were placed outside the tomb. A porphyry statue of the victor, by the East Prussian Friedrich Bagdons, dominated the Hall of Honour above the tomb. The concourse grass was replaced with stone and around the memorial landscape were placed interpretations of the German presence in East Prussia.

==The new crypt==

Hindenburg was originally buried in the central yard or &quot;plaza&quot; of the monument on 7 August 1934. On 2 October 1935, the anniversary of Hindenburg&#x27;s birthday, the President&#x27;s bronze coffin was relocated to a new, sombre chamber where he was joined by his wife Gertrud, who was moved from the family plot in Hanover. The new crypt, which was completed in the autumn of 1935, was located directly below the south tower. To create an entrance to the crypt, Hindenburg and the 20 unknown German soldiers from the 1914 battle were temporarily disinterred, and the level of the plaza was lowered by , with stone steps surrounding it on all sides. The unknown soldiers were re-interred in the side chapels. Designed by the Kruger brothers and carved by Paul Bronisch, the entrance to Hindenburg&#x27;s crypt was dominated by two fourteen-foot sculptures of the Eternal Watch, known as the &quot;Ewige Wache&quot;, which were carved out of more than 120 tons of Königsberg granite. The mausoleum had a dramatic vaulted ceiling.

==Pomp==
The re-interment of the &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; was marked by much pomp and ceremony by the Hitler administration, who declared that the upkeep of the memorial would thenceforth be carried out at government expense. The sarcophagus was draped in the German War Flag for the ceremony, at which Adolf Hitler performed the rededication. The Masuria region, where the memorial was built, was going through an economic resurgence at that time and nationalistic spirit was running high. This, and the ceremony of re-interment, caused one newspaper to claim &quot;a glorious return of the Teutonic Order&quot;. From 1936–1939 a travelling exhibition about Masuria, but centred on the Tannenberg battle and memorial, toured Germany. The Baedecker guide of 1936 described the Tannenberg Memorial &quot;Where President Hindenburg rests beside his fallen comrades&quot; as &quot;a place of national pilgrimage&quot;.

Plans were drawn up to install busts of the commanders and politicians involved in the Polish campaign with tablets inscribed with the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s speeches and a full-length statue of Adolf Hitler, but these never came about. At least one other commemoration was cancelled after the signing of the Anglo-Polish military alliance on 25 August 1939. The last state ceremonies held at the memorial were of two generals killed in the July Plot of 1944.

==Hindenburg&#x27;s disinterment and partial demolition of the memorial==
In January 1945, as Soviet forces advanced into East Prussia, Hitler ordered that the lead coffins of Hindenburg and his wife be disinterred and along with some of the regimental standards in the tomb, removed to safety. They were first moved to a bunker just outside Berlin, then to a salt mine near the village of Bernterode, Thuringia (in north central Germany), along with the remains of both &quot;Kaiser&quot; Wilhelm I and King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). The four coffins were hastily marked to indicate their contents using red crayon, and interred behind a masonry wall in a deep recess of the mine complex, underground. The coffins were discovered by U.S. Army Ordnance troops on 27 April 1945, and were moved to the basement of the heavily guarded Marburg Castle in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany. In August 1946, 20 months after being removed from the Tannenberg Memorial, Hindenburg and his wife were finally laid to rest by the American army at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s, the church of his Teutonic ancestors in Marburg, where they remain today.

On 21 January 1945, withdrawing German forces planted demolition charges inside the entrance tower and the tower previously housing von Hindenburg&#x27;s coffin, causing both towers to collapse. On 22 January Germans demolished more of the construction with a further 30 tonnes of explosives.

==Dismantling==
In the spring of 1949, the Communist Polish government ordered the dismantling of the very substantial remains of the monument; removal of the ruins continued until the 1980s, by which time virtually all traces of the memorial had gone. Today, only a protruding island in an isolated field remains to mark the extensive site. The Court of Honour (which measured slightly larger than a football field) has been reduced to little more than an overgrown pit of scattered debris and rubble.

Several significant remnants of the structure can still be seen elsewhere. A perfectly preserved sculpted lion, which once topped an eight-metre pyramid at another war memorial about 300 m beside the monument, is now displayed in the town square in nearby Olsztynek.

After the Second World War, much of the materials of the stone-and-granite memorial was used to build the Soviet war memorial in Olsztyn, the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw, and for the new Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw.

==Replica==
Architect Dietrich Zlomke, born in Heiligenbeil near Königsberg, was commissioned to design a memorial to the dead of East and West Prussia in the two world wars, which was dedicated at Oberschleißheim near Munich in 1995. His choice of design was a smaller-scale replica of the Tannenberg Memorial in concrete, dominated in the centre by an oak cross six metres high and a smaller iron cross on the pale wall at the rear.

<text>In sociology, social facts are values, cultural norms, and social structures that transcend the individual and can exercise social control. The French sociologist Émile Durkheim defined the term, and argued that the discipline of sociology should be understood as the empirical study of social facts. For Durkheim, social facts &quot;consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him.&quot;

==Durkheim&#x27;s social fact==
In &quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot; Durkheim laid out a theory of sociology as &quot;the science of social facts&quot;. He considered social facts to &quot;consist of representations and actions&quot; which meant that &quot;they cannot be confused with organic phenomena, nor with physical phenomena, which have no existence save in and through the individual consciousness.&quot; Durkheim says that a social fact is a thing that many people do very similarly because the socialized community that they belong to has influenced them to do these things.

Durkheim defined the social fact this way:
:&quot;A social fact is any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint;
::or:
:which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations.&quot;

He viewed it as a concrete idea that affected a person&#x27;s everyday life.

Durkheim&#x27;s examples of social facts included social institutions such as kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions with other members of our societies. Deviating from the norms of such institutions makes the individual unacceptable or misfit in the group.

Among the most noted of Durkheim&#x27;s work was his discovery of the &quot;social fact&quot; of suicide rates. By carefully examining police suicide statistics in different districts, Durkheim demonstrated that the suicide rate of Catholic communities is lower than that of Protestant communities. He ascribed this to a &quot;social&quot; (as opposed to individual) cause. This was considered groundbreaking and remains influential.

Durkheim&#x27;s discovery of social facts was significant because it promised to make it possible to study the behaviour of entire societies, rather than just of particular individuals. Durkheim points to individual actions as instances or representations of different types of actions in society. Some contemporary, interpretivist, sociologists like Max Atkinson and Jack Douglas refer to Durkheim&#x27;s studies for two quite different purposes, however:

* Durkheim&#x27;s studies are graphic demonstrations of how careful the social researcher must be to ensure that data gathered for analysis are accurate. Durkheim&#x27;s reported suicide rates were, it is now clear, largely an artifact of the way particular deaths were classified as &quot;suicide&quot; or &quot;non-suicide&quot; by different communities. What he actually discovered was not different &quot;suicide rates&quot; at all, but different ways of &quot;thinking about suicide&quot;.
* His studies are also an entry point into the study of social meaning and the way that apparently identical individual acts often cannot be classified empirically. Social &quot;acts&quot; (even such an apparently private and individual act as suicide), in this modern view, are always seen (and classified) by social &quot;actors&quot;. Discovering the social facts about such acts, it follows, is generally neither possible nor desirable, but discovering the way individuals perceive and classify particular acts is what offers insight. A further complication is introduced by asking about the status of our &quot;discovery&quot; of these perceptions and classifications. After all, don&#x27;t such purported &quot;discoveries&quot; &quot;also&quot; reflect socially embedded practices of classification? But if such discoveries of perceptions of social facts aren&#x27;t therefore dubious, it is hard to see why the original claims about the social facts are.

==Mauss&#x27;s total social fact==
For Marcel Mauss, Durkheim&#x27;s nephew and sometime collaborator, a &quot;total social fact&quot; (French &quot;fait social total&quot;) is &quot;an activity that has implications throughout society, in the economic, legal, political, and religious spheres.&quot;
Diverse strands of social and psychological life are woven together through what he came to call &quot;total social facts&quot;. A total social fact informs and organizes seemingly quite distinct practices and institutions. Marcel Mauss popularized the term in his book, &quot;The Gift&quot;:

<doc id="168795" wikidata="Q509225" url="?curid=168795" title="C. Douglas Dillon">
<text>Clarence Douglas Dillon (born Clarence Douglass Dillon; August 21, 1909January 10, 2003) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the United States ambassador to France from 1953 to 1957 and as the 57th United States secretary of the treasury from 1961 to 1965. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (ExComm) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. His conservative economic policies while Secretary of the Treasury were designed to protect the U.S. dollar.

==Early life==
Dillon was born on August 21, 1909, in Geneva, Switzerland, the son of American parents, Anne McEldin (née Douglass) and financier Clarence Dillon. Although Dillon grew up as a patrician, his paternal grandfather, Samuel Lapowski, was a poor Jewish emigrant from Poland. After leaving Poland, his grandfather settled in Texas after the American Civil War and married Dillon&#x27;s Swedish-American grandmother. Dillon&#x27;s father later changed his family name to Dillon, an Anglicization of &quot;Dylion&quot;, his grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. Dillon&#x27;s mother was descended from the Graham family, Lairds of Tamrawer Castle at Kilsyth, Stirling, Scotland.

Dillon began his education at Pine Lodge School in Lakehurst, New Jersey. He continued at Groton School in Massachusetts, then at Harvard College, A.B. magna cum laude 1931 in American history and literature. Dillon earned a varsity letter for football his senior year.

==Career==
In 1938, he became Vice-President and Director of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., a firm that bore his father&#x27;s name (Clarence Dillon). After his World War II service on Guam, on Saipan, and in the Philippines, he left the United States Navy as Lieutenant Commander decorated with the Legion of Merit and Air Medal. In 1946 he became chairman of Dillon, Read; by 1952 he had doubled the firm&#x27;s investments.

===Political career===
Dillon had been active in Republican politics since 1934. He worked for John Foster Dulles in Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s 1948 presidential campaign. In 1951 he organized the New Jersey effort to secure the 1952 Republican nomination for Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was also a major contributor to Eisenhower&#x27;s general election campaign in 1952.

President Eisenhower appointed him United States Ambassador to France in 1953. Following his return he became Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1958 before becoming Under Secretary of State the following year. &quot;TIME&quot; reported that if Richard Nixon had won the presidential election of 1960 that Dillon was to be chosen as Secretary of State.

==Secretary of the Treasury==

In 1961, John F. Kennedy, appointed Republican Dillon Treasury Secretary. Dillon remained Treasury Secretary under President Lyndon B. Johnson until 1965.
According to Richard Dean Burns and Joseph M. Siracusa, Dillon&#x27;s leadership of the economic policy team, exerted significant conservative influence on the overall direction of the administration. He effectively convinced the president that the nation&#x27;s main economic challenge was the balance of payments deficit, leading to the adoption of a moderate approach and the dismissal of more radical liberal solutions to domestic issues. President Kennedy&#x27;s choice of Dillon as Secretary of the Treasury reflected a deep concern about the balance of payments deficit and the resulting &quot;gold drain.&quot; By choosing Dillon, a Wall Street figure with strong Republican connections and a reputation for advocating sound monetary policies, Kennedy aimed to reassure the financial community, which was apprehensive about the potential loose monetary policies of the incoming Democratic administration. According to Theodore Sorensen, the president&#x27;s choice was primarily influenced by the need to maintain global confidence in the dollar and prevent a massive conversion of dollars into gold. Kennedy shared Dillon&#x27;s moderately conservative economic perspectives at the time of his appointment, and Dillon enjoyed close access to the president throughout his presidency. He was one of the few political associates who socialized with Kennedy as well. The emphasis placed by Kennedy and Dillon on addressing the balance of payments issue had a substantial impact on the administration&#x27;s overall economic policy, steering it toward conservatism. The growing annual deficits in dollar payments had led to a significant accumulation of dollars in the hands of foreign banks and governments. The recurring loss of confidence in the value of the dollar prompted foreign holders to exchange their dollars for American gold, which had a fixed value relative to the dollar. This &quot;gold drain&quot; raised concerns within the financial community and remained a prominent issue during both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. In an effort to stabilize the status of the dollar and halt the outflow of gold, the Kennedy administration avoided economic measures that could potentially increase inflation and undermine foreign confidence in the dollar. During the initial years of Kennedy&#x27;s presidency, Dillon&#x27;s success in prioritizing the payments deficit prevented more aggressive fiscal and monetary interventions in the economy or increased spending on social programs.

On tariff policy, Dillon proposed the fifth round of tariff negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), conducted in Geneva 1960–1962; it came to be called the &quot;Dillon Round&quot; and led to substantial tariff reduction. Dillon was important in securing presidential power for reciprocal tariff reductions under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He also played a role in crafting the Revenue Act of 1962, which established a 7 percent investment credit to spur industrial growth. He supervised revision of depreciation rules to benefit corporate investment.

Dillon supervised the development of a reform package. He made a case before Congress to withhold taxes on interest and dividend income. The goal was to combat widespread tax evasion. Additionally, he advocated for the closure of loopholes utilized by foreign &quot;tax haven&quot; corporations and businessmen who deducted entertainment expenses. Although Congress rejected most of the administration&#x27;s reform program during the summer of 1962, Dillon nevertheless endorsed the final package because it included a 7 percent investment tax credit.

Kennedy also made use of Dillon&#x27;s diplomatic skills. He was made the leader of the American delegation dispatched to Punta del Este, Uruguay, in August 1961 to commence the Alliance for Progress. Dillon committed the U.S. to provide $20 billion in low-interest loans over the next decade to enhance the living conditions in Latin America. He endorsed the &quot;revolution of rising expectations&quot; and aimed to convert it into a &quot;revolution of rising satisfactions.&quot; Additionally, Dillon served on the National Security Council and actively participated in the intense discussions surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.

==Philanthropy==
A close friend of John D. Rockefeller III, he was chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1972 to 1975. He also served alongside John Rockefeller on the 1973 Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, and under Nelson Rockefeller in the Rockefeller Commission to investigate CIA activities. He served as president of Harvard Board of Overseers, chairman of the Brookings Institution, and vice chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.

===Metropolitan Museum of Art===
With his first wife, Dillon collected Impressionist art. He was a longtime trustee of the Metropolitan Museum, serving as its President (1970–1977) and then chairman. He built up its Chinese galleries and served as a member of the Museum&#x27;s Centennial committee. He personally donated $20 million to the museum and led a fundraising campaign, which raised an additional $100 million.

He received the Medal of Freedom in 1989.

==Personal life==
On March 10, 1931, Dillon married the former Phyllis Chess Ellsworth (1910–1982) in Boston, Massachusetts. Phyllis was the daughter of John Chess Ellsworth and Alice Frances Chalifoux. The couple had two daughters:

* Phyllis Ellsworth Dillon Collins
* Joan Douglas Dillon (b. 1935), former president of French Bordeaux wine company Domaine Clarence Dillon.

In 1983, the widowed Dillon married the former Susan &quot;Suzzie&quot; Slater (1917–2019). She had first been married to Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Sheldon Bassett (1911–1983) in 1939 (div.). In 1949 she married British entertainer Jack Buchanan (1891–1957). In 1961 she wed DeWitt Linn Sage (1905–1982), who again left her a widow.

Dillon died of natural causes on January 10, 2003, at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City at the age of 93.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Joan&#x27;s first marriage, he was a grandfather of Joan Dillon Moseley (b. 1954), and through her second marriage to Prince Charles of Luxembourg, he was a grandfather to Princess Charlotte (b. 1967) and Prince Robert (b. 1968) followed. After Prince Charles&#x27; death in 1977, Joan married Philippe, 8th duc de Mouchy in 1978, without further issue.

==In fiction==
In the Brendan DuBois novel &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; (1999), the Cuban Missile Crisis erupts into a full-scale nuclear war and Washington, D.C., is destroyed. President John F. Kennedy is killed, as is Vice President Lyndon Johnson, most of the Senate and Congress, and most members of the Kennedy administration. Dillon, the Secretary of the Treasury, is eventually found to have survived the war and becomes the 36th President of the United States.

<doc id="168798" wikidata="Q1345276" url="?curid=168798" title="Molly Malone">
<text>&quot;Molly Malone&quot; (Roud 16932, also known as &quot;Cockles and Mussels&quot; or &quot;In Dublin&#x27;s Fair City&quot;) is a song set in Dublin, Ireland, which has become its unofficial anthem.

A statue representing Molly Malone was unveiled on Grafton Street by then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Ben Briscoe, during the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations, when 13 June was declared to be Molly Malone Day.

In July 2014, the statue was relocated to Suffolk Street, in front of the Tourist Information Office, to make way for Luas track-laying work at the old location.

==History==
The song tells the fictional tale of a fishwife who plied her trade on the streets of Dublin and died young, of a fever. In the late 20th century, a legend grew up that there was a historical Molly, who lived in the 17th century. She is typically represented as a hawker by day and a part-time prostitute by night. In contrast, she has also been portrayed as one of the few chaste female street hawkers of her day.

There is no evidence that the song is based on a real woman in the 17th century or any other time. The name &quot;Molly&quot; originated as a familiar version of the names Mary and Margaret. Many such &quot;Molly&quot; Malones were born in Dublin over the centuries, but no evidence connects any of them to the events in the song. Nevertheless, the Dublin Millennium Commission in 1988 endorsed claims made for a Mary Malone who died on 13 June 1699, and proclaimed 13 June to be &quot;Molly Malone Day&quot;.

The song is not recorded earlier than 1876, when it was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Its placement in the section of the book titled &quot;Songs from English and German Universities&quot; suggests an Irish origin. It was also published by Francis Brothers and Day in London in 1884 as a work written and composed by James Yorkston, of Edinburgh, with music arranged by Edmund Forman. The London edition states that it was reprinted by permission of Kohler and Son of Edinburgh, implying that the first edition was in Scotland, but no copies of it have been found.

According to Siobhán Marie Kilfeather, the song is from the music hall style of the period, and one cannot wholly dismiss the possibility that it is &quot;based on an older folk song&quot;, but &quot;neither melody nor words bear any relationship to the Irish tradition of street ballads&quot;. She calls the story of the historical Molly &quot;nonsense&quot;. The song is in a familiar tragicomic mode that was then popular and was probably influenced by earlier songs with a similar theme, such as Percy Montross&#x27;s &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;, which was written in about 1880.

A variant, &quot;Cockles and Mussels&quot;, with some different lyrics, appeared in &quot;Students&#x27; Songs: Comprising the Newest and Most Popular College Songs As Now Sung at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, ... Union, Etc&quot; in 1884.

A copy of &quot;Apollo&#x27;s Medley&quot;, dating from around 1790, published in Doncaster and rediscovered in 2010, contains a song referring to &quot;Sweet Molly Malone&quot; on page 78 that ends with the line &quot;Och! I&#x27;ll roar and I&#x27;ll groan, My sweet Molly Malone, Till I&#x27;m bone of your bone, And asleep in your bed.&quot; Other than this name and the fact that she lives in Howth, near Dublin, this song bears no resemblance to &quot;Molly Malone&quot;. The song was later reprinted in the collection &quot;The Shamrock: A Collection of Irish Songs&quot; (1831) and was published in &quot;The Edinburgh Literary Journal&quot; that year with the title &quot;Molly Malone&quot;.

Some elements of the song appear in several earlier songs. A character named Molly Malone appears in at least two other songs. The song &quot;Widow Malone,&quot; published as early as 1809, refers to the title character alternately as &quot;Molly Malone,&quot; &quot;Mary Malone&quot; and &quot;sweet mistress Malone&quot;. Another song, &quot;Meet Me Miss Molly Malone&quot;, was published as early as 1836 in Glasgow, and in America in 1840. The song &quot;Pat Corney&#x27;s Account of Himself&quot;, published as early as 1826, begins, &quot;Now it&#x27;s show me that city where the girls are so pretty&quot; and ends, &quot;Crying oysters, and cockles, and Mussels for sale.&quot; During the 19th century, the expression &quot;Dublin&#x27;s fair city&quot; was used regularly in reference to Dublin, and the phrase &quot;alive, alive O&quot; is known to have been shouted by street vendors selling oysters, mussels, fish and eels.

==Statue==

Molly Malone is commemorated in a statue commissioned by Jurys Hotel Group and designed by Jeanne Rynhart, erected to celebrate the city&#x27;s first millennium in 1988. It was originally intended that Rynhart would be commissioned to create a further 12 street sculptures, including those of famous literary figures such as W. B. Yeats and Oscar Wilde, with the intention of creating a sculpture trail in the city. The unveiling of the statue was not met with universal praise, with Adrian Munnelly, director of the Arts Council in his capacity as registrar of Aosdána, writing to Bord Fáilte (the National Tourism Development) at the time to express his members&#x27; &quot;universal depreciation&quot; noting the statue was &quot;entirely deficient in artistic point and merit&quot;. Lord Mayor of Dublin Ben Briscoe defended the statue, saying &quot;the statue was regarded with great warmth and affection by the city of Dublin&quot;.

The statue was originally placed at the bottom of Grafton Street, and as with other public art in the city, was christened colloquially as &quot;The Tart with the Cart&quot;. The statue portrays Molly as a busty young woman in 17th-century dress, which would have consisted of a full-length chemise, overskirt and basque of wool. Her low-cut dress and large breasts were justified on the grounds that as &quot;women breastfed publicly in Molly&#x27;s time, breasts were popped out all over the place.&quot; The traditional, but revealing, costume in which she was sculpted by Rynhart may have also nodded to her supposed job as a part-time prostitute.

In April 2014, the statue was removed from its original location at the base of Grafton Street and kept in storage to make way for the new Luas tracks which skirted around Trinity College. During the removal of the statue, some cracks were revealed which required restoration work. This was carried out by Bushy Park Ironworks in the city. Speaking to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, ironworks employee Edward Bisgood noted how the company was &quot;carrying out some patination to bring her back to her original dark brown colour, but (was) leaving the areas where she&#x27;s been rubbed over the years, so she will look as people remember her, but she&#x27;ll be a lot stronger&quot;. In July 2014, the statue was placed in its new location outside the Dublin Tourist Office (formerly St. Andrew&#x27;s Church) on Suffolk Street, a short distance from the original site. Due to its notability and location, the statue is also a common starting and finishing point for some of Dublin city&#x27;s walking tours.

According to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; &quot;sometime before 2014&quot;, tourists began rubbing the statue&#x27;s bosom area &quot;for luck&quot;, with some visitors getting a photo of themselves doing so. The relatively new practice has been criticised by some, including Dublin-born singer Imelda May, who associated it with the objectification of women and questioned how &quot;the only statue in Dublin with breasts is basically assaulted in front of our children&#x27;s eyes daily&quot;. In February 2024, a local busker initiated a campaign named &#x27;Leave Molly &#x27; to draw attention to the misogynistic trend and call for its cessation.

==In popular culture==
In the film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), a drunk tramp sings &quot;Molly Malone&quot; in a tunnel before being assaulted by the Alex and his gang, whom Alex refers to as his &quot;droogs&quot;. In the film &quot;Premature Burial&quot; (1962), a character plays the melody to &quot;Molly Malone&quot; on the piano.

The Irish soap opera &quot;Fair City&quot; derives its title from the opening line of the song: &quot;In Dublin&#x27;s fair city, where the girls are so pretty...&quot;

==Recordings==
Versions of the song &quot;Molly Malone&quot; have been recorded by many artists, including The Dubliners, Heino, Danny Kaye, Pete Seeger, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Johnny Logan, Fiddler&#x27;s Green, and Patty Gurdy. 

Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney recorded an updated version of the song titled &quot;The Daughter of Molly Malone&quot; on their album &quot;That Travelin&#x27; Two-Beat&quot; (1965). Crosby also sang the song on the album &quot;A Little Bit of Irish&quot; recorded in 1966.

A version of the song was released as a charity single in 1998, to mark the Dublin Millennium, and reached number 4 in the Irish singles chart.

Versions of the song have also been recorded in Russian (as &quot;Душа моя, Молли&quot; or &quot;Molly, my soul&quot;), French, and in Dutch (as &quot;kokkels en mossels&quot;).

<text>An embolism is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing piece of material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus may be a blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), amniotic fluid (amniotic fluid embolism), or foreign material.

An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (vascular occlusion) may affect a part of the body distant from the origin of the embolus. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism.

An embolism is usually a pathological event, caused by illness or injury. Sometimes it is created intentionally for a therapeutic reason, such as to stop bleeding or to kill a cancerous tumor by stopping its blood supply. Such therapy is called embolization.

== Classification ==
There are different types of embolism, some of which are listed below.

Embolism can be classified based on where it enters the circulation, either in arteries or in veins. Arterial embolism are those that follow and, if not dissolved on the way, lodge in a more distal part of the systemic circulation. Sometimes, multiple classifications apply; for instance a pulmonary embolism is classified as an arterial embolism as well, because the clot follows the pulmonary artery carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the embolus forms in veins, e.g. deep vein thrombosis.

=== Arterial ===

Arterial embolism can cause occlusion in any part of the body. It is a major cause of infarction (tissue death from blockage of the blood supply).

An embolus lodging in the brain from either the heart or a carotid artery will most likely be the cause of a stroke due to ischemia.

An arterial embolus might originate in the heart (from a thrombus in the left atrium, following atrial fibrillation or be a septic embolus resulting from endocarditis). Emboli of cardiac origin are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Thrombus formation within the atrium occurs mainly in patients with mitral valve disease, and especially in those with mitral valve stenosis (narrowing), with atrial fibrillation (AF). In the absence of AF, pure mitral regurgitation has a low incidence of thromboembolism.

The risk of emboli forming in AF depends on other risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes, recent heart failure, or previous stroke.
Thrombus formation can also take place within the ventricles, and it occurs in approximately 30% of anterior-wall myocardial infarctions, compared with only 5% of inferior ones. Some other risk factors are poor ejection fraction (&lt;35%), size of infarct, and the presence of AF. In the first three months after infarction, left-ventricle aneurysms have a 10% risk of emboli forming. Patients with prosthetic valves also carry a significant increase in risk of thromboembolism. Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (mitral or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous emboli.

Emboli often have more serious consequences when they occur in the so-called &quot;end circulation&quot;: areas of the body that have no redundant blood supply, such as the brain and heart.

=== Venous ===

Assuming a normal circulation, an embolus formed in a systemic vein will always impact in the lungs, after passing through the right side of the heart. This will form a pulmonary embolism that will result in a blockage of the main artery of the lung and can be a complication of deep-vein thrombosis. The most common sites of origin of pulmonary emboli are the &quot;femoral&quot; veins. The deep veins of the calf are the most common sites of actual thrombi.

=== Paradoxical (venous to arterial) ===

In paradoxical embolism, also known as crossed embolism, an embolus from the veins crosses to the arterial blood system. This is generally found only with heart problems such as septal defects (holes in the cardiac septum) between the atria or ventricles. The most common such abnormality is patent foramen ovale, occurring in about 25% of the adult population, but here the defect functions as a valve which is normally closed, because pressure is slightly higher in the left side of the heart. Sometimes, for example if a patient coughs just when an embolus is passing, it might cross to the arterial system.

=== Direction ===
The direction of the embolus can be one of two types:
* Anterograde
* Retrograde

In anterograde embolism, the movement of emboli is in the direction of blood flow. In retrograde embolism, the emboli move in opposition to the blood flow direction; this is usually significant only in blood vessels with low pressure (veins) or with emboli of high weight.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;embolism&quot; comes from the Greek ἐμβολισμός, meaning &quot;interpressure&quot;.

<text>Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.

The genus is widespread across tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions in Africa, Eurasia, Australia, the Americas, and assorted oceanic islands. Several species are cultivated and naturalized in areas outside their native habitats.

&quot;Saccharum&quot; includes the sugarcanes. They have stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are generally rich in sugar, and measure two to six m (6 to 19 ft) tall. All sugarcane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.

<doc id="168805" wikidata="Q730506" url="?curid=168805" title="Laeken">
<text>&#x27; (French, ) or &#x27; (Dutch, ) is a residential suburb in the north-western part of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. It belongs to the municipality of the City of Brussels and is mostly identified by the Belgian postal code: 1020. Prior to 1921, it was a separate municipality.

==Toponymy==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Laeken&quot; () derives from the Germanic &quot;Lacha&quot; or &quot;Lache&quot; (&quot;water&quot;, &quot;lake&quot;), because the Molenbeek brook at the time formed a network of ponds at this height. The oldest mention of the village is in a diploma from 1080, where the name &quot;Gilbert de Lacha&quot; appears. There is also the mention &quot;Lachus&quot; in 1117.

==Main sights==

===Royal Palace===

The Royal Palace of Laeken, official home of the Belgian royal family, is situated in Laeken. The palace was built in 1782–1784 by the French architect and urbanist Charles de Wailly. It was partly destroyed by fire in 1890, and was rebuilt and extended by the architect Alphonse Balat. The French architect Charles Girault gave it its present outline in 1902. It has been the royal residence since the accession to the throne of King Leopold I in 1831. The former King Albert II and Queen Paola live in the Belvédère, a château on the grounds of the park surrounding the palace, while King Philippe and Queen Mathilde live in the main palace.

===Royal Greenhouses===

The Royal Domain also contains the large Royal Greenhouses of Laeken, a set of monumental dome-shaped constructions, accessible to the public only a few days a year. They were designed by Alphonse Balat, with the cooperation of the young Victor Horta.

===Church of Our Lady===
A little south of the Royal Palace, one can find the neo-Gothic Church of Our Lady, initially built as a mausoleum for Queen Louise-Marie, wife of Leopold I, whose children included King Leopold II and Empress Carlota of Mexico. The architect was Joseph Poelaert, designer of the famed Brussels&#x27; Palace of Justice. The church contains the Royal Crypt, where the members of the Belgian royal family are buried. In February each year, a memorial mass for deceased members of the royal family is held at the church. In the nave of the church, the tomb of Cardinal Joseph Cardijn can also be found.

===Laeken Cemetery===

Laeken Cemetery, located behind the church, is known as the &quot;Belgian Père Lachaise&quot;, after the famous cemetery in Paris, because it used to be the burial place of the rich and the famous. It harbours the graves of, among others, the symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff and the opera singer Maria Malibran, and also features an original cast of &quot;The Thinker&quot; (&quot;Le Penseur&quot;), by Auguste Rodin.

===Chinese Pavilion and Japanese Tower===

A little north of the Royal Palace stand the Chinese Pavilion and the Japanese Tower. The Chinese Pavilion was commissioned by Leopold II and now forms part of the Museums of the Far East. The rooms of the Chinese Pavilion are designed in &quot;chinoiserie&quot; Louis XIV and Louis XVI styles. They are decorated with Chinese motifs, chinaware and silverware. The Japanese Tower is a pagoda (known as a Tō), inspired by a construction Leopold II saw at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Leopold II commissioned his architect Alexandre Marcel to build him a similar one in Laeken.

===Other places of interest===
Other places of interest in Laeken include the King Baudouin Stadium, the Bruparck entertainment park (with the Atomium, Mini-Europe miniature park and Kinepolis cinema), the Centenary Palace, home to the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo), the Monument to the Dynasty in Laeken Park, as well as the Port of Brussels, next to which the &quot;Monument to Work&quot; by Constantin Meunier was erected.

The impressive buildings of the former goods station of Tour &amp; Taxis and the surrounding area border the neighbourhood, and will be turned into residences, as well as commercial enterprises.

<doc id="168833" wikidata="Q154121" url="?curid=168833" title="Micro-">
<text>Micro (Greek letter μ, mu, non-italic) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10−6 (one millionth). It comes from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;small&quot;.

It is the only SI prefix which uses a character not from the Latin alphabet. In Unicode, the symbol is represented by or the legacy symbol . The prefix &quot;mc&quot; is commonly used in healthcare or when the character &quot;μ&quot; is not available; for example, &quot;mcg&quot; commonly denotes a microgram. The letter &quot;u&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;μ&quot; when non-Latin characters are not available.

==Examples==
* Typical bacteria are 1 to 10 micrometer (1–10 μm) in diameter. 
* Eukaryotic cells are typically 10 to 100 micrometers in diameter.

==Symbol encoding in character sets==
The official symbol for the SI prefix &quot;micro&quot; is a Greek lowercase mu (μ). For reasons stemming from its design, Unicode has two different character codes for the letter, with slightly different appearance in some fonts, although most fonts use the same glyph. () is in the &quot;Latin-1 Supplement&quot; range identical to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (since 1987), residing at this code point also in DEC MCS (since 1983) and ECMA-94 (since 1985). () is in the Greek range. According to The Unicode Consortium, the Greek letter character is preferred, but implementations must recognize the micro sign as well, for compatibility with legacy character sets. This distinction also occurs in some legacy code pages, notably Windows-1253.

In circumstances in which only the Latin alphabet is available, ISO 2955 (since 1974, withdrawn 2001), DIN 66030 (since 1980) and BS 6430 (since 1983) allow the prefix codice_1 to be substituted by the letter codice_2 (or even codice_3, if lowercase letters are not available), as, for example, in codice_4 for codice_5, or codice_6 for codice_7, or in the common abbreviation codice_8 for microcontroller (μC).
Similarly, capacitor values according to the RKM code defined in IEC 60062 (since 1952) can be written as codice_9 (or codice_10) instead of codice_11 if the Greek letter codice_1 is not available.

The CJK Compatibility block contains square forms of some Japanese katakana measure and currency units.
 corresponds to .

==Other abbreviating conventions==
In some health care institutions, house rules deprecate the standard symbol for microgram, &quot;μg&quot;, in prescribing or chart recording, because of the risk of giving an incorrect dose because of the misreading of poor handwriting. The two alternatives are to abbreviate as &quot;mcg&quot; or to write out &quot;microgram&quot; in full (see also List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions). The alternative abbreviation may be ambiguous in rare circumstances in that &quot;mcg&quot; could also be read as a &quot;micrigram&quot;, i.e. 10−14 g; however the prefix &quot;micri&quot; is not standard, nor widely known, and is considered obsolete. This deprecation, focused on avoiding incorrect dosing in contexts where handwriting is often present, does not extend to all health-care contexts and institutions (for example, some clinical laboratories&#x27; reports adhere to it, whereas others do not), and in physical sciences research, &quot;μg&quot; remains the sole official abbreviation.

In medical data exchange according to the Health Level 7 (HL7) standard, the μ can be replaced by u as well.

<text>Closure or need for closure (NFC), used interchangeably with need for cognitive closure (NFCC), are social psychological terms that describe an individual&#x27;s desire for a clear, firm answer or peaceful resolution to a question or problem to avert ambiguity.

The term &quot;need&quot; denotes a motivated tendency to seek out information. The need for closure is the motivation to find an answer to an ambiguous situation. This motivation is enhanced by the perceived benefits of obtaining closure, such as the increased ability to predict the world and a stronger basis for action. This motivation is also enhanced by the perceived costs of lacking closure, such as dealing with uncertainty. A sense of closure is not usually possible with ambiguous loss, such as a missing person, and the hoped-for benefits, such as a sense of relief after the death of a person who inflicted harm, are not necessarily obtained. Because of this mismatch between what individuals hope will happen if they achieve closure and what they actually experience, the idea of getting closure has been described as a myth.

The level of the need for cognitive closure is a fairly stable individual characteristic. It can affect what information individuals seek out and how they process it. This need can be affected by situational factors. For example, in the presence of circumstances that increase the need for closure, individuals are more likely to use simple cognitive structures to process information.

According to Kruglanski &quot;et al&quot;., need for closure exerts its effects via two general tendencies: the urgency tendency (the inclination to attain closure as quickly as possible) and the permanence tendency (the tendency to maintain it for as long as possible). Together, these tendencies may produce the inclinations to seize and then freeze on early judgmental cues, reducing the extent of information processing and hypothesis generation and introducing biases in thinking.

==Need for Closure Scale==
The need for closure in social psychology is thought to be a fairly stable dispositional characteristic that can, nonetheless, be affected by situational factors. The Need for Closure Scale (NFCS) was developed by Arie Kruglanski, Donna Webster, and Adena Klem in 1993 and is designed to operationalize this construct and is presented as a unidimensional instrument possessing strong discriminant and predictive validity.

People who score high on the need for closure scale are more likely to exhibit impression primacy effects to correspondence bias, make stereotypical judgments, assimilate new information to existing, active beliefs, and, in the presence of prior information, resist persuasion. Someone rating low on need for closure will express more ideational fluidity and creative acts. Items on the scale include statements such as &quot;I think that having clear rules and order at work is essential to success,&quot; and &quot;I do not like situations that are uncertain.&quot; Items such as &quot;Even after I&#x27;ve made up my mind about something, I am always eager to consider a different opinion,&quot; and &quot;I like to have friends who are unpredictable&quot; are reverse scored.

Composed of 42 items, the scale has been used in numerous research studies and has been translated into multiple languages. Although Webster and Kruglanski (1994) treated the Need for Closure Scale as unidimensional (i.e., as measuring a single factor), the scale actually contains two orthogonal factors, decisiveness and need for structure. Thus, using a total scale score can overlook effects for each factor and complicate interpretations. In 2007, Roets and Van Hiel tried to resolve this issue by revising the scale so it would measure only one thing. They came up with a set of new decisiveness items that provided a viable alternative for the old Decisiveness subscale of the NFCS, which was poorly related to the other NFCS facet scales and had questionable validity. The new items were developed with explicit reference to decisiveness but formulated in such a way that they relate to the need rather than to the ability to decide. In 2011, Roets and Van Hiel created an abridged and empirically validated NFC scale consisting of only 15 items from the original NFC.

NFCS items correlate positively with authoritarianism, intolerance of ambiguity, dogmatism, need for order and structure and negatively with cognitive complexity and impulsivity, among several other cognitive tools and personality traits.

High NFC scores consistently correlate with items on the C-Scale (conservatism) as well as other measures of political and social conservatism.

==Need to avoid closure==

Functionally opposite to the need for closure is the need to avoid closure. Need to avoid closure reflects the desire to suspend judgmental commitment. It also contains the subcategories specific and non-specific need to avoid closure. Avoidance of specific closure reflects the desire to avoid specific answers to one&#x27;s questions. The non-specific need to avoid closure is much like the need for closure irrespective of whether or not this new knowledge points to a conclusion having positive or negative implications for them.

The need to avoid closure may stem from the perceived costs of possessing closure (e.g., envisioned penalties for an erroneous closure or perceived drawbacks of actions implied by closure) and the perceived benefits of lacking closure (e.g., immunity from possible criticism of any given closure). The need to avoid closure is controlled by the desire to avoid negative consequences of achieving closure of a situation or to continue the benefits of not closing but elongating a situation.

The need and avoidance of closure are conceptualized as ends of a continuum ranging from strong strivings for closure to strong resistance of closure. This is applied in the NFC Scale.

==Lack of closure==
The lack of closure leaves a situation in ambiguity. People high in need for closure seek to avoid this ambiguity at all costs where people high in need to avoid closure strive to make situations more ambiguous. Some perceived benefits of cognitive closure may relate to predictability, the basis for action, or social status accorded the possessors of knowledge (i.e., &quot;experts&quot;). Similarly, some perceived costs of lacking closure may relate to the additional time and effort required to attain closure, or the unpleasantness of process whereby closure must be reached. Occasionally, however, lack of closure may be perceived to offer various advantages such as freedom from a constraining commitment, neutrality in an acrimonious dispute, the maintenance of a romantic mystery and so on. Though lack of closure is generally thought of as being negative, it is clear that closure and lack of closure have positive or negative implications depending on the person and situation surrounding them.

==Implications==
A need for cognitive closure may occur while engaged in goal-driven or goal-motivated cognitive functions (e.g., attention control, memory recall, information selection and processing, cognitive inhibition, etc.). Ideally, people should attempt to acquire new knowledge to satisfy questions regarding particular issues (specific cognitive closure) irrespective of whether that knowledge points to a conclusion having positive or negative implications for them (non-specific cognitive closure). But because urgency and permanence are central to the motivational core of this overall process, individuals (or groups) may be compelled, consciously or unconsciously, to obtain information prematurely and irrespective of content.

A high need for cognitive closure might then invite bias in:
# selecting the most relevant information one should attend to for increasing chances of adaptation
# initiating and sustaining cognitive manipulations that are required to achieve particular outcomes
# making judgments and assessments of input information
# weighing information during the course of decision-making

For example, the level of NFCC can influence decision-making strategies used by an individual. In a study by Choi et al. that manipulated NFCC, the authors found that a higher NFCC was associated with a preference for using the faster &quot;attribute-based search&quot; which involves examining all available alternatives on one attribute and then moving on to the next attribute. Individuals with a lower NFCC, in contrast, used the &quot;alternative-based search&quot;, such that they examine all attributes of one alternative, then move on to the next alternative. Thus, studying NFCC has huge implications for consumer buying behavior.

Need for closure has also been found to have a role in race- and gender-based prejudice. Roets describes a conceptual fit between Allport&#x27;s &quot;motivated cognitive style&quot; of individuals who exhibit prejudice and Kruglanksi and Webster&#x27;s concept of high-NFCC individuals, such that both display urgency tendency i.e. the desire for quick, definite answers and permanence tendency i.e., the perseverance of the obtained answer in spite of contradictory information. Thus, NFC provides a strong empirical base for Allport&#x27;s hypothesized underlying cognitive style of prejudiced individuals.
A high need also induces the tendency to form knowledge more quickly, tying into other concepts, such as a tendency to prefer autocracy i.e. &quot;hard&quot; forms of influence that motivate the targets to comply with the agents&#x27; demands quickly via the promise of positive consequences or the threat of negative consequences, rather than &quot;soft&quot; forms of influence that might use extended argumentation or persuasion.

Additionally, and especially in those with strong needs for certainty (as measured on NFC Scale), the impulse to achieve cognitive closure may sometimes produce or evoke a mood instability, and/or truncated perceptions of one&#x27;s available behavioral choices, should some newly acquired information challenge preconceptions that they had long considered to be certain, permanent and inviolate e.g. certain religious or ethical views and values.

Thus it is apparent that the need for cognitive closure may have important implications for both personal and inter-personal thoughts and actions, including some related to educational processes and school learning.

==In education==
Formal education environments, such as elementary and secondary schools, present opportunities for learners to acquire new knowledge and skills, and to achieve deep, domain-specific conceptual mastery which, through well-designed pedagogical guidance and academic study, may enhance future career readiness, civic engagement, and general well-being. However, although it is understood that the basic principles of learning assert the importance of attending to students&#x27; prior knowledge, fostering conceptual understanding, and cultivating metacognitive awareness, students must also become engaged and be willing to tolerate and cognitively work through the intellectual ambiguity often associated with exposure to novel information and tasks.

Yet for students who have high need for cognitive closure, this phenomenon may inadvertently lead to the inhibition of cognitive functions and processes essential to the learning process, so that they can maintain their prior certainty and/or perceived permanence of personally or socially important ideas, even if those ideas or knowledge are distinctly unrelated to any specific content or information being presented in the classroom. In instances such as these, an individual&#x27;s desire for cognitive closure in another area may outweigh her/his motivation to expend cognitive resources toward learning new information. As a result, the student may appear uninterested and susceptible to under-achieving e.g. poor grades or not performing to expected levels.

In the absence of understanding and consideration of how need for cognitive closure may influence academic and/or achievement motivation, educators may erroneously conclude that a student does not have a desire to learn or that she/he has a cognitive, psychological, intellectual, or behavioral deficiency that is impeding the learning process. This is not to suggest that need for cognitive closure is a suitable explanation for all learning problems; however, in working with students who appear to be experiencing learning challenges manifested through amotivation or low motivation, it would not be unreasonable to explore need for cognitive closure as a potential factor.

==Research==
Individuals scoring high on the NFCS are more likely to attempt to draw closure by relying on incipient cues, and the first-encountered apparent fit. The need for closure is also said to predispose a very narrow or shallow information search, along with a higher tendency to use cognitive heuristics, when seeking solutions. (Van Hiel and Mervielde, 2003)

In studies on creativity, individuals with high need-for-closure ratings had low creativity scores. Those low in need-for-closure more frequently produced novel solutions that motivated and inspired others in their groups, and the outcomes of the projects in which they participated were rated as correspondingly more productive.

Most research on the need for closure has investigated its relation to social stimuli. However, recent research suggests that it may also predict responses to non-social stimuli. In particular, the need for closure predicts an evaluative bias against deviant non-social stimuli (e.g., the letter &quot;A&quot; presented in a category of letter &quot;B&quot;s)

&quot;Closure&quot; has also been used more loosely to refer to the outcome of an experience which, by virtue of its completion, demonstrates a therapeutic value. Legal scholars have linked &quot;closure&quot; to &quot;catharsis&quot; and &quot;satisfaction&quot; and at times the legal system may be enlisted into an individual&#x27;s desire for the cessation of uncertainty. In the case of the death penalty, for example, victims seeking &quot;closure&quot; may adopt effective strategies as diverse as retribution, on one hand, and forgiveness on the other.

<text>The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body. It is composed of around 270 bones at birth – this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together. The bone mass in the skeleton makes up about 14% of the total body weight (ca. 10–11 kg for an average person) and reaches maximum mass between the ages of 25 and 30. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs.

The human skeleton performs six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation.

The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis exist. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. The human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth. Unlike most primates, human males do not have penile bones.

==Divisions==
===Axial===

The axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column (32–34 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the rib cage (12 pairs of ribs and the sternum), and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones).

The upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints. The bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments. The erector spinae muscles are also supporting and are useful for balance.

===Appendicular===

The appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction.

==Functions==

The skeleton serves six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals and endocrine regulation.

===Support===
The skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape. The pelvis, associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would collapse.

===Movement===
The joints between bones allow movement, some allowing a wider range of movement than others, e.g. the ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck. Movement is powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones, and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system.

It is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement. Shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly.

===Protection===
The skeleton helps to protect many vital internal organs from being damaged.
* The skull protects the brain
* The vertebrae protect the spinal cord.
* The rib cage, spine, and sternum protect the lungs, heart and major blood vessels.

===Blood cell production===
The skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis, the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow. In children, haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia. In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum.

===Storage===
The bone matrix can store calcium and is involved in calcium metabolism, and bone marrow can store iron in ferritin and is involved in iron metabolism. However, bones are not entirely made of calcium, but a mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite, the latter making up 70% of a bone. Hydroxyapatite is in turn composed of 39.8% of calcium, 41.4% of oxygen, 18.5% of phosphorus, and 0.2% of hydrogen by mass. Chondroitin sulfate is a sugar made up primarily of oxygen and carbon.

===Endocrine regulation===
Bone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.

==Sex differences==
Anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas, but tend to be limited in the skeleton. The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis are exhibited across human populations. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. It is not known whether or to what extent those differences are genetic or environmental.

===Skull===
A variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism, such as the median nuchal line, mastoid processes, supraorbital margin, supraorbital ridge, and the chin.

===Dentition===
Human inter-sex dental dimorphism centers on the canine teeth, but it is not nearly as pronounced as in the other great apes.

===Long bones===
Long bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population. Muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the long bones is commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses.

===Pelvis===
The human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones, specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity, ilia, greater sciatic notches, and the sub-pubic angle. The Phenice method is commonly used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96% to 100% accuracy in some populations.

Women&#x27;s pelvises are wider in the pelvic inlet and are wider throughout the pelvis to allow for child birth. The sacrum in the women&#x27;s pelvis is curved inwards to allow the child to have a &quot;funnel&quot; to assist in the child&#x27;s pathway from the uterus to the birth canal.

==Clinical significance==

There are many classified skeletal disorders. One of the most common is osteoporosis. Also common is scoliosis, a side-to-side curve in the back or spine, often creating a pronounced &quot;C&quot; or &quot;S&quot; shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine. This condition is most apparent during adolescence, and is most common with females.

===Arthritis===
Arthritis is a disorder of the joints. It involves inflammation of one or more joints. When affected by arthritis, the joint or joints affected may be painful to move, may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely. The symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis. The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton. The cartilage in the affected joints will degrade, soften and wear away. This decreases the mobility of the joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be.

===Osteoporosis===

Osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of fractures. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average, as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, with the term &quot;established osteoporosis&quot; including the presence of a fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called &quot;postmenopausal osteoporosis&quot;, but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.

Osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. Calcium supplements may also be advised, as may vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing hormone replacement therapy.

==History==

===India===

The &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, composed between the 6th century BCE and 5th century CE speaks of 360 bones. Books on &quot;Salya-Shastra&quot; (surgical science) know of only 300. The text then lists the total of 300 as follows: 120 in the extremities (e.g. hands, legs), 117 in the pelvic area, sides, back, abdomen and breast, and 63 in the neck and upwards. The text then explains how these subtotals were empirically verified. The discussion shows that the Indian tradition nurtured diversity of thought, with Sushruta school reaching its own conclusions and differing from the Atreya-Caraka tradition. The differences in the count of bones in the two schools is partly because Charaka Samhita includes 32 tooth sockets in its count, and their difference of opinions on how and when to count a cartilage as bone (which both sometimes do, unlike modern anatomy).

===Hellenistic world===
The study of bones in ancient Greece started under Ptolemaic kings due to their link to Egypt. Herophilos, through his work by studying dissected human corpses in Alexandria, is credited to be the pioneer of the field. His works are lost but are often cited by notable persons in the field such as Galen and Rufus of Ephesus. Galen himself did little dissection though and relied on the work of others like Marinus of Alexandria, as well as his own observations of gladiator cadavers and animals. According to Katherine Park, in medieval Europe dissection continued to be practiced, contrary to the popular understanding that such practices were taboo and thus completely banned. The practice of &quot;holy autopsy&quot;, such as in the case of Clare of Montefalco further supports the claim. Alexandria continued as a center of anatomy under Islamic rule, with Ibn Zuhr a notable figure. Chinese understandings are divergent, as the closest corresponding concept in the medicinal system seems to be the meridians, although given that Hua Tuo regularly performed surgery, there may be some distance between medical theory and actual understanding.

===Renaissance===
Leonardo da Vinci made studies of the skeleton, albeit unpublished in his time. Many artists, Antonio del Pollaiuolo being the first, performed dissections for better understanding of the body, although they concentrated mostly on the muscles. Vesalius, regarded as the founder of modern anatomy, authored the book &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, which contained many illustrations of the skeleton and other body parts, correcting some theories dating from Galen, such as the lower jaw being a single bone instead of two. Various other figures like Alessandro Achillini also contributed to the further understanding of the skeleton.

===18th century===
As early as 1797, the death goddess or folk saint known as Santa Muerte has been represented as a skeleton.

<doc id="168850" wikidata="Q11124" url="?curid=168850" title="Stephen Breyer">
<text>Stephen Gerald Breyer ( ; born August 15, 1938) is an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1994 until his retirement in 2022. He was nominated by President Bill Clinton, and replaced retiring justice Harry Blackmun. Breyer was generally associated with the liberal wing of the Court. Since his retirement, he has been the Byrne Professor of Administrative Law and Process at Harvard Law School.

Born in San Francisco, Breyer attended Stanford University and the University of Oxford, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1964. After a clerkship with Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg in 1964–65, Breyer was a law professor and lecturer at Harvard Law School from 1967 until 1980. He specialized in administrative law, writing textbooks that remain in use today. He held other prominent positions before being nominated to the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the United States assistant attorney general for antitrust and assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer became a federal judge in 1980, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In his 2005 book &quot;Active Liberty&quot;, Breyer made his first attempt to systematically communicate his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.

On January 27, 2022, Breyer and President Joe Biden announced Breyer&#x27;s intention to retire from the Supreme Court. On February 25, 2022, Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and one of Breyer&#x27;s former law clerks, to succeed him. Breyer remained on the Supreme Court until June 30, 2022, when Jackson succeeded him. Breyer wrote majority opinions in landmark Supreme Court cases such as &quot;Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.&quot;, &quot;United States v. Lara&quot;, and &quot;Google v. Oracle&quot; and notable dissents questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty in cases such as &quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Breyer was born on August 15, 1938, in San Francisco, California, to Anne A. (&quot;née&quot; Roberts) and Irving Gerald Breyer. Breyer&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather emigrated from Romania to the United States, settling in Cleveland, Ohio, where Breyer&#x27;s grandfather was born. Breyer was raised in a middle-class Jewish family. His father was a lawyer who served as legal counsel to the San Francisco Board of Education. Breyer and his younger brother Charles R. Breyer, who later became a federal district judge, were active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. Breyer attended Lowell High School, where he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society and debated regularly in high school tournaments, including against future California governor Jerry Brown and future Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe.

After graduating from high school in 1955, Breyer studied philosophy at Stanford University. He graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Breyer was awarded a Marshall Scholarship, which he used to study philosophy, politics, and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, receiving a B.A. with first-class honors in 1961. He then returned to the United States to attend Harvard Law School, where he was an articles editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Laws degree, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

Breyer spent eight years in the United States Army Reserve during the Vietnam War, including six months on active duty in the Army Strategic Intelligence. He reached the rank of corporal and was honorably discharged in 1965.

In 1967, Breyer married Joanna Freda Hare, a psychologist and member of the British aristocracy, younger daughter of John Hare, 1st Viscount Blakenham and granddaughter of Richard Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel. They have three adult children: Chloe, an Episcopal priest; Nell; and Michael.

==Legal career==
After law school, Breyer served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court justice Arthur Goldberg from 1964 to 1965. He served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission, then spent two years in the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division as a special assistant to its assistant attorney general.

In 1967, Breyer returned to Harvard Law School as an assistant professor. He taught at Harvard Law until 1980, and held a joint appointment at Harvard Kennedy School from 1977 to 1980. At Harvard, Breyer was known as a leading expert on administrative law. While there, he wrote two highly influential books on deregulation: &quot;Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Effective Risk Regulation&quot; and &quot;Regulation and Its Reform&quot;. In 1970, Breyer wrote &quot;The Uneasy Case for Copyright&quot;, one of the most widely cited skeptical examinations of copyright. Breyer was a visiting professor at the College of Law in Sydney, Australia, the University of Rome, and the Tulane University Law School.

While teaching at Harvard, Breyer took several leaves of absence to serve in the U.S. government. He served as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act that closed the Civil Aeronautics Board.

==U.S. Court of Appeals (1980–1994)==

In the last days of President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration, on November 13, 1980, after he had been defeated for reelection, Carter nominated Breyer to the First Circuit, to a new seat established by , and the United States Senate confirmed him on December 9, 1980, by an 80–10 vote. He received his commission on December 10, 1980. From 1980 to 1994, Breyer was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit; he was the court&#x27;s Chief Judge from 1990 to 1994. One of his duties as chief judge was to oversee the design and construction of a new federal courthouse for Boston, beginning an avocational interest in architecture and the Pritzker Architecture Prize.

Breyer served as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States between 1990 and 1994 and the United States Sentencing Commission between 1985 and 1989. On the sentencing commission he played a key role in reforming federal criminal sentencing procedures, producing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which were formulated to increase uniformity in sentencing.

== Supreme Court (1994–2022) ==

In 1993, on the recommendation of Orrin Hatch, President Bill Clinton considered both Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the seat vacated by Byron White. Clinton ultimately appointed Ginsburg. 

After Harry Blackmun retired in 1994, Clinton initially offered the nomination to George Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader, who was retiring. Mitchell declined. Former governor of Arizona Bruce Babbitt, who ran for president in 1988 and was serving as Secretary of the Interior, was then offered the nomination, but also declined, saying he was looking forward to spending more time with his wife, Harriet C. Babbitt. She was serving as the 12th United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States. Babbitt later said that had he been confirmed to the court, she would have been compelled to resign and that he did not want to cause that. Both served in their positions to the end of Clinton&#x27;s presidency in January 2001. Clinton next offered the nomination to Harriett Woods, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and two-time Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate. Woods was serving as president of the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. She also declined, and recommended Breyer and U.S. representative Barbara Jordan.

Clinton then turned to Richard S. Arnold, a former Arkansas state representative and chief of staff to Arkansas Governor Dale Bumpers. President Jimmy Carter had nominated Arnold to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and the Senate confirmed him on February 20, 1980. He served till 1990. After that, he was serving as chief judge and a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States. Clinton had almost nominated Arnold before; he was the runner-up to Ginsburg. Arnold told Clinton the day before the planned announcement of his nomination that due to serious &quot;health concerns&quot;, he had to &quot;defer this honorable nomination&quot;.

Initially, Clinton had felt Breyer lacked &quot;soul and passion&quot;. But after heavy lobbying by Senators Ted Kennedy and Tom Harkin, Clinton met with Breyer again and proceeded to nominate him as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on May 17, 1994. Breyer was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1994, by an 87 to 9 vote, and received his commission on August 3.

In 2015, Breyer broke a federal law that bans judges from hearing cases when they or their spouses or minor children have a financial interest in a company involved. His wife sold about $33,000 worth of stock in Johnson Controls a day after Breyer participated in the oral argument. This brought him back into compliance and he joined the majority in ruling in favor of the interests of a Johnson Controls subsidiary which was party to &quot;FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass&#x27;n&quot;.

Breyer wrote 551 opinions during his 28-year career, not counting those relating to orders or in the &quot;shadow docket&quot;.

===Abortion===
In 2000, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, which struck down a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion. On June 29, 2020, he wrote the plurality opinion in &quot;June Medical Services v. Russo&quot;. The ruling struck down Louisiana&#x27;s abortion law requiring any doctor who performed abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Breyer reaffirmed the &quot;benefits and burdens&quot; test he had created in &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;, which struck down a nearly identical abortion law in Texas. In 2022, he dissented in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

===Census===
In &quot;Department of Commerce v. New York&quot; (2019), Breyer was in the 5–4 majority that ruled that the Census Bureau had not followed proper procedure in its implementation of a citizenship question. He was also one of four justices who would have held the citizenship question unconstitutional in itself. In a mostly concurring opinion, he wrote: &quot;Yet the decision was ill considered in a number of critically important respects. The Secretary did not give adequate consideration to issues that should have been central to his judgment, such as the high likelihood of an undercount, the low likelihood that a question would yield more accurate citizenship data, and the apparent lack of any need for more accurate citizenship data to begin with. The Secretary&#x27;s failures in considering those critical issues make his decision unreasonable&quot;.

On December 18, 2020, Breyer was one of three dissenters in &quot;Trump v. New York&quot;. In a 20-page dissent, he argued that the Court should not have sidestepped the case and should have ruled in favor of the challengers, who wanted the Court to block the Trump administration&#x27;s last-minute attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census. The census ultimately did not exclude undocumented immigrants, due to a lack of time and the subsequent issuance of Executive Order 13986.

===Copyright===
In &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, decided on January 15, 2003, Breyer and Justice John Paul Stevens filed separate dissenting opinions. In his 28-page dissent, Breyer argued that the 20-year retroactive extension of existing copyright granted by the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) amounted effectively to a grant of perpetual copyright that violated the Copyright Clause of the Constitution, read in light of the First Amendment. He argued that the extension would produce a period of protection worth more than 99.8% of protection in perpetuity and that few artists would be more inclined to produce work knowing that their great-grandchildren would receive royalties. He also wrote that the fair use defense came to no avail either, as it could not help &quot;those who wish to obtain from electronic databases material that is not there&quot;, e.g. teachers who can find from online no ideal material to be used in the class as it has been deleted. In 2012, he expressed a similar idea in his dissent in &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot;, which affirmed the constitutionality of the application of Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994.

In 2005, while joining a unanimous Court in &quot;MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.&quot; against peer-to-peer file sharing companies Grokster and Streamcast on the ground of inducement liability, Breyer wrote a concurrence that the companies would be protected under the &quot;Sony&quot; doctrine without evidence of inducement.

On March 20, 2012, Breyer wrote for a unanimous court in &quot;Mayo v. Prometheus&quot; that patent claims relating to new diagnostic methods of natural phenomena were not patentable as they did not add an &quot;inventive concept to application of the natural laws&quot;. The patent, which was related to a patient&#x27;s metabolization of a drug resulting from a determination of effective dosage, was analyzed to determine whether it was of an applied &quot;law of nature&quot; or merely an instruction on applying a natural law. In Breyer&#x27;s analysis, a doctor&#x27;s administration of an already known drug related only to an identification of an &quot;intended audience&quot; to carry out the practice rather than a transformation of the subject. Breyer added, &quot;If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself.&quot;

In &quot;American Broadcasting Cos., Inc. v. Aereo, Inc.&quot;, decided on June 25, 2014, Breyer delivered the majority opinion, ruling that Aereo, allowing subscribers to view near-live streams of over-the-air television on Internet-connected devices, operated so overwhelmingly similar to the cable companies that it violated the right of public performance of the networks&#x27; copyrighted work.

In &quot;Google v. Oracle&quot;, decided on April 5, 2021, Breyer wrote the 38-page majority opinion, holding that Google&#x27;s copying of 11,500 lines of Java declaring code (0.4% of all Java code) constituted fair use because &quot;three of these packages were ... fundamental to being able to use the Java language at all&quot;. Breyer explained, &quot;By using the same declaring code for those packages, programmers using the Android platform can rely on the method calls that they are already familiar with to call up particular tasks (e.g., determining which of two integers is the greater); but Google&#x27;s own implementing programs carry out those tasks. Without that copying, programmers would need to learn an entirely new system to call up the same tasks.&quot;

===Death penalty===
In 2015, Breyer dissented in &quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot;, which held by a 5–4 vote that prisoners challenging their executions must provide a &quot;known and available&quot; execution method before challenging their method of execution. In a dissent joined by Ginsburg, Breyer questioned the constitutionality of the death penalty itself. He wrote, &quot;For the reasons I have set forth in this opinion, I believe it highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment. At the very least, the Court should call for full briefing on the basic question.&quot; In July 2020, Breyer reiterated this position, writing, &quot;As I have previously written, the solution may be for this Court to directly examine the question whether the death penalty violates the Constitution.&quot;

===Free speech===
On June 18, 2015, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans&quot;. He wrote that license plates are considered governmental speech and are more subject to regulation than private speech. In doing so, he noted that States have historically used license plates to convey governmental messages and that speech appearing on &quot;what is essentially a government-issued ID&quot; could reasonably assumed to be associated with the State. Breyer also commented on the differences between the government and private citizens, saying that government speech &quot;is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it says. […] Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, government would not work&quot;.

On June 23, 2021, Breyer authored the majority opinion in &quot;Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.&quot;, relating to the role of school regulation of off-campus student speech. In his opinion he noted the importance of potential regulation of such speech by school authorities but acknowledged that such regulation was diminished due to the potential implication of a 24-hour restriction on student speech if fully realized, its traditional role under parental supervision, and the interest of schools in safeguarding the marketplace of ideas. Despite this, Breyer stipulated that the utterance of profanity on social media did not constitute &quot;substantial disruptance&quot; of a school activity or threaten harm to others, writing, &quot;the justifications offered for punishing Levy&#x27;s speech were simply insufficient […] were she an adult, the First Amendment would provide strong protection&quot;.

===Defendant protections===
On June 21, 2011, Breyer wrote for the majority in &quot;Turner v. Rogers&quot; on the requirement of counsel or some other safeguard in civil contempt cases. In his opinion, he acknowledged that a right to counsel does not exist in all matters relating to incarceration, as in civil contempt cases the defendant&#x27;s opponent is also often unrepresented, the arguments typically center on straightforward questions, and substitute safeguards are available. These safeguards, such as soliciting financial information or informing the defendant of the legal significance of payment, were required to have been provided by the state on pain of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.

On June 22, 2015, Breyer wrote for the majority in &quot;Kingsley v. Hendrickson&quot; that a pretrial detainee must prove that excessive police force was excessive only by an objective standard, not a subjective standard. In his opinion, he wrote that the Due Process Clause protects pretrial detainees from &quot;objectively unreasonable&quot; force by a state actor. He concluded, &quot;in the absence of an expressed intent to punish, a pretrial detainee can nevertheless prevail by showing that the actions are not &#x27;rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive governmental purpose&#x27; or that the actions &#x27;appear excessive in relation to that purpose.&#x27;&quot;

On February 21, 2018, Breyer wrote for the majority in &quot;Class v. United States&quot; on whether some who has already pleaded guilty may challenge a federal law&#x27;s constitutionality. In his opinion, he distinguished &quot;Class&quot; from past cases where appeal was denied, such as &quot;United States v. Broce&quot; and &quot;Menna v. New York&quot;, as Class&#x27;s admission of guilt resulted in his ability to appeal the questioned indictments that his record would otherwise have contradicted. He concluded, &quot;the claims at issue here do not fall within any of the categories of claims that Class&#x27;s plea agreement forbids him to raise on direct appeal. They challenge the Government&#x27;s power to criminalize Class&#x27;s (admitted) conduct. They thereby call into question the Government&#x27;s power to &#x27;constitutionally prosecute&#x27; him. A guilty plea does not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.”

===Native American law===
On November 27, 2001, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Chickasaw Nation v. United States&quot;, relating to whether tribes are liable for taxes on gambling operations. In his opinion, he stipulated that IRC chapter 35, which affords state governmental lotteries an exemption from federal excise taxes, does not provide the same tax exemption to tribal pull-tab operations that act as lotteries under the IRC. Breyer wrote that a straightforward reading of the code, which stipulated that the &quot;reporting and withholding of taxes&quot; on gambling operations applied equally to both the states and tribes, was &quot;included inadvertently. The presence of a bad example in a statute does not warrant rewriting the remainder of the statute&#x27;s language. Nor does it necessarily mean that the statute is ambiguous.&quot; Chapter 35, according to Breyer, &quot;simply imposes taxes […] from which it exempts certain state-controlled gambling activities&quot;.
On April 19, 2004, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;United States v. Lara&quot;, holding that both tribal governments and the federal government may prosecute non-member Native Americans for the same charges without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause, as Native Nations are separate sovereigns. He reiterated this question in the context of the tribe&#x27;s sovereignty as &quot;Whether Congress has the constitutional power to relax restrictions that the political branches have, over time, placed on the exercise of a tribe&#x27;s inherent legal authority&quot;. Breyer concluded that the Indian Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to legislate with respect to tribes and that Congress&#x27;s amendments to the Indian Civil Rights Act constitute a deference to tribal sovereignty ensuring double jeopardy does not apply.

===Environment===
In &quot;Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.&quot; (2000), Breyer was in the 7–2 majority that held that people who use the North Tyger River for recreational purposes but could not do so due to pollution had standing to sue industrial polluters.

On April 23, 2020, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund&quot;. The Court ruled that the County of Maui must have a permit under the Clean Water Act in order to release groundwater pollution into the ocean. Although the ruling was less broad than the 9th Circuit&#x27;s ruling, environmentalist groups saw the ruling as a win and an affirmation of the Clean Water Act.

On July 31, 2020, Breyer dissented when the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, refused to lift a stay on the 9th Circuit ruling that halted construction of the wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Sierra Club argued that the wall would harm the environment unduly, including threatening wildlife and changing the flow of water in the Sonoran Desert. Breyer wrote, &quot;The Court&#x27;s decision to let construction continue nevertheless, I fear, may &#x27;operat[e], in effect, as a final judgment.&#x27;&quot; Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined his dissent.

On March 4, 2021, Breyer dissented in &quot;United States Fish and Wildlife Serv. v. Sierra Club, Inc.&quot;, joined only by Sotomayor. The case concerned the Sierra Club&#x27;s request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for &quot;draft opinions&quot; concerning rules governing underwater structures that are used to cool industrial equipment. The Sierra Club argued that it had the right to access the documents. The majority opinion limits environmental groups&#x27; ability to obtain government documents under FOIA. Breyer wrote in his dissent, &quot;Agency practice shows that the Draft Biological Opinion, not the Final Biological Opinion, is the document that informs the EPA of the Services&#x27; conclusions about jeopardy and alternatives and triggers within the EPA the process of deciding what to do about those conclusions. If a Final Biological Opinion is discoverable under FOIA, as all seem to agree it is, why would a Draft Biological Opinion, embodying the same Service conclusions (and leaving the EPA with the same four choices), not be?&quot;

In &quot;Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association&quot;, Breyer ruled for oil refineries, joining the majority opinion, which held that oil refineries struggling financially did not need a continuous exemption every year since 2011 in order to be granted an exemption from federal renewable fuels policy.

===Health care===
Breyer generally voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010. He wrote the 7-2 majority opinion in &quot;California v. Texas&quot;, a decision on June 17, 2021, holding that Texas and other states lacked standing to sue against the Affordable Care Act&#x27;s individual mandate. Breyer wrote, &quot;It is consequently not surprising that the plaintiffs cannot point to cases that support them. To the contrary, our cases have consistently spoken of the need to assert an injury that is the result of a statute&#x27;s actual or threatened enforcement, whether today or in the future.&quot;

===Partisan gerrymandering===
On April 28, 2004, Breyer dissented in &quot;Vieth v. Jubelirer&quot;, in which the Court held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Breyer wrote in his dissent, &quot;Sometimes purely political &#x27;gerrymandering&#x27; will fail to advance any plausible democratic objective while simultaneously threatening serious democratic harm. And sometimes when that is so, courts can identify an equal protection violation and provide a remedy.&quot; In 2006, Breyer was in a 5–4 majority holding that District 23 of the 2003 Texas redistricting violated the Voting Rights Act due to vote dilution. Along with Justice John Paul Stevens, Breyer would also have ruled in favor of plaintiffs&#x27; claims that Texas&#x27;s statewide plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. In June 2019, Breyer dissented in &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;, in which the Supreme Court decided 5–4 that gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim.

===Voting rights===
Breyer wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama&quot;, which ruled that racial gerrymandering claims must be looked at district by district, and struck down four of Alabama&#x27;s state Senate districts as unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.

Breyer joined Ginsburg&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;. A 5–4 majority ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Breyer joined another dissent by Ginsburg in &quot;RNC v. DNC&quot;, which overturned a lower court&#x27;s extension of a voting deadline in the Wisconsin primary elections. The lower court had extended the deadline so that people who had not yet received mail-in ballots by April 7 could vote by mail in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Breyer dissented in a similar Wisconsin case in October; the petitioners had asked the court to require Wisconsin to count mail-in ballots received up to six days after Election Day, and the Court, with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissenting, refused the petitioners&#x27; request to extend the deadline. Breyer joined Kagan&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Brnovich v. DNC&quot; (2021), a case that upheld Arizona&#x27;s ban on ballot harvesting and refusal to count out-of-precinct ballots. As the most senior dissenter, Breyer likely assigned the dissenting opinion to Kagan.

== Retirement and post-retirement ==

After Democratic victories in the 2020 presidential and Senate elections, progressive activists and Democratic members of Congress called on Breyer to retire so that President Biden could nominate a younger liberal justice. In an August 2021 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Breyer said he wished to retire before his death, and recounted a conversation he had with Justice Antonin Scalia in which Scalia mentioned that he did not want his successor to &quot;reverse everything I&#x27;ve done for the last 25 years&quot;. Breyer said that Scalia&#x27;s point will &quot;inevitably be in the psychology&quot; of his decision to retire. In a September 2021 interview with &quot;Fox News&quot;&#x27;s Chris Wallace, Breyer said activists calling for his retirement are &quot;entitled to their opinion&quot; and &quot;I didn&#x27;t retire because I had decided on balance I wouldn&#x27;t retire&quot;. He said he took several factors into account when deciding his retirement plans, and reiterated that he did not plan to &quot;die on the court&quot;.

On January 26, 2022, news outlets reported Breyer&#x27;s intention to retire from the court at the end of the 2021–22 term. Breyer confirmed his pending retirement in a White House announcement alongside Biden on January 27. On February 25, Biden announced his nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former clerk of Breyer and judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to succeed Breyer on the Supreme Court. The U.S. Senate confirmed Jackson by a vote of 53–47 on April 7, 2022. The last opinion Breyer wrote before his retirement was the majority opinion in &quot;Torres v. Texas Department of Public Safety&quot;. He retired on June 30, 2022, at 12:00 noon EDT, following the court&#x27;s final opinions and orders for the term. Breyer&#x27;s retirement left only one military veteran, Samuel Alito, on the Supreme Court.

On July 2, 2022, it was announced that Breyer had been appointed Byrne Professor of Administrative Law and Process at Harvard Law School, with immediate effect. Breyer had previously both attended and taught at Harvard Law School.

As a retired Supreme Court justice, Breyer can still sit as a judge in lower federal courts by designation. He first returned to the bench in 2025 in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, the court on which he was a judge before his Supreme Court appointment.

Breyer attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump, appearing after the nine sitting Supreme Court justices.

==Judicial philosophy==
===In general===
Breyer&#x27;s pragmatic approach to the law &quot;will tend to make the law more sensible&quot;, according to Cass Sunstein, who added that Breyer&#x27;s &quot;attack on originalism is powerful and convincing&quot;.

Breyer consistently voted in favor of abortion rights, one of the most controversial areas of the Supreme Court&#x27;s docket. He also defended the Court&#x27;s use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions. Breyer is also recognized as deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Court&#x27;s First Amendment rulings. He demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994.

Breyer&#x27;s extensive experience in administrative law is accompanied by his staunch defense of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. He rejects the strict interpretation of the Sixth Amendment espoused by Justice Scalia that all facts necessary to criminal punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In many other areas on the Court, too, Breyer&#x27;s pragmatism was considered the intellectual counterweight to Scalia&#x27;s textualist philosophy.

In describing his interpretive philosophy, Breyer has sometimes noted his use of six interpretive tools: text, history, tradition, precedent, the purpose of a statute, and the consequences of competing interpretations. He has noted that only the last two differentiate him from textualists such as Scalia. Breyer argues that these sources are necessary, however, and in the former case (purpose), can in fact provide greater objectivity in legal interpretation than looking merely at what is often ambiguous statutory text. With the latter (consequences), Breyer argues that considering the impact of legal interpretations is a further way of ensuring consistency with a law&#x27;s intended purpose.

===&quot;Active Liberty&quot;===
Breyer expounded his judicial philosophy in 2005 in &quot;Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution&quot;. In it, Breyer urges judges to interpret legal provisions (of the Constitution or of statutes) in light of the purpose of the text and how well the consequences of specific rulings fit those purposes. The book is considered a response to the 1997 book &quot;A Matter of Interpretation&quot;, in which Antonin Scalia emphasized adherence to the original meaning of the text alone.

In &quot;Active Liberty&quot;, Breyer argues that the Framers of the Constitution sought to establish a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens. Breyer refers to Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;. The first Berlinian concept, being what most people understand by liberty, is &quot;freedom from government coercion&quot;. Berlin termed this &quot;negative liberty&quot; and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this &quot;modern liberty&quot;. The second Berlinian concept—&quot;positive liberty&quot;—is the &quot;freedom to participate in the government&quot;. In Breyer&#x27;s terminology, this is the &quot;active liberty&quot; the judge should champion. Having established what &quot;active liberty&quot; is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of &quot;negative liberty&quot;, Breyer makes a predominantly utilitarian case for rulings that give effect to the democratic intentions of the Constitution.

The book&#x27;s historical premises and practical prescriptions have been challenged. For example, according to Peter Berkowitz, the reason that &quot;[t]he primarily democratic nature of the Constitution&#x27;s governmental structure has not always seemed obvious&quot;, as Breyer puts it, is &quot;because it&#x27;s not true, at least in Breyer&#x27;s sense, that the Constitution elevates active liberty above modern [negative] liberty&quot;. Breyer&#x27;s position &quot;demonstrates not fidelity to the Constitution&quot;, Berkowitz argues, &quot;but rather a determination to rewrite the Constitution&#x27;s priorities&quot;. Berkowitz suggests that Breyer is also inconsistent in failing to apply this standard to the issue of abortion, instead preferring decisions &quot;that protect women&#x27;s modern liberty, which remove controversial issues from democratic discourse&quot;. Failing to answer the textualist charge that the Living Documentarian judge is a law unto himself, Berkowitz argues that &quot;Active Liberty&quot; &quot;suggests that when necessary, instead of choosing the consequence that serves what he regards as the Constitution&#x27;s leading purpose, Breyer will determine the Constitution&#x27;s leading purpose on the basis of the consequence that he prefers to vindicate&quot;.

Against the last charge, Cass Sunstein has defended Breyer, noting that of the nine justices on the Rehnquist Court, Breyer had the highest percentage of votes to uphold acts of Congress and also to defer to the decision of the executive branch. However, according to Jeffrey Toobin in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Breyer concedes that a judicial approach based on &#x27;active liberty&#x27; will not yield solutions to every constitutional debate&quot;, and that, in Breyer&#x27;s words, &quot;respecting the democratic process does not mean you abdicate your role of enforcing the limits in the Constitution, whether in the Bill of Rights or in separation of powers.&quot;

To this point, and from a discussion at the New York Historical Society in March 2006, Breyer has noted that &quot;democratic means&quot; did not bring about an end to slavery, or the concept of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, and it is the concept of universal suffrage that allowed corrupt and discriminatory (but democratically inspired) state laws to be overturned in favor of civil rights.

===Other books===
In 2010, Breyer published a second book, &quot;Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge&#x27;s View&quot;. In it, he argues that judges have six tools they can use to determine a legal provision&#x27;s proper meaning: (1) its text; (2) its historical context; (3) precedent; (4) tradition; (5) its purpose; and (6) the consequences of potential interpretations. Textualists, like Scalia, only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;consequences&quot; are &quot;particularly&quot; important interpretative tools.

Breyer cites several watershed moments in Supreme Court history to show why the consequences of a particular ruling should always be in a judge&#x27;s mind. He notes that President Jackson ignored the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;, which led to the Trail of Tears and severely weakened the Court&#x27;s authority. He also cites the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision, an important precursor to the American Civil War. When the Court ignores the consequences of its decisions, Breyer argues, it can lead to devastating and destabilizing outcomes.

In 2015, Breyer released a third book, &quot;The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities&quot;, examining the interplay between U.S. and international law and how the realities of a globalized world need to be considered in U.S. cases.

On March 26, 2024, Breyer released a fourth book, &quot;Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, Not Textualism&quot;. In an interview about the book, he said that textualism, a judicial philosophy conservative justices favor, &quot;will not help achieve the goals of those who write statutes or those who wrote and adopted the Constitution&quot; and is doomed to fail.

===Other views===
In an interview on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; on December 12, 2010, Breyer said that based on the values and the historical record, the Founding Fathers of the United States never intended guns to go unregulated and that history supports his and the other dissenters&#x27; views in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;. He summarized:

In the wake of the controversy over Justice Samuel Alito&#x27;s reaction to President Barack Obama&#x27;s criticism of the Court&#x27;s &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; ruling in his 2010 State of the Union Address, Breyer said he would continue to attend the address:

===Honors===
Breyer was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2004. In 2007, Breyer was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America. In 2018, he was named to chair of the Pritzker Architecture Prize jury, succeeding previous chair Glenn Murcutt.

==In popular culture==
Breyer has appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert&#x27;s TV show. On the &quot;Late Show&quot; in September 2021, he discussed the Texas Heartbeat Act and his reluctance to retire.

Breyer appeared on &quot;Fareed Zakaria GPS&quot; on CNN in September 2021 where he was questioned on when he planned to retire. He promoted his book &quot;The Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics&quot;.

<text>A common year starting on Sunday is any non-leap year (i.e. a year with 365 days) that begins on Sunday, 1 January, and ends on Sunday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is A. The most recent year of such kind was 2023, and the next one will be 2034 in the Gregorian calendar, or, likewise, 2018 and 2029 in the obsolete Julian calendar, see below for more.

Any common year that starts on a Sunday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this common year occur in January and October.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==

=== Gregorian Calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, alongside Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-three common years per cycle or exactly 10.75% start on a Sunday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.

=== Julian Calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). A leap year has two adjoining dominical letters (one for January and February and the other for March to December, as 29 February has no letter). This sequence occurs exactly once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 11, 22 and 28 of the cycle are common years beginning on Sunday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Sunday.

<doc id="168855" wikidata="Q235680" url="?curid=168855" title="Common year starting on Friday">
<text>A common year starting on Friday is any non-leap year (i.e. a year with 365 days) that begins on Friday, 1 January, and ends on Friday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is C. The most recent year of such kind was 2021, and the next one will be 2027 in the Gregorian calendar, or, likewise, 2022 and 2033 in the obsolete Julian calendar; see below for more. This common year is one of the three possible common years in which a century year can end on, and occurs in century years that yield a remainder of 100 when divided by 400. The most recent such year was 1700, and the next one will be 2100.

Any common year that starts on Friday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this common year occurs in August. Leap years starting on Thursday share this characteristic, but also have another one in February.

From July of the year that precedes this type of year until September in this type of year is the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Friday the 17th. Leap years starting on Tuesday share this characteristic, from August of the common year that precedes it to October in that type of year, (e.g. 2007-08 and 2035-36). This type of year also has the longest period (also 14 months) without a Tuesday the 13th, from July of this year until September of the next common year (that being on Saturday, e.g. 2021-22), unless the next year is a leap year (which is also a Saturday), then the period is reduced to only 11 months (e.g. 1999-2000 and 2027-28).

This is the one of two types of years overall where a rectangular February is possible, in places where Monday is considered to be the first day of the week. Common years starting on Thursday share this characteristic, but only in places where Sunday is considered to be the first day of the week.

Additionally, this type of year has three months (February, March and November) beginning exactly on the first day of the week, in areas which Monday is considered the first day of the week. Leap years starting on Monday share this characteristic on the months of January, April and July.

== Calendars ==

This is the only year type where the &quot;n&quot;th &quot;Doomsday&quot; (this year Sunday) is not in ISO week &quot;n&quot;; it is in ISO week &quot;n&quot;-1.

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, alongside Sunday, Monday, Wednesday or Saturday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-three common years per cycle or exactly 10.75% start on a Friday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.

For this kind of year, the ISO week 10 (which begins March 8) and all subsequent ISO weeks occur later than in all other years, and exactly one week later than Leap years starting on Thursday. Also, the ISO weeks in January and February occur later than all other common years, but leap years starting on Friday share this characteristic in January and February, until ISO week 8.


=== Julian calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). This sequence occurs exactly once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 4, 15 and 26 of the cycle are common years beginning on Friday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Friday.

<text>The skull, or cranium, is typically a bony enclosure around the brain of a vertebrate. In some fish, and amphibians, the skull is of cartilage. The skull is at the head end of the vertebrate. 

In the human the skull comprises two prominent parts: the neurocranium, and the facial skeleton. which evolved from the first pharyngeal arch. The skull forms the frontmost portion of the axial skeleton and is a product of cephalization and vesicular enlargement of the brain, with several special senses structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and in fish specialized tactile organs such as barbels near the mouth.

The skull is composed of three types of bone: cranial bones, facial bones and ossicles, which is made up of a number of fused flat and irregular bones. The cranial bones are joined at firm fibrous junctions called sutures and contains many foramina, fossae, processes, and sinuses. In zoology, the openings in the skull are called fenestrae, the most prominent of which is the foramen magnum, where the brainstem goes through to join the spinal cord.

In human anatomy, the neurocranium (or braincase), is further divided into the calvarium and the endocranium, together forming a cranial cavity that houses the brain. The interior periosteum forms part of the dura mater, the facial skeleton and splanchnocranium with the mandible being its largest bone. The mandible articulates with the temporal bones of the neurocranium at the paired temporomandibular joints. The skull itself articulates with the spinal column at the atlanto-occipital joint.

Functions of the skull include physical protection for the brain, providing attachments for neck muscles, facial muscles and muscles of mastication, providing fixed eye sockets and outer ears (ear canals and auricles) to enable stereoscopic vision and sound localisation, forming nasal and oral cavities that allow better olfaction, taste and digestion, and contributing to phonation by acoustic resonance within the cavities and sinuses. In some animals such as ungulates and elephants, the skull also has a function in anti-predator defense and sexual selection by providing the foundation for horns, antlers and tusks.

The English word &quot;skull&quot; is probably derived from Old Norse , while the Latin word comes from the Greek root (). The human skull fully develops two years after birth.

==Structure==
=== Humans ===


The human skull is the bone structure that forms the head in the human skeleton. It supports the structures of the face and forms a cavity for the brain. Like the skulls of other vertebrates, it protects the brain from injury.

The skull consists of three parts, of different embryological origin—the neurocranium, the sutures, and the facial skeleton. The neurocranium (or &quot;braincase&quot;) forms the protective cranial cavity that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem. The upper areas of the cranial bones form the calvaria (skullcap). The facial skeleton (membranous viscerocranium) is formed by the bones supporting the face, and includes the mandible. 

The bones of the skull are joined by fibrous joints known as sutures—synarthrodial (immovable) joints formed by bony ossification, with Sharpey&#x27;s fibres permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as Wormian bones or &quot;sutural bones&quot;. Most commonly these are found in the course of the lambdoid suture.

====Bones ====
The human skull is generally considered to consist of 22 bones—eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the occipital bone, two temporal bones, two parietal bones, the sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal bones.

The bones of the facial skeleton (14) are the vomer, two inferior nasal conchae, two nasal bones, two maxilla, the mandible, two palatine bones, two zygomatic bones, and two lacrimal bones. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the hyoid bone or the three ossicles of the middle ear, the malleus, incus, and stapes, but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.

Some of these bones—the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are flat bones.

====Cavities and foramina====
The skull also contains sinuses, air-filled cavities known as paranasal sinuses, and numerous foramina. The sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn into the nasal cavity.

The foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the foramen magnum, of the occipital bone, that allows the passage of the spinal cord as well as nerves and blood vessels.

====Processes====
The many processes of the skull include the mastoid process and the zygomatic processes.

=== Other vertebrates ===
==== Fenestrae====

==== Bones ====
The jugal is a skull bone that found in most of the reptiles, amphibians and birds. In mammals, the jugal is often called the zygomatic bone or malar bone.

The prefrontal bone is a bone that separates the lacrimal and frontal bones in many tetrapod skulls.

====Fish====
The skull of fish is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. Lampreys and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper jaw and the lower jaws being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional dermal bone, forming a more or less coherent skull roof in lungfish and holost fish. The lower jaw defines the chin.

The simpler structure is found in jawless fish, in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.

Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large fontanelle. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the rostrum, and capsules to enclose the olfactory organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the inner ear. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single condyle, articulating with the first vertebra. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller foramina for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.

In ray-finned fish, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the premaxilla, with the maxilla itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.

Although the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes. The skull roof is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the pterygoids and vomers alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from cartilage, and its overall structure is reduced.

===Tetrapods===
The skulls of the earliest tetrapods closely resembled those of their ancestors amongst the lobe-finned fishes. The skull roof is formed of a series of plate-like bones, including the maxilla, frontals, parietals, and lacrimals, among others. It is overlaying the endocranium, corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in sharks and rays. The various separate bones that compose the temporal bone of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the vomer and palatine bones. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the foramen magnum and a median bone lying further forward; these are homologous with the occipital bone and parts of the sphenoid in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian mandible.

In living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements.

====Birds====
Birds have a diapsid skull, as in reptiles, with a prelacrimal fossa (present in some reptiles). The skull has a single occipital condyle. The skull consists of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak). The skull of a normal bird usually weighs about 1% of the bird&#x27;s total bodyweight. The eye occupies a considerable amount of the skull and is surrounded by a sclerotic eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.

====Amphibians====
Living amphibians typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage. In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain. The fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds, in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify.

==Development==

The skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The skull roof bones, comprising the bones of the facial skeleton and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are dermal bones formed by intramembranous ossification, though the temporal bones are formed by endochondral ossification. The endocranium, the bones supporting the brain (the occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous. The geometry of the skull base and its fossae, the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae changes rapidly. The anterior cranial fossa changes especially during the first trimester of pregnancy and skull defects can often develop during this time.

At birth, the human skull is made up of 44 separate bony elements. During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the frontal bone). The bones of the roof of the skull are initially separated by regions of dense connective tissue called fontanelles. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth, these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the &quot;obstetrical hinge&quot;, which is where the squamous and lateral parts of the occipital bone meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the great cerebral vein. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating sutures. The five sutures are the two squamous sutures, one coronal, one lambdoid, and one sagittal suture. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a &quot;soft spot&quot; on a baby&#x27;s forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby&#x27;s heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.

The skull in the neonate is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the calvaria. (In the adult it is half the size). The base of the skull is short and narrow, though the inner ear is almost adult size.

==Clinical significance==
Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses, and changes the growth pattern of the skull. Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it grows more in the parallel direction. Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features. In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development.

A copper beaten skull is a phenomenon wherein intense intracranial pressure disfigures the internal surface of the skull. The name comes from the fact that the inner skull has the appearance of having been beaten with a ball-peen hammer, such as is often used by coppersmiths. The condition is most common in children.

===Injuries and treatment===
Injuries to the brain can be life-threatening. Normally the skull protects the brain from damage through its high resistance to deformation; the skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature, needing the force of about 1 ton to reduce its diameter by 1 cm. In some cases of head injury, however, there can be raised intracranial pressure through mechanisms such as a subdural haematoma. In these cases, the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the foramen magnum (&quot;coning&quot;) because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant brain damage or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with concussion must be watched extremely carefully. Repeated concussions can activate the structure of skull bones as the brain&#x27;s protective covering.

Dating back to Neolithic times, a skull operation called trepanning was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a &quot;burr&quot; hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a craniectomy.

In March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient&#x27;s skull with a precision, 3D-printed polymer implant. About 9 months later, the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman. She had been suffering from hyperostosis, which increased the thickness of her skull and compressed her brain.

A study conducted in 2018 by the researchers of Harvard Medical School in Boston, funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH), suggested that instead of travelling via blood, there are &quot;tiny channels&quot; in the skull through which the immune cells combined with the bone marrow reach the areas of inflammation after an injury to the brain tissues.

===Transgender procedures===
Surgical alteration of sexually dimorphic skull features may be carried out as a part of facial feminization surgery or facial masculinization surgery, these reconstructive surgical procedures that can alter sexually dimorphic facial features to bring them closer in shape and size to facial features of the desired sex. These procedures can be an important part of the treatment of transgender people for gender dysphoria.

==Society and culture==
Artificial cranial deformation is a largely historical practice of some cultures. Cords and wooden boards would be used to apply pressure to an infant&#x27;s skull and alter its shape, sometimes quite significantly. This procedure would begin just after birth and would be carried on for several years.

===Osteology===
Like the face, the skull and teeth can also indicate a person&#x27;s life history and origin. Forensic scientists and archaeologists use quantitative and qualitative traits to estimate what the bearer of the skull looked like. When a significant amount of bones are found, such as at Spitalfields in the UK and Jōmon shell mounds in Japan, osteologists can use traits, such as the proportions of length, height and width, to know the relationships of the population of the study with other living or extinct populations.

The German physician Franz Joseph Gall in around 1800 formulated the theory of phrenology, which attempted to show that specific features of the skull are associated with certain personality traits or intellectual capabilities of its owner. His theory is now considered to be pseudoscientific.

===Sexual dimorphism===
In the mid-nineteenth century, anthropologists found it crucial to distinguish between male and female skulls. An anthropologist of the time, James McGrigor Allan, argued that the female brain was similar to that of an animal. This allowed anthropologists to declare that women were in fact more emotional and less rational than men. McGrigor then concluded that women&#x27;s brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time. To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as craniology. These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between women and black people.

Research has shown that while in early life there is little difference between male and female skulls, in adulthood male skulls tend to be larger and more robust than female skulls, which are lighter and smaller, with a cranial capacity about 10 percent less than that of the male. However, later studies show that women&#x27;s skulls are slightly thicker and thus men may be more susceptible to head injury than women. However, other studies shows that men&#x27;s skulls are slightly thicker in certain areas. Some studies show that females are more susceptible to concussion than males. Men&#x27;s skulls have also been shown to maintain density with age, which may aid in preventing head injury, while women&#x27;s skull density slightly decreases with age.

Male skulls can all have more prominent supraorbital ridges, glabella, and temporal lines. Female skulls generally have rounder orbits and narrower jaws. Male skulls on average have larger, broader palates, squarer orbits, larger mastoid processes, larger sinuses, and larger occipital condyles than those of females. Male mandibles typically have squarer chins and thicker, rougher muscle attachments than female mandibles.

===Craniometry===
The cephalic index is the ratio of the width of the head, multiplied by 100 and divided by its length (front to back). The index is also used to categorize animals, especially dogs and cats. The width is usually measured just below the parietal eminence, and the length from the glabella to the occipital point.

Humans may be:
* &quot;Dolichocephalic&quot; — long-headed
* &quot;Mesaticephalic&quot; — medium-headed
* &quot;Brachycephalic&quot; — short-headed
The &quot;vertical&quot; cephalic index refers to the ratio between the height of the head multiplied by 100 and divided by the length of the head.

Humans may be:
* &quot;Chamaecranic&quot; — low-skulled
* &quot;Orthocranic&quot; — medium high-skulled
* &quot;Hypsicranic&quot; — high-skulled

== Terminology ==
* Chondrocranium, a primitive cartilaginous skeletal structure
* Endocranium
* Epicranium
* Pericranium, a membrane that lines the outer surface of the cranium

==History==
Trepanning, a practice in which a hole is created in the skull, has been described as the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence, found in the forms of cave paintings and human remains. At one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 out of 120 prehistoric skulls found had trepanation holes.

<doc id="168864" wikidata="Q2488476" url="?curid=168864" title="Well-ordering principle">
<text>In mathematics, the well-ordering principle states that every non-empty subset of nonnegative integers contains a least element. In other words, the set of nonnegative integers is well-ordered by its &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;magnitude&quot; order in which formula_1 precedes formula_2 if and only if formula_2 is either formula_1 or the sum of formula_1 and some nonnegative integer (other orderings include the ordering formula_6; and formula_7).

The phrase &quot;well-ordering principle&quot; is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the &quot;well-ordering theorem&quot;. On other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of integers formula_8 contains a well-ordered subset, called the natural numbers, in which every nonempty subset contains a least element.

==Properties==
Depending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced, this (second-order) property of the set of natural numbers is either an axiom or a provable theorem. For example:
* In Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic and related systems, and indeed in most (not necessarily formal) mathematical treatments of the well-ordering principle, the principle is derived from the principle of mathematical induction, which is itself taken as basic. 
* Considering the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers, and assuming that we know already that the real numbers are complete (again, either as an axiom or a theorem about the real number system), i.e., every bounded (from below) set has an infimum, then also every set formula_9 of natural numbers has an infimum, say formula_10. We can now find an integer formula_11 such that formula_10 lies in the half-open interval formula_13, and can then show that we must have formula_14, and formula_11 in &quot;formula_9&quot;.
* In axiomatic set theory, the natural numbers are defined as the smallest inductive set (i.e., set containing 0 and closed under the successor operation). One can (even without invoking the regularity axiom) show that the set of all natural numbers formula_17 such that &quot;formula_18 is well-ordered&quot; is inductive, and must therefore contain all natural numbers; from this property one can conclude that the set of all natural numbers is also well-ordered.

In the second sense, this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form: to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set formula_19, assume the contrary, which implies that the set of counterexamples is non-empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample. Then show that for any counterexample there is a still smaller counterexample, producing a contradiction. This mode of argument is the contrapositive of proof by complete induction. It is known light-heartedly as the &quot;minimal criminal&quot; method and is similar in its nature to Fermat&#x27;s method of &quot;infinite descent&quot;.

Garrett Birkhoff and Saunders Mac Lane wrote in &quot;A Survey of Modern Algebra&quot; that this property, like the least upper bound axiom for real numbers, is non-algebraic; i.e., it cannot be deduced from the algebraic properties of the integers (which form an ordered integral domain).

==Example applications==
The well-ordering principle can be used in the following proofs.

===Prime factorization===
Theorem: &quot;Every integer greater than one can be factored as a product of primes.&quot; This theorem constitutes part of the Prime Factorization Theorem.

&quot;Proof&quot; (by well-ordering principle). Let formula_20 be the set of all integers greater than one that &quot;cannot&quot; be factored as a product of primes. We show that formula_20 is empty.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that formula_20 is not empty. Then, by the well-ordering principle, there is a least element formula_23; formula_17 cannot be prime since a prime number itself is considered a length-one product of primes. By the definition of non-prime numbers, formula_17 has factors formula_26, where formula_26 are integers greater than one and less than formula_17. Since formula_29, they are not in formula_20 as formula_17 is the smallest element of formula_20. So, formula_26 can be factored as products of primes, where formula_34 and formula_35, meaning that formula_36, a product of primes. This contradicts the assumption that formula_23, so the assumption that formula_20 is nonempty must be false.

===Integer summation===
Theorem: formula_39 for all positive integers formula_17.

&quot;Proof&quot;. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the above theorem is false. Then, there exists a non-empty set of positive integers formula_41. By the well-ordering principle, formula_20 has a minimum element formula_43 such that when formula_44, the equation is false, but true for all positive integers less than formula_43. The equation is true for formula_46, so formula_47; formula_48 is a positive integer less than formula_43, so the equation holds for formula_48 as it is not in formula_20. Therefore, 
formula_52
which shows that the equation holds for formula_43, a contradiction. So, the equation must hold for all positive integers.

<text>In mathematics and logic, a corollary ( , ) is a theorem of less importance which can be readily deduced from a previous, more notable statement. A corollary could, for instance, be a proposition which is incidentally proved while proving another proposition; it might also be used more casually to refer to something which naturally or incidentally accompanies something else.

==Overview==
In mathematics, a corollary is a theorem connected by a short proof to an existing theorem. The use of the term &quot;corollary&quot;, rather than &quot;proposition&quot; or &quot;theorem&quot;, is intrinsically subjective. More formally, proposition &quot;B&quot; is a corollary of proposition &quot;A&quot;, if &quot;B&quot; can be readily deduced from &quot;A&quot; or is self-evident from its proof. 

In many cases, a corollary corresponds to a special case of a larger theorem, which makes the theorem easier to use and apply, even though its importance is generally considered to be secondary to that of the theorem. In particular, &quot;B&quot; is unlikely to be termed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those of &quot;A&quot;. A corollary might have a proof that explains its derivation, even though such a derivation might be considered rather self-evident in some occasions (e.g., the Pythagorean theorem as a corollary of law of cosines).

==Peirce&#x27;s theory of deductive reasoning==
Charles Sanders Peirce held that the most important division of kinds of deductive reasoning is that between corollarial and theorematic. He argued that while all deduction ultimately depends in one way or another on mental experimentation on schemata or diagrams, in corollarial deduction:

&quot;It is only necessary to imagine any case in which the premises are true in order to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds in that case&quot;

while in theorematic deduction:

&quot;It is necessary to experiment in the imagination upon the image of the premise in order from the result of such experiment to make corollarial deductions to the truth of the conclusion.&quot;

Peirce also held that corollarial deduction matches Aristotle&#x27;s conception of direct demonstration, which Aristotle regarded as the only thoroughly satisfactory demonstration, while theorematic deduction is:

# The kind more prized by mathematicians
# Peculiar to mathematics 
# Involves in its course the introduction of a lemma or at least a definition uncontemplated in the thesis (the proposition that is to be proved), in remarkable cases that definition is of an abstraction that &quot;ought to be supported by a proper postulate.&quot;

<text>Lucio Edwin Gutiérrez Borbúa (born 23 March 1957) served as 43rd President of Ecuador from 15 January 2003 to 20 April 2005. In 2023, he was elected to the National Assembly.

==Early life==

Lucio Gutierrez, in full Lucio Edwin Gutiérrez Borbua, (born 23 March 1957, Quito, Ecuador), Ecuadoran army colonel and politician who served as president of Ecuador (2003–05).
Gutiérrez was raised in Tena, an Amazon basin town. He was the son of a traveling salesman and attended primary and secondary school in Tena before transferring at age 15 to a military college in Quito. Gutiérrez graduated from the Army Polytechnic School as a civil engineer after having won honor&#x27;s for academic and athletic prowess. He later studied in Brazil and the United States.

Gutiérrez rose steadily through the army ranks. In 1990–92 he served with the United Nations observer mission to Nicaragua. As a young man, he demonstrated little interest in politics, but during the 1990s he sympathized with fellow Ecuadorans as they became increasingly disenchanted with corruption and poverty. In 1997, as aide-de-camp to Pres. Abdalá Bucaram Ortiz, he refused an order to use force against a crowd outside the presidential palace. 
Bucaram fled the palace and was later removed from office by the National Congress. In 1999 Gutiérrez repeatedly questioned the government&#x27;s conduct and pointedly refused to shake Pres. Jamil Mahuad Witt&#x27;s hand during a public ceremony in December.

==Military career==

Gutierrez was born on 23 March 1957, in the city of Quito. Although holding degrees in civil engineering, administration and physical education, he chose a career with the Ecuadorian army, where he rose to the rank of colonel before his involvement in a coup against the government. 

In January 2000, thousands of Ecuadorians of Andean Indian descent massed in the capital of Quito to protest corruption in the government and economic policy. Ordered to break up demonstrations, Gutierrez instead helped feed the protesters, allowed them to occupy the country&#x27;s congress building, and joined Indian leader Antonio Vargas and a judge, Carlos Solorzano in &quot;announcing a government of national salvation.&quot;

The coup did not last long and the old government returned to power, but with a new president to replace the discredited predecessor. Gutierrez and other supporters of the coup were imprisoned for six months and expelled from the army.

As with many other military men who have entered politics in Latin American countries, Gutiérrez&#x27;s first experiences in a public forum date back to a period of political and social unrest. Indigenous and poor Ecuadorans staged massive protests when the Jamil Mahuad government decided to adopt the U.S. dollar as the national currency in 2000. Gutiérrez disobeyed the government&#x27;s order to repress the protestors and instead, together with fellow officers and their troops, joined the movement to depose president Mahuad. Days later, the Ecuadoran Congress deposed the president and the vice-president took the presidential chair

== Political rise ==
Gutiérrez entered the national spotlight during the 2000 Ecuadorian coup d&#x27;état that unseated President Jamil Mahuad for three hours and forced him to abandon office after demonstrations in Quito by thousands of Indigenous Ecuadorians protested the Mahuad government&#x27;s support of neoliberal economic policies, particularly the proposed dollarization plans. Instead of ordering to disperse the protesters, then Col. Gutiérrez and the army stood aside and let them take over the national parliament.

Under pressure from the United States, and lacking support from the indigenous movement, the Junta was dissolved by General Carlos Mendoza and the Congress named then Vice President Gustavo Noboa as president of the country. The armed forces jailed Gutiérrez for six months, but he was discharged, and faced no criminal prosecution despite the fact he was a direct participant.

Prior to the 2000 coup, Gutiérrez was aide-de-camp to former presidents Abdalá Bucaram and Fabián Alarcón. He claimed that, during the demonstrations that unseated Bucaram in February 1997, he also disobeyed orders to protect Carondelet Palace, leaving Bucaram no other choice but to leave.
== Presidency (2003–2005) ==
Gutiérrez ran for President in 2002 as the candidate of the January 21 Patriotic Society Party (PSP), named for the date of the 2000 protest, and the Pachakutik Movement, on a platform of fighting corruption and reversing neoliberal economic reforms. He defeated banana magnate and wealthiest man in Ecuador, Álvaro Noboa, in the second round with 55% of the popular vote, through a partnership with the leftist and indigenous movement parties, Democratic People&#x27;s Movement (Movimiento Popular Democratico/MPD) and Pachacutik, respectively.

Gutiérrez alienated many of his supporters by supporting the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and by keeping the status-quo on economic issues. After three months of government, Gutiérrez broke his alliance with leftist parties and reached an agreement with the Social Christian Party (Partido Social Cristiano/PSC), continuing the economic policies of its predecessors and increasing bonds with the United States. The government received increased frequent accusations of corruption and nepotism. After two years, Gutiérrez broke the agreement with the PSC, further weakening the government politically.

In November 2004 his former left-wing supporters joined with the conservative PSC in launching an effort to impeach him on various charges. Gutiérrez was accused of embezzlement by the PSC for using funds, resources and public property in favor of PSP candidates in the elections of 2004, and by the Democratic Left (Ecuador) (Izquierda Democrática/ID), MPD and Pachakutik for jeopardizing the security of the state for literally inciting the people to burn the courts. Impeachment proceedings collapsed when two legislators broke party lines, and a majority (51) votes could not be reached to continue the proceedings.

In December 2004, Gutiérrez alleged that the Supreme Court of Justice was biased in favor of the PSC. His political party, PSP, together with the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action (Partido Renovador Institucional de Acción Nacional/PRIAN) of Álvaro Noboa, the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano/PRE) of Abdalá Bucaram, independents, and MPD, voted in the Congress for the reorganization of the Supreme Court of Justice via majority resolution. His adversaries sustained that the Constitution gives autonomy to the judicial branch and does not authorize Congress to interfere in the judiciary by removing or nominating judges. Judges were replaced by allies to PRE, PRIAN and PSP political parties with the clear intention of dropping criminal charges against former president Abdalá Bucaram, accused of several acts of corruption during his presidency which led to his exile in Panama from 1997 until April 2005.

=== Crisis ===
On 15 April 2005, amid a growing political crisis and protests in the city of Quito against the Government, President Gutiérrez declared a state of emergency in Quito and revoked the newly appointed Supreme Court of Justice. This was a controversial move that provoked conflicting reactions and was seen by analysts as a dictatorial act. The state of emergency was lifted on 16 April, as the State of Emergency was disobeyed by citizens and General Aguas of the army, who refused to enforce it, and Ecuador&#x27;s Congress was expected to hold a session in order to decide whether to ratify the Supreme Court&#x27;s dismissal.

On 20 April 2005, following a week of massive demonstrations, the Congress of Ecuador (meeting in a special session in a private building, CIESPAL, with opposition delegates only), on the grounds that Gutiérrez had abandoned his constitutional duties, voted 60–2 (38 members, including the great majority of PRE/PRIAN/PSP deputies, did not vote) to remove Gutiérrez from office and appointed Vice President Alfedo Palacio González to serve as President. At the same time, the Ecuadorian Joint Armed Forces Command (Comando Conjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas) publicly expressed that they were withdrawing their support for Gutiérrez, who had no option but to leave the Presidential Palace on a helicopter. He sought political asylum in the house of the Brazilian Ambassador in the north of Quito, after his attempt to leave the city aboard a plane at Quito International Airport was thwarted by hundreds of angry protesters that breached airport security and blocked the airstrip.

=== Approval rating ===
Gutierrez began his presidency with an approval rating of 64%. Gutierrez left office with a 32% approval rating, according to a CEDATOS survey.

== Post-Presidency ==
Brazil offered Gutiérrez asylum and arranged air transport out of Ecuador for the former president. He arrived via Rio Branco on 24 April 2005. He renounced his asylum, then went to Peru and the United States. In September he was reported to be seeking political asylum in Colombia. This was offered on 4 October only to be refused by Gutiérrez on 13 October. Then on 15 October he voluntarily returned to Ecuador vowing to &quot;use all legal and constitutional means to retake power.&quot; He was arrested at the Eloy Alfaro International Airport in Manta, after arriving in a chartered SARPA plane with his brother, Gilmar Gutiérrez, his companion-in-arms Fausto Cobo, and some collaborators. He was taken to a prison in Quito and locked in a maximum security cell on charges of attempting to subvert Ecuador&#x27;s internal security by repeatedly proclaiming to the international media that he continued to be the legitimate President of the Republic of Ecuador.

On 3 March 2006, a judge in Ecuador dismissed the charges against Gutiérrez. A very notorious political agreement ensued between Gutiérrez and the PSC. Gutiérrez and the deputies of PSP sided with the PSC in order to gain a majority for controlling the country&#x27;s Constitutional Court. Upon his release, Gutiérrez thanked the Ecuadorian people for their support and vowed that he would participate and win the presidential election in October.

On 15 October 2006, his PSP, led by Gilmar Gutiérrez, got the third place in the national election with 17% of the total votes, with the support of the economically disadvantaged, landless farmers and indigenous population.

In the 2009 Presidential Election, Lucio Gutiérrez ran for president of Ecuador under the flag of PSP. In the presidential election held on 26 April, he came in second with 26.8% of the vote, losing to Rafael Correa. Lucio Gutiérrez declared election fraud even though all the polls conducted well before election day gave a great advantage to Rafael Correa, and even when international observers from the European Union declared total transparency of the election process.

He was again running for president in 2021, obtaining 1.8% of the vote.

== Post-Election ==

Almost all supporters of Lucio Gutiérrez are in the Amazon region where he was born. This relationship has been used by his political party to gain the support of inhabitants of these isolated areas. Gutiérrez has said he will form a parallel cabinet to that of President Rafael Correa so that if the &quot;people give him the opportunity, he will have an experienced cabinet.&quot;
=== Attempted coup ===

He is alleged to have instigated the 2010 police revolt against Correa. He has fervently denied the allegations claiming that he was in Washington D.C. attending an event at the Inter-American Defense College (of which he is an alumnus), then traveled to Miami to attend a conference on the Socialism of the 21st century and finally to serve as an observer in the Brazilian presidential poll. He has further stated that the whole event was fabricated.

A special commission formed by Correa in 2013 to investigate the events has claimed that he and his party plotted, along with the fugitive Isaias brothers (former owners of Filanbanco who reside in Miami after fleeing during the 1998–2000 banking crisis), former chief of intelligence Mario Pazmiño (accused by Correa of working with the CIA and of being involved in the Colombian attack against Ecuadorian territory in 2008 which killed FARC leader Raúl Reyes and sparked a regional crisis) as well as others.

<doc id="168868" wikidata="Q155004" url="?curid=168868" title="Philippe of Belgium">
<text>Philippe (born 15 April 1960) is King of the Belgians. He is the eldest child of King Albert II and Queen Paola. He succeeded his father upon the former’s abdication for health reasons on 21 July 2013. He married Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz in 1999, with whom he has four children. Their eldest child, Princess Elisabeth, is first in the line of succession.

==Early life==
Philippe was born on 15 April 1960 at the Belvédère Château in Laeken, northern Brussels. His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Liège (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Liège (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles.

Philippe was baptised one month later at the Church of St. James on Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May, and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. His godparents were his paternal grandfather, King Leopold III, and his maternal grandmother, Donna Luisa, Princess Ruffo di Calabria.

Albert and Paola&#x27;s marriage was unhappy, and they were usually absent from Philippe&#x27;s life. The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist described it as, &quot;something that would justify intervention by social workers.&quot;

Philippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).

He was also the fifth cousin of the late Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom since they share a common ancestor, Francis (he was the grandfather of Queen Victoria and one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians). Queen Elizabeth II and King Philippe had been 3rd cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark.

==Education==
As a child the future king was required to move from a French-language school which he liked to a secondary school in Flanders, where he found it difficult to make friends. &quot;In my youth, I had many problems at school&quot;, Philippe told teenage dropouts in 2019. &quot;I felt badly treated. It was not easy for me&quot;. From 1978 to 1981, Philippe was educated at the Belgian Royal Military Academy in the 118th &quot;Promotion Toutes Armes&quot; (Promotion All Weapons). On 26 September 1980, he was appointed second lieutenant and took the officer&#x27;s oath.

Philippe continued his education at Trinity College, Oxford, and he attended graduate school at Stanford University, California, where he graduated in 1985 with an MA degree in political science.
He obtained his fighter pilot&#x27;s wings and his certificates as a parachutist and a commando. In 1989, he attended a series of special sessions at the Royal Higher Defence Institute. The same year, he was promoted to colonel.

In 1993, King Baudouin died in Spain, Albert became the new king, and Philippe became the new heir apparent, titled Duke of Brabant.

On 25 March 2001, Philippe was appointed to the rank of major-general in the Land Component and the Air Component and to the rank of rear-admiral in the Naval Component.

==Marriage==
Philippe married Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz, daughter of a Walloon count of a Belgian noble family and female line descendant of Polish noble families such as the princes Sapieha and counts Komorowski, on 4 December 1999 in Brussels, in a civil ceremony at the Brussels Town Hall and a religious ceremony at the Cathedral of Saint Michel and Saint Gudule in Brussels. They have four children who were all born at Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, Brussels: 
*Princess Elisabeth (born 25 October 2001)
*Prince Gabriel (born 20 August 2003)
*Prince Emmanuel (born 4 October 2005)
*Princess Eléonore (born 16 April 2008)

==Foreign trade==
On 6 August 1993, the government named Philippe as honorary chairman of the Belgian Foreign Trade Board (BFTB). He succeeded his father, who had been honorary chairman of the BFTB since 1962. On 3 May 2003, he was appointed honorary chairman of the board of the Foreign Trade Agency, replacing the BFTB.

In this capacity, Philippe has headed more than 60 economic missions. Upon his accession as seventh King of the Belgians, this role was taken over by his sister Princess Astrid.

==Reign==

King Albert II announced on 3 July 2013 that he would abdicate in favour of Philippe on 21 July 2013. Approximately one hour after King Albert II&#x27;s abdication, Prince Philippe was sworn in as King of the Belgians. His eldest child, Princess Elisabeth, became his heir apparent and is expected to become Belgium&#x27;s first queen regnant.

Philippe played a role in forming a coalition government after the 2014 Belgian federal election. Political meetings with the King were moved from the Palace of Laeken to the Royal Palace of Brussels. In May 2019, Philippe met with Vlaams Belang President Tom Van Grieken, the first time the party had received a royal audience.

In 2020, Philippe announced regret for the &quot;acts of violence and cruelty&quot; committed in the Congo Free State under the rule of his great-great-granduncle King Leopold II.

In September 2024, Philippe, along with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo publicly criticised Pope Francis during their welcome addresses for him over sexual abuses committed by the Roman Catholic Church in Belgium.

<text>Tiffany Cobb (born March 16, 1976), known professionally as Blu Cantrell, is an American R&amp;B singer.

Cantrell rose to fame in 2001, with the release of her debut single, &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up Style (Oops!)&quot;, which peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the US Mainstream Top 40 chart. The song also charted in several other countries, and appeared on her debut album, &quot;So Blu&quot;. In 2002, the song earned Cantrell a Grammy Award nomination. In 2003, Cantrell released her second album, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award and included the single &quot;Breathe&quot; (featuring Sean Paul). Written and produced by Ivan Matias, &quot;Breathe&quot; was a major global success in 2003, especially in the United Kingdom, where it topped the UK Singles Chart for four consecutive weeks. &quot;Breathe&quot; also reached the top ten of several other charts across the world, including the European Hot 100.

==Early life==
Cantrell was born Tiffany Cobb in Providence, Rhode Island. Her mother, former beauty queen Susi Franco, was an actress and jazz vocalist. According to Cantrell, she has African-American, German, and Italian ancestry. Cantrell&#x27;s parents separated when she was a young child, and she along with her five siblings—Adam, Tino, Nick, Kelli, and Summer—were raised by her mother.

==Career==
===Early career===
In the late 1990s, Cantrell established herself as a professional backing vocalist for artists such as Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. In 1999, she became a member of the girl group 8th Avenue, a protégé of singer Teddy Riley. The band recorded several songs and appeared on Blackstreet&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Finally&quot;, but their material was shelved after Riley left Blackstreet to reform his previous group Guy, and Blackstreet were dropped by Interscope Records. Shortly thereafter, 8th Avenue also disbanded. Before long, Cantrell was introduced by both a dancer friend and R&amp;B singer Usher to music producer Tricky Stewart, the head of Red Zone Entertainment. Stewart originally wanted Cantrell to become a member of his girl group 321, but after a fruitful recording session, he offered to help develop Cantrell&#x27;s solo career instead. Cantrell subsequently moved in with Stewart and his girlfriend in their house in Atlanta, and was promptly placed with Arista Records head Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid, who offered the singer a contract with the company after hearing one song she wrote and sang in front of him and his staff. After a bidding war with several different labels, Reid&#x27;s bid was the highest, prompting Cantrell to sign with them.

===2001–2004: &quot;So Blu&quot; and &quot;Bittersweet&quot;===
After her signing with Arista, Cantrell went straight into recording sessions with Dallas Austin and Stewart, as well as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. In July 2001, her debut album, &quot;So Blu,&quot; was released. The record earned generally favorable reviews from critics and became a commercial success, particularly in North America, where it peaked at number eight on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was eventually certified gold by both the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Music Canada. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up Style (Oops!)&quot; became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands and peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song earned Cantrell Grammy Award nominations for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and for Best R&amp;B Song, as well as an American Music Award nomination for Favorite New Soul/R&amp;B Artist, both in 2002. Also in 2002, Cantrell was featured in a small cameo role in Charles Stone III&#x27;s musical comedy-drama film &quot;Drumline,&quot; where she could be seen singing the American national anthem. Her song &quot;It&#x27;s Killing Me (In My Mind)&quot; was included on the soundtrack of the 2002 action comedy film &quot;Bad Company.&quot;

In 2003, Cantrell released her second album, &quot;Bittersweet&quot; which featured production from Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Mike City, Soulshock &amp; Karlin, and Shep Crawford. As with her debut, the album garnered a positive reception from critics, even earning her a Best R&amp;B Album nomination at the 46th Grammy Awards, but was less successful in the United States, peaking at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was a success internationally, where sales were boosted by its hit single &quot;Breathe&quot;, a collaboration with Sean Paul. Her highest-charting single yet, it topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and reached the top ten of the majority of charts it appeared on, ranking among the biggest-selling releases of the year. &quot;Breathe&quot; was followed by the top thirty single &quot;Make Me Wanna Scream&quot;.

===2005–present===

In 2005, following the formation of the joint venture of BMG and Sony Music Entertainment, Arista merged with J Records and began operating under the newly formed RCA Music Group. At about the same time, Cantrell&#x27;s recording deal was up for renewal and though she was in a position to re-sign with the label, the singer chose to leave the company following the resignation of her mentor L.A. Reid. She then toured intensively as a free agent. Cantrell also starred alongside LisaRaye and Kenya Moore in the musical stage play &quot;Gossip, Lies and Secrets&quot; which ran from September until November in 2007. The following year, she appeared in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Circus&quot;, becoming the first celebrity to be eliminated from the show in the season&#x27;s second week.

In 2013, Cantrell confirmed that she was working independently on her third studio album. In December 2016, she told &quot;Fuse&quot; that she was still working on a new album.

Despite the lack of US success after her one big hit, Cantrell continues to perform in Australia and Europe.

==Personal life==
Cantrell was taken into custody by police for a psychological evaluation on September 3, 2014. She was seen running around the streets of Santa Monica at around 2 am, screaming that someone had &quot;poisoned her with gas&quot;. Cantrell, according to witnesses, went &quot;berserk&quot; and referred to herself as a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;, questioning authorities whether they recognized her; when her &quot;erratic&quot; behavior failed to cease, someone called the police. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was evaluated by medics.

<text>Natalie Renée McIntyre (born September 6, 1967), known professionally as Macy Gray, is an American R&amp;B and soul singer and actress. She is known for her distinctive raspy voice and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday. As of 2018, she has sold over 25 million records worldwide.

Gray has released ten studio albums, and received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one. She has appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Training Day&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;, &quot;Lackawanna Blues&quot;, &quot;Idlewild&quot;, &quot;For Colored Girls&quot;, and &quot;The Paperboy&quot;. Gray is best known for her international hit single &quot;I Try&quot;, taken from her multi-platinum debut album &quot;On How Life Is&quot;. Gray was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2014 in her hometown of Canton, Ohio.

==Early life==
Natalie McIntyre was born in Canton, Ohio, the daughter of Laura McIntyre, a math schoolteacher, and Otis Jones. Her stepfather was a steelworker, and her sister is a biology teacher. She has a younger brother, Nate, who owns a gym in West Philadelphia and was featured on the season five finale of &quot;Queer Eye&quot;. She began piano lessons at age seven. A childhood bicycle mishap resulted in her noticing a mailbox of a man named Macy Gray; she used the name in stories she wrote and later decided to use it as her stage name. She was late developing and did not learn to hold conversation until just before her tenth birthday.

Gray attended elementary school with Brian Warner (later known as musician Marilyn Manson) although they did not know each other. She attended more than one high school, including a boarding school which asked her to leave due to her behavior.

She attended the University of Southern California and studied scriptwriting.

==Musical career==

While attending the University of Southern California, she agreed to write songs for a friend. A demo session was scheduled for the songs to be recorded by another singer, but the vocalist failed to appear, so Gray recorded them herself. 

She then met writer-producer Joe Solo while working as a cashier in Beverly Hills. Together, they wrote a collection of songs and recorded them in Solo&#x27;s studio. The demo tape gave Gray the opportunity to sing at jazz cafés in Los Angeles. Although Gray did not consider her unusual voice desirable for singing, Atlantic Records signed her. She began recording her debut record but was dropped from the label upon the departure of A&amp;R man Tom Carolan, who had signed her to the label. Macy returned to Ohio but in 1997 Los Angeles based Zomba Label Group Senior VP A&amp;R man Jeff Blue, convinced her to return to music and signed her to a development deal, recording new songs based on her life experiences, with a new sound, and began shopping her to record labels. In 1998, she landed a record deal with Epic Records. She performed on &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;, a song on the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; debut album &quot;Behind the Front&quot;.

===1999–2001: &quot;On How Life Is&quot;===
Gray worked on her debut album in 1999 with producer Darryl Swann. Released in the summer of 1999, &quot;On How Life Is&quot; became a worldwide smash. The first single, &quot;Do Something&quot;, stalled on the charts, but the second single, &quot;I Try&quot;, made the album a success. &quot;I Try&quot; (which was originally featured in &quot;Love Jones&quot; and the Jennifer Aniston-starring romantic-comedy &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; in 1997) was one of the biggest singles of 1999, and subsequent singles (&quot;Still&quot; and &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t You Call Me&quot;) ensured the album became triple platinum in the US and quadruple platinum in the UK.

In 2001, Gray won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;I Try&quot;, which was also nominated for the Song of the Year and Record of the Year Grammys. She then collaborated with Fatboy Slim, the Black Eyed Peas, and Slick Rick (on the song &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;, from the &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; soundtrack), as well as acting for the first time, in the thriller &quot;Training Day&quot;. In August 2001, Gray was booed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame exhibition game after forgetting the lyrics to the American national anthem.

===2001–2005: &quot;The Id&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Being Myself&quot;===

Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Id&quot; featured appearances by John Frusciante and Erykah Badu on the single &quot;Sweet Baby&quot; (which was co-written with longtime collaborator Joe Solo). The album peaked at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It fared even better in the UK, where it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the BPI.

In 2002, she appeared in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and contributed a remix of her song &quot;My Nutmeg Phantasy&quot; to its accompanying soundtrack. Gray also worked with Santana on the track &quot;Amoré (Sexo)&quot;, for his album &quot;Shaman&quot;.

Also in 2002, she appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD in tribute to Nigerian Afropop pioneer Fela Kuti, &quot;Red Hot and Riot&quot;. She appeared on a remake of Kuti&#x27;s classic track &quot;Water No Get Enemy&quot; alongside prominent neo soul, hip hop and R&amp;B artists, D&#x27;Angelo, the Soultronics, Nile Rodgers, Roy Hargrove, and Kuti&#x27;s son, Femi Kuti.

She recorded a duet with Zucchero called &quot;Like the Sun (From Out of Nowhere)&quot;, which featured Jeff Beck on guitar released in 2004 on &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;, a duet collection. Her song &quot;Time of My Life&quot; was included in the soundtrack to &quot;8 Mile&quot;. A cartoon based on Gray&#x27;s childhood was being developed, but it never came to fruition.

In 2003, Gray released her third studio album, &quot;The Trouble with Being Myself&quot;, to rave reviews. The lead single, &quot;When I See You&quot;, became a radio hit in the US and a top-forty hit in the UK, although the album was not as well received by fans. Nevertheless, it became Gray&#x27;s third top twenty album in the UK. A greatest hits collection and a live album were subsequently released: &quot;The Very Best of Macy Gray&quot; (2004) and &quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot; (2005). Additionally, Gray was featured on Marcus Miller&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Silver Rain&quot;, on a cover of Prince&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;. She also appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Chicago&quot; with Queen Latifah and Lil&#x27; Kim on &quot;Cell Block Tango/He Had it Comin&#x27;&quot;.

===2007–2010: Return to music and &quot;Big&quot;===

Gray began 2007 by being kicked off-stage at a concert in Barbados for profanity (which was part of the show), but she was not aware that it was against the law in that country. She gave a public apology that night to avoid arrest.

In March, Gray released her fourth studio album (sixth overall), &quot;Big&quot;. Two singles, &quot;Finally Made Me Happy&quot; and &quot;Shoo Be Doo&quot;, were released from the album. &quot;What I Gotta Do&quot;, another track from the album, is featured on the &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; soundtrack. It has been considered Gray&#x27;s comeback album, after a four-year hiatus since her last studio album. The album was critically acclaimed and seen by some as her best work to date. It features collaborations with Natalie Cole, Fergie, Justin Timberlake, and will.i.am, who co-executive produced the album with Gray. It was moderately successful in the US, where it debuted and peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Gray&#x27;s highest-charting album since &quot;The Id&quot;. &quot;Big&quot; reached number 62 on the albums chart in the UK, her lowest-charting UK album, but it achieved some success in several other countries, including Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Finland, reaching the Top 40 on their album charts.

PBS&#x27;s &quot;Soundstage&quot; live concert series premiered a Gray concert on July 5.

On July 7, 2007, Gray performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Gray and her band members wore clothes bearing political messages. Gray&#x27;s dress carried the message &quot;Darfur Red Alert&quot;.

In 2008, Gray launched a new campaign under the name &quot;Nemesis Jaxson&quot;, with the single &quot;Slap a Bitch&quot;.

Early in 2009, Gray recorded the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot;.

===2010–2011: &quot;The Sellout&quot;===
The first single from Gray&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;The Sellout&quot;, &quot;Beauty in the World&quot;, is featured in the final sequence of the series finale, &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, of the ABC television series, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. &quot;Beauty in the World&quot; was also used as the theme in multiple videos created by Microsoft to promote Internet Explorer 9. Both singles released from the album (&quot;Beauty in the World&quot; and &quot;Lately&quot;) were top 10 hits on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs Chart.

Upon its release, &quot;The Sellout&quot; received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Metacritic gave it an average score of 57, based on 15 reviews; Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; gave it three out of five stars; while AllMusic writer John Bush shared a similar sentiment and panned Gray&#x27;s songwriting.

However, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s James Reed commended its production, and Jeremy Allen of &quot;NME&quot; gave the album a 7/10 rating.

===2011–2015: &quot;Covered&quot;, &quot;Talking Book&quot;, and &quot;The Way&quot;===

In 2011, Gray signed a deal with 429 Records and started recording a series of covers for her next studio album &quot;Covered&quot;. The album was officially released on March 26, 2012. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot; (originally performed by Eurythmics). On February 16, 2012, Gray participated in the Sanremo Festival as a guest, performing alongside Gigi D&#x27;Alessio and Loredana Bertè.

For the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Stevie Wonder album &quot;Talking Book&quot;, Gray covered the entire record and released her &quot;Talking Book&quot; as a tribute.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s &quot;Where Are They Now&quot;, Gray opened up about her problems with drug abuse, stating that she was ill-prepared for the level of fame she received. The interview coincided with the release of her album &quot;The Way&quot;, released in October 2014 on Kobalt Records. A world tour was announced shortly after its release.

===2016–present: &quot;Stripped&quot; and &quot;Ruby&quot;===
In 2016, Gray&#x27;s career continued with an album produced by Chesky Records, the record label founded by Grammy-nominated composer and musician David Chesky. &quot;Stripped&quot; was released September 9, 2016, and garnered almost unanimous praise from critics. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Jazz Chart. Earlier that year, she was featured on Ariana Grande&#x27;s song &quot;Leave Me Lonely&quot; from her third studio album, &quot;Dangerous Woman&quot;.

Gray released her tenth studio album, &quot;Ruby&quot;, in September 2018.

===Other work===
In 2001, she was the voice for Seeiah Owens in the video game &quot;SSX Tricky&quot;. Gray sang the theme song for the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot;, composed by Jared Faber and Emily Kapnek. Gray also performed the song on the short-lived UPN romantic comedy &quot;Second Time Around&quot; starring Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker in 2004. In 2006 Gray appeared in the eighth season of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;, playing for Habitat for Humanity. She finished in third place.

In August 2008, Gray headlined at the 2008 Summer Sundae music festival in Leicester, England, performing cover versions of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;, Deee-Lite&#x27;s &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot; and Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot;. For the gig, her band wore pink Andy Warhol wigs. On September 28, 2008, Gray sang the American national anthem as part of the Israeli flag-raising ceremony at the Israeli consulate of Los Angeles. Also in 2008, Gray collaborated with Australian DJ and singer Kaz James on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot;. The single was released in early 2009 in Australia and is credited to Kaz James featuring Macy Gray. In 2009, Gray briefly competed in season 9 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional partner Jonathan Roberts. They were eliminated in a double elimination in week one. In 2012, she performed the Michael Jackson song &quot;Rock with You&quot; for a special performance of the West End musical &quot;Thriller – Live&quot; for BBC Children in Need Pop Goes the Musical.

In 2015, Gray was featured on the song &quot;Into the Deep&quot; by Galactic. In 2016, Gray was featured on the song &quot;Leave Me Lonely&quot; by Ariana Grande. In 2018, Gray was featured alongside Dolly Parton on a re-recording of &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; for the &quot;Dumplin&quot;&#x27; soundtrack. In 2020, Gray was featured on the single &quot;Out Of Love&quot; by Canadian band Busty and the Bass. The band also released a notable cover of Gray&#x27;s &quot;I Try&quot; in 2016.

In 2021, Gray competed in season three of the Australian version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Atlantis&quot;. On February 20, 2022, Gray performed The Star-Spangled Banner at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. Gray represented her home state of Ohio at the 2022 America Song Contest with the song &quot;Every Night&quot;.

In 2023, Gray competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Sea Queen&quot;. She finished in 4th place.

In 2025, Gray competed in season six of the British version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Toad in the Hole&quot;, which she was third to be eliminated. She subsequently walked off stage before later returning to unmask in front of the audience and panel.

==Personal life==
Gray was married to Tracey Hinds, a mortgage broker, for about two years, but they divorced prior to her rise to prominence. They have three children. She opened the Macy Gray Music Academy in 2005.

In a July 2022 interview on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot;, Gray was asked how she would define a woman, to which she answered &quot;boobs and a vagina&quot;. She went on to state that she did not support the inclusion of transgender women in women&#x27;s sports. In the days following the interview, she said that her words had been misunderstood, along with rejecting criticism she had received online for her views. In a subsequent appearance on the &quot;Today&quot; television show, she said, &quot;Being a woman is a vibe and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m very proud of and something that it is very precious to me. I think that if you in your heart feel that&#x27;s what you are, then that&#x27;s what you are regardless of what anybody says or thinks&quot;.
