<text>Fritz Haber (; 9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that a third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this food supports nearly half the world&#x27;s population. For this work, Haber has been called one of the most important scientists and industrial chemists in human history. Haber also, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. 

Haber, a known German nationalist, is also considered the &quot;father of chemical warfare&quot; for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I. He first proposed the use of the heavier-than-air chlorine gas as a weapon to break the trench deadlock during the Second Battle of Ypres. His work was later used, without his direct involvement, to develop the Zyklon B pesticide used for the killing of more than 1 million Jews in gas chambers in the greater context of the Holocaust.

After the Nazis&#x27; rise to power in 1933, Haber resigned from his position. Already in poor health, he spent time in various countries before Chaim Weizmann invited him to become the director of the Sieff Research Institute (now the Weizmann Institute) in Rehovot, Mandatory Palestine. He accepted the offer but died of heart failure mid-journey in a Basel, Switzerland hotel on 29 January 1934, aged 65.

==Early life and education==
Haber was born in Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), into a well-off Jewish family. Though Haber was a common family name in Breslau, the family has been traced back to a great-grandfather, Pinkus Selig Haber, who was a wool dealer from Kempen (now Kępno, Poland). An important Prussian edict of 13 March 1812 determined that Jews and their families, including Pinkus Haber, were &quot;to be treated as local citizens and citizens of Prussia&quot;. Under such regulations, members of the Haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business, politics, and law.

Haber was the son of Siegfried and Paula Haber, who were first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families. Haber&#x27;s father Siegfried was a well-known merchant in the town, who had founded his own business in dye pigments, paints and pharmaceuticals. Paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after Fritz&#x27;s birth, leaving Siegfried devastated and Fritz in the care of various aunts. When Haber was about six years old, Siegfried remarried to Hedwig Hamburger. Siegfried and his second wife had three daughters: Else, Helene, and Frieda. Although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult owing to Fritz being associated with the death of his first wife, Haber developed close relationships with his stepmother and his half-sisters. Siegfried displayed love and care for his three daughters but never fully accepted Fritz as his son.

By the time Fritz was born, the Habers had to some extent become assimilated into German society. He attended primary school at the Johanneum School, a &quot;simultaneous school&quot; open equally to Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish students. At age 11, he went to school at the St Elizabeth classical school, in a class evenly divided between Protestant and Jewish students. His family supported the Jewish community and continued to observe many Jewish traditions, but were not strongly associated with the synagogue. Haber identified strongly as German, less so as Jewish.

Haber successfully passed his examinations at the St Elizabeth High School in Breslau in September 1886. Although his father wished him to become an apprentice in the dye company, Haber obtained his father&#x27;s permission to study chemistry at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (today the Humboldt University of Berlin), with the director of the Institute for Chemistry A. W. Hofmann. Haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester (1886–87) in Berlin, and arranged to attend the Heidelberg University for the summer semester of 1887, where he studied under Robert Bunsen. He then returned to Berlin, to the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (today Technische Universität Berlin).

In the summer of 1889, Haber was conscripted and left university to perform his one-year volunteer service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment. Upon its completion, he returned to Charlottenburg where he became a student of Carl Liebermann. In addition to Liebermann&#x27;s lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes.

Liebermann assigned Haber to work on reactions with piperonal for his thesis topic, published as (About a Few piperonal Derivatives) in 1891. Haber received his doctorate &quot;cum laude&quot; from Friedrich Wilhelm University in May 1891, after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the University of Berlin, since Charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates.

With his degree, Haber returned to Breslau to work at his father&#x27;s chemical business, where their relationship continued to have difficulties. Through Siegfried&#x27;s connections, Haber was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies to gain experience. These included Grünwald and Company (a Budapest distillery), an Austrian ammonia-sodium factory, and the Feldmühle paper and cellulose works. These experiences drove Haber to learn more about technical processes, and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at the Polytechnic College in Zürich (now the ETH Zürich), studying with Georg Lunge. In the Fall of 1892, Haber returned again to Breslau to work in his father&#x27;s company, but the two men continued to clash and Siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together.

Haber had received a PhD in chemistry by this time, but his father required him to take handwriting courses and become a salesman to learn more about the company. Haber urged his father to transfer from natural to synthetic dyes, but his father refused. Eventually, his father followed global business trends and switched to synthetic dyes. Haber&#x27;s next suggestion, during a cholera epidemic, was for his father to purchase calcium hypochlorite, which at the time was the only known method for the prevention of cholera. That epidemic ended up being isolated and resulted in their possession of a sizeable amount of unused calcium hypochlorite, which is unstable. This caused a rift between Siegfried and Haber, with his father telling him to go back to his university studies as he did not belong in the business world.

==Early career==
Haber then sought an academic appointment, first working as an independent assistant to Ludwig Knorr at the University of Jena between 1892 and 1894. During his time in Jena, Haber converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, possibly in an attempt to improve his chances of getting a better academic or military position. Knorr recommended Haber to Carl Engler, a chemistry professor at the University of Karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dyes and the dye industry, and the study of synthetic materials for textiles. Engler referred Haber to a colleague in Karlsruhe, Hans Bunte, who made Haber an &quot;Assistent&quot; in 1894.

Bunte suggested that Haber examine the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. By making careful quantitative analyses, Haber was able to establish that &quot;the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds&quot;, a classic result in the study of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. This work became Haber&#x27;s habilitation thesis.

Haber was appointed a Privatdozent in Bunte&#x27;s institute, taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology, and continuing to work on the combustion of gases. In 1896, the university supported him in travelling to Silesia, Saxony, and Austria to learn about advances in dye technology.

In 1897 Haber made a similar trip to learn about developments in electrochemistry. He had been interested in the area for some time, and had worked with another privatdozent, Hans Luggin, who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry. Haber&#x27;s 1898 book (Outline of technical electrochemistry based on theoretical foundations) attracted considerable attention, particularly his work on the reduction of nitrobenzene. In the book&#x27;s foreword, Haber expresses his gratitude to Luggin, who died on 5 December 1899. Haber collaborated with others in the area as well, including Georg Bredig, a student and later an assistant of Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig.

Bunte and Engler supported an application for further authorization of Haber&#x27;s teaching activities, and on 6 December 1898, Haber was invested with the title of &quot;Extraordinarius&quot; and an associate professorship, by order of the Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden.

Haber worked in a variety of areas while at Karlsruhe, making significant contributions in several areas. In the area of dye and textiles, he and Friedrich Bran were able to explain theoretically steps in textile printing processes developed by Adolf Holz. Discussions with Carl Engler prompted Haber to explain autoxidation in electrochemical terms, differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation. Haber&#x27;s examinations of the thermodynamics of the reaction of solids confirmed that Faraday&#x27;s laws hold for the electrolysis of crystalline salts. This work led to a theoretical basis for the glass electrode and the measurement of electrolytic potentials. Haber&#x27;s work on irreversible and reversible forms of electrochemical reduction are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry. He also studied the passivity of non-rare metals and the effects of electric current on corrosion of metals. In addition, Haber published his second book, (1905) trans. &quot;Thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions: seven lectures&quot; (1908), later regarded as &quot;a model of accuracy and critical insight&quot; in the field of chemical thermodynamics.

In 1906, Max Le Blanc, chair of the physical chemistry department at Karlsruhe, accepted a position at the University of Leipzig. After receiving recommendations from a search committee, the Ministry of Education in Baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at Karlsruhe to Haber, who accepted the offer.

==Nobel Prize==
During his time at University of Karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911, Haber and his assistant Robert Le Rossignol invented the Haber–Bosch process, which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure. This discovery was a direct consequence of Le Châtelier&#x27;s principle, announced in 1884, which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed, the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change. Since it was known how to decompose ammonia in the presence of a nickel-based catalyst, one could derive from Le Châtelier&#x27;s principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure. 

To further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production, Haber turned to industry. Partnering with Carl Bosch at BASF, the process was successfully scaled up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia. The Haber–Bosch process was a milestone in industrial chemistry. The production of nitrogen-based products such as fertilizer and chemical feedstocks, which was previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits, now became possible using an easily available and abundant base: atmospheric nitrogen. The ability to produce much larger quantities of nitrogen-based fertilizers in turn supported much greater agricultural yields, supporting half the world&#x27;s population.

The discovery of a new way of producing ammonia had other significant economic impacts as well. Chile had been a major (and almost unique) exporter of natural deposits such as sodium nitrate (caliche). After the introduction of the Haber process, naturally extracted nitrate production in Chile fell from 2.5 million tons (employing 60,000 workers and selling at US$45/ton) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons, produced by 14,133 workers, and selling at $19/ton in 1934.

The annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons. The food base of half the current world population is based on the Haber–Bosch process.

Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work (he actually received the award in 1919).
In his acceptance speech for that Nobel Prize Haber commented &quot;It may be that this solution is not the final one. Nitrogen bacteria teach us that Nature, with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter, still understands and utilizes methods which we do not as yet know how to imitate.&quot;

Haber was also active in the research on combustion reactions, the separation of gold from sea water, adsorption effects, electrochemistry, and free radical research (see Fenton&#x27;s reagent). A large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem. In 1953, this institute was renamed for him. He is sometimes credited, incorrectly, with first synthesizing MDMA (which was first synthesized by Merck KGaA chemist Anton Köllisch in 1912).

==World War I==
Haber greeted World War I with enthusiasm, joining 92 other German intellectuals in signing the &quot;Manifesto of the Ninety-Three&quot; in October 1914. Haber played a major role in the development of the non-ballistic use of chemical warfare in World War I, in spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the Hague Convention of 1907 (to which Germany was a signatory). He was promoted to the rank of captain and made head of the Chemistry Section in the Ministry of War soon after the war began. In addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare, Haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the German military at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April to 25 May 1915) in Belgium. The team Haber assembled consisted of more than 150 scientists and 1,300 technical personnel. Haber also helped to develop gas masks with adsorbent filters which could protect against such weapons.

A special troop was formed for gas warfare (Pioneer Regiments 35 and 36) under the command of Otto Peterson, with Haber and Friedrich Kerschbaum as advisors. Haber actively recruited physicists, chemists, and other scientists to be transferred to the unit. Future Nobel laureates James Franck, Gustav Hertz, and Otto Hahn served as gas troops in Haber&#x27;s unit. In 1914 and 1915, before the Second Battle of Ypres, Haber&#x27;s unit investigated reports that the French had deployed Turpinite, a supposed chemical weapon, against German soldiers.

Gas warfare in World War I was, in a sense, the war of the chemists, with Haber pitted against French Nobel laureate chemist Victor Grignard. Regarding war and peace, Haber once said &quot;during peace time a scientist belongs to the world, but during war time he belongs to his country&quot;. This was an example of the ethical dilemmas facing chemists at that 
time.

Haber was a patriotic German who was proud of his service during World War I, for which he was decorated. He was even given the rank of captain by the Kaiser, which Haber had been denied 25 years earlier during his compulsory military service.

In his studies of the effects of poison gas, Haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect (death) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time. He formulated a simple mathematical relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary exposure time. This relationship became known as Haber&#x27;s rule.

Haber defended gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane, saying that death was death, by whatever means it was inflicted and referred to history: &quot;The disapproval that the knight had for the man with the firearm is repeated in the soldier who shoots with steel bullets towards the man who confronts him with chemical weapons. [...] The gas weapons are not at all more cruel than the flying iron pieces; on the contrary, the fraction of fatal gas diseases is comparatively smaller, the mutilations are missing&quot;.

Haber received much criticism for his involvement in the development of chemical weapons in pre-World War II Germany, both from contemporaries, especially Albert Einstein, and from modern-day scientists.

==Between World Wars==
From 1919 to 1923 Haber continued to be involved in Germany&#x27;s secret development of chemical weapons, working with Hugo Stoltzenberg, and helping both Spain and Russia in the development of chemical gases.

During the 1920s, scientists working at Haber&#x27;s institute developed the cyanide gas formulation Zyklon A, which was used as an insecticide, especially as a fumigant in grain stores.

From 1919 to 1925, in response to a request made by German ambassador Wilhelm Solf to Japan for Japanese support for German scholars in times of financial hardship, a Japanese businessman named Hoshi Hajime, the president of Hoshi Pharmaceutical Company, donated two million Reichsmark to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society as the &#x27;Japan Fund&#x27; (Hoshi-Ausschuss). Haber was asked to manage the fund, and was invited by Hoshi to Japan in 1924. Haber offered a number of chemical licences to Hoshi&#x27;s company, but the offers were refused. The money from the Fund was used to support the work of Richard Willstätter, Max Planck, Otto Hahn, Leo Szilard, and others.

In the 1920s, Haber searched exhaustively for a method to extract gold from sea water, and published a number of scientific papers on the subject. After years of research, he concluded that the concentration of gold dissolved in sea water was much lower than that reported by earlier researchers, and that gold extraction from sea water was uneconomic.

By 1931, Haber was increasingly concerned about the rise of National Socialism in Germany, and the possible safety of his friends, associates, and family. Under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 7 April 1933, Jewish scientists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society were particularly targeted. The (&quot;Journal for all natural sciences&quot;) charged that &quot;The founding of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Dahlem was the prelude to an influx of Jews into the physical sciences. The directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical and Electrochemistry was given to the Jew, F. Haber, the nephew of the big-time Jewish profiteer Koppel&quot;. (Koppel was not actually related to Haber.) Haber was stunned by these developments, since he assumed that his conversion to Christianity and his services to the state during World War I should have made him a German patriot. Ordered to dismiss all Jewish personnel, Haber attempted to delay their departures long enough to find them somewhere to go. As of 30 April 1933, Haber wrote to Bernhard Rust, the national and Prussian minister of Education, and to Max Planck, president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, to tender his resignation as the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and as a professor at the university, effective 1 October 1933. He said that although as a converted Jew he might be legally entitled to remain in his position, he no longer wished to do so.

Haber and his son Hermann also urged that Haber&#x27;s children by Charlotte Nathan, at boarding school in Germany, should leave the country. Charlotte and the children moved to the United Kingdom around 1933 or 1934. After the war, Charlotte&#x27;s children became British citizens.

==Personal life and family==
Haber met Clara Immerwahr in Breslau in 1889, while he was serving his required year in the military. Clara was the daughter of a chemist who owned a sugar factory, and was the first woman to earn a PhD (in chemistry) at the University of Breslau. She converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1897, several years before she and Haber became engaged. They were married on 3 August 1901; their son Hermann was born on 1 June 1902.

Clara was a women&#x27;s rights activist and according to some accounts, a pacifist. Intelligent and a perfectionist, she became increasingly depressed after her marriage and the resulting loss of her career. On 2 May 1915, following an argument with Haber, Clara died of suicide in their garden by shooting herself in the heart with his service revolver. She did not die immediately, and was found by her 12-year-old son, Hermann, who had heard the shot.

The reasons for her suicide remain the subject of speculation. There were multiple stresses in the marriage, and it has been suggested that she opposed Haber&#x27;s work in chemical warfare. According to this view, her suicide may have been in part a response to Haber&#x27;s having personally overseen the first successful use of chlorine gas during the Second Battle of Ypres, resulting in over 67,000 casualties. Haber left within days for the Eastern Front to oversee gas release against the Russian Army. Originally buried in Dahlem, Clara&#x27;s remains were later transferred at her husband&#x27;s request to Basel, where she is buried next to him.

Haber married his second wife, Charlotte Nathan, on 25 October 1917 in Berlin. When out travelling, Fritz was staying at the Adlon Hotel which was near the Deutscher Klub. At this establishment, Fritz met Nathan, who was one of the secretaries and sparked his interest with her accomplishments despite not having extensive experience or education. On the day that he met her, it had been raining and she gave him an umbrella to use to which he replied &quot;I lay the umbrella into your arms and myself and my thanks at your feet&quot;. She replied &quot;I&#x27;d rather like the contrary&quot;. They began seeing each other and he would soon propose to her. Charlotte rejected the proposal at first due to their large age difference but she eventually agreed. Charlotte, like Clara, converted from Judaism to Christianity before marrying Haber. The couple had two children, Eva-Charlotte and Ludwig Fritz (&quot;Lutz&quot;). Again, however, there were conflicts, and the couple were divorced as of 6 December 1927.

Haber and Clara&#x27;s son, Hermann Haber, lived in France until 1941, but was unable to obtain French citizenship. When Germany invaded France during World War II, Hermann and his wife and three daughters escaped internment on a French ship travelling from Marseilles to the Caribbean. From there, they obtained visas allowing them to immigrate to the United States. Hermann&#x27;s wife Margarethe died after the end of the war, and Hermann committed suicide in 1946. His oldest daughter, Claire, committed suicide in 1949; also a chemist, she had been told her research into an antidote for the effects of chlorine gas was being set aside, as work on the atomic bomb was taking precedence.

Fritz Haber&#x27;s other son, Ludwig Fritz Haber (1921–2004), became an eminent British economist and wrote a history of chemical warfare in World War I, &quot;The Poisonous Cloud&quot; (1986). Hermann&#x27;s daughter Eva lived in Kenya for many years, returning to England in the 1950s. She died in 2015, leaving three children, five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. Several members of Haber&#x27;s extended family died in Nazi concentration camps, including his half-sister Frieda&#x27;s daughter, Hilde Glücksmann, her husband, and their two children.

==Death==

Haber left Dahlem in August 1933, staying briefly in Paris, Spain, and Switzerland. He was in extremely poor health during these travels. Haber specifically suffered attacks from angina. Repeated angina attacks can cause lasting damage which likely contributed to his death the next year.

In the meantime, some of the scientists who had been Haber&#x27;s counterparts and competitors in England during World War I now helped him and others to leave Germany. Brigadier Harold Hartley, Sir William Jackson Pope and Frederick G. Donnan arranged for Haber to be officially invited to Cambridge, England. There, with his assistant Joseph Joshua Weiss, Haber lived and worked for a few months. Scientists such as Ernest Rutherford were less forgiving of Haber&#x27;s involvement in poison gas warfare: Rutherford pointedly refused to shake hands with him.

In 1933, during Haber&#x27;s brief sojourn in England, Chaim Weizmann offered him the directorship at the Sieff Research Institute (now the Weizmann Institute) in Rehovot, in Mandatory Palestine. He accepted, and left for the Middle East in January 1934, travelling with his half-sister, Else Haber Freyhahn. His ill health overpowered him and on 29 January 1934, at the age of 65, he died of heart failure, mid-journey, in a Basel hotel.

Following Haber&#x27;s wishes, Haber and Clara&#x27;s son Hermann arranged for Haber to be cremated and buried in Basel&#x27;s Hörnli Cemetery on 29 September 1934, and for Clara&#x27;s remains to be removed from Dahlem and re-interred with him on 27 January 1937 (see picture). Albert Einstein, his longtime friend, eulogized Haber with the following words: &quot;Haber&#x27;s life was the tragedy of the German Jew – the tragedy of unrequited love&quot;.

==Estate and legacy==
Haber bequeathed his extensive private library to the Sieff Institute, where it was dedicated as the Fritz Haber Library on 29 January 1936. Hermann Haber helped to move the library and gave a speech at the dedication. It still exists as a private collection in the Weizmann Institute.

In 1981, the Minerva foundation of the Max Planck Society and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) established the Fritz Haber Research Center for Molecular Dynamics, based at the Institute of Chemistry of the Hebrew University. Its purpose is the promotion of Israeli-German scientific collaboration in the field of Molecular Dynamics. The Center&#x27;s library is also called Fritz Haber Library, but it is not immediately clear whether there is any connection to the 1936 homonymous library of the Sieff (now Weizmann) Institute.

The institute most closely associated with his work, the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Dahlem (a suburb of Berlin), was renamed Fritz Haber Institute in 1953 and is part of the Max Planck Society.

==Dramatizations and fictionalizations==
The Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote the song &quot;Father&quot; about Haber.

A fictional description of Haber&#x27;s life, and in particular his long-term relationship with Albert Einstein, appears in Vern Thiessen&#x27;s 2003 play &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Gift&quot;. Thiessen describes Haber as a tragic figure who strives unsuccessfully throughout his life to evade both his Jewish ancestry and the moral implications of his scientific contributions.

BBC Radio 4 &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; has broadcast two plays on the life of Fritz Haber. The description of the first reads: from the Diversity Website:

The second play was titled &quot;The Greater Good&quot; and was first broadcast on 23 October 2008. It was directed by Celia de Wolff and written by Justin Hopper, and starred Anton Lesser as Haber. It explored his work on chemical warfare during World War I and the strain it put on his wife Clara (Lesley Sharp), concluding with her suicide and its cover-up by the authorities. Other cast included Dan Starkey as Haber&#x27;s research associate Otto Sackur, Stephen Critchlow as Colonel Peterson, Conor Tottenham as Haber&#x27;s son Hermann, Malcolm Tierney as General Falkenhayn and Janice Acquah as Zinaide.

In 2008, a short film titled &quot;Haber&quot; depicted Fritz Haber&#x27;s decision to embark on the gas warfare program and his relationship with his wife. The film was written and directed by Daniel Ragussis.

In November 2008, Haber was again played by Anton Lesser in &quot;Einstein and Eddington&quot;.

In January 2012, &quot;Radiolab&quot; aired a segment on Haber, including the invention of the Haber Process, the Second Battle of Ypres, his involvement with Zyklon A, and the death of his wife, Clara.

In December 2013, Haber was the subject of a BBC World Service radio programme: &quot;Why has one of the world&#x27;s most important scientists been forgotten?&quot;.

His and his wife&#x27;s life, including their relationship with the Einsteins, and Haber&#x27;s wife&#x27;s suicide, are featured prominently in the novel &quot;A Reunion of Ghosts&quot; by Judith Claire Mitchell. The characters are named Lenz and Iris Alter.

Haber&#x27;s life and relationship to Albert Einstein was portrayed in &quot;Genius&quot; which aired on National Geographic Channel from 25 April to 27 June 2017.

<text>The United States presidential line of succession is the order in which the vice president of the United States and other officers of the United States federal government assume the powers and duties of the U.S. presidency (or the office itself, in the instance of succession by the vice president) upon an elected president&#x27;s death, resignation, removal from office, or incapacity.

The order of succession specifies that the office passes to the vice president; if the vice presidency is simultaneously vacant, the powers and duties of the presidency pass to the speaker of the House of Representatives, president pro tempore of the Senate, and then Cabinet secretaries, depending on eligibility.

Presidential succession is referred to multiple times in the U.S. Constitution: Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, the 12th Amendment, 20th Amendment, and 25th Amendment. The vice president is designated as first in the presidential line of succession by the Article II succession clause, which also authorizes Congress to provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president. It has done so on three occasions. The Presidential Succession Act was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006. The 25th Amendment, adopted in 1967, also establishes procedures for filling an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president.

The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president &quot;acting as&quot; president rather than &quot;becoming&quot; president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is highest and fourth in line (after the Senate president pro tem); the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order of when their departments (or the department of which their department is the successor) were created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally not &quot;eligible to the Office of President&quot; are disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the president through succession and skipped to the next in line. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions: eight times due to the incumbent&#x27;s death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has ever been called upon to act as president.

Widely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 demonstrated the potential for a decapitation strike that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession in addition to many members of Congress and the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, numerous wide-ranging discussions were started, in Congress, among academics and within the public policy community about continuity of government concerns including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions remain ongoing. One effort put forward by the Continuity of Government Commission, a nonpartisan think tank, produced three reports (2003, 2009, and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.
== Current order of succession ==
The presidential order of succession is set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, as amended. The order consists of congressional officers, followed by the members of the cabinet in the order of the establishment of each department, provided that each officer satisfies the constitutional requirements for serving as president. In the table below, the absence of a number in the first column indicates that the office is either vacant, or that the incumbent is ineligible.

== Constitutional provisions ==

=== Presidential eligibility ===
Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: One must be a natural-born citizen of the United States (or a citizen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, in 1788), be at least 35 years of age and have been a resident in the United States for at least fourteen years.

=== Presidential succession ===

The presidential line of succession is mentioned in four places in the Constitution:

* Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the vice president first in the line of succession and allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which neither the president nor vice president can serve.
* The 12th Amendment provided that the vice president would also fill any vacancy of the presidency arising from failure of the House of Representatives to choose a president in a contingent election.
* The 20th Amendment, Section 3, supersedes the above 12th Amendment provision, by declaring that if the president-elect dies before his term begins, the vice president-elect becomes president on Inauguration Day and serves for the full term to which the president-elect was elected, and also that, if on Inauguration Day, a president has not been chosen or the president-elect does not qualify for the presidency, the vice president-elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the president-elect qualifies. It also authorizes Congress to provide for instances in which neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect have qualified.
* The 25th Amendment, Section 1, clarifies Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, by stating unequivocally that the vice president is the direct successor of the president, and becomes president if the incumbent dies, resigns or is removed from office. It also, in sections 3 and 4, provides for situations where the president is temporarily disabled, such as if the president has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit, establishing procedures whereby the vice president can become acting president. Additionally, in Section 2, the amendment provides a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession, establishing that a vice presidential vacancy will be filled by a president&#x27;s nominee upon confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of Congress. Previously, whenever a vice president had succeeded to the presidency or had died or resigned from office, the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began; there were 16 such vacancies prior to 1967.

== Succession acts ==
===Act of 1792===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 () provided for succession after the president and vice president: first, the president pro tempore of the Senate, followed by the speaker of the House. The statute provided that the presidential successor would serve in an acting capacity, holding office only until a new president could be elected. A special election was to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies occurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October, in which case the election would occur the following year; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term, in which case the next election would take place as regularly scheduled). The persons elected president and vice president in such a special election would have served a full four-year term beginning on March 4 of the next year. No such election ever took place.

Various framers of the Constitution, such as James Madison, criticized the arrangement as being contrary to their intent. The decision to build the line of succession around those two officials was made after a long and contentious debate. In addition to the president pro tempore and the speaker, both the secretary of state and the chief justice of the Supreme Court were also suggested. Including the secretary of state was unacceptable to most Federalists, who did not want the then secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson, who had become the leader of the opposition Democratic-Republicans, to follow the vice president in the succession, and many objected to including the chief justice due to separation of powers concerns.

===Act of 1886===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1886 () established succession to include the members of the President&#x27;s cabinet in the order of the establishment of the various departments, beginning with the Secretary of State, and stipulated that any official discharging the powers and duties of the presidency must possess the constitutional qualifications to hold the office. The president pro tempore and Speaker were excluded from the new line, and the provision mandating a special presidential election when a double vacancy arose was also dropped.

The need for increasing the number of presidential successors was abundantly clear to Congress, for twice within the span of just over four years it happened that there was no one in the presidential line of succession. In September 1881, when Chester A. Arthur succeeded to the presidency following James A. Garfield&#x27;s death, there was no vice president, no president pro tempore of the Senate, and no Speaker of the House of Representatives. Then, in November 1885, Grover Cleveland faced a similar situation, following the death of Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks, as the Senate and the House had not convened yet to elect new officers.

=== Act of 1947 ===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (), which was signed into law on July 18, 1947, restored the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate to the line of succession—but in reverse-order from their 1792 positions—and placed them ahead of the members of the Cabinet, positioned, as before, in the order of the establishment of their department.

Placing the speaker and the president pro tempore (both elected officials) back in the succession and placing them ahead of cabinet members (all of whom are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate), was Harry S. Truman&#x27;s idea. Personally conveyed to Congress in June 1945, two months after becoming president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s death, the proposal reflected Truman&#x27;s belief that the president should not have the power to appoint to office &quot;the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act&quot;, and that the presidency should, whenever possible, &quot;be filled by an elective officer.&quot;

===Further amendments===
The 1947 act has been modified several times, with changes being made as the face of the federal bureaucracy has changed over the ensuing years. Its most recent change came about in 2006, when the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act added the secretary of homeland security to the presidential line of succession.

== Ambiguities regarding succession and inability ==

Although the Presidential Succession Clause in Article II of the Constitution clearly provided for the vice president to take over the &quot;powers and duties&quot; of the presidency in the event of a president&#x27;s removal, death, resignation, or inability, left unclear was whether the vice president became president of the United States or simply temporarily acted as president in a case of succession. Some historians, including Edward Corwin and John D. Feerick, have argued that the framers&#x27; intention was that the vice president would remain vice president while executing the powers and duties of the presidency until a new president could be elected.

The hypothetical debate about whether the office or merely the powers of the office devolve upon a vice president who succeeds to the presidency between elections became an urgent constitutional issue in 1841, when President William Henry Harrison died in office. Vice President John Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to carry out the full powers and duties of the presidency, asserting he was the president and not merely a temporary acting president, by taking the presidential oath of office.

Many around him—including John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and other members of Congress, along with Whig party leaders, and even Tyler&#x27;s own cabinet—believed that he was only acting as president and did not have the office itself. He was nicknamed &quot;His Accidency&quot; and excoriated as a usurper. Nonetheless, Tyler adhered to his position, even returning, unopened, mail addressed to the &quot;Acting President of the United States&quot; sent by his detractors. Tyler&#x27;s view ultimately prevailed when the House and Senate voted to accept the title &quot;President&quot;, setting a precedent for an orderly transfer of presidential power following a president&#x27;s death, one that was subsequently written into the Constitution as section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

Even after the precedent regarding presidential succession due to the president&#x27;s death was set, the part of the Presidential Succession Clause that provided for replacing a disabled president remained unclear. What constituted an &quot;inability&quot;? Who determined the existence of an inability? Did a vice president become president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability; or was the vice president merely &quot;acting as President&quot;? Due to this lack of clarity, later vice presidents were hesitant to assert any role in cases of presidential inability. Two situations are noteworthy:

* On July 2, 1881, President James A. Garfield was shot; hit from behind by two bullets (one grazing his arm and the other lodging in his back). The president wavered between life and death for 80 days after the shooting; it was the first time that the nation as a whole experienced the uncertainties associated with a prolonged period of presidential inability. Most disconcerting, especially for Garfield administration personnel and members of Congress, was the lack of constitutional guidance on how to handle the situation. No one was sure who, if anyone, should exercise presidential authority while the president was disabled; many urged Vice President Chester A. Arthur to step up, but he declined, fearful of being labeled a usurper. Aware that he was in a delicate position and that his every action was placed under scrutiny, Arthur remained secluded in his New York City home for most of the summer. Members of the Garfield Cabinet conferred daily with the president&#x27;s doctors and kept the vice president informed of significant developments on the president&#x27;s condition.
* In October 1919, President Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke. Nearly blind and partially paralyzed, he spent the final 17 months of his presidency sequestered in the White House. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, the cabinet, and the nation were kept in the dark over the severity of the president&#x27;s illness for several months. Marshall was pointedly afraid to ask about Wilson&#x27;s health, or to preside over cabinet meetings, fearful that he would be accused of &quot;longing for his place&quot;. Though members of both parties in Congress pledged to support him if he asserted his claim to the presidential powers and duties, Marshall declined to act, or to do anything that might seem ambitious or disloyal to Wilson. At a time when the fight over joining the League of Nations was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were demanding action, the operations of the executive branch were once more hampered due to the fact that there was no constitutional basis for declaring that the president was unable to function.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in September 1955, he and Vice President Richard Nixon developed an informal plan authorizing Nixon to assume some administrative duties during Eisenhower&#x27;s recovery. Although it did not have the force of law, the plan helped to reassure the nation. The agreement also contained a provision whereby Eisenhower could declare his own inability and, if unable to do so, empowered Nixon, with appropriate consultation, to make the decision. Had it been invoked, Nixon would have served as acting president until the president issued a declaration of his recovery. Moved forward as a consequence of President Kennedy&#x27;s November 1963 assassination, this informal plan evolved into constitutional procedure a decade later through Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which resolved the uncertainties surrounding presidential disability.

== Presidential succession by vice presidents ==

Nine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency intra-term, eight due to the president&#x27;s death, and one due to the president&#x27;s resignation from office.
Additionally, three vice presidents have temporarily assumed the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president, as authorized by Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment: George H. W. Bush did so once, on July 13, 1985; Dick Cheney did so twice, on June 29, 2002 and again on July 21, 2007; and Kamala Harris did so once, on November 19, 2021.

== Presidential succession beyond the vice president ==

While several vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president, and a number of them have died or resigned, the offices of president and vice president have never been simultaneously vacant; thus no other officer in the presidential line of succession has ever been called upon to act as president. There was potential for such a &quot;double vacancy&quot; when John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, as Vice President Andrew Johnson was also targeted (along with Secretary of State William Seward and possibly General Ulysses S. Grant) as part of Booth&#x27;s plot to destabilize the Union government. It again became a real possibility three years later, when, with the vice presidency vacant, Johnson as president was impeached by the House of Representatives and faced removal from office if convicted at trial in the Senate. Johnson was acquitted by a one-vote margin.

The 25th Amendment&#x27;s mechanism for filling vice presidential vacancies has reduced the likelihood that the House speaker, Senate president pro tempore, or any cabinet member will need to serve as acting president. In October 1973, the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew made House Speaker Carl Albert first in line to succeed President Richard Nixonbut only briefly, as Gerald Ford was sworn in as vice president on December 6, 1973. On August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned the presidency, making Ford president; Albert was then again next in line, but only for the four months it took for Nelson Rockefeller to be nominated and confirmed as Ford&#x27;s vice president.

===Next in line===
Since 1789 there have been eighteen instances of the vice presidency becoming vacant; during those periods, the persons next in line to serve as acting president were:

====Under the 1792 succession act====
====Under the 1886 succession act====
====Under the 1947 succession act====
== Contemporary issues and concerns ==

In 2003, the Continuity of Government Commission suggested that the succession law has &quot;at least seven significant issues ... that warrant attention&quot;, specifically:

# The reality that all figures in the line of succession work and reside in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. In the event of a disaster such as a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated. For this concern, one of the listed people is selected as &quot;designated survivor&quot; and stays at an undisclosed secure location during certain events where all others are present, such as the State of the Union address.
# Doubt that the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate are constitutionally eligible to act as president.
# A concern about the wisdom of including the president pro tempore in the line of succession as the &quot;largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest-serving senator of the majority party&quot;. For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the president pro tempore was then-98-year-old Strom Thurmond.
# A concern that the line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the president, speaker, and the president pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.
# A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as secretary.
# The fact that, should a Cabinet member begin to act as president, the law allows the House to elect a new speaker (or the Senate to elect a new president pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.
# The absence of a provision where a president is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the president and killed the vice president).

In 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission commented on the use of the term &quot;Officer&quot; in the 1947 statute,
 
In 2016–2017, the Second Fordham University School of Law Clinic on Presidential Succession developed a series of proposals to &quot;resolve succession issues that have received little attention from scholars and commissions&quot; over the past several decades; its recommendations included:

* Removing legislators and several Cabinet members from the line of succession and adding four officials, or &quot;Standing Successors&quot;, outside of Washington, D.C. The line of succession would be: Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of the Treasury, Standing Standing Standing and Standing 
* If legislators are not removed from the line of succession, only designate them as successors in cases where the president dies or resigns, not where he is disabled (to protect legislators from being forced to resign to act as president temporarily) or removed from office;
* Eliminate the &quot;bumping provision&quot; in the Succession Act of 1947;
* Clarify the ambiguity in the Succession Act of 1947 as to whether acting Cabinet secretaries are in the line of succession;
* That the outgoing president nominate and the Senate confirm some of the incoming president&#x27;s Cabinet secretaries prior to Inauguration Day, which is a particular point of vulnerability for the line of succession;
* Establish statutory procedures for declaring 1) a dual inability of the president and the vice president, including where there is no vice president and 2) a sole inability of the vice president.

<text>Capitol Records, LLC (known legally as Capitol Records, Inc. until 2007), and simply known as Capitol, is an American record label owned by Universal Music Group through its Capitol Music Group imprint. It was founded as the first West Coast-based record label of note in the United States in 1942 by Johnny Mercer, Buddy DeSylva, and Glenn E. Wallichs. Capitol was acquired by British music conglomerate EMI as its North American subsidiary in 1955. EMI was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2012, and was merged with the company a year later, making Capitol and the Capitol Music Group both distributed by UMG. The label&#x27;s circular headquarters building is a recognized landmark of Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.

Capitol is known as the record label of the Beach Boys and The Kingston Trio, and as the U.S. label of the Beatles (their native label being Parlophone), especially during the years of Beatlemania in the U.S. from 1964 to 1967. Capitol Records artist roster also includes Katy Perry, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Troye Sivan, Kodak Black, Doechii, 50 Cent, Yeat, That Mexican OT, Young Miko, Maggie Rogers, Lewis Capaldi, Niall Horan, Kings of Leon, Paul McCartney, Bee Gees, Royel Otis, and Meovv.

== History ==
===Founding===
Songwriter Johnny Mercer founded Capitol Records in 1942 with financial help from songwriter and film producer Buddy DeSylva and the business acumen of Glenn Wallichs, owner of Wallichs Music City. Mercer raised the idea of starting a record company while golfing with Harold Arlen and Bobby Sherwood and with Wallichs at Wallichs&#x27;s record store. On February 2, 1942, Mercer and Wallichs met DeSylva at a restaurant in Hollywood to talk about investment by Paramount Pictures.

On March 27, 1942, the three men incorporated as Liberty Records (not affiliated with Capitol&#x27;s future sister label Liberty Records). In May, the application was amended to change the label&#x27;s name to Capitol Records.

On April 6, 1942, Mercer supervised Capitol&#x27;s first recording session where Martha Tilton recorded the song &quot;Moon Dreams&quot;. On May 5, Bobby Sherwood and his orchestra recorded two tracks in the studio. On May 21, Freddie Slack and his orchestra recorded three tracks in the studio: one with the orchestra, one with Ella Mae Morse called &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie&quot; and &quot;Air-Minded Executive&quot; supervised by Mercer. On June 4, Capitol opened its first office in a second-floor room south of Sunset Boulevard. On that same day, Wallichs presented the company&#x27;s first free record to Los Angeles disc jockey Peter Potter. On June 5, Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra recorded four songs at the studio. On June 12, the orchestra recorded five more songs in the studio, including &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot; with Billie Holiday. On June 11, Tex Ritter recorded &quot;(I Got Spurs That) Jingle Jangle Jingle&quot; and &quot;Goodbye My Little Cherokee&quot; for his first Capitol recording session, and the songs comprised Capitol&#x27;s 110th produced record.

The earliest recording artists included co-owner Mercer, Johnnie Johnston, Morse, Jo Stafford, the Pied Pipers, Tex Ritter, Tilton, Paul Weston, Whiteman, and Margaret Whiting. Capitol&#x27;s first gold single was Morse&#x27;s &quot;Cow Cow Boogie&quot; in 1942.

Capitol&#x27;s first album was &quot;Capitol Presents Songs by Johnny Mercer&quot;, a three disc set with recordings by Mercer, Stafford and the Pied Pipers, all with Weston&#x27;s orchestra.

Capitol was the first major west coast label to compete with major labels on the east coast such as RCA Victor, Columbia, and Decca. In addition to its Los Angeles recording studios, Capitol owned a second studio in New York City and occasionally sent mobile recording equipment to other cities.

===Other genres===
In 1946, writer-producer Alan W. Livingston created Bozo the Clown for the company&#x27;s children&#x27;s record library, with Pinto Colvig (the voice of Goofy in Walt Disney cartoons) as Bozo. Mel Blanc reprised his own cartoon roles including Bugs Bunny and other Looney Tunes characters, as well as Woody Woodpecker, while several Disney records were narrated by radio announcer Don Wilson. Examples of notable Capitol albums for children during that era are &quot;Sparky&#x27;s Magic Piano&quot; and &quot;Rusty in Orchestraville&quot;. Capitol also developed a noted jazz catalog that included the Capitol Jazz Men and issued the Miles Davis&#x27;s album &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;.

Capitol released a few classical albums in the 1940s, some of which contained handsome heavily embossed, leather-like covers. These recordings appeared on the 78 rpm format and were subsequently reissued on the new LP format in 1949. Among the recordings: Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos&#x27; &quot;Choros No. 10&quot;, with contributions from a Los Angeles choral group and the Janssen Symphony Orchestra (1940–1952), conducted by Werner Janssen; &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot; by Russian composer Reinhold Moritzovich Glière; and César Franck&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in D minor&quot;, with Willem Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

In 1949, Capitol opened a branch office in Canada and purchased KHJ Studios on Melrose Avenue adjacent to Paramount in Hollywood.

By the 1950s, Capitol had become a huge label that concentrated primarily on popular music. 

Capitol began recording rock and roll acts such as The Jodimars and Gene Vincent. There were comedy records by Stan Freberg, Johnny Standley, and Mickey Katz. On August 2, 1952, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine contained a chronicle of the label&#x27;s first ten years in business.

===Ownership under EMI===

In 1955, the British record company EMI (which evolved into Universal Music Group) purchased Capitol Records, ending the 55-year mutual distribution agreement between EMI and RCA Victor in the Western Hemisphere in 1957. EMI acquired 96% of Capitol&#x27;s stock for $8.5 million. EMI built a studio at Hollywood and Vine to match its state-of-the-art Abbey Road Studios in London.

In the 1950s, Decca Records broke its distribution contract with Panart, the first independent Cuban record company. This provided an opening for Capitol, which then contracted with Panart to have Capitol and Odeon records distributed in Cuba. In turn, Capitol distributed Panart records in the United States, growing the export percentage of Panart records from 20 percent to 50 percent. This was a coup for Capitol, as RCA Victor up to this point had huge predominance in the United States distribution of Cuban music recordings.

In 1957, EMI&#x27;s classical label Angel was merged into Capitol. Some classical recordings were issued in high fidelity and stereophonic sound. These included William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski with various orchestras (including the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra) and Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as light classical albums by Carmen Dragon and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and albums of film music conducted by Hollywood composers such as Alfred Newman.

In the realm of &quot;Sweet Jazz&quot; big-band music, Capitol also joined forces with the bandleader Guy Lombardo starting in the mid 1950s to issue a series of approximately thirty recordings until the late 1960s.

The Capitol of the World series introduced in 1956 and active into the 1970s encompassed &quot;German Beer Drinking Songs&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon in Rome&quot;, &quot;Australian Aboriginals&quot;, and &quot;Kasongo! Modern Music of the Belgian Congo&quot;. Many were produced by Dave Dexter Jr. This series contained over 400 albums. It was also in this period that Capitol issued Christmas music recordings from various countries outside the United States. In the 1960s Capitol established subsidiary labels including Tower Records. Capitol was the US distributor of the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records.

In October 1979, EMI merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to form Thorn EMI and, due to business models increasingly diverging, on August 16, 1996, Thorn EMI&#x27;s shareholders voted to demerge. The resulting media company was then known as the EMI Group. In June 1997, Capitol, together with Virgin Records, absorbed EMI USA, which folded.

===Distribution under Universal Music Group===
In 2012, the recorded music operations of EMI were sold to the Universal Music Group and the world headquarters were re-established in the Capitol Tower in Hollywood as part of the subsequent reorganization of the Capitol Music Group. Steve Barnett, previously an employee of Columbia, was hired as chairman and CEO of the division.

Capitol filed a lawsuit against Vimeo, an online video-sharing website, for audio copyright infringement. Capitol filed the claim after users were visibly lip-synching to some of their tracks.

Following legal action by Capitol against the ReDigi.com online company in April 2013, the latter was found to have violated copyright law. Capitol Records claimed that ReDigi was guilty of copyright infringement due to a business model that facilitated the creation of additional copies of Capitol&#x27;s digital music files, whereby users could upload the files for downloading or streaming to the new purchaser of the file. ReDigi argued that the resale of MP3/digital music files is permitted under certain doctrines (&quot;fair use&quot; and &quot;first sale&quot;) but the court maintained that the doctrines&#x27; application &quot;was limited to material items that the copyright owner put into the stream of commerce.&quot;

In 2014, PGH Live Music joined the team and Katy Perry founded the record label Metamorphosis Music, starting a label venture with Capitol. The name of the label was later changed to Unsub Records in 2016.

Also that year, Capitol rose to number two market share and won four categories at the Grammy Awards for music by Beck and Sam Smith.

In 2018, Capitol&#x27;s electronic division Astralwerks relaunched with a new team and moved its entire operations to Capitol&#x27;s tower in Los Angeles.

In 2019, Jeff Vaughn was named President of Capitol Records, assuming his position as of January 1, 2020.

In 2021, Michelle Jubelirer was named the Chair &amp; CEO of Capitol.

In 2024, Capitol Records became part of UMG&#x27;s Interscope Capitol Labels Group.

==Headquarters==
Designed by Welton Becket with Louis Naidorf, a young architect from Becket&#x27;s office, serving as project designer the thirteen-story, earthquake-resistant Capitol Records Tower was the world&#x27;s first circular office building and it is the base for several recording studios. Although not intended as a tribute to record players, its wide curved awnings and tall narrow tower mimic the appearance of a stack of gramophone records atop a phonograph. The building was commissioned by EMI after its acquisition of Capitol Records in 1955 and was completed in April 1956. The building is north of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine and is the center of the company&#x27;s consolidated West Coast operations. It was nicknamed &quot;The House That Nat Built&quot; after the financial success of Capitol singer Nat King Cole. The rectangular ground floor is a separate structure joined to the tower after it was completed.

In September 2006, EMI announced that it had sold the tower and adjacent properties for $50 million to New York-based developer Argent Ventures. In mid-2008, a controversy erupted over a plan to build a condominium complex next door, igniting fears that the building&#x27;s acoustic properties, specifically its underground echo chambers, would be compromised. It was announced in November 2012 that Steve Barnett would become chairman and CEO of Capitol Music Group and would be based at the Capitol Records Building. Capitol and artist Richard Wyatt Jr. restored his Hollywood Jazz Mural on the south wall of the Capitol Records Building.

==Studios==

Capitol&#x27;s recording studios were designed to minimize noise and vibration, then newly important goals in the high-fidelity sound era. An inner wall floating on layers of rubber and cork was erected inside the building&#x27;s concrete exterior walls, leaving a one-inch air gap to provide complete sound isolation. The facility also features subterranean echo chambers that allow engineers to add reverberation during the recording process. Eight trapezoidal chambers are located underground, with 10-inch concrete walls and concrete ceilings. Speakers on one side and microphones on the other permit an echo effect of up to five seconds. Studios A and B can be combined for the recording of orchestral music and symphonic film soundtracks. The first album recorded in the tower was &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color&quot;.

== International operations ==
Capitol modified albums that were originally released in other countries on other labels. Albums released in the United States contained fewer tracks, usually no more than 11 or 12, compared to albums released in the United Kingdom due to differences in the method of publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries. Also, in the American market it was expected that albums would include the current hit single, whereas British albums typically did not duplicate songs released as singles.

=== The Beatles ===
Possibly the best-known treatment of an international artist&#x27;s recordings was the label&#x27;s release pattern for various albums by the Beatles. This began with Capitol&#x27;s release of &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, the first album by the band to be released by Capitol in the United States. It was based on the British album &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, which contained 14 tracks and a running time of around 35 minutes. Capitol removed five tracks (&quot;Money&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot;, &quot;Please Mister Postman&quot;, and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;) and added both sides of the band&#x27;s first American hit single (&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; c/w &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;) and the British single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;This Boy&quot;. &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was on the Beatles&#x27; first British album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. This resulted in Capitol releasing &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot; as a 12-track album with a duration of around 30 minutes and made it comparable with other American pop albums. It also provided Capitol with unreleased tracks for use in later US Beatles albums such as &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album.&quot;

Capitol also issued &quot;duophonic&quot; stereo releases of some recordings where the original master was monophonic. Capitol engineers split the single master mono track into two, boosted the bass on the right channel, boosted treble on the left channel and added a split-second delay between channels to produce a &quot;stereo&quot; release. This duophonic process meant that the Beatles&#x27; American fans occasionally heard a slightly different song from that heard by the rest of the world if they listened to the stereo version.

This trend in the Beatles&#x27; American discography continued until 1967 when a new recording contract with EMI was signed. Unhappy with the way Capitol in the US and other companies around the world were issuing their work in almost unrecognizable forms, beginning in 1967 the Beatles gained full approval of album titles and cover art, track listing and running order in North America. Starting with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Beatles&#x27; albums were released unmodified. The issue of 45 RPM singles featuring album tracks was also stopped. Instead, non-album tracks were issued as singles between album releases.

=== United Kingdom ===
Beginning in 1948, Capitol Records were released in the UK on the Capitol label by Decca. After its 1955 acquisition of Capitol, EMI took over distribution in 1956. EMI&#x27;s Parlophone unit handled Capitol label marketing in the UK in later years.

In 2012, EMI was sold to Universal Music Group. Universal Music started Capitol as an autonomous label in the UK with the rights to the Beatles&#x27; catalog. This marks the first time that Capitol in the UK operated as an autonomous label.

=== Canada ===
Capitol Records of Canada was established in 1949 by businessman W. Lockwood Miller. Capitol broke with Miller&#x27;s company and formed Capitol Record Distributors of Canada Limited in 1954. EMI acquired this company when it acquired Capitol. The company was renamed Capitol Records of Canada Ltd. in 1958 after Miller&#x27;s rights to the name expired. In 1959, Capitol of Canada picked up distribution rights for EMI&#x27;s labels Angel, Pathé, Odeon, and Parlophone.

In 1957, Paul White joined Capitol of Canada and in 1960 established an A&amp;R department independent of the American company to promote talent for the Canadian market. The division found native talent such as Anne Murray and EMI musicians from other countries. Beginning in 1962, Capitol of Canada issued albums by British musicians such as Cliff Richard, Helen Shapiro and Frank Ifield. They accepted the Beatles long before the American company. By 1967, they were distributing non-EMI labels such as 20th Century Fox, Buena Vista Records, Disneyland, and Pickwick. The company was renamed Capitol Records-EMI of Canada in 1974, before the EMI Music Canada name was adopted in 1993. EMI Music Canada was absorbed into Universal Music Canada in 2012. In 2016, Universal Music Canada donated the EMI Music Canada archives to the University of Calgary.

===Other countries===
Capitol Latin focuses on Latin music artists in Latin America and the United States. It was founded in 1989 as EMI Latin and was renamed to Capitol Latin in 2009. Capitol Latin was merged with Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2013.

Capitol Records of Mexico was founded in 1965 as the Mexican division of Capitol. EMI later renamed the label EMI Capitol of Mexico until it later became simply EMI&#x27;s local company, EMI Music Mexico. Since 2012, after Universal Music Group purchased EMI, the Mexican EMI brand, music catalog and office are owned by Universal Music México.

Capitol Music Germany was founded by EMI Music Germany and inherited most of EMI&#x27;s German artists catalog. In 2013, Capitol Germany was acquired by Universal and merged with UMG&#x27;s Vertigo Berlin domestic division. The new label is called &quot;Vertigo/Capitol&quot;.

Capitol Music Group Sweden was relaunched in 2015 after UMG rebranded the Lionheart Music Group label. It originally existed as a division of EMI Music Sweden during the 1990s and mid-2000s. EMI&#x27;s Swedish offices were included in the Parlophone Label Group sale and were acquired by Warner Music Group, which owns the Capitol Sweden&#x27;s back catalog.

In France, Capitol Label Services (formerly Capitol Music France) exists as a division of Universal Music France, and bears the 1970s Capitol &quot;C&quot; logo.

<doc id="174653" wikidata="Q12221140" url="?curid=174653" title="Parallel universes in fiction">
<text>A parallel universe, also known as an alternative universe, parallel world, parallel dimension, alternative reality, or alternative dimension, is a hypothetical universe co-existing with one&#x27;s own, typically distinct in some way. The sum of all potential parallel universes that constitute reality is often called the &quot;multiverse&quot;. Another common term for a parallel universe is &quot;another dimension&quot;, stemming from the idea that if the 4th dimension is time, the 5th dimension—a direction at a right angle to the fourth—is a direction into any of the alternative spacetime realities.

Fiction has long borrowed an idea of &quot;another world&quot; from myth, legend and religion. Heaven, Hell, Olympus, and Valhalla are all &quot;alternative universes&quot; different from the familiar material realm. Plato reflected deeply on parallel realities, resulting in the worlds of Platonism, in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower (earthly) reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly equivalent.

One of the first science-fiction examples of a parallel universe is Murray Leinster&#x27;s short story &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;, published in 1934, which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot; analogizes time to the geographic coordinate system, with travel along latitude corresponding to time travel moving through past, present and future, and travel along longitude corresponding to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities.

In modern literature, parallel universes can serve two main purposes: to allow stories with elements that would ordinarily violate the laws of nature; and to serve as a starting point for speculative fiction, asking the question &quot;What if [event] turned out differently?&quot;. Examples of the former include Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; and C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, while examples of the latter include Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Worldwar&quot; series.

A parallel universe—or more specifically, continued interaction between a parallel universe and our own—may serve as a central plot-point, or it may simply be mentioned and quickly dismissed, having served its purpose of establishing a realm unconstrained by realism. &quot;Discworld&quot;, for example, only very rarely mentions our world or any other worlds, as Pratchett set the books in a parallel universe instead of in &quot;our&quot; reality to allow for magic on the Disc.

==Science fiction==
While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another &quot;dimension&quot; has become synonymous with the term &quot;parallel universe&quot;. The usage is particularly common in movies, television and comic books and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was popularized in comic books with the publication of &quot;The Flash&quot; No. 123, &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; in 1961.

In written science fiction, &quot;new dimension&quot; more commonly—and more accurately—refer to additional coordinate axes, beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally perceptible, the traveller can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible.
In 1884, Edwin A. Abbott wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called &quot;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions&quot;. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described &quot;Flatland&quot; as &quot;The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions&quot;.

In 1895, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H. G. Wells used time as an additional &quot;dimension&quot; in this sense, taking the four-dimensional model of classical physics and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like &quot;The Wonderful Visit&quot; and &quot;Men Like Gods&quot;, an idea proposed by the astronomer Simon Newcomb, who talked about both time and parallel universes; &quot;Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other.&quot;

There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the TARDIS console in &quot;Inferno&quot;. Douglas Adams, in the last book of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, uses the idea of probability as an extra axis in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, although according to the novel they were more a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. Robert A. Heinlein, in &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked symmetry to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Time Traveller,&quot; these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment.

===Hyperspace===
Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of &quot;hyperspace&quot; often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a faster-than-light shortcut for interstellar travel. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are:
#It is possible to enter and exit from this hyperspace with reasonable ease 
#There is reason to enter and exit hyperspace rather than travel conventionally (in most settings, &#x27;hyperspace&#x27; is considered a faster form of travel).

Sometimes &quot;hyperspace&quot; is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be &quot;crumpled&quot; in some higher spatial dimension, and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through: the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two-dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a &quot;new dimension&quot;, it is not an example of a parallel universe. It &quot;is&quot; a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See wormhole.)

While the use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a plot device and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction &quot;about&quot; parallel universes.

===Time travel===

Time travel can result in multiple universes if a time traveller can change the past. In one interpretation, alternative histories as a result of time travel are not parallel universes: while multiple parallel universes can co-exist simultaneously, only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment, as alternative history usually involves, in essence, overriding the original timeline with a new one. As a result, travel between alternative histories is not possible without reverting the timeline back to the original.

There are exceptions to the above, and an alternative history doesn&#x27;t necessarily overwrite the old one. There are no rules written in stone regarding this. Modern ideas of time travel pose the idea of branching timelines, such as the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot and &quot;&quot;. Technically, if a timeline is not explicitly stated to have been erased, it is still there.

Parallel universes as a result of time travel can serve simply as the backdrop, or it may be a central plot point. &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; by Harry Turtledove, where the Confederate Army is given thousands of AK-47 rifles and ends up winning the American Civil War, is a good example of the former, while Fritz Leiber&#x27;s novel &quot;The Big Time&quot; where a war between two alternative futures manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world is a good example of the latter.

===Multiple worlds and time travel===
Subscribing to the many-worlds interpretation of Quantum Physics, alternative histories in fiction can arise as a natural phenomenon of the universe. In these works, the idea is that each choice every person makes, each leading to a different result, both occur, so when a person decides between jam or butter on his toast, two universes are created: one where that person chose jam, and another where that person chose butter. The concept of &quot;sidewise&quot; time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster&#x27;s &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;, is used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point.

Often, worlds that are more similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be &quot;closer&quot; to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. H. Beam Piper used this concept, naming it &quot;paratime&quot; and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. Keith Laumer used the same concept of &quot;sideways&quot; time travel in his 1962 novel &quot;Worlds of the Imperium&quot;. More recently, novels such as Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;The Coming of the Quantum Cats&quot; and Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Anathem&quot; explore human-scale readings of the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation, postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows &quot;travel&quot; among alternative universes.

Universe &#x27;types&#x27; frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose Nazis won the Second World War, as in &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; by Philip K. Dick, &quot;SS-GB&quot; by Len Deighton, &quot;Fatherland&quot; by Robert Harris, and &quot;Earthside&quot; by Dennis E. Taylor, and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in &quot;Roma Eterna&quot; by Robert Silverberg, &quot;Romanitas&quot; by Sophia McDougall, and &quot;Warlords of Utopia&quot; by Lance Parkin.

===Similar concepts===
====Counter-Earth====

The concept of counter-Earth might seem similar to a parallel universe but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-Earth is a planet that shares Earth&#x27;s orbit but is on the opposite side of the Sun, and thus cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like Earth in any way, although typically in fiction it is practically identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is within our universe and the Solar System, reaching it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel.

====Convergent evolution and parallel evolution====
Convergent evolution is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories. Again, this is not a true parallel universe since such planets exist within the same universe as our own, but the stories are similar in some respects. &quot;Star Trek&quot; frequently explored such worlds, in episodes including &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, and &quot;Miri&quot;.

The 2017 episode of British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, explains the different origins of the Cybermen as parallel evolution, due to the inevitability of humans and human-like species attempting to upgrade themselves through technology; this perspective resolves continuity differences in the Cybermen&#x27;s history.

Convergent evolution may also be due to contamination. In this case, a planet may start out differently from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth&#x27;s culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way. &quot;Star Trek&quot; also frequently used this theory as well, for example, in &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; and &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;.

====Simulated reality====
Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as &quot;The Matrix&quot; or The Thirteenth Floor which can parallel ours very closely.

==Fantasy==
===Transportation of modern characters to fantasy universe===

It is common in fantasy for authors to find ways to bring a protagonist from &quot;our&quot; world to the fantasy world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within unknown, distant locations on Earth; peasants who seldom, if ever, traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an ogre or other fantastical beings could live an hour away. Characters in the author&#x27;s world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as Jonathan Swift does in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; or in the 1949 novel &quot;Silverlock&quot; by John Myers Myers, or be sucked up into a tornado and land in Oz. These &quot;lost world&quot; stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a &quot;parallel universe,&quot; as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic &quot;lost world&quot; can blur into a more explicit &quot;parallel universe&quot; when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the &quot;real&quot; world, but is much larger inside than out, as in Robert Holdstock&#x27;s novel &quot;Mythago Wood&quot;.

However, increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off. Perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, many works chose a setting that takes place in another, separate reality. As it is now not possible to reach these worlds via conventional travel, a common trope is a portal or artifact that connects our world and the fantasy world together, examples being the wardrobe in C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; or the sigil in James Branch Cabell&#x27;s &quot;The Cream of the Jest&quot;.

In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other altered state of consciousness. Examples include the &quot;Dream Cycle&quot; stories by H. P. Lovecraft or the &quot;Thomas Covenant&quot; stories of Stephen R. Donaldson. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning whether the dream-world is as real as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme in the ideas of cyberspace and virtual reality.

===Between the worlds===
In a few cases, the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on simply the fantasy world, but on ours as well. Sometimes the intent is to let them mingle and see what would happen, such as introducing a computer programmer into a high fantasy world as seen in Rick Cook&#x27;s &quot;Wizardry&quot; series, while other times an attempt to keep them from mingling becomes a major plot point, such as in Aaron Allston&#x27;s &quot;Doc Sidhe.&quot; In that story, our &quot;grim world&quot; is paralleled by a &quot;fair world&quot; where the elves live and history echoes ours, where a major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds.

===Fantasy multiverses===
The idea of a multiverse is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and superhuman protagonists. One example of an epic and far-ranging fantasy &quot;multiverse&quot; is that of Michael Moorcock, who actually named the concept in a 1963 science fiction novel &quot;The Sundered Worlds&quot;. Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, &quot;It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in &quot;New Scientist&quot; (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.&quot;

Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Champion&quot; stories go far beyond alternative history to include mythic and sword and sorcery settings as well as worlds more similar to, or the same as, our own.

The term &#x27;polycosmos&#x27; was coined as an alternative to &#x27;multiverse&#x27; by the author and editor Paul le Page Barnett (also known by the pseudonym John Grant), and is built from Greek rather than Latin morphemes. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that &quot;all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they&#x27;re playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same.&quot;

===Fictional universe as alternative universe===

There are many examples of the meta-fictional idea of having the author&#x27;s created universe (or any author&#x27;s universe) rise to the same level of &quot;reality&quot; as the universe we&#x27;re familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Men Like Gods&quot;, Myers&#x27; &quot;Silverlock&quot;, and Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;. Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp took the protagonist of the Harold Shea series through the worlds of Norse myth, Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, and the &quot;Kalevala&quot; – without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in &quot;Xanadu&quot;, a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established.

Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book&#x27;s account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Stone&quot;, taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in Rebecca Lickiss&#x27;s &quot;Eccentric Circles&quot;, an elf is grateful to Tolkien for transforming elves from dainty little creatures. These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny&#x27;s characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world.

Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. Stephen King&#x27;s seven-volume &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King&#x27;s own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only &quot;real&quot; in King&#x27;s literary universe (this can be debated as an example of breaking the fourth wall), and even travel to a world – twice – in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King&#x27;s world outside of the books. An early instance of this was in works by Gardner Fox for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does &quot;exist&quot; and it resonates into the &quot;real world&quot;. Some people in the &quot;real world&quot; pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use to write stories.

Robert Heinlein introduces an extension of his &quot;Future History&quot; series called &quot;The World as Myth&quot;. In &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, Heinlein quantizes that the many parallel, fictional universes – in terms of works of fiction. He postulates that &quot;all&quot; fictional universes are accessible by the &quot;time twister&quot; in the air vehicle named the &quot;Gay Deceiver&quot;. Heinlein also &quot;breaks the fourth wall&quot; by having both Robert and his wife Virginia visit an inter-universal science-fiction-and-fantasy convention in the book&#x27;s last chapter.

Heinlein continues this literary conceit in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own fictional universe. Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, &quot;&quot;, whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically Fundamentalist Christian Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel).

===Elfland===
Elfland, or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of elves and fairies but goblins, trolls, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore.

On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with &#x27;ordinary&#x27; land. Thomas the Rhymer might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell.

This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In Norse mythology, Elfland (Alfheim) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of Bohuslän. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the elves, showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people.

While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands – &quot;Tam Lin&quot; does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place – at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as Oisín, have found that time &quot;catches up&quot; with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands.

Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry – as in Josepha Sherman&#x27;s Prince of the Sidhe series or Esther Friesner&#x27;s &quot;Elf Defense&quot; – and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons – Hope Mirrlees&#x27;s &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot;, or Lord Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series proposes that the world of the Elves is a &quot;parasite&quot; universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as &quot;Roundworld&quot; in the novels). In the young teenage book &quot;Mist&quot; by Kathryn James, the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences.

===Isekai===
Isekai is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist&#x27;s world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them.

==Films==
The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the Land of Oz from the mundane world by filming it in Technicolor while filming the scenes set in Kansas in sepia.

In Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 Christmas classic, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, George Bailey makes a wish that he had never existed, which an angel, Clarence, asks God to grant to teach George how important his life really is; he is about to be arrested for fraud in relation to money having gone missing from the bank he runs. He gets to see what his gentle sleepy town would be like if he never lived, including the death of his brother Harry at a young age, which in turn results in many troops dying in a kamikaze attack, whom Harry would have saved if George was around to save Harry.

At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo&#x27;s &quot;It Happened Here&quot; (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone Operation Sea Lion in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by Nazi Germany. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration.

Another common use of the theme is as a prison for villains or demons. The idea is used in the first two &quot;Superman&quot; movies starring Christopher Reeve where Kryptonian villains were sentenced to the Phantom Zone from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the film &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;, where the &quot;8th dimension&quot; is essentially a &quot;phantom zone&quot; used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in horror films include the 1986 film &quot;From Beyond&quot; (based on the H. P. Lovecraft story of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive aliens from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 John Carpenter film &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as Satan, trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in Los Angeles, is actually an alien being that is the &#x27;son&#x27; of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his &quot;father&quot; by reaching in through a mirror.
In &quot;Event Horizon&quot; (1997), directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, a space ship accidentally travels to another dimension (implied to be hell), turning the crew insane and driving them to kill each other.

Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself. Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) &quot;truth&quot;, the seminal example being Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot;. Conversely, often in film noir and crime dramas, the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally – as in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; – or unintentionally – as in &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the German film &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, the short-lived British West End musical &quot;Our House&quot; and the British film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;.

More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film &quot;The Family Man&quot;, the 2001 cult film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, which deals with what it terms a &quot;tangent universe&quot; that erupts from our own universe; &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; &quot;The One&quot; (2001) starring Jet Li, in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li&#x27;s character is a police officer in one universe and a serial killer in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and &quot;&quot; (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current &quot;Star Trek&quot; films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film&#x27;s villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be rebooted without affecting the continuity of any other &quot;Star Trek&quot; film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller &quot;Source Code&quot; employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in &quot;The Cloverfield Paradox&quot;, the third installment of the franchise, accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternative universe, where the monster and the events in the first film transpired. This concept has been also been passively depicted in the view of a romantic couple in the Indian Tamil Film Irandam Ulagam.
In the 2000 film &quot;The Beach,&quot; Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character Richard, while sitting on the beach with love interest Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), describes the utopia they have found in Thailand as their own parallel universe.

Following its introduction in the film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, the multiverse became central to the Multiverse Saga series of superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, being depicted in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;, &quot;The Marvels&quot;, and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;. This series of universes overlaps or encompasses with universes depicted in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe and the animated &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; franchise. Upcoming films in the MCU that also depict the multiverse include &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The success of Marvel&#x27;s Multiverse Saga, particularly &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; in 2019, led to a noticeable rise in the popularity of multiverses and shared universes in films of the early 2020s, predominantly for superhero films but also in Hollywood more broadly. Notable examples include the aforementioned &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; franchise, 2022&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;, the DC Extended Universe film &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;. Some filmmakers and critics, including &quot;Endgame&quot; co-director Joe Russo, have expressed concern that film studios may be embracing multiverse-centric plotlines to capitalize on characters and intellectual property with pre-existing popularity, ultimately to the detriment of originality and creativity in filmmaking.

== Television ==
The idea of parallel universes has received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general science fiction or fantasy storyline.

* The 1990s TV series &quot;Sliders&quot; depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their &quot;home&quot; universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes &#x27;Honest Abe&#x27; never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low.
* One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time (outside of the Twilight Zone) was a 1970 storyline on the soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in an attempt to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841.
* A well known and often imitated example is the 1967 original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode entitled &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. The episode introduced an alternative version of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being evil twins. When the parallel universe concept is parodied, the allusion is often to this episode. An earlier episode for the &quot;Trek&quot; series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot;. A mad scientist from &quot;our&quot; universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an antimatter-comprised continuum. His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos&#x27; existence. With help from Captain Kirk, A traps B along with him in a &quot;anti&quot;-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both matter-oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the &quot;Codename: Kids Next Door&quot; episode Operation: P.O.O.L..
* The mirror universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot; was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, entitled &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, serves as a prequel, introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe.
* In the 1970s young adult British SF series &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, its second-season episode, &quot;A Rift in Time&quot; (March–April 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an alternative history where the Roman Empire developed the steam engine in the first century CE, had a technological head start, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine.
* Multiple episodes of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; use the concept. In &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat&#x27;s alternative is a dog. &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; introduces a heroic alternative Rimmer, a version of whom reappears in &quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot;. The next episode, &quot;Ouroboros&quot;, makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes.
* In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episode &quot;The Wish&quot;, Cordelia Chase inadvertently creates an alternative reality in which Buffy never moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, allowing vampires to dominate the town openly and turn her core-universe allies Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg into vampires. Later, that world&#x27;s vampire version of Willow is accidentally brought into the core world.
* The plot of the season four episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;, entitled &quot;Brain Drain&quot;, features The Source of All Evil kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters&#x27; magic.
* The &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise includes many stories in which alternative timelines, alternative dimensions and alternative realities are explored. These include the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episodes &quot;There But For the Grace of God&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot;, &quot;Crystal Skull&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Moebius&quot; parts 1 and 2, &quot;Babylon&quot;, &quot;Ripple Effect&quot;, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Mantle&quot;, &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, &quot;Unending&quot; and the direct-to-DVD movie &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episodes &quot;Before I Sleep&quot;, &quot;McKay and Mrs. Miller&quot;, &quot;The Last Man&quot;, &quot;The Daedalus Variations&quot;, &quot;Vegas&quot; and &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot;, and the &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; episodes &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Twin Destinies&quot;, &quot;Common Descent&quot; and &quot;Epilogue&quot;.
* The animated series, &quot;Futurama&quot;, had an episode where the characters travel between &quot;Universe 1&quot; and &quot;Universe A (also known as universe Γ)&quot; via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the &quot;evil&quot; ones. They also had another episode where they travel to the edge of the universe and in the distance was the cowboy universe where everyone was dressed as cowboys. It was accidentally invented by Professor Farnsworth.
* The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of déjà vu was a major plot line of the first-season finale of &quot;Fringe&quot;, guest-starring Leonard Nimoy of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently.
* In the 2010 season of &quot;Lost&quot;, the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters&#x27; original timeline. The show continued to show two &quot;sets&quot; of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths.
* In the anime and manga series of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating a timeline split of parallel realities. This event leads to the appearance of Cell, who kills the same Future Trunks after he originally returns from the past of and kills the Androids via a remote control in his own timeline. Cell does this to go to the main timeline of the series when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. Back in the same past the series follows, Future Trunks discovers the existence of the time machine Cell stole in the original future reality, leading him to make the decision to stay in past instead. This creates a parallel reality for his own future timeline where he is physically capable of killing both the Androids and Cell once he returns after the events of the Cell Saga.
** Its sequel, &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, later features 12 separate universes that are numbered from 1 to 12 and form matching pairs where each pair&#x27;s numbers add up to 13. The universe that the main characters live in is Universe 7, which is paired with Universe 6. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zeno (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a fit of rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies. Zeno eventually arranges a massive battle royal tournament between eight of the universes, in which the losing universes are destroyed.
**The spin-off series &quot;Super Dragon Ball Heroes&quot; features alternative versions of the main characters who protect the flow of time as part of the &quot;Time Patrol&quot;. They usually have the &quot;Xeno&quot; moniker in addition to their names (e.g. Goku Xeno, Vegeta Xeno, Trunks Xeno, etc.).
* The anime &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; attempted to combine all the parallel Gundam universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the metaseries into one single reality.
* The anime and manga series &quot;Eureka Seven: AO&quot; takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series&#x27; predecessor &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;. The &quot;E7&quot; series started off in the year 12005, and the &quot;AO&quot; world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters&#x27; son.
* The anime and manga series &quot;Katekyo Hitman Reborn!&quot; by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc.
* The anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark &quot;reality&quot; of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series &quot;Angelic Days&quot;.
* The anime series &quot;Bakugan&quot; features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series&#x27; hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 &amp; 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology.
* In another anime series, &quot;Digimon&quot;, there is a parallel universe called &quot;digital world&quot;. The show&#x27;s child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and become partners and friends. In the third story arc of &quot;Digimon Fusion&quot;, the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse.
* In the anime series &quot;Umineko no Naku Koro ni&quot; the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler&#x27;s dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of &quot;fragments&quot;.
* In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Parallels&quot;, Lt. Worf traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure.
* The &quot;Community&quot; episode Remedial Chaos Theory, six different timelines and one &quot;prime&quot; timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the pizza. One timeline, dubbed the &quot;Darkest Timeline&quot;, results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock&#x27;s in &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;.
* In the 2003 anime series of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories diverged, apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other.

===As an ongoing subplot===
Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot. &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; elaborated on the premise of the original series&#x27; &quot;Mirror&quot; universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise. Other examples are the science fiction series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the fantasy/horror series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and the romance/fantasy &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;.

Following the precedent set by &quot;Star Trek&quot;, these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out &quot;worse&quot; than the &quot;original&quot; universe: in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable Goa&#x27;uld onslaught; in &quot;Buffy&quot;, two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to Sunnydale too late to stop the vampires from taking control; &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot; repeatedly visits an alternative universe where Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, died when he was ten years of age, and Lois Lane is also apparently dead. Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the &quot;original&quot; Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own.

In addition to following &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; lead, showing the &quot;evil&quot; variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character&#x27;s presence.

&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they &quot;touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last&quot;. He referred to our world&#x27;s tendency to deny such things as arrogant.

In the season 1 finale of &quot;The Flash&quot;, the Reverse-Flash opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, The Flash starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Earth-1 sent by Zoom. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of Atom Smasher, Sand Demon, King Shark, and Dr. Light; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the Earth-2 Flash after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at S.T.A.R. Labs. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of Harrison Wells, arrives on Earth-1 as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes. Up until season 7, a new version of Wells was featured every season.

===Television series involving parallel universes===

There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself.

* In the South Korean Drama &quot;Dr. Jin&quot; (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history.
* &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes.
* &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions.

* &quot;Dark&quot;, where (previous) existence of an original world was revealed only in the last (third) season. Original world there was destroyed/split into two parallel ones by a genius scientist in pain, because his son&#x27;s family was lost in an accident and he desperately wanted them back alive. Each of two worlds has their own protagonists group (Sic Mundus Creatus Est vs Erit Lux) fighting for a supremacy of time travel, available in three flavours: via a local cave, swirling blob of God Particles and portable drones.

== Books ==
The &quot;Wolves Chronicles&quot; by Joan Aiken are a series of Children&#x27;s literature novels set during an alternative history where the channel tunnel was completed during the Napoleonic Wars and used by several subspecies of Canis Lupis made up of Steppe wolf, Eurasian wolf, Tundra wolf and even Mongolian wolf and Italian wolf to use it to migrate out of scarceness of food and pelt collecting to England. So in a parallel early 19th century during the reign of the fictional King James the Third the wolves have evolved to resemble the Florida black wolf and are a constant presence in the background of all these characters in the stories, particularly the child protagonists in which those particular tales focus on.

&quot;Time Echoes Trilogy&quot; by Bryan Davis addresses the idea of parallel worlds as it delves into a plot in which the main character travels between three different &quot;earths&quot; each moving at a different speed of time so one Earth is 20 years in the past while another one is 10 minutes into the future when compared to the Earth from which the character exists.

&quot;Overstrike&quot; by C. M. Angus features high-functioning schizophrenics with the ability to simultaneously perceive multiple realities.

Some later retellings of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; feature alternative versions to those characters (and locations) created by J. M. Barrie, transplanted into an alternate reality. Among these parallel Peter Pan interpretations are: &quot;Tigerheart&quot;, &quot;Shelby and the Lost Boy of Misbegot Islands&quot;, &quot;Peter Phantom: And the Curse of Nightmare Islands&quot; (and serials) &quot;Tales of the Airship Neverland&quot;, &quot;Nevermor&quot; and &quot;Everland&quot;.

==Comic books==
Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of continuity faced by the major two publishers, Marvel Comics and DC Comics. The two publishers have used the multiverse concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major serial protagonists with continuous histories lasting, as in the case of Superman, over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See &quot;Multiverse (DC Comics)&quot; and &quot;Multiverse (Marvel Comics)&quot;) DC&#x27;s &quot;Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Multiverse&quot; collected 12 issues in 1999 with an introduction by Moorcock which offered a sophisticated description of his rationale.

DC Comics inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of Golden Age superheroes the Justice Society of America now located on Earth-Two, and devised a &quot;mirror universe&quot; scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of Earth-Three shortly afterwards, several years before &quot;Star Trek&quot; devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an Axis victory in World War II, Earth-S, home to the Fawcett Comics superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as Captain Marvel, and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms.

Therefore, comic books, in general, are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major crossover storylines, such as &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, where Marvel has a series called &quot;What If...&quot; that&#x27;s devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the &quot;main&quot; universe&#x27;s continuity. DC&#x27;s version of &quot;What If...&quot; is the Elseworlds imprint.

DC Comics series &quot;52&quot; heralded the return of the Multiverse. &quot;52&quot; was a mega-crossover event tied to &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; which was the sequel to the 1980s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU. Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, DC&#x27;s imprint WildStorm and an Earth devoted to the Charlton Comics heroes of DC. &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer&quot; and the &quot;Tales of the Multiverse&quot; stories expand upon this new multiverse.

Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the X-Men books, such as 1981&#x27;s &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, and 2006&#x27;s &quot;House of M&quot; and 2014&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline involving alternative versions of Spider-Man. In addition, the Squadron Supreme is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the Avengers comic. Exiles is an offshoot of the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main Marvel Universe intact. The Marvel UK line has long had multiverse stories including the Jaspers&#x27; Warp storyline of Captain Britain&#x27;s first series (it was here that the designation Earth-616 was first applied to the mainstream Marvel Universe).

Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the Ultimate Universe. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate Fantastic Four and the Ultimates (their &quot;Avengers&quot;).

The graphic novel Watchmen is set in an alternative history, in 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as President of the United States. The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating &quot;Cold War&quot; as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent.

In 1973 Tammy published &quot;The Clock and Cluny Jones&quot;, where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in Misty annual 1985 as &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock.&quot;

In 1978 Misty published &quot;The Sentinels&quot;. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where Hitler conquered Britain in 1940.

In 1981 Jinty published &quot;Worlds Apart.&quot; Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published &quot;Land of No Tears&quot; where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned.

The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic series from Archie Comics. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another &quot;mirror universe&quot; where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a perpendicular dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds.

In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; and &quot;Sonic Rush Adventure&quot;, home to Sonic&#x27;s ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; and &quot;Sonic X&quot;. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as Sailor Moon, Godzilla, and various titles from Marvel Comics. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot;.

The various Transformers comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual Botcon fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured Cliffjumper, an Autobot from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the Decepticons are good. This universe is known as the &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release.

==Audio drama==

In The Gray Area, the seven part serial &quot;Paths Not Taken&quot; takes place in an alternative universe in which Donald Trump has won a second presidential term, gay people are criminalized and arrested, and a violent authoritarian movement known as the &quot;Thanksgiving Cleanse&quot; has swept the nation. In addition, the main universe of the series takes place in a timeline in which Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election.

* In the adventure game &quot;9: The Last Resort&quot; (1996), after resolving several mind-blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past &quot;The Tiki Guards&quot;; and a door opens up to &quot;The Void&quot; – actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space.
* &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998) features a world called &quot;Click Clock Wood&quot;, which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others.
* The first-person shooter &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; (2013) features the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The main character is named Booker Dewitt, an homage to physicist Bryce DeWitt.

* The story of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; (1999) centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Home World&quot; which is a branch created by the actions of the heroes of the game&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.
*&quot;City of Heroes&quot; (2004), a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse&#x27;s Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth.
* &quot;Crash Twinsanity&quot; (2004) features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the &quot;10th dimension&quot;, which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite, with the presence of an &quot;Evil Crash&quot;, and also planned to have &quot;Good Cortex&quot; and &quot;Evil Coco&quot;, but they were cut during development). Similarly, &quot;Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time&quot; sees Crash and a slew of other heroes traversing multiple universes to find the multiverse&#x27;s keepers of order, the Quantum Masks.
* In the psychological horror point-and-click adventure game &quot;Dark Seed&quot; (1992), the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror.

* &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994) features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness&#x27;s subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas.

*&quot;Fallout&quot; series (1997– ) takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the mission that the first men on the Moon flew in 1969 is called &quot;Valiant 11&quot;, rather than Apollo 11. This universe diverged from the players&#x27; after World War II, which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.
* The Final Fantasy series (1987– ) is implied to take place in a large multiverse, where most games exist in their own universes. Some, like Final Fantasy III (1990) and Final Fantasy V (1992), span two or more parallel worlds, though some delve further into the concept.
* In &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot; (2024), multiple alternative worlds were revealed to have been created as a result of the main cast previously defeating the Arbiter of Fate in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;. Zack Fair, the main character of &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and Aerith&#x27;s first love, survived his fated showdown with the Shinra military in an alternative timeline where the Lifestream was depleted from the Planet. Zack and an alternative Aerith each fight beside the main character Cloud Strife during the end of the game.
* &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; uses the concept of the multiverse to the fullest extent the FF series has seen. The game&#x27;s world is fractured into fourteen different &quot;shards,&quot; with a group of villains known as the Ascians wanting to rejoin them back into the original world by causing &quot;Umbral Calamities.&quot; Three different shards have been visited: the First, the Ninth, and the Thirteenth (also known as the Void). The other three that remain are the Fourth, the Eighth, and the Eleventh. The universes of other games have also been implied to canonically interact with that of FFXIV, including (2017) and Final Fantasy XI (2002).
* In &quot;Freedom Force&quot; (2002), most of the story is set in Patriot City, but a number of other locations and time periods are used, including magical realms, prehistoric times, and realms entirely removed from time and space.
*&quot;Half-Life&quot; series (1998– ) revolves heavily around alternative universes. Xen is a location in the first &quot;Half-Life&quot; game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called The Combine which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species.
*&quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; (2015) takes place in the Nexus, a strange limbo of clashing universes, which collide from across space, time, and dimensions. The Nexus exists in the center of a trans-dimensional cosmic storm, which can rip worlds and universes in and out of existence, and it can also pull worlds into stability. Some of the central realms in the Nexus are examples of these points of stability. Every Realm within the Nexus has one stone called &quot;Singularity&quot;, and only the one who achieves it through conquest can become the Realm Lord. Many powerful warriors have been sucked into the Nexus, including combatants from &quot;Warcraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Diablo&quot;, and &quot;Overwatch&quot; universes. New combatants are constantly arriving, some of them are chosen after they died in their original reality.
*&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series (2002– ) features a Disney/Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; multiverse, in which various worlds are based on Disney films or concepts from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; line. The series also introduces the concept of different &quot;Realms&quot; corresponding to Light, Darkness, and In-Between where all of the worlds take place. The upcoming &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts IV&quot; are planned to revolve around the idea that the &quot;other side&quot; of the real world is fiction, with protagonist Sora&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; world being a fiction to the people of Earth and vice versa.
*In the &quot;Kirby&quot; series, some of the most prominent locations are other dimensions in the form of Another Dimension, The Mirror World, Cyberspace, Dreamscape, and much more. The &quot;Kirby Clash&quot; series of games take place in the Dream Kingdom, in a parallel universe apart from the series&#x27; primary setting of Dream Land. These games are connected to the main series&#x27; canon through the events of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe&quot;.
*The series &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; (1996– ) is played through several realms and timelines.
* &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; (1991) features a dark and twisted parallel version of Hyrule called the &quot;Dark World&quot;. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; (1998), after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. The younger version of Link travels in search of his friend Navi, leading to the events of &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;. However, the timeline Link left remains destroyed, and Hyrule is flooded by its gods, leading to the world depicted in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; (2002). There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; takes place in Termina, a parallel world to Hyrule. Almost all of the characters from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; reappear in the game. The &quot;Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages&quot; games (2001) use a similar concept to that which is used in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. In these games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game. In the first half of &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; (2006), areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule.
* The world of the classic cult adventure games of &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; (1999) created by Ragnar Thornqast, along with its sequels, deals with the existence of two parallel universes – technological (Stark) and magical (Arcadia).
* &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023) is set in a new timeline created by Liu Kang after winning control of the Hourglass from Kronika and Shang Tsung and becoming Keeper of Time in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; and its &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion. Later in the story, it is revealed that the battle for Kronika&#x27;s Hourglass in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; had led to the creation of numerous other timelines in which other characters became Keepers of Time. Characters from these timelines appear in Liu Kang&#x27;s timeline by the game&#x27;s climax. The game&#x27;s main antagonist is Titan Shang Tsung, who hails from &quot;Aftermath&quot;’s alternative ending in which he kills Liu Kang and takes the Hourglass, and later infiltrates the surviving Liu Kang&#x27;s timeline disguised as Kronika to empower that timeline&#x27;s Shang Tsung and Quan Chi.
* &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; (2004) involves a world, &quot;Aether&quot;, having an alternative self in the, &quot;Dark&quot; realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime&#x27;s essence inside Samus&#x27;s Phazon Suit.
* In the adventure PC game &quot;Myst&quot; (1993), the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched.
* In &quot;OtherSpace&quot; (1998), a text-based science fiction MMORPG, refugees from Earth&#x27;s universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called &quot;Hiverspace&quot;, whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart. Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor.
* In the role-playing game &quot;Outcast&quot; (1999), a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an &quot;entity&quot;. Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole.
* &quot;Persona 2: Eternal Punishment&quot; (2000) takes place in an alternative universe called &quot;This Side&quot; wherein the events of &quot;Innocent Sin&quot; did not take place and the characters have never met in the past.
* &quot;Persona 4&quot; (2008) features the main cast entering an alternative dimension called the TV World, which exists as part of the Collective Unconscious in the larger &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; multiverse, to find a serial killer in the town of Inaba.
*&quot;Portal 2&quot; (2011), an action-adventure video game, features a game-mode entitled &quot;Perpetual Testing Initiative&quot; (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist &quot;Bendy&quot; through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled &quot;The Multiverse&quot;, and the PeTI&#x27;s parallel universes are different from the main &quot;Half-Life&quot;/&quot;Portal&quot; timeline.
* &quot;&quot; (2006) is set in alternative universe where Tsarist Russia never experienced the Russian Revolution but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive alien invasion from a species known as the &quot;Chimera&quot;, who then proceed to overrun Western Europe, Great Britain, Canada and much of the United States, and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951.
* In the survival horror video game series &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (1999– ), the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where &quot;Silent Hill&quot; is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the &quot;Other World&quot;.
* Sonic Rush (2005) focuses on Blaze the Cat, a visitor from another universe parallel to Sonic&#x27;s with its own version of Sonic&#x27;s nemesis, Dr. Eggman. Sonic Rush Adventure (2007) expands upon this, as Sonic and Tails end up stranded in Blaze&#x27;s home universe and must find their way home. Other games in the series, such as Sonic CD (1993) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), explore the idea of alternate timelines and the butterfly effect.
* &quot;Sudeki&quot; (2004) is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness.
* &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996) features a world called &quot;Tiny Huge Island&quot; which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world.
* &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (1988) features a &quot;Magic Potion&quot; item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access &quot;Subspace&quot;; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found.
* After the completion of the Special World in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990), the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts.
* In &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot; (2007), the town &quot;Flipside&quot; (which acts as the game&#x27;s central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called &quot;Flopside&quot;. While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters.
* In &quot;&quot; (2023), when Dr. Crygor uses his latest invention (The Time Obliterator 5.0 (similar to a stopwatch)), with his granddaughter Penny and the karaoke robot Mike, to time warp to Underarm Jungle and travel back in time to the Stone Age, and lots of creatures, dinosaurs, and mammoths to see how the painting were made by a caveman named the Caresawayan, who&#x27;s drawing the rock art.
* Both titles of the &quot;When They Cry&quot; visual novel series (&quot;Higurashi&quot; and &quot;Umineko&quot; for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has &#x27;lost&#x27;, another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved.
* The visual novel/puzzle video game series &quot;Zero Escape&quot; heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history. In this fictional universe, characters use a method of travelling between different timelines called &quot;SHIFT&quot; (short for &quot;Spacetime Human Internal Fluctuating Travel&quot;). 
* The survival video game &quot;Don&#x27;t Starve&quot; (2013) involves the many playable characters efforts to survive in a semi-nightmarish parallel world of wilderness known as the Constant, the story reveals that much of the world was once ruled by a race of sentient and technologically advanced arthropodal creatures, who destroyed themselves with the overuse of nightmare fuel, the Constant appears to change according to how afraid the characters are feeling, and is now controlled by mysterious shadow creatures that appear to those who are afraid and is also somewhat controlled by whoever is trapped on the &quot;nightmare throne&quot;.
* &quot;Agents of Mayhem&quot; is set in an alternative universe to the Saints Row series in which the Third Street Saints never forms, which leads up to Vice Kings, Los Carnales and Westside Rollerz uniting into one gang.
* In &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot; The Last Stand Update (2020), release The Last Stand map where all players case that the survivors took a different path leading to the Death Toll Finale. Instead of going to the Boathouse, players choose to go to the Lighthouse by a truck. Players must light the long-disused lighthouse and fight against a lot of infected to wait a rescue boat.

<doc id="174662" wikidata="Q202741" url="?curid=174662" title="Blondie (band)">
<text>Blondie is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1974 by the singer Debbie Harry and the guitarist Chris Stein. The band was a pioneer in the American new wave genre and scene of the mid 70s.

The band&#x27;s first two albums contained strong elements of punk and new wave. Although successful in the UK and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the US until the release of their critically acclaimed third album in 1978 &quot;Parallel Lines.&quot; Over the next two years, the band released a string of hit singles, including &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; (US No. 1), &quot;One Way or Another&quot;, &quot;Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Call Me&quot; (US No. 1), &quot;Atomic&quot;, &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; (US No. 1), and &quot;Rapture&quot; (US No. 1). The band became noted for its eclectic mixture of musical styles, incorporating elements of disco, pop, reggae, funk and early hip hop music.

Blondie disbanded after the release of their sixth studio album, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, in 1982. Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for her partner Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin. The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and their sixth number one single in the UK with &quot;Maria&quot; in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK number one single, &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;.

The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie has sold over 40 million records worldwide and continues to actively perform. The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Pollinator&quot;, was released on 2017.

==History==

===1974–1978: Early career===
Inspired by the burgeoning new music scene at the Mercer Arts Center in Manhattan, musician Chris Stein sought to join a similar band. He joined the Stilettoes in 1973 as their guitarist and formed a romantic relationship with Debbie Harry, who was one of the band&#x27;s vocalists, a former waitress and Playboy Bunny. Harry had been a member of a folk-rock band, the Wind in the Willows, in the late 1960s. In July 1974, Stein and Harry parted ways with the Stilettoes and Elda Gentile, the band&#x27;s originator, forming a new band with ex-Stilettoes bandmates Billy O&#x27;Connor (drums; born 1953, died 2015) and Fred Smith (bass). Originally billed as Angel and the Snake for two shows in August 1974, they had renamed themselves Blondie by October 1974, while Ivan Kral joined the band on guitar. The new name derived from comments made by truck drivers who catcalled &quot;Hey, Blondie&quot; to Harry as they drove past.

By the spring of 1975, O&#x27;Connor had left the music business and Smith replaced Richard Hell in Television, while Kral eventually joined the Patti Smith Group. Stein and Harry continued the band, and proceeded with auditions to recruit drummer Clem Burke and bassist Gary Valentine (Gary J. Lachman).

Blondie became regular performers at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and CBGB. In June 1975, the band&#x27;s first recording came in the way of a demo produced by Alan Betrock. To fill out their sound, they recruited keyboard player Jimmy Destri in November 1975. The band signed with Private Stock Records and released their first single &quot;X-Offender&quot; in June 1976, while their debut album, &quot;Blondie&quot;, was issued in December 1976. Neither was initially a commercial success, and the band spent the rest of the year touring with Television and visiting the UK. Blondie opened for David Bowie and Iggy Pop on the latter&#x27;s US tour in early 1977 supporting &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Blondie was invited by Bowie and Pop after the pair had heard their debut. In July 1977, Valentine decided to leave the band and form his own group, the Know; he was replaced by Frank Infante.

In September 1977, the band bought back its contract with Private Stock and signed with British label Chrysalis Records. The first album was re-released on the new label in October 1977. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s review of the debut album observed the eclectic nature of the group&#x27;s music, comparing it both to Phil Spector and to the Who, and commented that the album&#x27;s two strengths were Richard Gottehrer&#x27;s production and the persona of Debbie Harry.

The band&#x27;s first commercial success occurred in Australia in 1977, when the music television program &quot;Countdown&quot; mistakenly played their video &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, which was the B-side of the single &quot;X-Offender&quot;. Jimmy Destri later credited the show&#x27;s Molly Meldrum for their initial success, commenting that &quot;we still thank him to this day&quot; for playing the wrong song. In a 1998 interview, drummer Burke recalled seeing the episode in which the wrong song was played, but he and Stein suggested that it may have been a deliberate subterfuge on the part of Meldrum. Stein asserted that &quot;X-Offender&quot; was &quot;too crazy and aggressive [to become a hit]&quot;, while &quot;In the Flesh&quot; was &quot;not representative of any punk sensibility. Over the years, I&#x27;ve thought they probably played both things but liked one better. That&#x27;s all.&quot; In retrospect, Burke described &quot;In the Flesh&quot; as &quot;a forerunner to the power ballad&quot;.

The single reached number two in Australia, and the album entered the Australian top twenty in November 1977. A subsequent double-A release of &quot;X-Offender&quot; and &quot;Rip Her to Shreds&quot; reached number 81. A successful Australian tour followed in December 1977, though it was marred by an incident in Brisbane when disappointed fans almost rioted after Harry cancelled a performance due to illness.

In February 1978, Blondie released their second album, &quot;Plastic Letters&quot; (UK number 10, US number 78, Australia number 64). The album was recorded as a four-piece during the summer of 1977, with Stein responsible for both bass and guitars. &quot;Plastic Letters&quot; was promoted extensively throughout Europe and Asia by Chrysalis Records. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Denis&quot;, was a cover version of the Randy and the Rainbows&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;Denise&quot;. It reached number two on the British singles charts, while both the album and its second single, &quot;(I&#x27;m Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear&quot;, reached the British top ten. Chart success, along with a successful 1978 UK tour, including a gig at London&#x27;s Roundhouse, made Blondie one of the first American new wave bands to achieve mainstream success in the UK. With Infante moving to guitar, the British musician Nigel Harrison was hired as the group&#x27;s full-time bassist, expanding Blondie to a six-piece for the first time and marking a stabilization in the band&#x27;s line-up.

===1978–1981: Mainstream success===

Blondie completed the recording of their third album, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; during the summer of 1978 together with Australian producer Mike Chapman. It was released in September of that year and reached number one in the UK, number six in the US, and number two in Australia. It finally broke the band into the American market on the strength of the worldwide hit single &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; became the group&#x27;s most successful album, selling 20 million copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s first two singles were &quot;Picture This&quot; (UK number 12) and &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot; (UK number five). As the band previously had success with a cover, Chrysalis Records chose their version of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You Too&quot; as the lead single from &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; in the US. This turned out to be a miscalculation as the single failed to chart.

&quot;Heart of Glass&quot; was released in early 1979 and the disco-infused track topped the UK charts in February 1979, and the US charts in April 1979. It was a reworking of a rock and reggae-influenced song that the group had performed since its formation in the mid-1970s, updated with strong elements of disco music. Burke later said the revamped version was inspired partly by Kraftwerk and partly by the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, whose drum beat Burke tried to emulate. He and Stein gave Destri much of the credit for the final result, noting that Destri&#x27;s appreciation of technology had led him to introduce synthesizers and to rework the keyboard sections. Although some critics condemned Blondie for &quot;selling out&quot; by dabbling in disco, the song became a worldwide success and one of the biggest selling singles of 1979. As the focal point for the band, Harry began to attain a celebrity status that set her apart from the other band members. She also embarked on an acting career and appeared in the film &quot;The Foreigner&quot; directed by Amos Poe.

Blondie&#x27;s next single in the US was a more aggressive rock song, &quot;One Way or Another&quot; (US number 24), though in the UK, an alternate single choice, &quot;Sunday Girl&quot;, became a number one hit. &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; has been ranked number 140 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of 500 greatest albums of all time. In June 1979, Blondie, photographed by Annie Leibovitz, was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. In the summer of 1979, the band returned to the studio with Chapman to record their next album.

Blondie&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; (UK number one, US number seventeen, Australia number nine), also produced by Chapman, was released in September 1979. Although well received by critics as a suitable follow-up to &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;, the album and its singles failed to achieve the same level of success in the US. In the UK, the album delivered three top 20 hits, including the band&#x27;s third UK number one (&quot;Atomic&quot;, UK number one, US number thirty-nine). The lead track off the album, &quot;Dreaming&quot; featuring Ellie Greenwich, reached number two in the UK. But it only made it to number 27 in the US. The second single &quot;Union City Blue&quot; (UK number 13) shared the title of a film featuring Harry, directed by Marcus Reichert. Along with the inspiration from the film, &quot;Union City Blue&quot;&#x27;s lyrics derived from her living in Union City, New Jersey. She worked various jobs across the Hudson River from Manhattan, noting the scenic skyline and passion she embraced while living there, before giving birth to Blondie. The single was not released in the US in favor of the track &quot;The Hardest Part&quot;. Chrysalis Records&#x27; Linda Carhart asked Jon Roseman Productions US division to shoot videos for every song and create the first ever video album. David Mallet directed and Paul Flattery produced it at various locations and studios in and around New York. It was nominated for a Grammy, the first year the Recording Academy instituted an award for music videos. At the end of the year, the show filmed at the Apollo theatre in Glasgow was broadcast by the BBC on the Old Grey Whistle Test. In March 1980, &quot;Atomic&quot; reached number one in the UK and the album was certified gold the following month.

Blondie&#x27;s next single, the Grammy-nominated &quot;Call Me&quot;, was the result of Debbie Harry&#x27;s collaboration with the Italian songwriter and producer Giorgio Moroder, who had been responsible for many of Donna Summer&#x27;s biggest hits. The track was recorded as the title theme of the Richard Gere film &quot;American Gigolo&quot;. Released in the US in February 1980, &quot;Call Me&quot; spent six consecutive weeks at number one in the US and Canada. Released in the UK in April 1980, it reached number one and became a global hit. The single was also number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1980 year-end chart. In the summer of 1980, the band appeared in a bit part in the film &quot;Roadie&quot; starring Meat Loaf. Blondie performed the Johnny Cash song &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, and the live recording was featured on the film soundtrack and on a later CD reissue of the &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; album.

In November 1980, Blondie&#x27;s fifth studio album and third with Chapman, &quot;Autoamerican&quot; (UK number three, US number seven, Australia number eight), was released. &quot;Autoamerican&quot; contained two more US number one hits: the reggae-styled &quot;The Tide Is High&quot;, a cover version of a 1967 song written by John Holt of the Paragons, and the rap-flavored &quot;Rapture&quot;, which was the first song featuring rapping to reach number one in the US. In the song, Harry mentions the hip hop and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy who also appears in the video for the song. &quot;Autoamerican&quot; featured a far wider stylistic range than previous Blondie albums, including the avant-garde instrumental &quot;Europa&quot;, the acoustic jazz of &quot;Faces&quot;, and &quot;Follow Me&quot; (from the Broadway show &quot;Camelot&quot;). The album went on to achieve platinum success in both the US and the UK.

Blondie took a break for most of 1981. Debbie Harry appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in February 1981 as both the guest host-actor and as a singer, with Stein and Burke backing her during musical performances. Harry and Destri both released solo albums. Stein worked on Harry&#x27;s album &quot;KooKoo&quot; (UK number six, US number twenty-eight) produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. He also joined Burke on Destri&#x27;s album &quot;Heart on a Wall&quot;. Burke also played drums on the Eurythmics&#x27; debut album &quot;In The Garden&quot;. Harry, Stein and Destri also worked together on music for the 1981 John Waters film &quot;Polyester&quot;. In October 1981, Chrysalis Records released &quot;The Best of Blondie&quot; (UK number four, US number thirty, Australia number one), the group&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation.

===1982: &quot;The Hunter&quot; and breakup===

The band reconvened in December 1981 to record a new album, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, released in May 1982 (UK number nine, US number thirty-three, Australia number fifteen). Infante was initially not included in the new album due to friction with other group members, but began legal proceedings and was later reinstated after an out-of-court settlement. In contrast to their earlier commercial and critical successes, &quot;The Hunter&quot; was poorly received. The album did have two moderate hit singles: &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; (UK number 11, US number 37, Australia number 13) and &quot;War Child&quot; (UK number 39). The album also included &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, a track the band had been commissioned to write and record for the 1981 James Bond film of the same name; however, it was rejected by the film&#x27;s producers who ultimately chose another song with the same title recorded by Sheena Easton.

In June 1982, Harry contributed backing vocals to the Gun Club&#x27;s second album, &quot;Miami&quot;, being credited as &quot;D.H. Lawrence Jr&quot;. Stein produced the record, and is credited as &quot;bongos&quot; and &quot;cover photos/design&quot;. The Gun Club&#x27;s singer Jeffrey Lee Pierce was a fan, emulating Harry&#x27;s hairstyle and founding the West Coast Blondie Fan Club, before becoming friends with the band in New York.

For the brief North American tour (July to August 1982) to promote the &quot;Hunter&quot; album, guitarist Infante was replaced with session musician Eddie Martinez. Also added to the live lineup were second keyboardist Abel Domingues and a three-man horn section comprising Douglas Harris, Joseph Kohanski, and Arthur Pugh. A UK and European tour was cancelled due to poor ticket sales.

In November 1982, the band publicly announced that they had disbanded. In 1983, Stein was diagnosed with the life-threatening illness pemphigus, and Harry cared for him.
Harry embarked on solo career in the mid-1980s, including two singles—the 1983 track &quot;Rush Rush&quot; from the film &quot;Scarface&quot;, and the 1985 track &quot;Feel The Spin&quot;—released while she continued to feature in films. Harry released the album &quot;Rockbird&quot; in 1986, with active participation from Stein. The album was a moderate success in the UK where it reached gold certification and gave her a UK top 10 hit with &quot;French Kissin&#x27;&quot;. Meanwhile, Burke became a much-in-demand session drummer, playing and touring with Eurythmics for their 1986 album &quot;Revenge&quot;, and Destri maintained an active career as a producer and session musician.

A remix album entitled &quot;Once More into the Bleach&quot; was released in 1988, and featured remixes of classic Blondie tracks and material from Harry&#x27;s solo career, including &quot;Denis&quot;. Harry continued releasing solo albums, &quot;Def, Dumb and Blonde&quot; (1989) and &quot;Debravation&quot; (1993), while continuing to tour. Further collections follow with &quot;The Complete Picture - The Very Best of Deborah Harry and Blondie&quot; reaching number three in UK charts in 1991. In 1993, a rarities album &quot;Blond and Beyond&quot; appeared while &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; was released a year later in the US. A second remix album &quot;&quot; was released in 1995 and a live album &quot;Picture This Live&quot; followed in 1997.

===1997–2007: Re-formation, &quot;No Exit&quot; and &quot;The Curse of Blondie&quot;===

During the 1990s, Blondie&#x27;s past work began to be recognized again by a new generation of fans and artists including Garbage and No Doubt. Chrysalis/EMI Records also released several compilations and collections of remixed versions of some of their biggest hits.

Harry continued her moderately successful solo career after the band broke up, releasing albums in 1989 and 1993 which helped keep the band in the public eye. In 1990, she reunited with Stein and Burke for a summer tour of mid-sized venues as part of an &quot;Escape from New York&quot; package with Jerry Harrison, the Tom Tom Club and the Ramones.

In 1996, Stein and Harry began the process of reuniting Blondie and contacted original members Burke, Destri, and Valentine. Valentine had by this time moved to London and become a full-time writer under his real name, Gary Lachman—his &quot;New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation&quot; (2002) is a memoir of his years with the band. Reportedly, long-time bassist Nigel Harrison (Valentine&#x27;s eventual replacement in the late 1970s) was considered to fill the role and even contributed to some new demos with the group, but ultimately he and fellow former member Frank Infante did not participate in the reunion, and the two unsuccessfully sued to prevent the reunion under the name Blondie.

In 1997, the original five-piece band re-formed—including Valentine on bass—and did three live performances, all at outdoor festivals sponsored by local radio stations. Their first reunion performance occurred on May 31, 1997, when they played the HFStival at R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, DC. An international tour followed in late 1998 and early 1999. During this period, and without Valentine, they released a cover of Iggy Pop&#x27;s song &quot;Ordinary Bummer&quot; on the tribute album &quot;We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute&quot; (1997) under the pseudonym &quot;Adolph&#x27;s Dog&quot;.

A new album, &quot;No Exit&quot; (UK number three, US number eighteen), was released in February 1999. The band was now officially a four-piece, consisting of core original members Harry, Stein, Burke and Destri. By this point, Valentine had left the group and did not play on the album or contribute to the writing of any songs—two songs on the album co-authored by &quot;Valentine&quot; were in fact co-authored by Kathy Valentine of the Go-Go&#x27;s, no relation to Gary Valentine. Session musicians Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) played on this and subsequent Blondie releases.

&quot;No Exit&quot; reached number three on the UK charts and the first single &quot;Maria&quot;, which Destri had written thinking about his high school days, became Blondie&#x27;s sixth UK number one single 20 years after their first chart-topper &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. This gave the band the distinction of being one of only two American acts to reach number one in the UK singles charts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (the other being Michael Jackson who had number one hits with the Jacksons and solo in the same decades).

The re-formed band released the follow-up album &quot;The Curse of Blondie&quot; (UK number 36, US number 160) in October 2003. &quot;Curse&quot; proved to be Blondie&#x27;s lowest-charting album since their debut in 1976, although the single &quot;Good Boys&quot; managed to reach number 12 in the UK charts.

In 2004, Jimmy Destri left the group in order to deal with drug addiction, leaving Harry, Stein and Burke as the only members of the original line-up still with the band. Though Destri&#x27;s stint in rehab was successful, he was not invited back into the band. He intended to work on their 2011 album &quot;Panic Of Girls&quot;, but did not contribute as either a songwriter or a musician on the finished product.

In 2005, a new CD/DVD hits package titled &quot;Greatest Hits: Sight + Sound&quot; was released, peaking at number 48 in the UK.

Blondie co-headlined a tour with the New Cars in 2006, releasing a cover of Roxy Music hit &quot;More than This&quot; in support of the tour.

===2008–2012: Parallel Lines 30th Anniversary Tour and &quot;Panic of Girls&quot;===

On June 5, 2008, Blondie commenced a world tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; with a concert at Ram&#x27;s Head Live in Baltimore, Maryland. The tour covered some Eastern and Midwestern US cities throughout the month of June. In July, the tour took the band overseas to Israel, the UK, Russia, Europe and Scandinavia, wrapping up on August 4, 2008, at Store Vega in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired by attendances for the tour, Burke and Carbonara both told interviewers in 2008 and 2009 that the band was working on another record, which would be their first new album since the release of &quot;The Curse of Blondie&quot; in 2003. Carbonara described it as &quot;a real Blondie record.&quot;

Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with Pat Benatar and the Donnas in the summer of 2009. Following the tour, in October, the band began recording sessions for their ninth studio album with producer Jeff Saltzman in Woodstock, New York. After playing with the band for over a decade, both Foxx (bass) and Carbonara (guitar) were elevated to official membership status with Blondie. Keyboard player Matt Katz-Bohen, who had replaced Destri, was also made an official member, making Blondie a six-piece band.

In December 2009, the band released the song &quot;We Three Kings&quot; to coincide with the Christmas holiday. The new album, to be titled &quot;Panic of Girls&quot;, which was being mixed at the time, was said to be ready to follow in 2010. Stein stated that Dutch artist Chris Berens would provide the cover art. In April 2010, it was announced that guitarist Carbonara had amicably left Blondie to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tommy Kessler (the finished &quot;Panic of Girls&quot; album credits both Kessler and Carbonara as official members).

In June 2010, Blondie began the first leg of a world tour named &quot;Endangered Species Tour&quot;, which covered the UK and Ireland, supported by UK band Little Fish. The set lists featured both classics and new material from the forthcoming &quot;Panic of Girls&quot;. After a break in July, the tour resumed in August and covered the US and Canada over the course of six weeks. Blondie then took the &quot;Endangered Species Tour&quot; to Australia and New Zealand in November to December 2010, co-headlining with the Pretenders.

It was first revealed that the band&#x27;s album was going to be released first in Australia through the Australian Sony label in December 2010, but Sony later backed out of the deal, leaving the album still unreleased. The album&#x27;s release date was finally set for mid-2011 without the involvement of a major record label. The album was first released in May 2011 as a limited edition &quot;fan pack&quot; in the UK with a 132-page magazine and various collectible items, before being released as a regular CD later in the summer. The lead single &quot;Mother&quot; was released beforehand as a free download. A music video for the song was released on May 18, 2011. It was directed by Laurent Rejto and features cameos by Kate Pierson from the B-52&#x27;s, James Lorinz (Frankenhooker), Johnny Dynell, Chi Chi Valenti, the Dazzle Dancers, Rob Roth, Barbara Sicuranza, Larry Fessenden, Alan Midgette (Andy Warhol&#x27;s double), The Five Points Band, Guy Furrow, Kitty Boots, and Hattie Hathaway. A second single from the album, &quot;What I Heard&quot;, was available as a digital release in July 2011.

On August 20, 2011, Blondie performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt. The band continued to tour regularly into 2012. A concert in New York City was streamed live on YouTube on October 11, 2012. The same week, the band listed three previously unreleased songs recorded during the &quot;Panic of Girls&quot; sessions (&quot;Bride of Infinity&quot;, &quot;Rock On&quot;, and &quot;Dead Air&quot;) on Amazon.com which were made available for free download in the US, and in the UK via the band&#x27;s official website. Another track, &quot;Practice Makes Perfect&quot;, was also made available as a free download in November 2012.

===2013–present: &quot;Ghosts of Download&quot; and &quot;Pollinator&quot;===
On March 20, 2013, Harry and Stein were interviewed on the radio show WNYC Soundcheck in which they confirmed they were working on a new Blondie album and previewed a new song entitled &quot;Make a Way&quot;. In June and July 2013, the band held a &quot;Blast Off Tour&quot; of Europe. The US &quot;No Principals Tour&quot; followed in September and October 2013. The first single from the album, &quot;A Rose by Any Name&quot;, was released digitally in Europe on June 24, 2013. A second single, &quot;Sugar on the Side&quot;, was released digitally in the US in December 2013.

The album &quot;Ghosts of Download&quot; was released in May 2014 as part of a two-disc package titled &quot;Blondie 4(0) Ever&quot; to coincide with the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The package also includes &quot;Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux&quot;, a compilation of re-recordings of Blondie&#x27;s past singles. The band&#x27;s official worldwide 40th anniversary tour began in February 2014.
In the summer of 2015, the band announced they would be working on a new album produced by John Congleton. Other collaborators are Johnny Marr, Sia, Charli XCX and Dave Stewart. Blondie recorded a concert for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Soundstage&quot; to be aired some time in 2016 and included two new tracks, &quot;My Monster&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;.

In 2015, Blondie members Harry and Stein made a guest appearance alongside the Gregory Brothers in an episode of the YouTube series &quot;Songify the News&quot;, where they collaborated again to parody the 2016 US presidential election debates.

In January 2017, it was announced that the band would support Phil Collins at Dublin&#x27;s Aviva Stadium on June 25, 2017, as part of his &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot; tour. The band also toured Australia and New Zealand on a co-headlining tour with Cyndi Lauper.

In the March 2017 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, the band announced that their eleventh studio album, &quot;Pollinator&quot;, would be released on May 5, 2017. The album was recorded at The Magic Shop in SoHo, New York City, and featured songs written by the likes of TV on the Radio&#x27;s David Sitek, Johnny Marr, Sia, Charli XCX, and Dev Hynes. &quot;Pollinator&quot; spawned hit singles &quot;Fun&quot; and &quot;Long Time&quot; and embarked Blondie on an extensive promotional tour in North America, South America and Europe. The album peaked at number four in the UK and is Blondie&#x27;s most successful studio album since &quot;No Exit&quot;.

On December 21, 2019, Blondie announced through their social media that they would release an EP and mini-documentary entitled &quot;Vivir en La Habana&quot;. It was recorded during the band&#x27;s residency in Havana, Cuba, in March 2019, and directed by Rob Roth and was shown at several film festivals around the globe. The EP is not entirely a &quot;live&quot; recording as Stein, who was not present at the Havana concerts, added guitar parts in the studio to enhance the live tracks. In October 2020, Harry and Stein appeared in Schmoyoho&#x27;s parody of the 2020 US presidential debates between vice presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Mike Pence in a song titled &quot;One Heartbeat Away&quot;, where they played the role of moderators.

On October 20, 2020, Blondie announced that they would be embarking on a ten-date arena tour of the UK in November 2021 with Garbage as the opening act. The tour was postponed until April 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Johnny Marr, formerly of the Smiths, replaced Garbage on the tour. Additional dates were subsequently added in the US. In April 2022, prior to the launch of the UK/US tour, it was announced that Stein would be unable to tour with the group due to heart issues. &quot;I&#x27;ve been dealing with a dumbass condition called Atrial Fibrillation or AFib which is irregular heartbeats and combined with the meds I take for it I&#x27;m too fatigued to deal,&quot; Stein said. He was replaced by Andee Blacksugar. Bassist Foxx, too, was absent due to a back injury. Former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock filled in for Foxx. Matlock also recorded with the band for the forthcoming Blondie album.

Blondie performed at the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2023.

In a June 2024 interview for BBC Radio 6 Music, Harry and Stein confirmed that Blondie&#x27;s upcoming album will be released in Spring 2025. This was followed up on November 6, 2024 by images posted onto Stein&#x27;s and Blondie&#x27;s official social media, showing Harry in the recording studio, captioned &#x27;Whatever. Blondie album next year&#x27;.

==Style and legacy==
By 1982, the year the band initially broke up, Blondie had released six studio albums, each exhibiting a stylistic progression from the last. The band is known not only for the striking stage persona and vocal performances of Harry but also for incorporating elements in their work from numerous subgenres of music, reaching from their punk roots to embrace new wave, disco, pop, rap, and reggae.

In March 2006, Blondie, following an introductory speech by Shirley Manson of Garbage, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Seven members (Harry, Stein, Burke, Destri, Infante, Nigel Harrison, and Valentine) were invited to the ceremony, which led to an on-stage spat between the extant group and their former bandmate Infante, who asked during the live broadcast of the ceremony that he and Nigel Harrison be allowed to perform with the group, a request refused by Harry who stated that the band had already rehearsed their performance. On May 22, 2006, Blondie was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame at Guitar Center on Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard. New inductees are voted on by previous Rock Walk inductees.

<text>Mark John Bosnich (; born 13 January 1972) is an Australian former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper, and sports pundit. He played in England for Premier League clubs Aston Villa, Manchester United and Chelsea. He also played in Australia for Sydney United, Central Coast Mariners and Sydney Olympic, as well as representing Australia 17 times during his career, scoring one goal for his nation. He was a co-host of &quot;Bill &amp; Boz&quot; on Fox Sports News.

Manchester United brought Bosnich to England in 1989, but a lack of first-team opportunities and a failed attempt to secure a work visa, saw him return to Australia. A year later, Aston Villa brought him back to England and he established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League during the 1990s. Manchester United re-signed him in 1999 as a replacement for the departing Peter Schmeichel, but injuries and a lack of first-team opportunities led to a decline in form. He left Manchester United for Chelsea in 2001, where he again struggled to find a regular place in the starting line-up and continued to battle with injuries. In September 2002, he was released by Chelsea and banned from football for nine months after testing positive for cocaine.

Bosnich subsequently developed an addiction to the drug and spent the next six years of his life in exile, before training for a comeback in 2007 and eventually making a return to the professional game in his native Australia the following year, before retiring in 2009.

==Club career==

===Manchester United (1988–1991)===
Bosnich was born and raised in Liverpool, southwestern Sydney. His Croatian immigrant father was born in Blato, Korčula, Croatia, and migrated to Sydney in 1959 and his mother is Australian-born to Croatian immigrants. He attended Casula Primary School and later Liverpool Boys High School. Bosnich played for Sydney Croatia youth team before moving to England. In 1989, at the age of 17, he joined Manchester United on a non-contract basis and made his debut for them in a First Division fixture against Wimbledon on 30 April 1990.

He only played two more games for Manchester United before his registration with the club was cancelled on 30 June 1991. Bosnich had been in England using a student visa and when this expired in July 1991, he then returned to Sydney Croatia briefly in the 1991–92 season. He returned to England signing for Aston Villa on a free transfer on 28 February 1992.

===Aston Villa (1992–1999)===
Bosnich did not claim a regular place in the Aston Villa first team until the 1993–94 season. In the League Cup semi-final against Tranmere Rovers that season, he dramatically stopped three shots in a penalty shoot-out. Villa won the final, against his former club, Manchester United. In March 1994 Bosnich saved two penalties against Tottenham Hotspur, one from Darren Anderton and one from Nick Barmby, to help secure a 1–1 draw. These were his fourth and fifth penalty saves from open play that season. 1994–95 was Bosnich&#x27;s first full season as Villa&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper, but it was a disappointing season for the club as they narrowly avoided relegation.

Bosnich was one of the few players to be retained by new manager Brian Little following Ron Atkinson&#x27;s dismissal in November 1994, as the bulk of Atkinson&#x27;s team was sold off to make way for a new side. 1995–96 was perhaps the best season of Bosnich&#x27;s career. He was now widely acclaimed as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League, as he helped Villa finish fourth in the league and win the Football League Cup final at Wembley with a 3–0 triumph over Leeds United.

In 1996, Bosnich was fined £1,000 and censured by the FA after he was found guilty of misconduct by upsetting fans of Tottenham Hotspur (a club with a large Jewish following) with a Nazi salute. Bosnich spent three more seasons at Villa Park before his contract expired and he joined Manchester United on a free transfer. He had played 207 times in seven and a half years with Villa.

===Return to Manchester United (1999–2001)===
Bosnich was signed for Manchester United in the 1999 close season as successor to Peter Schmeichel, signing on a free transfer after his contract at Villa Park expired. During the season, he picked up a Premier League title medal as United were crowned champions by an 18-point margin. That season Bosnich started 23 league games, Raimond van der Gouw started 11 and Massimo Taibi started 4. Highlights of this season were saving two penalties in January 2000; one from Necaxa&#x27;s Álex Aguinaga in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship to secure a 1–1 draw, and the other from Middlesbrough&#x27;s Juninho to help secure a 1–0 win. He also played a key role in Manchester United becoming the first English team to win the Intercontinental Cup in keeping a clean sheet against Palmeiras of Brazil, in Tokyo.

He had one season as United&#x27;s regular goalkeeper, but then they signed the French World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez in June 2000. Soon after, Bosnich found himself as third-choice goalkeeper. Newly appointed Celtic manager Martin O&#x27;Neill made an offer to loan Bosnich for the 2000–01 season, but he decided against the move and decided that he would try to regain his place in the Manchester United first team. He had also fallen out of favour with the national side, losing his spot to Mark Schwarzer. With hopes of a first-team return fading, Bosnich was linked with Chelsea.

In Alex Ferguson&#x27;s autobiography released in 2013, he called Bosnich a &quot;terrible professional&quot;. Bosnich responded to Ferguson, saying, &quot;The fact remains that I was the only player he signed twice at Manchester United. I&#x27;m honoured to be mentioned. He&#x27;s entitled to his view and I&#x27;m entitled to mine.&quot;

===Chelsea (2001–2002)===
Bosnich never played a first-team game for United after the arrival of Fabien Barthez, and on 18 January 2001 he signed for Chelsea on a free transfer. Problems with his fitness and injury meant his debut did not happen until the following season in a UEFA Cup tie against Hapoel Tel Aviv. Bosnich was earning A$130,000-a-week (approximately £45,500-a-week) at Chelsea. He was injured in a league game against Everton in November 2001 and this proved to be his final appearance for the club. His career reached rock-bottom in September 2002 when he failed a drugs test and was subsequently sacked by Chelsea and banned from football for nine months.

===Exile and return (2002–2007)===
The suspension scuppered a move to Bolton Wanderers in the newly introduced winter transfer window. Bosnich was keen on the idea of moving to the Reebok Stadium and the player&#x27;s agent admitted that dialogue had taken place but Sam Allardyce remained coy about his interest. In the autumn of 2004, Bosnich spurned an opportunity to return to football with League One side Walsall, who were then managed by Paul Merson, who had played alongside Bosnich in his final season at Aston Villa.

Bosnich developed a $5,000-a-week cocaine addiction and became a recluse. Bosnich took up to of cocaine a day. At one stage, he almost shot his father with an air rifle, thinking it was an intruder in his home. His father convinced him to quit the drug. In early 2007, former Chelsea teammate and QPR goalkeeping coach Ed de Goey gave him inspiration to come out of retirement. By July 2007, Bosnich started training at Queens Park Rangers&#x27; training ground in an attempt to initially get fit, with the view to play professionally again. During the summer he lost and claimed to have regained most of his reflexes. In September he kept a clean sheet in goal during a friendly behind closed doors against Barnet, which QPR won 2–0.

===Australia===
Bosnich returned to Australia in 2008 after many years living in London. Bosnich was confirmed to be the starting goalkeeper for the Central Coast Mariners for their pre-season cup game against Sydney FC on 27 July 2008. Bosnich kept a clean sheet including saving a penalty by Sydney FC&#x27;s Steve Corica before being substituted in the 80th minute to a standing ovation by both sets of supporters. On 19 August 2008, Bosnich signed a seven-week guest player deal with the Mariners.

Bosnich made his A-League debut with the Central Coast Mariners on 31 August 2008 in a 4–2 away win against the Queensland Roar at the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Once Mariners first-choice goalkeeper Danny Vukovic had served his suspension, Bosnich did not play again for the Mariners. On 31 May 2009, it was announced that Bosnich had signed to play for Sydney Olympic for the remainder of the NSW Premier League season.

Bosnich suffered a hamstring injury and he ended his playing career to focus on his television commitments. On 22 October 2010, it was confirmed Bosnich would temporarily join the North Queensland Fury as an interim coach for the fixture against Newcastle Jets, in the absence of Franz Straka and Stuart McLaren, who had been banned from the touchline for two games. However, Bosnich was not allowed by the FFA because he did not have a coaching license.

==International career==
His first appearance with the Australia national team came in 1990 against touring USSR club side Torpedo, followed by a number of further appearances in &#x27;unofficial&#x27; Socceroos matches in the next few years. His first full international appearance came in 1993 against New Zealand in a qualifying match for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Bosnich also appeared for the Socceroos at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Although his international appearances with the Socceroos were rare, they were memorable occasions. Keeping for Australia in the away leg of its home-and-away qualifier with Iran in a failed attempt to qualify for the 1998 World Cup, Australia losing on away goals in what Bosnich described as &quot;the lowest moment in Australian football&quot;. Bosnich also scored a late penalty for his national team in a 13–0 win over the Solomon Islands. In November 2007 he admitted that he was hopeful of selection for Australia to make up for the times he shunned it in favour of his club commitments. &quot;If I ever get the chance to play for Australia again, I will never make the mistake of saying &#x27;no&#x27;.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bosnich married for the first time in 1992, to an English woman named Lisa Hall. The wedding took place in Sydney, New South Wales, in February. It was rumoured that he married Hall to be able to return to Britain, after problems with his working visa. After two years of marriage, Home Office officials were satisfied it was not a wedding of convenience and Bosnich was allowed to remain indefinitely in Britain. However, the marriage ended just three months later. According to him, &quot;We were in love but our marriage just didn&#x27;t work out.&quot; His second marriage was to Sarah Jarrett, in 1999. He almost failed to reach the altar, having only been released on bail hours before the wedding following an incident at a strip club during his stag night celebrations.

The marriage lasted only 14 months. Jarrett was pregnant at the time of the divorce, but she lost the baby soon afterwards, in the third month of pregnancy. Bosnich said that much of his cocaine problem was due to his relationship with British model Sophie Anderton, claiming that for every line of cocaine she had, he had to have one too. He does not regret his actions however, crediting them with being able to help someone in need. His addiction worsened and he later said, &quot;There was a stage where I got up to 10 grams a day when I was really down in the dumps.&quot; On 16 July 2008, he was made bankrupt at the High Court in London on the petition of a creditor. 

Bosnich provided special comments for the Socceroos&#x27; friendly with Nigeria on 17 November alongside Simon Hill on Australia&#x27;s Fox Sports and subsequently on SBS&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 FA Cup final. Bosnich is now a football analyst and commentator for Fox Sports football programmes. As part of this role, he co-hosted &quot;Bill &amp; Boz&quot; which has since been cancelled. In 2021, Bosnich joined Stan Sport to cover the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League competitions. He also works as a player agent. Bosnich trains at Kostya Tszyu&#x27;s Boxing Academy in Rockdale. Bosnich lived with his parents in Fairfield when he returned to Australia and now lives in Woolloomooloo with his partner Sarah Jones.

<text>Victor Cousin (; ; 28 November 179214 January 1867) was a French philosopher. He was the founder of &quot;eclecticism&quot;, a briefly influential school of French philosophy that combined elements of German idealism and Scottish Common Sense Realism. As the administrator of public instruction for over a decade, Cousin also had an important influence on French educational policy.

==Biography==

===Early years===

The son of a watchmaker, he was born in Paris, in the Quartier Saint-Antoine. At the age of ten he was sent to the local grammar school, the Lycée Charlemagne, where he studied until he was eighteen. &quot;Lycées&quot; being organically linked to the University of France and its Faculties since their Napoleonic institution (the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; was awarded by juries made of university professors) Cousin was &quot;crowned&quot; in the ancient hall of the Sorbonne for a Latin oration he wrote which owned him a first prize at the &quot;concours général&quot;, a competition between the best pupils at &quot;lycées&quot; (established under the Ancien Régime and reinstated under the First Empire, and still extant). The classical training of the lycée strongly disposed him to literature, or &quot;éloquence&quot; as it was then called. He was already known among his fellow students for his knowledge of Greek. From the lycée he graduated to the most prestigious of higher education schools, (as it is now called), where Pierre Laromiguière was then lecturing on philosophy.

In the second preface to the &quot;Fragments philosophiques&quot;, in which he candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life, Cousin speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the memory of the day when he heard Laromiguière for the first time. &quot;That day decided my whole life.&quot; Laromiguière taught the philosophy of John Locke and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, happily modified on some points, with a clearness and grace which in appearance at least removed difficulties, and with a charm of spiritual bonhomie which penetrated and subdued.&quot; That school has remained ever since the living heart of French philosophy; Henri Bergson, Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida are among its past students.

===Influences on Cousin&#x27;s early philosophical thought===

Cousin wanted to lecture on philosophy and quickly obtained the position of master of conferences (&quot;maître de conférences&quot;) in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching of Pierre Paul Royer-Collard. This teacher, he tells us, &quot;by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the Scottish philosophy.&quot; The &quot;Scottish Philosophy&quot; being the &quot;Common Sense&quot; Philosophy of Thomas Reid and otherswhich taught that both the external world and the human mind (introspection proving the existence of &quot;free will&quot; by the fact of consciousness) had an objective existence. In 1815–1816 Cousin attained the position of &quot;suppliant&quot; (assistant) to Royer-Collard in the history of modern philosophy chair of the faculty of letters. Another thinker who influenced him at this early period was Maine de Biran, whom Cousin regarded as the unequalled psychological observer of his time in France.

These men strongly influenced Cousin&#x27;s philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes the lesson of decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, and especially in the simplest facts of consciousness, the voluntary activity in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this &quot;triple discipline&quot; that Cousin&#x27;s philosophical thought was first developed, and that in 1815 he began the public teaching of philosophy in the Normal School and in the faculty of letters.

He then took up the study of German, worked at Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, and sought to master the &quot;Philosophy of Nature&quot; of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, which at first greatly attracted him. The influence of Schelling may be observed very markedly in the earlier form of his philosophy. He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi, but regarded it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded in reason. In 1817 he went to Germany, and met Hegel at Heidelberg. Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften&quot; appeared the same year, and Cousin had one of the earliest copies. He thought Hegel not particularly amiable, but the two became friends. The following year Cousin went to Munich, where he met Schelling for the first time, and spent a month with him and Jacobi, obtaining a deeper insight into the Philosophy of Nature.

===Political troubles disrupt career===

France&#x27;s political troubles interfered for a time with his career. In the events of 1814–1815 he took the royalist side. He adopted the views of the party known as doctrinaire, of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical leader. He seems to have gone further, and to have approached the extreme Left. Then came a reaction against liberalism, and in 1821–1822 Cousin was deprived of his offices in the faculty of letters and in the Normal School. The Normal School was swept away, and Cousin shared the fate of Guizot, who was ejected from the chair of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was a mixed blessing: he set out for Germany with a view to further philosophical study. While at Berlin in 1824–1825 he was thrown into prison, either on some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police, or as a result of an indiscreet conversation. Freed after six months, he remained under the suspicion of the French government for three years. It was during this period that he developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism, his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the &quot;Fragments philosophiques&quot; (Paris, 1826). The preface to the second edition (1833) and the third (1838) aimed at a vindication of his principles against contemporary criticism. Even the best of his later books, the &quot;Philosophie écossaise&quot;, the &quot;Du vrai, du beau, et du bien&quot;, and the &quot;Philosophie de Locke&quot;, were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820. The lectures on Locke were first sketched in 1819, and fully developed in the course of 1829.

During the seven years when he was prevented from teaching, he produced, besides the &quot;Fragments&quot;, the edition of the works of Proclus (6 vols., 1820–1827), and the works of René Descartes (II vols., 1826). He also commenced his &quot;Translation of Plato&quot; (13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One sees in the &quot;Fragments&quot; very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the &quot;Fragments&quot; of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the &quot;Cours de l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie&quot;.

===Reinstatement at the University===

In 1828, Antoine Lefebvre de Vatimesnil, Minister of Public Instruction (1828–1829) in Martignac&#x27;s ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousin&#x27;s greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the chair was the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of Pierre Abélard. The lecturer&#x27;s eloquence mingled with speculative exposition, and he possessed a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.

There was a moral elevation in Cousin&#x27;s spiritual philosophy which touched the hearts of his listeners, and seemed to be the basis for higher development in national literature and art, and even in politics, than the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence, Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and Dugald Stewart have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophy—especially its history—was revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.

Among those influenced by Cousin were Edgar Allan Poe, Théodore Simon Jouffroy, Jean Philibert Damiron, Adolphe Garnier, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Jules Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, Felix Ravaisson-Mollien, Charles de Rémusat, Orestes Brownson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jules Simon, Paul Janet, Adolphe Franck and Patrick Edward Dove, who dedicated his book &quot;The Theory of Human Progression&quot; (1850) to him — Jouffroy and Damiron were first fellow-followers. students, and then disciples. Jouffroy always kept firm to the early — the French and Scottish — impulses of Cousin&#x27;s teaching. Cousin continued to lecture for two and a half years after his return to the chair. Sympathizing with the revolution of July, he was at once recognized by the new government as a friend of national liberty. Writing in June 1833, he explains both his philosophical and his political position:
&quot;I had the advantage of holding united against me for many years both the sensational and the theological school. In 1830 both schools descended into the arena of politics. The sensational school quite naturally produced the demagogic party, and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore theocracy. On the other hand, he who combated any exclusive principle in science was bound to reject also any exclusive principle in the state, and to defend representative government.&quot;

===Effect on primary instruction===
The government was not slow to honour him. He was induced by the ministry of which his friend François Guizot was the head to become a member of the council of public instruction and counsellor of state, and in 1832 he was made a Peer of France. He ceased to lecture, but retained the title of professor of philosophy. Finally, he accepted the position of minister of public instruction in 1840 under Adolphe Thiers. He was in addition director of the Normal School and virtual head of the university, and from 1840 a member of the Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in the Institut de France. His character and his official position at this period gave him great power in the university and in the educational arrangements of the country.

The most important work he accomplished during this period was the organization of primary instruction. It was to the efforts of Cousin that France owed her advance, in relation to primary education, between 1830 and 1848. Prussia and Saxony had set the national example, and France was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national calamity and of personal wrong, he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that &quot;to carry back the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena.&quot; In the summer of 1831, commissioned by the government, he visited Frankfurt and Saxony, and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the minister, afterwards published as &quot;Rapport sur l&#x27;Etat de l&#x27;instruction publique dans quelques pays de l&#x27;Allemagne et particulièrement en Prusse&quot; (Compare also &quot;De l&#x27;instruction publique en Hollande&quot;, 1837) His views were readily accepted on his return to France, and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary instruction. (See his &quot;Exposé des motifs et projet de loi sur l&#x27;instruction primaire, présentés à la chambre des députés&quot;, &quot;séance du 2 janvier 1837&quot;.)

In the words of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (July 1833), these documents &quot;mark an epoch in the progress of national education, and are directly conducive to results important not only to France but to Europe.&quot; The Report was translated into English by Sarah Austin in 1834. The translation was frequently reprinted in the United States of America. The legislatures of New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the schools at the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that, among all the literary distinctions which he had received, &quot;None has touched me more than the title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education.&quot; To the enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king, and to the zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization, France owes what is best in her system of primary education,a national interest which had been neglected under the French Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration (see Exposé, p. 17). In the first two years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished in all the history of France. In defence of university studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844, against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were published in a tractate &quot;Défense de l&#x27;université et de la philosophie&quot; (1844 and 1845).

===Writing period 1830 to 1848===

This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 was spent, so far as philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures and writings, in maturing them for publication or reissue, and in research into certain periods of the sophical history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared &quot;De la Métaphysique d&#x27;Aristote, suivi d&#x27;un essai de traduction du premier et du douzième livres&quot;; in 1836, &quot;Cours de philosophie professé à la faculté des lettres pendant l&#x27;année 1818&quot;, and &quot;Œuvres inédites d&#x27;Abélard&quot;. This &quot;Cours de philosophie&quot; appeared later in 1854 as &quot;Du vrai, du beau, et du bien&quot;. From 1825 to 1840 appeared &quot;Cours de l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie&quot;, in 1829 &quot;Manuel de l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie de Tennemann&quot;, translated from the German. In 1840–1841 we have &quot;Cours d&#x27;histoire de la philosophie morale au XVIIIe siècle&quot; (5 vols.). In 1841 appeared his edition of the &quot;Œuvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran&quot;; in 1842, &quot;Leçons de philosophie sur Kant&quot; (Eng. trans. AG Henderson, 1854), and in the same year &quot;Des Pensées de Pascal&quot;. The &quot;Nouveaux fragments&quot; were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later, in 1859, appeared &quot;Petri Abaelardi Opera&quot;.

Also during this period Cousin seems to have turned with fresh interest to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation under the influence of Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the &quot;Des Pensées de Pascal&quot;, 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal (1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de Sable (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de Hautefort (1856). Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

When the reign of Louis Philippe came to a close through the opposition of his ministry, with Guizot at its head, to the demand for electoral reform and through the policy of the Spanish marriages, Cousin, who was opposed to the government on these points, lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the Provisional government. He published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Justice et charité&quot;, the purport of which showed the moderation of his political views. It was markedly anti-socialistic. But from this period he passed almost entirely from public life, and ceased to wield the personal influence which he had done during the preceding years. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December, he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the superior council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the Empire he stood aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with Guizot and Villemain in the rank of honorary professors. His sympathies were apparently with the monarchy, under certain constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political issues of the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his lifetime, he says: &quot;It conducts human societies to the true republic, that dream of all generous souls, which in our time can be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy.&quot;

===Death===

During the last years of his life he occupied a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne, where he lived simply and unostentatiously. The chief feature of the rooms was his noble library, the cherished collection of a lifetime. He died in Cannes on 14 January 1867, in his seventy-fifth year. In the front of the Sorbonne, below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters, a tablet records an extract from his will, in which he bequeaths his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial work and triumphs.

==Philosophy==

===Three distinctive points===

There are three distinctive points in Cousin&#x27;s philosophy. These are his method, the results of his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice psychology, ontology and eclecticism in history.

Cousin strongly insisted on the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.

===Observational method===

The observational method applied to consciousness gives us the science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper one of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, on the one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, from that of Scottish metaphysician Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is for him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not for him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.

===Three results of psychological observation===

The three great results of psychological observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason. These three facts are different in character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or the facts of the sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The Me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.

But there is a peculiarity in Cousin&#x27;s doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.

===Doctrine of the Reason===

But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive principle of the philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to us by psychological observation, the reason of our consciousness, is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it; its character is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles in knowledge is the essential point in psychology; it ought to be put first and emphasized to the last that these exist and that they are wholly impersonal or absolute. The number of these principles, their enumeration and classification, is an important point, but it is secondary to that of the recognition of their true nature. This was the point which Kant missed in his analysis, and this is the fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the integrity of philosophy by the method of the observation of consciousness. And how is this impersonality or absoluteness of the conditions of knowledge to be established? The answer is in substance that Kant went wrong in putting necessity first as the criterion of those laws. This brought them within the sphere of reflection, and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of thinking them reversed; and led to their being regarded as wholly relative to human intelligence, restricted to the sphere of the phenomenal, incapable of revealing to us substantial reality—necessary, yet subjective. But this test of necessity is a wholly secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they are each and all given to us, given to our consciousness, in an act of spontaneous apperception or apprehension, immediately, instantaneously, in a sphere above the reflective consciousness, yet within the reach of knowledge. And &quot;All subjectivity with all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free self; but in itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that self in humanity; it belongs not even to humanity. We may say with truth that nature and humanity belong to it, for without its laws both would perish.&quot;

But what is the number of those laws? Kant reviewing the enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced. According to Cousin, there are but two primary laws of thought, that of causality and that of substance. From these flow naturally all the others. In the order of nature, that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given us in each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness.

These principles of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, enable us to pass beyond the limits of the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.

But these two forces, the me and the not-me, are reciprocally limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, to which they are related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.

This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to the charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with Spinoza,they are free forces having their power or spring of action in themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of the Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity, activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity.

The elements found in consciousness are also to be found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity.

Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, skepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the chasm result was reached &quot;Each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems, we should have a complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness.&quot; Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.

===Comparison to Kant, Schelling and Hegel===

Such is the system in outline. The historical position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned in the form of infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.

With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme ground of all as positively apprehended, and as a source of development, but he utterly repudiates Schelling&#x27;s method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness, or it does not. If not, how do you know it and its object which are identical? If it does, it comes within the sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made by Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling&#x27;s intellectual intuition is the mere negation of knowledge.

Again the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction, a hypothesis illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established is the possibility of reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the very thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction, but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated, illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily developed, are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of consciousness, in psychology.

===The absolute or infinite===

The absolute or infinitethe unconditioned ground and source of all realityis yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousnessunder its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by Sir William Hamilton in the Edinburgh Review of 1829, and it was animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling. Hamilton&#x27;s objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the same—that the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these &quot;The positive alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself.&quot; A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton&#x27;s objection which has been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that which you do not know? The answer to this is that in the case of contradictory statements—A and not A—the latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positive—i.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of the Logic. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence, which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolute—they are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin&#x27;s absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these—in a word, a mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamilton&#x27;s criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton&#x27;s doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere, theodicy.

The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.

But if these three correlative facts are immediately given, it seems to be thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in reflective consciousness. He seeks to trace the steps which the reason has spontaneously and consciously, but irreflectively, followed. And here the question arises—Can we vindicate in a reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of reality?

===The self===
The self is found to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.

The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to the influence of a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, for the simple reason that such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions, and cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.

The truth is that Cousin&#x27;s doctrine of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.

Cousin&#x27;s doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through volition spontaneous apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most artistic, but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because it is most rational. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.

Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which is not in the individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.

It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim, far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.

Sir W. Hamilton (&quot;Discussions&quot;, p. 541), one of his most resolute opponents, described Cousin as &quot;A profound and original thinker, a lucid and eloquent writer, a scholar equally at home in ancient and in modern learning, a philosopher superior to all prejudices of age or country, party or profession, and whose lofty eclecticism, seeking truth under every form of opinion, traces its unity even through the most hostile systems.&quot;

<text>Paul Alexandre René Janet (; 30 April 1823 – 4 October 1899) was a French philosopher and writer.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, he became professor of moral philosophy at Bourges (1845–1848) and Strasbourg (1848–1857), and of logic at the &quot;lycée Louis-le-Grand&quot;, Paris (1857–1864). In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Sorbonne, and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.

He wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: &quot;La Famille&quot;, &quot;Histoire de la philosophie dans l&#x27;antiquité et dans le temps moderne&quot;, &quot;Histoire de la science politique&quot;, &quot;Philosophie de la Revolution Française&quot;, etc. However, in the opinion of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (11th edition, 1911), these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of Victor Cousin, and through him of G. W. F. Hegel. His principal work, &quot;Théorie de la morale&quot;, owes much to Immanuel Kant.

Charles Darwin was familiar with Janet&#x27;s ideas, but thought that he had not well understood the theory of natural selection, as he indicated in a letter of 1866 to Alfred Russel Wallace:
 As for M. Janet he is a metaphysician &amp; such gentlemen are so acute that I think they often misunderstand common folk.

<doc id="174666" wikidata="Q453382" url="?curid=174666" title="John Adams (mutineer)">
<text>John Adams, known as Jack Adams (4 July 1767– 5 March 1829), was the last survivor of the mutineers who settled on Pitcairn Island in January 1790, the year after the mutiny. His real name was John Adams, but he used the name Alexander Smith until he was discovered in 1808 by Captain Mayhew Folger of the American whaling ship &quot;Topaz&quot;. His children used the surname &quot;Adams&quot;.

== Early life ==
Almost nothing is known about the early life of Adams. An article from the &quot;Mona&#x27;s Herald&quot;, dated April 1876, states that Adams had, for some time, resided in Douglas, Isle of Man.

== Pitcairn ==
The mutineers of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; and their Tahitian companions settled on the island and set fire to the &quot;Bounty&quot;. Only the ballast stone remains of the wreck in Bounty Bay. 

Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills had taken the lives of most of the mutineers and Tahitian men. John Adams, Ned Young, and Matthew Quintal were the last three mutineers surviving in 1799 when the thuggish Quintal, while drunk, reportedly threatened to kill the entire community if he could not have Fletcher Christian&#x27;s widow as his own consort, and in response Adams and Young lured him to Young&#x27;s house and killed him with a hatchet. 
Having taken effective control of the 19-member strong colony after the 1793 massacre, Adams and Young then turned to the Scriptures using the ship&#x27;s Bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society. As a result, Adams and Young embraced Christianity and taught the children to read and write using the Bible. Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection in 1800, but Adams continued his work of educating the women and children. The Pitcairners also converted to Christianity. The Pitcairners would later convert from their existing form of Christianity to Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s.

The American sailing ship &quot;Topaz&quot; was the first to rediscover Pitcairn in 1808. Adams was eventually granted amnesty for the mutiny. On 17 December 1825 Adams was married to Teio, or &#x27;Mary&#x27;. Teio had already borne Adams&#x27; only son, George Adams, in 1804.
Adams&#x27; grave on Pitcairn is the only known grave site of a &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineer. It has a replacement headstone, the original lead-covered wooden grave marker having been taken back to Britain where it is now on display in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London.
The main settlement and capital of Pitcairn, Adamstown, is named after Adams.

Adams is portrayed by Philip Martin Brown in the 1984 film &quot;The Bounty&quot;.

<text>Harald Høffding (11 March 1843 – 2 July 1931) was a Danish philosopher and theologian.

==Life==
Born Høffding was born in Copenhagen, the son of businessman Niels Frederik Høffding and Martha Høffding (née Jhellerup). The family lived at the corner of Gammeltorv and Nørregade. Høffding became a schoolmaster, and ultimately in 1883 a professor at the University of Copenhagen. He was strongly influenced by Søren Kierkegaard in his early development, but later became a positivist, retaining and combining with it the spirit and method of practical psychology and the critical school. The physicist Niels Bohr studied philosophy from and became a friend of Høffding. The philosopher and author Ágúst H. Bjarnason was a student of Høffding.

Høffding&#x27;s great-nephew was the statistician Wassily Hoeffding.

Høffding died in Copenhagen.

==Work==

His best-known work is perhaps his &quot;Den nyere Filosofis Historie&quot; (1894), translated into English from the German edition (1895) by B.E. Meyer as &quot;History of Modern Philosophy&quot; (2 vols., 1900), a work intended by him to supplement and to correct that of Hans Brøchner to whom it is dedicated. His &quot;Psychology, the Problems of Philosophy&quot; (1905) and &quot;Philosophy of Religion&quot; (1906) also have appeared in English.

Among Høffding&#x27;s other writings, most of which have been translated into German, are &quot;Den engelske Filosofi i vor Tid&quot; (1874); &quot;Etik&quot; (1876); &quot;Psychologi i Omrids paa Grundlag af Erfaring&quot; (ed. 1892); &quot;Psykologiske Undersøgelser&quot; (1889); &quot;Charles Darwin&quot; (1889); &quot;Kontinuiteten i Kants filosofiske Udviklingsgang&quot; (1893); &quot;Sören Kierkegaard als Philosoph&quot; (1896); &quot;Det psykologiske Grundlag for logiske Domme&quot; (1899); &quot;Rousseau und seine Philosophie&quot; (1901); &quot;Mindre Arbejder&quot; (1899).

==Commemoration==
A commemorative plaque on the facade of Alexandrahus in Copenhagen (Nørregade 1) commemorates that Høffding was born on the site.

<text>The Sukhothai Kingdom was a post-classical Siamese kingdom (&quot;maṇḍala&quot;) in Mainland Southeast Asia surrounding the ancient capital city of Sukhothai in present-day north-central Thailand. It evolved from a trading hub to a city-state in 1127 and emerged into the kingdom by Si Inthrathit in 1238. Sukhothai existed as an independent polity until 1438 when it fell under the influence of the neighboring Ayutthaya after the death of Borommapan (Maha Thammaracha IV).

Sukhothai was originally a trade center in Lavo—itself under the suzerainty of the Khmer Empire from 946–1052—when Central Thai people led by Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, a local leader, revolted and gained their independence. Bang Klang Hao took the regnal name of Si Inthrathit and became the first monarch of the Phra Ruang dynasty.

The kingdom was centralized and expanded to its greatest extent during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng the Great (1279–1298), who some historians considered to have introduced Theravada Buddhism and the initial Thai script to the kingdom. Ram Khamhaeng also initiated relations with Yuan China, through which the kingdom developed the techniques to produce and export ceramics like sangkhalok ware.

After the reign of Ram Khamhaeng, the kingdom fell into decline. In 1349, during the reign of Li Thai (Maha Thammaracha I), Sukhothai was invaded by the Ayutthaya Kingdom, a neighboring Thai polity. It remained a tributary state of Ayutthaya until it was annexed by the kingdom in 1438 after the death of Borommapan. Despite this, the Sukhothai nobility continued to influence the Ayutthaya monarchy in centuries after through the Sukhothai dynasty.

Sukhothai is traditionally known as &quot;the first Thai kingdom&quot; in Thai historiography, but current historical consensus agrees that the history of the Thai people began much earlier. The ruins of the kingdom&#x27;s capital, now outside the modern town of Sukhothai Thani in Sukhothai Province, are preserved as the Sukhothai Historical Park and have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
The English term Sukhothai () is the romanization of the Thai word per the Royal Thai General System of Transcription. The Thai word for the historical country was a transliteration of the Khmer spelling, rendered in English as &quot;Sukhodaya&quot; (). The Khmer term is itself derived from the Sanskrit &quot;sukha&quot; (, &#x27;lasting happiness&#x27;) and &quot;udaya&quot; (, &#x27;rise&#x27; or &#x27;emergence&#x27;). Together, the phrase can be interpreted as meaning &quot;dawn of happiness&quot;.

==History==
===Early settlement===

According to the legend, the city of Sukhothai was founded in 494 followed by its twin city of Chaliang () after Tai-speaking people migrated southward from the upper Mekong basin. Later in 500 CE, after the establishment of the Lavo Kingdom, a nobel from Lavo named Phalirat () became the first Sukhothai governor. The following rulers after Phalirat remain unclear. 

It was expected that the city would be abandoned in the late 6th century due to the invasion of another Austroasiatic-speaking people from Umongasela () in the present-day Fang and was then re-established in 957 by Aphai Kamini () who evacuated from Haripuñjaya after the capital Haripuñjaya was sacked by Umongasela. Sukhothai declared independence from Umongasela in 1017 during the reign of Arun Kuman (). Controlling trade routes between Mon city-states in the west and Tai kingdoms in the north, as well as other polities in the lower Chao Phraya River basin, made Sukhothai emerge as the logistics hub in the region and evolved into a city-state no later than 1127, which continued until the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom in 1238.

In contrast, some historians suggest the migration of Tai peoples into Mainland Southeast Asia was somewhat gradual, and likely took place between the 8th and 10th centuries. Prior to the rise of Sukhothai, various other Tai kingdoms existed in the neighboring northern highlands. These include Ngoenyang of the Northern Thai people (present-day Chiang Saen) and Chiang Hung of the Tai Lue people (present-day Jinghong, China). According to semi-legendary Shan documents, the Mau Shan Prince, &quot;Sam Lung-pha&quot; of Mogaung, before he established the Tai kingdom of the Ahom in Assam in 1229, raided the Menam valley and the Malay peninsula as far as Tawi (Dawei) and Yansaleng (Junk Ceylon?). This purported influx of armed Tai may have had something to do with establishing the Tai kingdom of Sukhothai.

===Formation===
Chaliang, who established royal intermarriage with Tai&#x27;s Chiang Saen in the 900s, led by expanded political influence to Sukhothai of Lavo in 1175. However, nobles of the Lavo faction revolted and recaptured Sukhothai in 1181, which caused a group of Central Thai peoples led by a local mueang chief, Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, to took Sukhothai back and established it as an independent Thai state in 1238. Bang Klang Hao was assisted by a local ally, Pho Khun Pha Mueang. This event was a turning point in the history of the Tai peoples, as Sukhothai would remain the center of Tai power until the end of the 14th century.

The year when the Lavo nobility revolted and recaptured Sukhothai overlapped with the period when Angkor regained Lavo&#x27;s Lavapura from the Mon-Tai monarch of Chaliang, who had ruled Lavapura since 1106 after the throne was vacated by Lavo&#x27;s relocation of the capital to Ayodhya in the 1080s.

Bang Klang Hao ruled Sukhothai under the regnal name Si Inthrathit and established the Phra Ruang dynasty. Under the rule of Si Inthrathit, the primordial kingdom expanded its influence to the bordering cities surrounding the capital. By the end of his reign in 1270, Sukhothai covered the entire upper valley of the Chao Phraya River, then known simply as Mae Nam (, &#x27;mother of waters&#x27;), the generic Thai name for all rivers. In the first era, Sukhothai strongly shared a connection with western Mon neighbor, Hanthawaddy Kingdom, in present-day lower Myanmar.

From the 13th to 14th centuries, Sukhothai was strongly influenced by the Khmer culture as Lavo the regional center. About some fifty kilometers north of Sukhodaya stood another sister town, Sri Sajanalaya, that would later become Si Satchanalai, an important center of Sukhothai politics alongside the capital. Under Lavo control, various monuments was built in the city, several of which still stand in the Sukhothai Historical Park. They include the Ta Pha Daeng Shrine, Wat Phra Phai Luang, and Wat Si Sawai. It was then shifted to Tai Yuan&#x27;s Lan Na style in the early 14th century and steadily influenced by Mon and Sri Lanka through Theravada Buddhism since the reign of Ram Khamhaeng.

===Expansion under Ram Khamhaeng===

In 1270, Si Inthrathit died and was succeeded by his son Ban Mueang. At the end of Ban Mueang&#x27;s reign, he was succeeded by his brother Ram Khamhaeng the Great; both expanded Sukhothai beyond the borders established by their father. To the south, Ram Khamhaeng subjugated the mandala kingdoms of Suvarnabhumi (likely present-day Suphan Buri) and Tambralinga (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat). Through the acquisition of Tambralinga, Ram Khamhaeng is said to have adopted Theravada Buddhism as the state religion of Sukhothai; the accuracy of these claims by traditional historians is disputed. 

To the north, Ram Khamhaeng placed Phrae and Muang Sua (present-day Luang Prabang, Laos), among other mandala city-states, under tribute. To the west, Ram Khamhaeng helped assist the Mon people under Wareru (who is said to have eloped with Ram Khamhaeng&#x27;s daughter) in their rebellion against Pagan control, and Wareru would establish a kingdom at Martaban, the predecessor to Hanthawaddy (present-day Bago, Myanmar). Martaban is traditionally considered a tributary state of Sukhothai, but such Sukhothai domination may not have extended that far. 

With regard to religion and culture, Ram Khamhaeng requested monks from Sri Thamnakorn to propagate Theravada Buddhism in Sukhothai. In 1283, the Sukhothai script was likely invented by Ram Khamhaeng; the earliest evidence of this ancient Thai writing is seen in the Ram Khamhaeng Inscription, discovered by Mongkut (Rama IV) nearly six centuries later. The script later evolved into the modern Thai script of today.

It was also during this time that the first relations with Yuan China were established and Sukhothai began sending trade missions to China. The well-known exported good of Sukhothai was the sangkhalok ware. This was the only period in Thai history that Siam produced Chinese-style ceramics, and they fell out of use by the 14th century.

===Decline and tributary status===
By the beginning of the fourteenth century, Sukhothai controlled the Chao Phraya plain, with spurs West to the Hanthawaddy Kingdom and South to the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom. After the death of Ram Khamhaeng, he was succeeded by his son Loe Thai.

Tributary states of Sukhothai began to break away rapidly after the death of Ram Khamhaeng. To the north, Uttaradit and the Lao kingdoms of Muang Sua and Vieng Chan Vieng Kham (present-day Vientiane) liberated themselves from their Sukhothai overlords. In 1319, Martaban in the west broke away. In 1321, Lan Na (the successor state to Ngoenyang) annexed Tak, one of the oldest towns in Sukhothai. To the south, Suphannaphum Kingdom and Nakhon Si Thammarat also broke free early in the reign of Loe Thai. Thus, the kingdom was quickly reduced to its former status as merely a local power.

In 1323, Loe Thai was succeeded by his cousin, Ngua Nam Thum. In 1347, he was succeeded by Li Thai (Maha Thammaracha I), the son of Loe Thai. In 1349, armies from Ayutthaya invaded the kingdom and forced Sukhothai to become its tributary. The center of power in the tributary state shifted to Song Khwae (present-day Phitsanulok). In 1378, Lue Thai (Maha Thammaracha II) had to submit to this new Thai power as a vassal state. He was succeeded by Sai Lue Thai (Maha Thammaracha III) in 1399.

In 1424, after the death of Sai Lue Thai, his sons Phaya Ram and Phaya Ban Mueang fought for the throne. Intharacha of Ayutthaya intervened and installed Ban Mueang as Borommapan (Maha Thammaracha IV). When Borommapan died in 1438, Borommarachathirat II of Ayutthaya installed his son Ramesuan (the future Borommatrailokkanat of Ayutthaya) as Upparat in Sukhothai, a position similar to both that of a viceroy and an heir presumptive, establishing a form of personal union and creating the Siamese Front Palace system. Prince Ramesuan was presumably accompanied by Ayutthayan administrative staff and a military garrison, thus affirming the end of Sukhothai as an independent kingdom.

===Annexation and further influence===
Under tributary status, the former territories of Sukhothai, known to the people of Ayutthaya as the Northern Cities (, ), continued to be ruled by local aristocrats under Ayutthaya&#x27;s overlordship per the mandala systems of both dominions. The mandalas would politically and culturally merge during the 15th and 16th centuries, and Sukhothai&#x27;s warfare, administration, architecture, religious practice, and language influenced those of Ayutthaya. Sukhothai nobles linked themselves with the Ayutthayan elite through marriage alliances, and often played the role of kingmaker in Ayutthayan succession conflicts. Sukhothai military leaders served prominently in Ayutthaya&#x27;s army as the military tradition of Sukhothai was considered to be tougher.

From 1456 to 1474, former Sukhothai territory became a battleground during the Ayutthaya-Lan Na War (1441–1474). In 1462, Sukhothai briefly rebelled against Ayutthaya and allied itself with their enemy, Lan Na. In 1463, Borommatrailokkanat temporarily moved the monarch&#x27;s residence to Song Khwae, presumably to be closer to the frontline, and the city was permanently renamed to Phitsanulok. Contemporary Portuguese traders described Ayutthaya and Phitsanulok as &quot;twin states&quot;.

In 1548, Maha Chakkraphat named Khun Phirenthorathep, a noble from the Sukhothai clan, as the leader in Phitsanulok. Phirenthorathep was conferred with the name Maha Thammaracha in line with the historical kings of Sukhothai, and married one of Maha Chakkraphat&#x27;s daughters, strengthening his claim to both a historical and present monarchy. Despite this, the title of Upparat went to Maha Chakkraphat&#x27;s son Ramesuan (who died in 1564) and later his brother Mahinthrathirat. After a series of wars with the Burmese Toungoo Empire, Maha Thammaracha allied himself with the Burmese against Ayutthaya. In 1569, Ayutthaya under Mahinthrathirat fell to the Burmese, and Bayinnaung installed Maha Thammaracha (Sanphet I) as the vassal king in Ayutthaya and the first king of the Sukhothai dynasty.

In 1584, Maha Thammaracha and his son, the Upparat and future Naresuan the Great (Sanphet II), would free Ayutthaya from Burmese overlordship in the Burmese-Siamese War of 1584–1593. After the Battle of the Sittaung River, Naresuan forcibly relocated people from the northern cities of Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Phichai, Sawankhalok, Kamphaeng Phet, Phichit, and Phra Bang closer to Ayutthaya. Since then, the ruins of the capital city of the former Sukhothai Kingdom have been preserved as the Sukhothai Historical Park and designated a World Heritage Site.

==Legacy==

The Silajaruek of Sukhothai are hundreds of stone inscriptions that form a historical record of the period. Among the most important inscriptions are the Ram Khamhaeng Inscription (also known as Inscription No. 1), Silajaruek Wat Srichum (an account on the history of the region itself and of Sri Lanka), and Silajaruek Wat Pamamuang (a politico-religious record of Loe Thai).

Mongkut (Rama IV) is considered the champion of Sukhothai narrative history due to his discovery of Inscription No. 1, the &quot;first evidence&quot; of the history of Sukhothai. Mongkut said that he found a &quot;first stone inscription&quot; in Sukhothai which told of heroic kings such as Ram Khamhaeng, the administrative system, and other developments in what was considered the &quot;prosperous time&quot; of the kingdom. The story of Sukhothai was incorporated into Thailand&#x27;s &quot;national history&quot; in the late 19th century by Mongkut as a historical work presented to the British diplomatic mission.
From then on, as a part of modern nation-building process, modern national Siamese history included the history of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Sukhothai was said to be the &quot;first national capital&quot;, followed by Ayutthaya and Thonburi, until Rattanakosin, or today Bangkok. Sukhothai history was crucial among Siam&#x27;s &quot;modernists&quot;, both &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot;. Sukhothai history became even more important after the Siamese Revolution of 1932. Research and writing on Sukhothai history were abundant. Ideas derived from the inscription were studied and &quot;theorised&quot;.

One of the most well-known topics was Sukhothai&#x27;s &quot;democracy&quot; rule. Stories of the close relationship between the king and his people, vividly described as a &quot;father-son&quot; relationship, were considered the &quot;seed&quot; of ancient Thai democracy; however, changes in government took place when later society embraced &quot;foreign&quot; traditions, like those of Angkor, influenced by Hinduism and &quot;mystic&quot; Mahayana Buddhism. The story of Sukhothai became the model of &quot;freedom&quot;. Chit Phumisak, a &quot;revolutionary&quot; scholar, saw the Sukhothai period as the beginning of the Thai people&#x27;s liberation from their foreign ruler in Angkor.

During military rule beginning in the 1950s, Sukhothai was increasingly featured in the Thai national history curriculum. Sukhothai&#x27;s &quot;father-son&quot; model for Thai democracy in contrast to Angkorian tradition became one of freedom from the &quot;foreign ideology&quot; of Cambodian communism. Other aspects of Sukhothai were also explored under the new curriculum, such as the commoner and slave status as well as economics. These topics became the subject of ideological controversy during the Cold War and the communist insurgency in Thailand.

<text>Pierre Paul Royer-Collard (; 21 June 1763 – 2 September 1845) was a French statesman and philosopher, leader of the Doctrinaires group during the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830).

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born at Sompuis, near Vitry-le-François (in modern-day Marne), the son of Anthony Royer, a small businessman. His mother, Angélique Perpétue Collard, had a reputation for strong character and great piety. His younger brother, Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard, was a physician and pioneer in the field of psychiatry, at one point serving as chief physician at Charenton Asylum.

Royer-Collard was sent at 12 to the college of Chaumont of which his uncle, Father Paul Collard, was director. He subsequently followed his uncle to Saint-Omer, where he studied mathematics.

===Career===
At the outbreak of the French Revolution, to which he was passionately sympathetic, he was practising at the Parisian bar. He was returned by his section, the Island of Saint-Louis, to the Commune, of which he was secretary from 1790 to 1792. After the revolution of 10 August in that year he was replaced by Jean-Lambert Tallien.

His sympathies were now with the Gironde, and after the insurrection of the 12th Prairial (31 May 1793) his life was in danger. He returned to Sompuis, and was saved from arrest possibly by the protection of Georges Danton and in some degree by his mother&#x27;s influence on the local commissary of the Convention. In 1797 he was returned by his department (Marne) to the Council of the Five Hundred, where he allied himself especially with Camille Jordan. He made a well-regarded speech in the council in defence of the principles of religious liberty, but the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) drove him back into private life.

It was at this period that he developed his legitimist opinions and entered into communication with the Comte de Provence (Louis XVIII of France). He was the ruling spirit in the small committee formed in Paris to help forward a Restoration independent of the Comte d&#x27;Artois and his party; but with the establishment of the Consulate he saw the prospects of the monarchy were temporarily hopeless, and the members of the committee resigned. From that time until the Restoration Royer-Collard devoted himself exclusively to the study of philosophy. He derived his opposition to the philosophy of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac chiefly from the study of René Descartes and his followers, and from his early veneration for the fathers of Port-Royal. He was occupied with developing a system to provide a moral and political education consonant with his view of the needs of France. From 1811 to 1814 he lectured at the Sorbonne. He has strongly influenced by the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid, and in 1811-12 he lectured on Reid at the École Normale.

From this time dates his long association with François Guizot. Royer-Collard himself was supervisor of the press under the first restoration. From 1815 onwards he sat as deputy for Marne in the chamber. As president of the commission of public instruction from 1815 to 1820 he checked the pretensions of the clerical party, the immediate cause of his retirement being an attempt to infringe the rights of the University of Paris by awarding diplomas, independent of university examinations, to the teaching fraternity of the Christian Brothers. Royer-Collard&#x27;s acceptance of the legitimist principle did not prevent a faithful adhesion to the social revolution effected in 1789, and he protested in 1815, in 1820, and again under the Monarchy of July against laws of exception.

He was the moving spirit of the &quot;Doctrinaires&quot;, as they were called, who met at the house of the Comte de Ste Aulaire and in the salon of Madame de Staël&#x27;s daughter, the duchesse de Broglie. The leaders of the party, beside Royer-Collard, were Guizot, PFH de Serre, Camille Jordan and Charles de Rémusat. In 1820 Royer-Collard was excluded from the Council of State by a decree signed by his former ally Serre. In 1827 he was elected for seven constituencies, but remained faithful to his native department. Next year he became president of the chamber, and fought against the reactionary policy which precipitated the Revolution of July. It was Royer-Collard who in March 1830 presented the address of the 221. From that time he took no active part in politics, although he retained his seat in the chamber until 1839. Whilst during the first half of the nineteenth century the word &quot;liberal&quot; was generally synonymous with Voltaireanism and hostility to the Jesuits, certain speeches of Royer-Collard quoted by Barante show that he professed a deferential attachment for the Church. &quot;If Christianity&quot;, he wrote, &quot;has been a degradation, a corruption, Voltaire in attacking it has been a benefactor of the human race; but if the contrary be true, then the passing of Voltaire over the Christian earth has been a great calamity.&quot; In a letter to Père de Ravignan he comments upon the institution of the Jesuits as a &quot;wonderful creation&quot;.

===Personal life===
Royer-Collard married Augustine Marie Rosalie de Forges de Chãtaeubrun on 20 October 1800. They had four children, two of whom predeceased them.

He died at his estate of Châteauvieux in the Berry, south of Blois.

<text>The Samoyed ( or ; , or ) is a breed of medium-sized herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are spitz-type dogs which take their name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. Descending from the Nenets Herding Laika, they are domesticated animals that assist in herding, hunting, protection and sled-pulling.

Samoyed dogs are most often white, and can have a brown tint to their double-layer coat which is naturally dirt-repellent. They are known to be used in expeditions in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and have a friendly and agreeable disposition.

== History ==
The progenitor of the Samoyeds was the Nenets Herding Laika, a reindeer herding spitz commonly used throughout northern Siberia, especially the Nenets people who were pejoratively referred to as Samoyeds at that time. DNA evidence confirms that Samoyeds are a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A genomic study of two dog specimens that are nearly 100 years old and obtained from the Nenets people on the Yamal Peninsula found that these are related to two specimens dated 2,000 years old and 850 years old, which suggests continuity of the lineage in this region. The two 100 year old dogs were closely related with the Samoyed breed, which indicates that the ancient arctic lineage lives on in the modern Samoyed dog. 
During preparation for the Fram expedition to the North Pole in 1893–1896, 33 dogs were purchased from the Nenets people. While 28 of these dogs would go to the North Pole, none of them survived. The remaining dogs, including pups born during the voyage, were left aboard the ship. In April 1893 the bitch had another litter, most of them white. According to Nansen&#x27;s notes &quot;...all the dogs were strong, tough and excellent at pulling sleds; they worked very well in hunting Polar bears [as well].&quot; These dogs would become the original Samoyeds.

British Zoologist Ernest Kilburn-Scott is widely considered the founder of Samoyed breed. In 1889, he returned to England with a puppy he had purchased from a Samoyed encampment near Arkhangelsk. In the early days, imported dogs were a wide array of colors. However, it was widely believed that the &quot;true Samoyeds,&quot; as originally bred in Siberia, were predominantly white. In 1909, the first official breed standard for the Samoyed was developed in England.

In 1898-1900, Carsten Borchgrevink brought 90 Samoyeds to the southern hemisphere during the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; Expedition. In his book &quot;To the South Polar Regions,&quot; expedition member Louis Bernacchi wrote:

On the return trip, the dogs were left on Native Island, New Zealand. Due to quarantine requirements, many of the dogs were killed but a few remained. 9 of the remaining dogs were bought by Ernest Shackleton.

Robert Falcon Scott brought twenty Samoyeds with him during his 1902 journey. The dogs struggled under the conditions Scott placed them in, with four dogs pulling heavily loaded sleds through 45 cm (18 in) of snow with bleeding feet. Scott blamed their failure on rotten dried fish.

== Appearance and characteristics ==

The AKC Standard requires and at the shoulder for males, and and for females. The UK Kennel Club Standard requires for males, and for females.

Samoyed ears are thick and covered with fur, triangular in shape, and erect. They are almost always white but have a light to dark brown tint (known as &quot;biscuit&quot;) to a greater or lesser extent. The tint is usually on the ears but can be visible on the whole body.
The Samoyed tail is one of the breed&#x27;s distinguishing features. Like the Alaskan Malamute, the tail is carried curled over the back; however, unlike the Alaskan Malamute, the Samoyed tail is held actually touching the back. It is not usually held in a tight curl, or held flag-like; it is usually carried lying over the back and to one side. In cold weather, Samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to provide additional warmth. Almost all Samoyeds will allow their tails to fall when they are relaxed and at ease, as when being stroked or while eating, but will return their tails to a curl when more alert.

Samoyeds have a dense, double layer coat. The topcoat contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs, which appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean and free of debris. The under layer, or undercoat, consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the dog warm. The undercoat typically sheds heavily once or twice a year, and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as &quot;blowing coat&quot;. This does not mean the Samoyed will shed only during that time however; fine hairs (versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding) will be shed all year round, and have a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white coloring, although pure white and all biscuit dogs are common. Males typically have larger ruffs than females. While this breed is touted as &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;, it does shed a fair amount and needs frequent grooming. While the breed may produce fewer allergens, care should be taken for severe allergies.

Shed Samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting, with a texture similar to angora. The fur is sometimes also used for the creation of artificial flies for fly fishing.

Life expectancy for the breed is about 12–13 years.

== Temperament ==

Samoyeds&#x27; friendly and affable disposition makes them poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare. The breed is characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames &quot;Sammie smile&quot; and &quot;smiley dog&quot;. With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. According to the Samoyed Club of America, when Samoyeds become bored, they may become destructive or start to dig.

== Activities ==

Samoyeds can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, mushing and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Samoyeds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

== Health ==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

=== Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy ===
The breed can be affected by a genetic disease known as Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy, a kidney disease. The disease is known to be caused by an X-linked recessive faulty allele and therefore the disease is more severe in male Samoyeds. Also known as hereditary nephritis, it is caused by a nonsense mutation in codon 1027 of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome (glycine to stop codon), which is similar to Alport&#x27;s syndrome in humans.

Carrier females do develop mild symptoms after 2–3 months of age, but mostly do not go on to develop kidney failure. The disease is caused by a defect in the structure of the type-IV collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane. As a consequence, the collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane are unable to form cross-links, so the structural integrity is weakened and the membrane is more susceptible to &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; damage. As the structure of the basement membrane begins to degenerate, plasma proteins are lost in the urine and symptoms begin to appear. Affected males appear healthy for the first three months of life, but then symptoms start to appear and worsen as the disease progresses: the dog becomes lethargic and muscle wastage occurs, as a result of proteinuria. From three months of age onwards, a reduced glomerular filtration rate is detected, indicative of progressive kidney failure.

Clinically, proteinuria is found in both sexes from the age of three to four months; in dogs older than this, kidney failure in combination with more or less pronounced hearing loss occurs swiftly and death at the age of 8 to 15 months is expected. In heterozygous females, the disease develops slowly. The disease can be treated to slow down the development by use of cyclosporine A and ACE inhibitors, but not stopped.

If a carrier female is mated with a healthy stud dog, the female offspring have a 50% chance of being carriers for the disease, and any male offspring have a 50% chance of being affected by the disease. A genetic test is available for this disease.

=== Other health concerns ===
For the Samoyeds several breed-specific hereditary diseases are described in the veterinary literature:

* Diabetes mellitus similar but not identical to human Type I (insulin deficiency): The disease occurs in middle-aged Samoyeds, the mean age at diagnosis is seven years. The cause is a chronic inflammation of the pancreas and/or autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of islets of Langerhans. Moreover, autoantibodies to insulin were found in affected dogs. Several genetic markers are being discussed as possible causes.
* Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) caused by a frameshift mutation in the RPRG locus of the X chromosome. The disease leads to a slowly progressive loss of vision, which eventually leads to blindness. The first symptoms appear between two and five years of age. The disease corresponds to the X-linked PRA type 3 in humans.
* Short legs in conjunction with eye abnormalities: a genetic defect at the COL2A1 locus leads to disproportionate dwarfism due to short limbs in connection with cataracts, malformations of the retina or retinal detachment, liquefaction of the vitreous and a persistent hyaloid artery. The malformations of the retina are dominant (i.e. they occur in heterozygous dogs); the other symptoms are recessive, so that they are expressed only in homozygous dogs. These conditions have no effect on the expression of the protein opticin.
* Pulmonary stenosis occurs more frequently in Samoyeds in comparison with other breeds. The disease can cause shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmias and rapid fatigue when moving, and increases the risk of congestive heart failure.
* Hip dysplasia is also a concern for Samoyeds.
* The breed can also be affected by sebaceous adenitis, an uncommon idiopathic autoimmune skin disease.

<doc id="174681" wikidata="Q1479519" url="?curid=174681" title="Félix Ravaisson-Mollien">
<text>Jean Gaspard Félix Lacher Ravaisson-Mollien (; ; 23 October 1813 – 18 May 1900) was a French philosopher, &#x27;perhaps France&#x27;s most influential philosopher in the second half of the nineteenth century&#x27;. He was originally and remains more commonly known as Félix Ravaisson. 

His &#x27;seminal&#x27; &#x27;key&#x27; work was &quot;De l&#x27;habitude&quot; (1838), translated in English as &quot;Of Habit&quot;. Ravaisson&#x27;s philosophy is in the tradition of French spiritualism, which was initiated by Pierre Maine de Biran (1766–1824) with the essay &quot;The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking&quot; (1802). However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called &#x27;spiritual realism&#x27; and – according to Ravaisson scholar Mark Sinclair – can be thought of as founding &#x27;the school of contingency&#x27;. His most well known and influential successor was Henri Bergson, with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s; although the &#x27;lineage&#x27; of this &#x27;philosophy of life&#x27; can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with Gilles Deleuze. Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes. In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the minister of public instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as inspector general of libraries, and then the curator of classical antiquities at the Louvre. Later in his life he was appointed as the president of the jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, &#x27;a position of considerable influence&#x27;. Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Laché.

==Biography==

Ravaisson was born at Namur. After a successful course of study at the Collège Rollin, he went to Munich in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of Schelling, and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work &quot;Essai sur la métaphysique d&#x27;Aristote&quot; (&quot;Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle&quot;), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of Aristotle and the Peripatetics, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.

In 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled &quot;De l&#x27;habitude&quot; (&quot;On Habit&quot;), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical &#x27;poem&#x27; on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at Rennes. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre (from 1870). He died in Paris in 1900.

==Philosophical work==

In philosophy, he was one of the school of Victor Cousin, with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.

==Bibliography==

Ravaisson&#x27;s &#x27;complete&#x27; &#x27;three major&#x27; philosophical works are: &quot;Essai sur la métaphysique d&#x27;Aristote&quot; [Vol. 1 &amp; Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); &quot;De l&#x27;habitude&quot; (&quot;On Habit&quot;, 1838); and &quot;Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme siècle&quot; (1867). Ravaisson also produced a number of other &#x27;noteworthy essays&#x27; such as &quot;La Philosophie contemporaine&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Philosophy&quot;, 1840); &quot;La Philosophie de Pascale&quot; (&quot;Pascal’s Philosophy&quot;, 1887), and &quot;Métaphysique et Morale&quot; (&quot;Metaphysics and Morals&quot;, 1893). Upon his death he also &#x27;left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously&#x27;, first as &quot;Testament philosophique&quot; in &quot;Revue de métaphysique et de morale&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Testament&quot;, 1901), then later in extended form as &quot;Testament philosophique&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Testament&quot;, 1933).

<doc id="174683" wikidata="Q23467020" url="?curid=174683" title="Naming of the Americas">
<text>The naming of the Americas occurred shortly after Christopher Columbus&#x27;s death in 1506. The earliest known use of the name &quot;America&quot; dates to April 25, 1507, when it was applied to what is now known as South America. It is generally accepted that the name derives from Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer, who explored the new continents in the following years on behalf of Spain and Portugal, with the name given by German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. However, some have suggested other explanations, including being named after the Amerrisque mountain range in Nicaragua, or after Richard Amerike, a merchant from Bristol, England.

==Usage==
In contemporary English, North and South America are generally considered separate continents, and taken together are called &quot;the Americas&quot; in the plural. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally &quot;the continent of America&quot; in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular &quot;America&quot; in English commonly refers to the United States of America.

Historically, in the English-speaking world, the term &quot;America&quot; could refer to a single continent until the 1950s (as in Van Loon&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; of 1937): According to historians Kären Wigen and Martin W. Lewis,

This shift did not seem to happen in most other cultural hemispheres on Earth, such as Romance-speaking (including France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Switzerland, Latin America, and the postcolonial Romance-speaking countries of Africa), Germanic (but excluding English) speaking (including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands), and elsewhere, where America is still considered a continent encompassing the North America and South America subcontinents, as well as Central America.

==Earliest use of name==
The earliest known use of the name &quot;America&quot; dates to April 25, 1507, when it was applied to what is now known as South America. It appears on a small globe map with twelve time zones, together with the largest wall map made to date, both created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in France. These were the first maps to show the Americas as a land mass separate from Asia. An accompanying book, &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot;, anonymous but apparently written by Waldseemüller&#x27;s collaborator Matthias Ringmann, states, &quot;I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part [that is, the South American mainland], after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerigen, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women&quot;. &quot;America&quot; is also inscribed on the Paris Green Globe (or &quot;Globe vert&quot;) which has been attributed to Waldseemüller and dated to 1506–07: as well as the single name inscribed on the northern and southern parts of the New World, the continent also bears the inscription: &quot;America ab inuentore nuncupata&quot; (America, named after its discoverer).

Mercator on his map called North America &quot;America or New India&quot; (&quot;America sive India Nova&quot;).

==Amerigo Vespucci==
&quot;Americus Vesputius&quot; was the Latinized version of the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci&#x27;s name, the forename being an old Italianization (compare modern Italian Enrico) of Medieval Latin (see Saint Emeric of Hungary), from the Old High German name Emmerich, which may have been a merger of several Germanic names – Amalric, Ermanaric and Old High German &quot;Haimirich&quot;, from Proto-Germanic &quot;*amala-&quot; (&#x27;vigor, bravery&#x27;), &quot;*ermuna-&quot; (&#x27;great; whole&#x27;) or &quot;*haima-&quot; (&#x27;home&#x27;) + &quot;*rīk-&quot; (&#x27;ruler&#x27;) (compare ).

Amerigo Vespucci (March 9, 1454February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who may have been the first to assert that the West Indies and corresponding mainland were not part of Asia&#x27;s eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus&#x27;s voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the Europeans.

Vespucci was apparently unaware of the use of his name to refer to the new landmass, as Waldseemüller&#x27;s maps did not reach Spain until a few years after his death. Ringmann may have been misled into crediting Vespucci by the widely published Soderini Letter, a sensationalized version of one of Vespucci&#x27;s actual letters reporting on the mapping of the South American coast, which glamorized his discoveries and implied that he had recognized that South America was a continent separate from Asia. Spain officially refused to accept the name &quot;America&quot; for two centuries, saying that Columbus should get credit, and Waldseemüller&#x27;s later maps, after Ringmann&#x27;s death, did not include it; in 1513 he labelled it &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; with a note about Columbus&#x27;s discovery of the land.

Following Waldseemüller, the Swiss scholar Heinrich Glarean included the name America in a 1528 work of geography published in Basel. There, four years later, the German scholar Simon Grinaeus published a map, which Hans Holbein and Sebastian Münster (who had made sketches of Waldseemüller&#x27;s 1507 map) contributed to; this labelled the continent America Terra Nova (America, the New Land). In 1534, Joachim von Watt labelled it simply America. Gerardus Mercator applied the names North and South America on his influential 1538 world map; by this point, the naming was irrevocable. Acceptance may have been aided by the &quot;natural poetic counterpart&quot; that the name &quot;America&quot; made with &quot;Asia, Africa,&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot;.

==Named after a Nicaraguan mountain range==
In 1874, Thomas Belt published the indigenous name of the Amerrisque Mountains in present-day Nicaragua. The next year, Jules Marcou suggested a derivation of the continent&#x27;s name from this mountain range. Marcou corresponded with Augustus Le Plongeon, who wrote: &quot;The name AMERICA or AMERRIQUE in the Mayan language means, a country of perpetually strong wind, or the Land of the Wind, and ... the [suffixes] can mean ... a spirit that breathes, life itself.&quot;

In this view, native speakers shared this indigenous word with Columbus and members of his crew, and Columbus made landfall in the vicinity of these mountains on his fourth voyage. The name America then spread via oral means throughout Europe relatively quickly even reaching Waldseemüller, who was preparing a map of newly reported lands for publication in 1507. Waldseemüller&#x27;s work in the area of denomination takes on a different aspect in this view. Jonathan Cohen of &quot;Stony Brook University&quot; writes:The baptismal passage in the &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot; has commonly been read as argument, in which the author said that he was naming the newly discovered continent in honor of Vespucci and saw no reason for objections. But, as etymologist Joy Rea has suggested, it could also be read as an explanation, in which he indicates that he has heard the New World was called America, and the only explanation lay in Vespucci&#x27;s name.

Among the reasons which proponents give in adopting this theory include the recognition of, in Cohen&#x27;s words, &quot;the simple fact that place names usually originate informally in the spoken word and first circulate that way, not in the printed word&quot;. In addition, Waldseemüller not only is exonerated from the charge of having arrogated to himself the privilege of naming lands, which privilege was reserved to monarchs and explorers, but also is freed from the charge of violating the long-established and virtually inviolable ancient European tradition of using only the first name of royal individuals as opposed to the last name of commoners (such as Vespucci) in bestowing names to lands.

==Richard Amerike==
Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd suggested in 1908 that the name was derived from the surname &quot;Amerike&quot; or &quot;ap Meryk&quot; and was used on early British maps that have since been lost. Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to Richard Amerike was a wealthy Anglo-Welsh merchant, royal customs officer and sheriff of Bristol. According to some writers, he was the principal owner of the &quot;Matthew&quot;, the ship sailed by John Cabot during his voyage of exploration to North America in 1497. The idea that Richard Amerike was a &#x27;principal supporter&#x27; of Cabot has gained popular currency in the 21st century. There is no evidence to support this. Similarly, and contrary to a recent tradition that names Amerike as principal owner and main funder of the &quot;Matthew&quot;, Cabot&#x27;s ship of 1497, academic enquiry does not connect Amerike with the ship. Her ownership at that date remains uncertain. Macdonald asserts that the caravel was specifically built for the Atlantic crossing.

Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at the 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot;. In &quot;Richard Ameryk and the name America,&quot; Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for delivering the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503). Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Hudd also thought it unlikely that America would have been named after Vespucci&#x27;s given name rather than his family name. Hudd used a quote from a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497. Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot;, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci. While Hudd&#x27;s speculation has found support from some authors, there is no strong evidence to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.

Moreover, because Amerike&#x27;s coat of arms was similar to the flag later adopted by the independent United States, a legend grew that the North American continent had been named for him rather than for Amerigo Vespucci. It is not widely accepted - the origin is usually attributed to the flag of the British East India Company.

==Native naming of the continent==
In 1977, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (Consejo Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas) proposed using the term Abya Yala instead of &quot;America&quot; when referring to the continent. There are also names in other indigenous languages such as Ixachitlan and Runa Pacha. Some scholars have adopted the term as an objection to colonialism.

<doc id="174684" wikidata="Q220856" url="?curid=174684" title="Charles Renouvier">
<text>Charles Bernard Renouvier (; 1 January 1815 – 1 September 1903) was a French philosopher. He considered himself a &quot;Swedenborg of history&quot; who sought to update the philosophy of Kantian liberalism and individualism for the socio-economic realities of the late nineteenth century, and influenced the sociological method of Émile Durkheim.

==Biography==
Renouvier was born in Montpellier and educated in Paris at the École Polytechnique. He took an early interest in politics, but never held public office, spending his time writing, away from public scrutiny.

==Philosophy==
Renouvier was the first French philosopher after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kant&#x27;s, as his chosen term &quot;néo-criticisme&quot; indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.

The two leading ideas are the dislike of the &quot;unknowable&quot; in all its forms, and a reliance on the validity of personal experience. The former accounts for Renouvier&#x27;s acceptance of Kant&#x27;s phenomenalism, combined with rejection of the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. It accounts, too, for his polemic on the one hand against a Substantial Soul, a Buddhistic Absolute, an Infinite Spiritual Substance; on the other hand against the no less mysterious material or dynamic substratum by which naturalistic Monism explains the world. He maintains that nothing exists except presentations, which are not merely sensational, and have an objective aspect no less than a subjective. To explain the formal organization of our experience, Renouvier adopts a modified version of the Kantian categories.

The insistence on the validity of personal experience leads Renouvier to a yet more important divergence from Kant in his treatment of volition. Liberty, he says, in a much wider sense than Kant, is man&#x27;s fundamental characteristic. Human freedom acts in the phenomenal, not in an imaginary noumenal sphere. Belief is not merely intellectual, but is determined by an act of will affirming what we hold to be morally good.

Renouvier&#x27;s dislike of the unknowable also led him to take up arms against the notion of an actual infinite. He believed that an infinite sum must be a name for something incomplete. If one begins to count, &quot;one, two, three ...&quot; there never comes a time when one is entitled to shout &quot;infinity&quot;! Infinity is a project, never a fact, in the neocritical view.

Renouvier became an important influence upon the thought of American psychologist and philosopher William James. James wrote that &quot;but for the decisive impression made on me in the 1870s by his masterly advocacy of pluralism, I might never have got free from the monistic superstition under which I had grown up.&quot;

==Religious views==

In his religious views, Renouvier makes a considerable approximation to Gottfried Leibniz. He holds that we are rationally justified in affirming human immortality and the existence of a finite God who is to be a constitutional ruler, but not a despot, over the souls of people. He nevertheless regards atheism as preferable to a belief in an infinite Deity.

Renouvier rejected absolute idealism, Spinozism and classical Christian theology finding its views on an infinite, omniscient and omnipotent God to be deterministic. Instead he posited a finite personal God that was good but limited in knowledge and power. His theology preserved human free will and absolved God from evil that humans commit. He described God as the &quot;permanent personality in the world&quot;.

<text>The LNER Class A4 is a class of streamlined 4-6-2 steam locomotive designed by Nigel Gresley for the London and North Eastern Railway in 1935. Their streamlined design gave them high-speed capability as well as making them instantly recognisable, and one of the class, 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;, holds the record as the world&#x27;s fastest steam locomotive. Thirty-five of the class were built to haul express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line route from London Kings Cross via York to Newcastle, and later via Newcastle to Edinburgh, Scotland. They remained in service on the East Coast Main Line until the early 1960s when they were replaced by Deltic diesel locomotives; they themselves proving to be worthy successors to the A4s. Several A4s saw out their remaining days until 1966 in Scotland, particularly on the Aberdeen – Glasgow express trains, for which they were used to improve the timing from 3.5 to 3 hours.

== Overview ==
Gresley introduced the Class A4 locomotives in 1935 to haul streamlined &quot;Silver Jubilee trains&quot; between London King&#x27;s Cross and Newcastle. The service was named in celebration of the 25th year of King George V&#x27;s reign.

During a visit to Germany in 1933, Gresley had been inspired by high-speed streamlined &quot;Flying Hamburger&quot; diesel trains. The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) had considered purchasing similar trains for use from London to Newcastle but the diesel units of the time did not have sufficient passenger carrying capacity and the capital investment in the new technology was prohibitive.

Gresley was sure that steam could do equally well with a decent fare-paying load behind the locomotive. Following trials in 1935 in which one of his A3 Pacifics, No. 2750 &quot;Papyrus&quot;, recorded a new maximum of and completed the journey in under four hours, the LNER&#x27;s Chief General Manager Ralph Wedgwood authorised Gresley to produce a streamlined development of the A3. Initially four locomotives were built, all with the word &#x27;silver&#x27; in their names. The first was 2509 &quot;Silver Link&quot;, followed by 2510 &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, 2511 &quot;Silver King&quot; and 2512 &quot;Silver Fox&quot;. During a press run to publicise the service, &quot;Silver Link&quot; twice achieved a speed of , breaking the British speed record and sustained an average of , over a distance of .

Following the commercial success of the &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; train, other streamlined services were introduced: &quot;The Coronation&quot; (London-Edinburgh, July 1937) and the &quot;West Riding Limited&quot; (Bradford &amp; Leeds-London &amp; return, November 1937) for which more A4s were built.

==Design==
The A4 Pacifics were designed for high-speed passenger services. The application of internal streamlining to the steam circuit, higher boiler pressure and the extension of the firebox to form a combustion chamber all contributed to a more efficient locomotive than the A3; consumption of coal and water were reduced. A further design improvement was fitting a Kylchap double-chimney, first on No. 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; in March 1938. The double-chimney improved the capability of the locomotives further, and the last three locomotives of the class (4901 &quot;Capercaillie&quot;, 4902 &quot;Seagull&quot; and 4903 &quot;Peregrine&quot;) were fitted with the Kylchap exhaust from new and the rest of the class acquired it in the late 1950s.

The class was noted for its streamlined design, which not only improved its aerodynamics, increasing its speed capabilities, but also created an updraught to lift smoke away from the driver&#x27;s line of vision, a problem inherent in many steam locomotives particularly those operated with short cut off valve events; fitting smoke deflectors was an alternative solution. The distinctive design made it a particularly attractive subject for artists, photographers and film-makers. The A4 Class locomotives were known by trainspotters as &quot;streaks&quot;.

The streamlining side skirts (valances) designed by Oliver Bulleid to aerofoil shape that were fitted to all the A4 locomotives, were removed during the Second World War to improve access to the valve gear for maintenance and were not replaced. This apart, the A4 was one of few streamlined steam locomotive designs in the world to retain its casing throughout its existence. Many similar designs, including the contemporary Coronation Class, had their streamlining removed or cancelled to cut costs, simplify maintenance and increase driver visibility.

==World record==

On 3 July 1938, 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; - the first of the class to enter service with the Kylchap exhaust - pulling six coaches and a dynamometer car, set a world speed record (indicated by the dynamometer) of . Gresley never accepted it as the record-breaking maximum. He claimed this speed could only have been attained over a few yards, though he was comfortable that the German speed record of had been surpassed. Close analysis of the dynamometer roll (currently at the NRM) of the record run confirms that &quot;Mallard&quot;&#x27;s speed did in fact exceed that of the German BR 05 002. The &quot;Mallard&quot; record reached its maximum speed on a downhill run and failed technically in due course, whereas 05 002&#x27;s journey was on level grade and the engine did not yet seem to be at its limit. On the other hand, the German train was four coaches long (197 tons), but Mallard&#x27;s train had seven coaches (240 tons).
One fact, often ignored when considering rival claims, is that Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a 15 mph permanent way check just north of Grantham; despite this a record was set. Gresley planned another attempt in September 1939, but was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. Prior to the record run on 3 July 1938, it was calculated that was possible; Driver Duddington and LNER Inspector Sid Jenkins both said they might well have achieved this figure had they not had to slow for the Essendine junctions.

At the end of &quot;Mallard&quot;&#x27;s record run, the middle big end (part of the motion for the inside cylinder) ran hot (indicated by the bursting of a heat-sensitive &quot;stink bomb&quot; placed in the bearing for warning purposes), the bearing metal had melted and the locomotive had to stop at Peterborough rather than continue to London. Deficiencies in the alignment of the Gresley-Holcroft derived motion meant that the inside cylinder of the A4 did more work at high speed than the two outside cylinders – on at least one occasion this led to the middle big end wearing to such an extent that the increased piston travel knocked the ends off the middle cylinder – and this overloading was mostly responsible for the failure.

== Performance in service ==
No other British steam locomotives have a longer or more consistent record of high speed running than the A4s. Instances of 100 mph running by them must exceed those of all other types combined, though 90 mph running was a relatively rare event with steam traction, much less 100 mph. It should also be remembered that A4s operated on the East Coast Main Line which has more opportunities for high speed running (particularly Stoke Bank) than any other in the UK.

In August 1936, the Silver Jubilee train on the descent of Stoke Bank headed by No. 2512 &quot;Silver Fox&quot; driven by George Henry Haygreen achieved a maximum of , then the highest speed attained in Britain with an ordinary passenger train. 
The fastest recorded post-war speed with British steam was also recorded by an A4. This occurred on 23 May 1959 on the Stephenson Locomotive Society Golden Jubilee special when No. 60007 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; achieved 112 mph when hauling 400 tons down Stoke Bank. The driver, Bill Hoole, had hoped for an attempt to beat Mallard&#x27;s record, but Alan Pegler, who was on the footplate and mindful of the risks, told him to ease off.

Although A4s were primarily designed for high speed express work they were also capable of high power outputs. In 1940, 4901 &quot;Capercaillie&quot; exerted 2,200 drawbar horsepower on the straight and level track north of York when hauling 21 coaches (730 tons gross) at an average of 75.9 mph for 25 miles. On W.A. Tuplin&#x27;s method for grading steam locomotive performance based on both power output and duration of effort, this was the highest value ever achieved by any British locomotive, at Grade 26.

The highest recorded power output from an A4 was 2,450 drawbar horsepower when &quot;Mallard&quot; herself was hauling 11 coaches (390 tons tare, 415 tons gross) &quot;up&quot; Stoke Bank at a sustained 80 mph in 1963. O. S. Nock thought this performance superior to Mallard&#x27;s world record run in 1938. An A4 with the same load on a &quot;good run&quot; would be doing about 50 to 60 mph at the summit of Stoke Bank. On a run on 8 September 1961 &quot;Mallard&quot; had its train travelling at 78 mph.

==Post-war history==

Although newer Pacifics had been introduced since the war and the streamlined trains were never reinstated, the A4s continued on top link duties, notably on the London to Edinburgh services.

Even after the war was over, the A4s still continued to perform non-stop services. In August 1948, No. 60028 &quot;Walter K. Whigham&quot; managed to perform a non-stop service run from King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh, setting the record for distance travelled for 408.65 miles. It would hold this record until No. 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;&#x27;s visit to Australia in 1988.

Improved methods of aligning the Gresley conjugated valve gear in the 1950s led to tighter tolerances for the bearings used within it and, consequently, to almost total eradication of the overloading of the middle cylinder. History repeated itself with the inside big end being replaced by one of the Great Western type, after which there was no more trouble, provided that maintenance routines were respected.

The wholesale application of double Kylchap chimneys to the entire class was entirely due to the persistence of P.N. Townend, the Assistant Motive Power Superintendent at London King&#x27;s Cross from 1956. He, at first, met with considerable resistance from higher authority. When permission was eventually given, it was found that the economy obtained over the single chimney A4s was from six to seven pounds of coal per mile, which more than justified the expense of the conversion.

These improvements led to greatly increased availability.

==Locomotive data==
The first four locomotives included the word &#x27;silver&#x27; in their names because they were intended to haul the &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; train. 2512 &quot;Silver Fox&quot; of this batch carried a stainless-steel fox near the centre of the streamline casing on each side, made by the Sheffield steelmakers Samuel Fox and Company. The next batch of A4s were named after birds, particularly those that were fast flyers, Gresley being a keen bird-watcher. Five (4488–92) were named after British Empire countries to haul the new Anglo-Scottish &quot;Coronation&quot; train; and two (4495/6), intended to haul the new &quot;West Riding Limited&quot;, received names connected to the wool trade: &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; and &quot;Golden Shuttle&quot;.

4498 was the hundredth Gresley Pacific to be built and was named after him. Subsequently, some other A4s were later renamed, usually to names of directors of the LNER.

== Withdrawal ==

One locomotive was withdrawn and scrapped after being damaged beyond repair in a German bombing raid on York on 29 April 1942 during World War II; this was No. 4469 &quot;Sir Ralph Wedgwood&quot;, which at the time had been overhauled and was based at Gateshead. It was running local trains to run it in and was stabled in York North Shed (now the National Railway Museum) where it suffered a direct hit; however, its tender survived and was later coupled to a Thompson A2/1.

The next five withdrawals, in December 1962, were: 60003 &quot;Andrew K. McCosh&quot;, 60014 &quot;Silver Link&quot;, 60028 &quot;Walter K. Whigham&quot;, 60030 &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; and 60033 &quot;Seagull&quot;. The rest of the class was withdrawn between 1963 and 1966. The last six in service were: 60004 &quot;William Whitelaw&quot;, 60007 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot;, 60009 &quot;Union of South Africa&quot;, 60019 &quot;Bittern&quot;, 60024 &quot;Kingfisher&quot; and 60034 &quot;Lord Faringdon&quot;. 60019 and 60024 were the last to be withdrawn in September 1966.

== Preservation ==
Six of the locomotives have been preserved; three of them were assigned to sheds in Scotland after the closure of King&#x27;s Cross shed (34A) to steam in 1964. Four A4s are in the UK and have run on the BR main lines at some point during their preservation career. Another two (&quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; and &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;) were donated to the Canada and the US, respectively, upon withdrawal by British Railways. Both North American-based A4s, along with the other three British-based A4s were moved to the National Railway Museum, York, in late 2012 on three-year loans as part of the NRM&#x27;s 2013 celebrations of the 75th anniversary of &quot;Mallard&quot; breaking the world speed record for steam, bringing all six preserved A4s together. During 2013, 4464 &#x27;Bittern&#x27; underwent a series of high-speed runs, partly in commemoration of &quot;Mallard&quot;&#x27;s record, partly to see if mainline speeds for certain heritage steam locomotives could be increased (The current maximum is 75 mph.). During the &quot;Tyne Tees Streak&quot; run, Bittern broke its own 91 mph speed record set just a few months prior by reaching a maximum speed of 93 mph (149.7 km/h).

From 2015 to 2020, &quot;Union of South Africa&quot; was the only A4 operational with a valid mainline certificate until it expired in 2020; 60007 was withdrawn for overhaul on 20 September 2015 and 4464 operated until the end of 2015 at the Watercress Line when it was withdrawn and placed on static display in 2018 at Crewe. Union of South Africa was withdrawn in October 2021 due to boiler issues and with the coming expiration of its boiler certificate in early 2022. &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; returned to the mainline on 21 April 2022 and worked its inaugural railtour on 21 May 2022 following the completion of its major overhaul. As of 2023, 5 of 6 surviving A4&#x27;s are on static display, the only working one being 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley. 60019 is planned to be moved from Margate to North Yorkshire for a mainline standard overhaul in 2024.

Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.
==Models==
One of the first two Hornby Dublo locomotive models produced, in 1938, was an A4. In 1999 a &#x27;Super Detail&#x27; Hornby A4 was released, later complemented by a budget &#x27;Railroad&#x27; model Hornby also produced an &#x27;OO&#x27;-scale live steam version in September 2003, that used an electrically heated boiler to produce steam – not previously possible in such a small model. Trix produced an &#x27;OO&#x27; scale model A4 from 1970; it was re-branded as a Liliput model in 1974 and survives to this day in modified form as a Bachmann model – Kader, Bachmann&#x27;s parent company, had bought Liliput in 1993. In September 2004, Hornby unveiled retooled OO gauge models of the A4 in LNER blue, LNER black and BR green.

During the 1980s, Minitrix produced British N gauge models of &quot;Mallard&quot;, both as 4468 in LNER blue and 60022 in BR green, and 4498 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; in LNER blue. From the 1990s, Graham Farish produced British N gauge models of the A4. In 2012, Dapol introduced a British N gauge model of 60017 &quot;Silver Fox&quot; in BR green.

<text>Carl Bosch (; 27 August 1874 – 26 April 1940) was a German chemist and engineer and Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. He was a pioneer in the field of high-pressure industrial chemistry and founder of IG Farben, at one point the world&#x27;s largest chemical company.

He also developed the Haber–Bosch process, important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that one-third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half of the world&#x27;s population. In addition, he co-developed the so-called Bosch-Meiser process for the industrial production of urea.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Carl Bosch was born in Cologne to a successful gas and plumbing supplier. His father was Carl Friedrich Alexander Bosch (1843–1904) and his uncle was Robert Bosch, who pioneered the development of the spark plug and founded the multinational company Bosch. Carl, trying to decide between a career in metallurgy or chemistry, studied at the &quot;Königlich Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg&quot; (now Technische Universität Berlin) and the University of Leipzig from 1892 to 1898. 

=== Career ===
Carl Bosch attended the University of Leipzig, and this is where he studied under Johannes Wislicenus, and he obtained his doctorate in 1898 for research in organic chemistry. After he left in 1899 he took an entry-level job at BASF, then Germany&#x27;s largest chemical and dye firm. From 1909 until 1913 he transformed Fritz Haber&#x27;s tabletop demonstration of a method to fix nitrogen using high-pressure chemistry through the Haber–Bosch process to produce synthetic nitrate, a process that has countless industrial applications for making a near-infinite variety of industrial compounds, consumer goods, and commercial products. His primary contribution was to expand the scale of the process, enabling the industrial production of vast quantities of synthetic nitrate. To do this, he had to construct a plant and equipment that would function effectively under high gas pressures and high temperatures. Bosch was also responsible for finding a more practical catalyst than the scarce osmium and expensive uranium being used by Haber.

There were many more obstacles as well, such as designing large compressors and safe high-pressure furnaces. A means was needed to provide pure hydrogen gas in quantity as the feedstock. Also, cheap and safe means had to be developed to clean and process the product ammonia. The first full-scale Haber–Bosch plant was erected in Oppau, Germany, now part of Ludwigshafen. With the process complete he was able to synthesize large amounts of ammonia, which was available for the industrial and agricultural fields. In fact, this production has increased the agricultural yields throughout the world. This work won him the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1931.

After World War I Bosch extended high-pressure techniques to the production of synthetic fuel via the Bergius process and methanol. In 1925 Bosch helped found IG Farben, and was the first head of the company. From 1935, Bosch was chairman of the board of directors.

He received the Siemens-Ring in 1924 for his contributions to applied research and his support of basic research. In 1931 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Friedrich Bergius for the introduction of high pressure chemistry. Today the Haber–Bosch process produces 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer every year. After the Nazi seizure of power, Bosch was one of the industrialists selected for membership in Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law in October 1933, where he served on the General Economic Council (&quot;Generalrat der Wirtschaft&quot;). In December 1933, Bosch received a contract to expand the production of synthetic oil, a development which was essential to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s future war plans.

== Personal life ==

Bosch married Else Schilbach in 1902. Carl and Else had a son and a daughter together. A critic of many Nazi policies, including anti-Semitism, Bosch was gradually relieved of his high positions, and fell into depression and alcoholism. He died in Heidelberg.

== Legacy ==
The Haber–Bosch Process today consumes more than one percent of humanity&#x27;s energy production and is responsible for feeding roughly one-third of its population. On average, one-half of the nitrogen in a human body comes from synthetically fixed sources, the product of a Haber–Bosch plant. Bosch was an ardent collector of insects, minerals, and gems. His collected meteorites and other mineral samples were loaned to Yale University, and eventually purchased by the Smithsonian. He was an amateur astronomer with a well-equipped private observatory. The asteroid 7414 Bosch was named in his honour.

Carl Bosch along with Fritz Haber were voted the world&#x27;s most influential chemical engineers of all time by members of the Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The Haber–Bosch process, quite possibly the best-known chemical process in the world, which captures nitrogen from the air and converts it to ammonia, has its hand in the process of the Green Revolution that has been feeding the increasing population of the world.

Bosch also won numerous awards including an honorary doctorate from Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (1918), the Liebig Memorial Medal of the Association of German Chemists along with the Bunsen Medal of the German Bunsen Society, the Siemens Ring, and the Golden Grashof Memorial medal of the VDI. In 1931 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the contribution to the invention of chemical high pressure methods. He also received the Exner medal from the Austrian Trade Association and the Carl Lueg Memorial Medal. Bosch also enjoyed his membership of various German and foreign scientific academics, and his chairmanship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society of which he became the President in 1937.

<doc id="174687" wikidata="Q233804" url="?curid=174687" title="Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland">
<text>Margaret of Denmark (23 June 1456 – 14 July 1486) was Queen of Scots from 1469 to 1486 by marriage to King James III. She was the daughter of Christian I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and Dorothea of Brandenburg.

==Life==
Margaret was born in Denmark to King Christian I and Queen Dorothea of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Not much is known about her upbringing. By the time she was four years old there were talks about her marriage to the Scottish Prince James. In 1468 Margaret was betrothed to James of Scotland as a means to stop a feud regarding the debt Scotland owed Denmark over the taxation of the Hebrides and Isle of Man. The marriage was arranged on the recommendation of king Charles VII of France. In July 1469, at the age of 13 she married James III at Holyrood Abbey. Upon their marriage all of the Scottish debt was cancelled. William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, was at that time the Norse Earl of Orkney. In 1472 he was made to exchange his Orkney fief for Ravenscraig Castle, so the Scottish throne took the earl&#x27;s rights to the islands too.

Queen Margaret was given the largest jointure allowed by Scottish law in her marriage settlement – one third of the royal revenues, together with Linlithgow Palace and Doune Castle. She was interested in clothes and jewellery, and known for always being dressed in the latest fashions of the time. Following the birth of her son James, in 1473 she went on a pilgrimage to Whithorn and then rejoined the king at Falkland Palace. She may have taught her son James to speak Danish. She became a popular queen in Scotland and was described as beautiful, gentle, and sensible.

The relationship between Margaret and James III was not described as a happy one. Reportedly, she was not very fond of her husband and had sexual intercourse with him only for procreation, though she did respect his position as a monarch. One reason for their estrangement was that James favoured their second son over their eldest. In 1476, James had decided that he wanted the Earldom of Ross for his second son and accused John MacDonald, the Earl, of treason. Macdonald was then put on trial before the Parliament, but upon Margaret&#x27;s request he was allowed to remain as Lord of Parliament. During the crisis of 1482, when James III was deprived of power by his brother for several months, Margaret was said to have shown more interest in the welfare of her children than her spouse, which led to a permanent estrangement. Politically, she worked for the reinstatement of her spouse in his powers as monarch during this incident. After the crisis of 1482, the couple lived apart: James III lived in Edinburgh, while queen Margaret preferred to live in Stirling with her children.

== Death ==
Margaret died at Stirling Castle on 14 July 1486 after falling ill, and was buried in Cambuskenneth Abbey. Her husband, James III, was interred with her after his death in 1488. The abbey has mostly been reduced to ruins, apart from its bell-tower, which is still standing today. The grave was enclosed and restored in 1865 at the expense of their descendant, Queen Victoria.

A story told by her son claims that Margaret was killed by poison given to her by John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell, leader of one of the political factions. As he was still favoured by the royal family after her death, this is doubtful and maybe slanderous, although he did know poisons.

== Jewels and costume ==
Records of costume and fabric bought for Margaret of Denmark survive in the accounts of the Lord Treasurers of Scotland. Fabrics and fur were bought by her chamber and wardrobe servants, Andrew Balfour, Caldwell, and Sandris Wardrop (Sanders of the Wardrobe), from merchants and shopkeepers in Edinburgh including Isobel Williamson, Thomas Yare, and Sandy Turing. Shoes were made by Hud, described as a &quot;souter&quot;. A skinner in Stirling made leather gloves. Garments made in 1473 and 1474 include gowns of blue velvet and red satin, cloaks, a kirtle of green damask, a riding gown, &quot;stomaks&quot; made of satin lined with ermine, &quot;bonnets of tire&quot;, &quot;turrets&quot; (veils), tippets and collars of velvet trimmed with fur. Gowns were also bought for the six gentlewomen of her chamber.

An inventory of a chest or &quot;kist&quot; and a coffer called a &quot;gardeviant&quot; from Stirling Castle containing some of the jewels of Margaret of Denmark was made in 1488 following the battle of Sauchieburn. The contents included belts of cloth of gold and crimson fabric with gold fittings. There were rosaries and gold chains, a collar of chalcedony with a pendant including a container of musk perfume, a pearl &quot;fret&quot; (a hair net), a swan collar, a small bag with nine unset precious stones, and a bag of lavender. There was a serpent tongue (a fossilized shark&#x27;s tooth thought to be a safeguard against poison) and a piece of a unicorn horn set in gold, probably used to assay food at meals. She also owned a ring set with a &quot;paddock stone&quot;, a toadstone also valued as an antidote to poison. There was a book of gold leaf for gilding, and purple bed curtains and a counterpane embroidered with thistles and unicorns. She had a pendant fashioned as her initial &quot;M&quot; set in diamonds with a great pearl.

<text>Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien is an American television talk show broadcast by NBC. The show is the second installment of the &quot;Late Night&quot; franchise originally established by David Letterman. Hosted by Conan O&#x27;Brien, it aired from September 13, 1993 to February 20, 2009, replacing &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and was replaced by &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. &quot;Late Night&quot; aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. From 1993 until 2000, Andy Richter served as O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s sidekick; following his departure, O&#x27;Brien was the show&#x27;s sole featured performer. The show&#x27;s house musical act was The Max Weinberg 7 and led by E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg.

In 2004, as part of a deal to secure a new contract, NBC announced that O&#x27;Brien would leave &quot;Late Night&quot; in 2009 to succeed Jay Leno as the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Jimmy Fallon began hosting his version of &quot;Late Night&quot; on March 2, 2009.

==History==
===Replacing David Letterman===
Upon Johnny Carson&#x27;s retirement from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1992, executives at NBC announced that Carson&#x27;s frequent guest-host Jay Leno would be Carson&#x27;s replacement, not David Letterman. NBC later said that Letterman&#x27;s high ratings for &quot;Late Night&quot; were the reason they kept him where he was. Letterman was bitterly disappointed and angry at not having been given &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; job; and, at Carson&#x27;s advice, he left NBC after eleven years on &quot;Late Night&quot;. CBS signed Letterman to host his own show opposite &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Letterman moved his show to CBS virtually unchanged, taking most of the staff, skits, and comedy formats with him. However, NBC owned the rights to the &quot;Late Night&quot; name, forcing Letterman to rename his show &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

NBC was not prepared to replace both Letterman and &quot;Late Night&quot;. Aside from the name, it needed to build a new show. Both Dana Carvey and Garry Shandling declined to host it. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels was brought in to develop the new show, and comedians Jon Stewart, Drew Carey, and Paul Provenza auditioned to host. Michaels suggested to Conan O&#x27;Brien, an unknown writer for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and former writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, that he should audition for the job. Despite having &quot;about 40 seconds&quot; of television-performance experience as an occasional extra on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches, O&#x27;Brien auditioned for the show on April 13, 1993. His guests were Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers; the audition took place on the set of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. NBC offered the show to O&#x27;Brien on April 26, and O&#x27;Brien made his first meaningful television appearance later that day when Leno introduced him on &quot;Tonight&quot;. On the final episode of his 16-year run, O&#x27;Brien stated that he &quot;owed his career to Lorne Michaels&quot;.

===Debut===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; debuted on September 13, 1993, with Andy Richter chosen as O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s sidekick. The premiere episode featured John Goodman, who received a &quot;First Guest&quot; medal for his appearance, Drew Barrymore, and Tony Randall with cameos from George Wendt and Bob Costas. The episode featured a cold open of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s walk to the studio with constant reminders that he was expected to live up to Letterman. Tom Brokaw makes a cameo, welcoming O&#x27;Brien to NBC but, doing as those on O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s walk had done, warning him that he had &quot;better be as good as Letterman, or else...&quot;, before menacingly crushing saltine crackers in front of O&#x27;Brien, appearing to be representative of the fate that awaited the new host if he failed to meet expectations. After seeming to be unaffected by the comments, O&#x27;Brien arrives at his dressing room and cheerfully prepares to hang himself. However, a warning that the show is about to start causes him to abandon his plans.

The show&#x27;s first musical guest was English rock band Radiohead, who performed during the second episode. American singer-songwriter Jonathan Richman was the show&#x27;s second musical guest.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s inexperience was apparent, and the show was generally considered mediocre by critics in terms of hosting. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times″&quot; Lon Grankhe called O&#x27;Brien &quot;nervous, unprepared and generally geeky&quot;, and Tom Shales wrote &quot;As for O&#x27;Brien, the young man is a living collage of annoying nervous habits. He giggles and titters, jiggles about and fiddles with his cuffs. He has dark, beady little eyes like a rabbit. He&#x27;s one of the whitest white men ever.&quot; (O&#x27;Brien wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; a satirical review of the first episode the day it aired titled &quot;O&#x27;Brien Flops!&quot;, in which he told readers &quot;Frankly, I was not impressed&quot;.) The originality and quality of the comedy, however, led by original head writer Robert Smigel, was widely praised. Although O&#x27;Brien benefited by comparison from the quick critical and commercial failure of the fellow new late-night &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot;, NBC only offered short-term contracts, 13 weeks at a time and once for six weeks, as widely reported by the press at the time. O&#x27;Brien was reportedly almost fired at least once in this period, but NBC had no one to replace him. According to Smigel, &quot;We were basically canceled at &quot;Conan&quot;, and then they changed their minds in August of &#x27;94, gave us a reprieve.&quot;

In an unusual form of advertising, Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s credits in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot; episode, originally aired on October 28, 1993 (and produced before O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s left the &quot;Simpsons&quot; writing staff to host &quot;Late Night&quot;), reference his new role as host of &quot;Late Night&quot;, including one credit that lists &quot;Watch My Show&quot; as his &quot;middle&quot; name. (All &quot;Simpsons&quot; &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes credit the voice cast and crew under Halloween-associated nicknames, some being faux middle names in quotation marks.)

One NBC affiliate, KPRC-TV in Houston, dropped &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in September 1994 due to low ratings and replaced it with the syndicated &quot;Jenny Jones Show&quot;. KPRC reinstated O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; in the fall of 1996, but scheduled it to air as late as 2:40 a.m.; over the next eight years, the station, in addition to &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, had aired various other first-run syndicated programs (&quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, &quot;Montel Williams&quot; and &quot;Inside Edition&quot;) and a rebroadcast of its 10:00 p.m. newscast between Leno and O&#x27;Brien after it reinstated &quot;Late Night&quot;. Houston became the subject of a 1997 skit (via classic remote piece) in which O&#x27;Brien made impromptu stops at Houston&#x27;s central bus terminal and the Astrodome to watch an episode of his own show with Houstonians. In response to emails sent by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s fans following the skit regarding its graveyard placement, KPRC moved the show to 12:35 a.m. in 1998; it would eventually move &quot;Late Night&quot; to its network-assigned timeslot, immediately following &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, in 2004.

According to O&#x27;Brien, NBC network executive Warren Littlefield told him, with regard to Andy Richter, he&#x27;d &quot;never succeed until I &#x27;got rid of that big fat dildo.&#x27; That was the tone of the conversations between us and the network.&quot; It was widely expected that the host of &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, Greg Kinnear would take over the role, but Kinnear turned down the opportunity. (Kinnear would instead become host of &quot;Late Night&quot;″s then-lead-out program, &quot;Later&quot;, in February 1994, remaining there for two years before deciding to pursue an acting career.) Stars like Tom Hanks agreed to appear on &quot;Late Night&quot;, which boosted audience awareness. Even Letterman, who admired O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s comic sensibility, appeared as a guest to register his support. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s performance style improved through experience, and he began to receive more favorable reviews and ratings the following year. With the ratings gradually improving over the course of two years, &quot;Late Night&quot; reached a new level of critical and commercial success in 1996. Tom Shales officially recanted his previous critical review with the headline &quot;I was wrong&quot;, and O&#x27;Brien received his first Emmy nomination for writing, which he received every year until 2011.

===1996–2000===

In 2000, Richter left &quot;Late Night&quot; on good terms, to pursue his acting career, a move that emotionally affected O&#x27;Brien, as evidenced by Richter&#x27;s last show. The show&#x27;s comedy bits and banter had usually depended on O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s interaction with Richter. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s wacky non-sequitur comedy became more pronounced as he played all of his comedy and commentary directly to the audience and Max Weinberg instead of towards Richter.

===2001–2009===

In 2002, when time came to renew his contract, O&#x27;Brien had notable offers from other networks to defect; Fox was reported to have made particularly strong overtures, pitching him an 11:00 p.m. show. O&#x27;Brien decided to re-sign with NBC, however, joking that he initially wanted to make a 13-week deal (a nod to his first contract). He ultimately signed through 2005, indicating that it was symbolic of surpassing Letterman&#x27;s run with 12 years of hosting.

In 2003, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s own production company, Conaco, was added as a producer of &quot;Late Night&quot;. The show celebrated its 10th anniversary, another milestone that O&#x27;Brien said he wanted to achieve with his 2002 contract. During the anniversary show, Mr. T handed O&#x27;Brien a chain with a large gold &quot;7&quot; on it.
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s last season on &quot;Late Night&quot; attracted an average of 1.98 million viewers, compared to 1.92 million viewers for &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;.

==Format==

===Humor===
The show was known for its wacky and absurd sophomoric comedic sensibility that is edgier than most other talk shows. Like his &quot;Late Night&quot; predecessor, David Letterman, the show&#x27;s humor also had a streak of biting sarcasm and irony. According to Robert Smigel, who served as head writer in 1993, the show&#x27;s comedic approach was to focus on being different from David Letterman:

Typically O&#x27;Brien would play the &#x27;straight man&#x27; role to the general absurdity of the comedy, treating the material or wacky nature of the sketches with sincerity. The show had an unusual quantity of comedy and original content rather than other talk shows such as &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; or &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that relied heavily on recurring segments and &#x27;found&#x27; humor. The show was particularly unique in the lack of &#x27;found&#x27; humor to derive content from i.e. most content being scripted as opposed to Letterman&#x27;s Small Town News or Jay Leno&#x27;s headlines that used this &quot;found humor&quot;. O&#x27;Brien would often playfully chide his audience for an underwhelming or overly enthusiastic response to his jokes.

Particularly in the early years, comedic sketches overtook all segments on the show, occasionally even interrupting guest interviews and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s monologue. Frequently sketches would randomly begin without introduction, such as during banter between Richter and O&#x27;Brien. A lot of the humor had a fantasy-like quality to it, where inanimate objects would talk or silly characters would disrupt the show. Sometimes a short story would emerge in these sketches with a resolution culminating in a song.

One recurring technique is to superimpose lips onto an existing image, as in the Syncro-Vox limited animation technique, resulting in the speaker saying things often quite out of character.

Although &quot;Late Night&quot; used political humor, it did so far less frequently than competing shows did. During the 1996 and 2000 presidential election seasons, &quot;Late Night&quot; was found to be the least politically oriented late night program. It averaged 310 political jokes per election season, in contrast to the Leno-led &quot;Tonight Show&quot; with 1,275.

(See List of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; sketches for an extensive list)

===The Max Weinberg 7===
The show&#x27;s house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg. The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie &quot;LaBamba&quot; Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. Weinberg sometimes took extended leaves of absence to tour with Bruce Springsteen as the drummer for the E Street Band. During his absence, James Wormworth would typically fill in on drums, and the band was led by Vivino under the name Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7.

With the departure of Andy Richter from &quot;Late Night&quot; in May 2000, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s jokes. One common running gag was Max&#x27;s awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max&#x27;s lack of knowledge of current affairs.

&quot;LaBamba&quot; was also used as the butt of many of Conan&#x27;s jokes. These humorous sketches usually revolved around LaBamba&#x27;s sizeable mustache, his poor acting skills, and his alleged inability to read written music. Mark Pender would often sing songs on the topic of a current event which ended with him screeching uncontrollably and climbing the risers into the audience. All members of the 7 have had successful side careers as studio musicians.

====Theme song and other music====

The show&#x27;s opening theme was co-written by composer Howard Shore and John Lurie (of the band The Lounge Lizards). Lurie would later say that he was contracted by Shore to write the theme, and after he turned in the piece, Shore made minimal changes and claimed an unwarranted co-writing credit. Lurie also claimed to have been a finalist for &quot;Late Night&quot;&#x27;s band leader position, but said producers told him, &quot;Conan thinks you’re funnier than him and that scares him.&quot;

As is common in the talk show format, the Max Weinberg 7 performed the show&#x27;s opening and closing themes, played bumpers into and out of commercial breaks (they actually played through the entire break for the studio audience), and a short piece during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s crossover to his desk after his monologue. The show&#x27;s closing theme was called &quot;Cornell Knowledge&quot;, and was lifted from Jerry and Jimmy Vivino&#x27;s first album together. However, on &quot;Late Night&quot;, it was played at a much quicker tempo than the album version. The band also played a wide variety of songs as bumpers coming to and from commercial breaks and introducing guests—usually popular music from a variety of eras.

===Joel Godard===
Joel Godard, a long-time announcer for NBC shows, was the program&#x27;s announcer and a frequent comedy contributor. On the show&#x27;s final episode, Conan noted that Godard was originally hired to simply announce the show&#x27;s intro and claimed &quot;nobody thought you&#x27;d ever see him&quot;; however, he was gradually worked into the show&#x27;s comedy pieces. These bits usually revolved around Godard&#x27;s supposed homosexual fetishes, deviant sexual habits, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies. The humor came in part from Godard&#x27;s delivery. No matter how depressing or deviant the topic being discussed was, he always did so in an exaggeratedly cheerful voice and with a huge smile plastered on his face. Several sketches ended with Godard apparently committing suicide in his announcer&#x27;s booth. When Andy Richter left the show in 2000, Godard began to appear in sketches more frequently.

===Writing staff===
In the first few seasons of the show, the writing staff consisted of several now-prolific comics including Robert Smigel as the head writer, Bob Odenkirk, Louis C.K., Tommy Blacha and Dino Stamatopoulos. Smigel left his position as head writer of the show in 1995 to pen several movies but continued to appear on the show to do bits as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and the &#x27;Satellite Interviews&#x27;. Jonathan Groff took over his position until replaced by Mike Sweeney in 2001.

Members of the show&#x27;s writing staff frequently appeared in sketches on the show. Among the most prolific were: Brian McCann (Preparation H Raymond, FedEx Pope, The Loser, Airsick Moth, Jerry Butters, Awesome Dave, Funhole Guy, Bulletproof Legs Guy, Adrian &quot;Raisin&quot; Foster, S&amp;M Lincoln, etc.), Brian Stack (Hannigan the Traveling Salesman, Artie Kendall the Ghost Crooner, The Interrupter, Kilty McBagpipes, Fan-tastic Guy, Clive Clemmons, Frankenstein, Ira, Slipnut Brian, etc.), Jon Glaser (Segue Sam, Pubes, Awareness Del, Wrist Hulk, Ahole Ronald, Gorton&#x27;s Fisherman, Jeremy, Slipnut Jon, etc.), Kevin Dorff (Coked-up Werewolf, Jesus Christ, Mansy the half-man/half-pansy, Joe&#x27;s Bartender, Todd the Tiny Guy, etc.), and Andy Blitz (Awful Ballgame Chanter, Vin Diesel&#x27;s brother Leonard Diesel, Slipnut Andy, Chuck Aloo aka the star of the &quot;24&quot; spin-off series &quot;60&quot;). Blitz went so far as to travel to India for one bit in which he carried his computer through the streets of India to get technical support firsthand from the telephone representative at NBC&#x27;s technical help center.

Several writing staff interns have gone on to become noted actors or writers including Vanessa Bayer, John Krasinski, Mindy Kaling, Ellie Kemper and Jack McBrayer.

===Sketch actors and cameo appearances===
&quot;Late Night&quot; employed a number of sketch actors, many of whom were frequently reused in different roles in different episodes. Several years before joining the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and before playing the role of Leslie Knope on another NBC TV show, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Amy Poehler often appeared as a regular in many sketches, though she was best remembered for playing the recurring role of Andy Richter&#x27;s Conan-obsessed teenage sister, Stacy. Other notable comedians such as Jack McBrayer, Rob Riggle, Rob Corddry, H. Jon Benjamin, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh and Andrew Daly also frequently appeared as sketch actors on the show for several years. Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (created and voiced by original head writer Robert Smigel) began as part of a sketch on &quot;Late Night.&quot; Celebrities such as Joyce Brothers, Nipsey Russell, Abe Vigoda, James Lipton, Bob Saget and William Preston as the character Carl &#x27;Oldy&#x27; Olsen also made frequent cameo appearances in comedy sketches on the show at different periods. One of the show&#x27;s graphic designers, Pierre Bernard, was featured in several sketches, such as &quot;Pierre Bernard&#x27;s Recliner of Rage&quot; and &quot;Nerding It Up For Pierre&quot;.

Celebrity guests of the night would also occasionally appear in sketches either during their interviews or during the earlier comedy segments, e.g. in &quot;In the year 2000&quot; (which always included the participation of a celebrity guest after Andy Richter left the show) or a sketch where Conan would pretend to write in his diary while an attractive female guest was there. Quite rare for a talk show, sometimes interviews began normally but turned into sketches with both the guest and Conan participating, usually when the guest was a &quot;friend of the show.&quot;

===Costumed characters===
Unusual for a late night talk show, &quot;Late Night&quot; made frequent use of various costumed characters such as The Masturbating Bear, Robot on a Toilet, and Pimpbot 5000. The humor in these sketches often derived from the crude construction of the characters&#x27; costumes as well as the absurdist nature of their conceptions. For example, Pimpbot 5000 was a 1950s-style robot who dressed and acted in the manner of an exaggerated blaxploitation pimp, while The Masturbating Bear was a man in a bear costume wearing an oversized diaper who would invariably begin to fondle himself to the tune of Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; when brought on stage. Many of these characters did little more in their appearances than walk across the stage or be wheeled out from behind the curtain, but some had extensive sketches on the show.

==Appearances in other shows==
The show made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; special &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, where Conan was interviewing two aliens while Big Bird was passing by them carrying a video tape.

The show also made an appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot;, where Conan interviews a now famous Bart.

==Production==

&quot;Late Night&quot; was a production of Lorne Michaels&#x27;s Broadway Video (and, since 2003, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Conaco). It was taped in Studio 6A in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. Next to the door were framed pictures of Letterman, Carson, Jack Paar and Steve Allen, each of whose groundbreaking late-night shows originated from studio 6A or 6B (where &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; is currently taped). The studio holds just over 200 audience members. It was taped at about 5:30 pm as an uninterrupted hour-long program, with the band playing music through the portions that would be filled by commercials. Generally, shows were taped at 5:30 pm Monday through Friday, although for much of the show&#x27;s run, reruns would be aired on Mondays and the show would not tape that day.

The show&#x27;s format consisted of an opening monologue from O&#x27;Brien, followed by various &quot;desk bits&quot;. These generally included several brief sketches, recurring segments, or some other form of comedy. Typically O&#x27;Brien would play the &#x27;straight man&#x27; role to the general absurdity of the comedy, treating the material or wacky nature of the sketches with sincerity. In the show&#x27;s second and fourth segments, O&#x27;Brien interviewed two celebrity guests, between which, in the third segment, O&#x27;Brien listed the next night&#x27;s/week&#x27;s guests. There was often a comedy bit as well during this segment. The show&#x27;s fifth segment was usually reserved for a musical or stand-up comedy performance, or occasionally another guest interview. The show&#x27;s final segment was usually a quick &quot;goodnight&quot; and the closing credits, which sometimes featured part of a bit from earlier in the show. Quite rare for a talkshow, frequently comedy segments would also spill into the interviews, typically when a guest was a &#x27;friend&#x27; of the show.

During the live tapings, and prior to the show, there was an audience warm-up, during which the audience watched a montage of highlights from the show, and staff writer Brian McCann greeted the audience (this task was formerly undertaken by head writer Mike Sweeney). McCann delivered a few jokes, told the audience what to expect, and finally introduced the band and then O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien then thanked the audience for coming, meeting as many audience members as he could. He would often then do a musical number with the band to pump up the audience (&quot;Burning Love&quot; was one standard). After the show was finished taping, O&#x27;Brien sang the &quot;End of the Show Song&quot;, which never aired on Late Night, although in February 2009, a short video of it was posted on Late Night Underground. The End of the Show Song finally did reach air on January 21, 2010, his penultimate show as Tonight Show host. It also was aired on the March 29, 2012 episode of Conan. The tradition of singing The End of the Show Song has continued, un-aired as usual, on &quot;Conan&quot;.

===Broadcast===

&quot;Late Night&quot; began broadcasting in 1080i ATSC on April 26, 2005, with a downscaled letterboxed NTSC simulcast (unlike &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, whose NTSC simulcast is fullscreen). O&#x27;Brien celebrated the conversion to the widescreen HDTV format with jokes throughout the week.

On December 6, 2005 &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; segments began selling on the iTunes Store. Most segments were priced at $1.99, as were most episodes of other shows, with &quot;special&quot; best-ofs and other longer segments priced at $9.99. In December, 2007 NBC stopped selling all its television shows on iTunes, but the network returned it to iTunes in September 2008 after NBC and Apple worked out a new agreement. The show was offered free at Hulu.com and the NBC website but has been unavailable on the Internet since the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict. However, in May 2018, O&#x27;Brien and TBS, announced they would partner with NBC to make his entire &quot;Late Night&quot; archives available online, marking the 25th anniversary of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s late night debut.

===Set design===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; had three long-term permanent sets, but retained the basic structure used when Letterman occupied Studio 6A: the performance space at the viewer&#x27;s left, and the desk area, to the viewer&#x27;s right, where interviews were done. O&#x27;Brien did his monologue in the performance area, emerging at the start of each episode from the area where musical guests perform. The Max Weinberg 7 were in the corner made by the stage-right wall and the wall in front of the audience. The desk area had a desk for O&#x27;Brien, a chair and couch(es) to the viewer&#x27;s left for guests (and originally Andy Richter), and a coffee table.

Primarily, set changes involved the background behind the desk and chair and couch. The original set, used from the show&#x27;s debut in 1993 until August 6, 1996, was primarily yellow, and the desk background resembled the living room of a New York City apartment, with windows that looked out at a Manhattan backdrop; it was modeled after Lorne Michaels&#x27; office. For years afterwards, O&#x27;Brien mocked this original set, particularly its &quot;mustard color&quot;. The two subsequent set designs featured darker blues and violets to emulate the feel of nighttime, with the final set featuring a balcony railing in front of a backdrop with the view from the top of Rockefeller Center. This set debuted on September 4, 2001, and necessitated changes almost instantly as its backdrop view of New York City contained the World Trade Center, which was destroyed a week later. A special curtain was used to obstruct the towers until October, when the curtain became a permanent part of the set design even after the backdrop was altered. During his final week of episodes, Conan took an axe to parts of the set, giving it out to audience members as souvenirs, not wanting to allow it to simply be thrown away.

==Special episodes==

===Remote pieces and episodes shot on location===
Remote pieces shot on location were a recurring staple on &quot;Late Night&quot;, but occasionally, entire episodes were shot on location, usually during sweeps months. The first vacation for the show was a week-long stint of shows in Los Angeles the week of November 9–12, 1999. This was the only location week for the show while Andy Richter was with the show, and the only time the show&#x27;s theme was altered for the week, with a more surf-style version of the show&#x27;s normal theme (though the Toronto shows ended the normal theme with a piece of &quot;O Canada&quot;). The show was broadcast from NBC&#x27;s L.A. studios (NBC Studios Burbank) and an L.A.-themed set was built, very similar in layout to the New York set.

From February 10–13, 2004, &quot;Late Night&quot; broadcast from the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, Canada. The guests for these episodes were all Canadians (with the exception of Adam Sandler), and included such stars as Jim Carrey and Mike Myers. As the show was taped at a theater, unlike the trip to L.A., the set built was not like the show&#x27;s standard set.
From May 9–12, 2006, the show made a similar venture to the Chicago Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, taking cues from their previous trip to Toronto. Between April 30 – May 4, 2007, the show originated from the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco.

In a sketch called &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Hates My Homeland&quot;, Conan mocked every nation in the world to see which ones he gets letters from. An announcer on the Finnish entertainment channel SubTV, which airs the show a couple of days after it is aired in the US, asked people to defend Finland before Conan got to insult it, and the viewers in Finland began sending mail before the bit had even gotten to the letter F. Conan responded by assuming the Finnish &quot;just couldn&#x27;t wait&quot; to be insulted and officially insulted Finland in the segment. An overwhelming number of postcards were supposedly received, which apparently &quot;forced&quot; Conan to give Finland a formal apology. Conan then went as far as to have the flag of Finland shown in the background during a speech and slandered the Finns&#x27; &quot;hated&quot; neighbor Sweden with a sign saying &quot;Sweden Sucks!&quot; printed over the flag of Sweden. It would seem that this chain of events led to elevated ratings in Finland and subsequently also sparked a special relationship with the viewers in Finland. Later when Conan was talking to audience members before the show, a group of fans visiting from Finland commented that he resembled their female president Tarja Halonen. Conan mentioned the resemblance on his show, even showing pictures of Halonen next to himself. When he discovered that Halonen was up for reelection he began making satirical commercials in support of Halonen and vowed to travel to Finland to meet her if she won re-election. When she did indeed win re-election in January 2006, Conan traveled to Finland and met with her. One episode, broadcast on March 10, 2006, was compiled mainly of footage from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s trip to Finland. In the episode, Conan greeted fans at the airport, participated in a Sami cultural ceremony, appeared on a Finnish talk show, and attempted to visit a fan who had written to him. The episode was not strictly taped as a live episode there, however, but was prefaced by an introduction by O&#x27;Brien taped in New York. The Finland episode came as the culmination of a long-running joke on the show.

Aside from location shows, the show also did special one-shots in its early years. In 1995, one episode of the show was taped aboard a New York City ferry in New York Harbor. Dubbed &quot;The Show on a Boat&quot; by the showtunes-style song-and-dance number performed by a trio of &quot;sailors&quot; at the start of the show, O&#x27;Brien, Richter, the band and guests were all crammed onto the deck of the ferry. The show was taped at its normal afternoon time, while it was still light out.

===Technical and production difficulties===
A more unexpected shoot occurred on October 10, 1996, when a five-alarm fire in Rockefeller Plaza rendered the 6A studios out of commission for the remainder of that week. The fire occurred on early Thursday morning, which left O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s staff precious little time to assemble a show elsewhere. Pressed for time as 12:35 approached, O&#x27;Brien taped the show outside, after dark, despite the cold weather, on a makeshift set with the Prometheus statue and 30 Rock serving as a backdrop. Furthering the unfortunate nature of the evening&#x27;s circumstances was the final guest, Julie Scardina, who brought along wild animals, including birds that Conan explained had to be kept tied up, as they could not be freed outside. Earlier in the show, O&#x27;Brien and Richter walked into Brookstone (located in the lobby of Rockefeller Center), camera crew in tow, and bought a massaging leather recliner for the first guest, Samuel L. Jackson. The second of the two &quot;fire shows&quot;, on Friday night, was taped in the &quot;Today Show&quot; studio, which was not affected by the fire, though the East L.A. rock band Los Lobos performed in the blustery wind a song from their newest album Colossal Head.

During the Northeast blackout of 2003, O&#x27;Brien and the staff taped a short 10-minute introduction explaining that the episode they had planned would not be taking place due to the blackout. Studio 6A was powered by a generator and lit by battery-powered floodlights. A standby show was aired in-progress after the intro. One of the scheduled guests that night, The Dandy Warhols, commandeered the studio&#x27;s green room, where they stayed until they performed on the show the next night.

===Gimmick episodes===
Other shows that were taped in the regular 6A studio were augmented by special gimmicks:

A lot of high-concept gimmick episodes were done in the early years of the show, such as a 1995 show done entirely on a boat of the circle line or &quot;Time Travel Week&quot;, four episodes from early 1996, where Conan and Andy (and the rest of the crew) &quot;time-traveled&quot; to a different point in time each night. Times and locations included The Civil War, Ancient Greece, The future, and The early &#x27;80s (featuring a cameo by David Letterman in the cold open, who occupied Conan&#x27;s studio in 1983, cruelly brushing off Conan and Andy&#x27;s attempt at explaining their presence in Letterman&#x27;s dressing room by saying, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you two fellas go find a nice, warm place to screw yourselves? Security!&quot;).

In 1997, a special episode was taped in which the studio audience was composed solely of grade-school age children, primarily 5–10 years of age. Conan interacted with the children, encouraging them to laugh and cheer to keep away the boredom monster.

The October 18, 2002 episode was re-shot entirely in clay animation nearly seven months after its first airing, including the opening credits and commercial bumpers. The episode&#x27;s originally broadcast soundtrack was retained while the visuals were reproduced to mirror the original footage in a small-scale reproduction of the studio 6A.

On October 31, 2006, a similarly conceptualized Halloween episode was created from an episode which originally aired in May and featured Larry King, among other guests. Using a process the show called &quot;Skelevision&quot;, all the visuals were re-shot with a Halloween motif, with human skeletons adorned with the clothing and accessories of the humans. This re-shoot was shot using the actual studio, and the puppeteers moved the skeletons with wires and cables while being visually obscured by green screen technology. Once again, the opening and bumpers were altered, this time including a model of a hearse winding through a foggy landscape and cemetery, and the voice of Bill Hader as Vincent Price in place of Joel Godard.

===U2 exclusive===

The October 5, 2005 episode of &quot;Late Night&quot; was devoted entirely to the band U2, marking the first time in the show&#x27;s then 13-year run that it had devoted an entire show to a single guest. Jim Pitt, the talent executive in charge of booking acts for the show, remarked that in his 12 years of working for &quot;Late Night&quot;, U2 and Johnny Cash were the &quot;dream artists&quot; he&#x27;d tried, but never succeeded in getting. The band performed three songs, two more than the customary one song, then had a lengthy interview with Conan.

===Episodes during the 2007–2008 writer&#x27;s strike===
After two months of being off-air, the first show to air during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike on January 2, 2008, featured a small musical segment at the beginning of the show detailing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s newly grown beard in a show of support for the striking writers. At the beginning of the January 28 episode, it was revealed that Conan had shaved his beard, which was followed with a similar musical segment.

Several times during the episodes produced during the writer&#x27;s strike, O&#x27;Brien would kill time by spinning his wedding ring on his desk, which he previously only did during rehearsals. His personal best was 41 seconds, achieved during an un-aired rehearsal. After several unsuccessful on-air attempts to break his record, during the show originally broadcast on February 9, 2008, O&#x27;Brien broke his record for endurance ring spinning, setting a time of 51 seconds by coating his wedding ring with Vaseline and spinning it on a Teflon surface. The feat was accomplished with the help of MIT physics professor Peter Fisher. The strike also gave rise to associate producer Jordan Schlansky&#x27;s repeated appearances on the show as an exaggerated version of himself.

====&quot;Feud&quot; with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert====

Early on in the later half of the 2007–2008 Writer&#x27;s Guild strike, Conan O&#x27;Brien claimed credit for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee&#x27;s popularity in opinion polling, due to his use of the &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; Lever while Chuck Norris was coincidentally sponsoring Huckabee. Stephen Colbert made the claim that because of &quot;the Colbert bump,&quot; he was responsible for Huckabee&#x27;s current success in the 2008 presidential race. O&#x27;Brien then claimed to be responsible for Colbert&#x27;s success; in response, Jon Stewart, host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, claimed that &quot;he&quot; was responsible for the success of O&#x27;Brien, and in turn the success of both Huckabee and Colbert. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle among the three hosts, with all three appearing on each other&#x27;s shows. The feud ended on &quot;Late Night&quot; with an all-out mock brawl between the three talk-show hosts.

===Anniversary episodes===
In 1996, a third anniversary episode was taped, though it aired in the regular 12:35/11:35 late night time slot. The show was composed of clips of the best of the first three years, and featured cameos from many former guests, including Janeane Garofalo, Scott Thompson, Tony Randall and George Wendt. Typical of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s style of comedy, he introduced his first guest (Wendt) by listing his notable achievements in television (particularly &quot;Cheers&quot;) then introduced each subsequent guest by repeatedly listing Wendt&#x27;s achievements (insinuating that all of his guests for that night&#x27;s show played the role of Norm on &quot;Cheers&quot;). In 1998, &quot;Late Night&quot; aired a fifth anniversary special in prime time, mostly consisting of clips from the first five years. It was taped in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; studio, also in the GE Building. The special was later sold on VHS tape. In 2003, a similar tenth anniversary special was taped in New York City&#x27;s famed Beacon Theatre and later made available on DVD.

===The final episode===
&quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;″s last episode was recorded February 20, 2009, and aired shortly after midnight that next morning. The episode featured clips from past shows and a reflection on the show&#x27;s sixteen-year-long run. John Mayer sent a farewell video message, singing a song about how Los Angeles is &quot;going to eat [Conan] alive&quot; (an ironic foretelling of things to come). In a short remote piece, Conan released regular contributor Abe Vigoda &quot;into the wild,&quot; as he could not bring him to Los Angeles for the move to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Will Ferrell made a surprise visit as George W. Bush, which quickly devolved into Ferrell tearing off his business suit to reveal an ill-fitting green leprechaun outfit that had been worn in a number of previous appearances on the show.

Former sidekick Andy Richter, who re-joined O&#x27;Brien when he took over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in June, joined O&#x27;Brien onstage for two segments, watching clips and reminiscing about the show. Among the clips shown, O&#x27;Brien noted that his all-time favorite &quot;Late Night&quot; piece was when he attended a re-enactment of an American Civil War-era baseball game, played at a Long Island, New York museum, Old Bethpage Village Restoration. During the course of the final week, O&#x27;Brien began violently dismantling and handing out pieces of the production set to the audience. In the final show, a large piece of the stage&#x27;s frame was pulled down and chopped into pieces. O&#x27;Brien then promised to give each audience member in attendance a piece of the set.

One of Conan&#x27;s favorite bands, The White Stripes, performed a new, slower arrangement of their song &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Friends&quot; based on Conan&#x27;s lullaby rendition of the song, with drummer Meg White playing second guitar and singing along with vocalist/guitarist Jack White. The performance proved to be the band&#x27;s last before their breakup in February 2011. The song would be used many years later as the theme for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s podcast &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend&quot;. The program concluded with a visibly emotional O&#x27;Brien giving a farewell speech from behind his desk, thanking his fans, writers, producers, backstage crew, his family, the Max Weinberg 7, David Letterman, Joel Godard, Jay Leno, and Lorne Michaels, as well as a final assurance that he would not &quot;grow up&quot; as he moved to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

About 3.4 million viewers watched O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s final episode of &quot;Late Night&quot;, the largest audience since the January 24, 2005 episode that followed Jay Leno&#x27;s tribute to Johnny Carson.

After the end of the series, Studio 6A at Rockefeller Center was remodeled for &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;. In the summer of 2013, NBC moved &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; to Studio 6A while 6B, which housed &quot;Late Night&quot; since Fallon succeeded O&#x27;Brien in 2009, was being renovated when Fallon took over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on February 17, 2014, while &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; moved to ABC&#x27;s Upper West Side studios.

==Awards and nominations==
==International broadcasts==

CNBC Europe used to air &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on weeknights from 11:45 pm–12:30 am CET, with weekend editions on Saturdays and Sundays at 9:45 pm–10:30 pm CET. However, in March 2007, CNBC Europe decided to show only the weekend editions, and drop the weeknight editions, to make way for more business news programmes in their weeknight schedules.

On the week of August 4, 2008, however, CNBC Europe has discontinued showing the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, which for many years was shown live from America in a 12:30 am–1:00 am CET slot. &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; has now replaced &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in the 12:30 am–1:00 am slot. The weeknight editions are a 30-minute condensed version of the show. The show follows the weeknight condensed version of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; which airs at 12:00 am CET.

In September 2008, CNBC Europe changed the weeknight schedules to include full uncut editions of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; broadcast in the 11:45 am CET/10:45 pm GMT 45-minute time slot. This schedule usually runs from Tuesdays to Fridays. CNBC Europe decided to stop broadcasting Late Night as of January 1, 2009, a mere two months before Conan&#x27;s last show as host. Instead of following &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; reruns on weekends, CNBC now broadcasts two &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episodes in a row.

<text>The Nenets (; ), also known as &#x27;Samoyeds&#x27; or &#x27;Yuraks&#x27; (deprecated terms), are a Samoyedic ethnic group native to Arctic Russia, Russian Far North. According to the latest census in 2021, there were 49,646 Nenets in the Russian Federation, most of them living in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District stretching along the coastline of the Arctic Ocean near the Arctic Circle between Kola and Taymyr peninsulas. The Nenets people speak either the Tundra or Forest Nenets languages. In the Russian Federation they have a status of Indigenous small-numbered peoples. Today, the Nenets people face numerous challenges from the state and oil and gas companies that threaten the environment and their way of life. As a result, many cite a rise in locally based activism.

== Etymology ==
The old Russian name &#x27;Samoyedy&#x27; most probably came from the ancient name of the territory where the Sami and the Nenets lived together &quot;Saame edna&quot; (the land of Sami). The name &#x27;Samoyed&#x27; went out of usage at the beginning of the 20th century. The people are known as the &quot;nentsy/nenej nenetsj&#x27;, which means &quot;real humans&quot;.

In Russian Empire, the term &quot;Samoyed&quot; was often applied indiscriminately to different peoples of Northern Russia who speak related Uralic languages: Nenets, Nganasans, Enets, Selkups (speakers of Samoyedic languages). Currently, the term &quot;Samoyedic peoples&quot; applies to the whole group of these different peoples.

== Number and settlement ==

The names of two autonomous regions of Russia (Nenets, Yamal-Nenets) mention the Nenets as the titular nationality of the region; another such district (Taimyrsky (Dolgano-Nenetsky) Autonomous Okrug) was abolished in 2007 and transformed into the Taimyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of the Krasnoyarsk Krai.

The Nenets are divided into two groups: tundra and forest; the two groups have different languages. Tundra Nenets are the majority. They live in two autonomous regions. The Forest Nenets – about 1500 people - live in the basin of the Pur and Taz rivers in the southeast of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and the east of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug – Yugra.

According to the 2021 census, there were 49,787 Nenets in Russia.

== Language ==

The Nenets language is on the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family, with two major dialects, Forest Nenets and Tundra Nenets. Ethnologue says that in Siberia, most young people are still fluent in Nenets, whereas in European Russia, they tend to speak Russian. Overall, the majority of native speakers are from older generations. UNESCO classifies Nenets as an endangered language. Some believe that the use of Russian and Komi is due to inter-ethnic marriages.

== History and way of life ==


There are two distinct groups of Nenets &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, based on their economy: the Tundra Nenets (living far to the north) and the Khandeyar, or Forest Nenets. A distinct third group of Nenets, (Yaran people), has emerged as a result of intermarriages between Nenets and Izhma Komi people.

The Samoyedic languages form a branch of the Uralic language family. According to one theory, they moved from farther south in Siberia to the northernmost part of what later became Russia sometime before the 12th century.

They ended up between the Kanin and Taymyr peninsulas, around the Ob and Yenisey rivers, with only a few of them settling into small communities like Kolva. Their main subsistence comes from hunting and reindeer herding. Using reindeer as a draft animal throughout the year enables them to cover great distances. Large-scale reindeer herding emerged in the 18th century. They bred the Samoyed dog to help herd their reindeer and pull their sleds, and European explorers later used these dogs for polar expeditions, because they were well adapted to the arctic conditions. Tundra wolves can cause considerable economic loss, as they prey on the reindeer herds which are the livelihood of some Nenets families. However, the introduction of snowmobiles in the 1990s allowed the Nenets of the Yamal Peninsula to decimate the local wolf population, as the wolves have nowhere to hide on the open tundra. Along with reindeer meat, fish is a major component in the Nenets&#x27; diet. Nenets housing is conical yurt (mya).

They have a shamanistic and animistic belief system which stresses respect for the land and its resources. During migrations, the Nenets placed sacred items like bear skins, religious figures, coins and more on a holy sleigh. The contents of this sacred sleigh are only unpacked during special occasions or for religious rituals (like sacrifices). However, only esteemed elders are allowed to unpack the sacred sleigh. They had a clan-based social structure. The Nenets shaman is called a Tadibya.
After the Russian Revolution, the Nenets culture suffered due to the Soviet collectivization policy. The government of the Soviet Union tried to force the nomadic Samoyeds to settle down permanently. They were forced to settle in villages and their children were educated in state boarding schools, which resulted in erosion of their cultural identity. One significant way in which the Nenets culture was affected was in the change of the male&#x27;s societal role. Previously, in the tundra, the male had the very important task of herding the reindeer. However, once the Nenets had to transition to a life away from the tundra, men found that they had lost their role. Much of the responsibility that awaited them in the village was considered, from the traditional point of view, to be women&#x27;s work. This erasure in the male identity was further enhanced by the Soviet government. In taiga villages occupations such as market gardening, fur farming, cattle breeding, trade, medicine, etc. were emphasized and these happened to be the ones that were marketed towards women. Lastly, the jobs offered by the Soviet government were often occupied by women and not men as many of the men had taken up the habit of hard drinking. Consequently, the once traditional culture of the Nenets people was swiftly upended. Many, especially in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, lost their mother tongue and became assimilated.

One repercussion from the collectivization policy was reindeer ownership. Due to the collectivization policy, many herders moved north while many of those that remained were &quot;deprived of their reindeer&quot;. Nenets people once owned many reindeer but after the war, many Nenets had to transition to small-scale herding. Although the Nenets herders were greatly affected, their lifestyle was not at threat for too long. While in the rest of Russia, the collectivization policy lasted for a very long time, it was only invoked onto the Yamal area for a decade. This was because after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, traditional economies were saved. 1950 to 1960 saw a 50% increase of reindeer and this number had almost doubled by 1980. The next few decades saw the slow progress of the Nenets people regaining and preserving their traditional nomadic lifestyle. The accomplishment of appeasing officials while maintaining their culture was achieved through a series of stratagems. For example, herders would often mix up the herds so that inspectors would find it impossible to see the true ratio of private to collective deer. Another method was for young herders to get a job as official workers of the state and pasture their own collective reindeer herd along with the private herd of one of their relatives. Once these herds were together and migration commenced, officials would not be able to know which of the reindeer were privately owned. 

Since the 1930s, a few Nenets have expressed themselves professionally through cultural media. For instance, Tyko Vylka and Konstantin Pankov became well-known painters. Anna Nerkagi is one of the most celebrated Nenets writers. Yuri Vella, though living as a reindeer herder, has become the first writer in the Forest Nenets language.

In the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine since 2022, the Nenets have been reported as one of Russia&#x27;s ethnic minority groups suffering from a disproportionally large casualty rate among Russian forces. According to activist and researcher Maria Vyushkova, the oil and gas industry in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug &quot;doesn&#x27;t bring anything to the indigenous population. On the contrary, it destroys the environment and what they live on - reindeer herding and fishing. Consequently, being in a dire economic situation, people are forced to join the army.&quot;

==Environment==

Although the Nenets people were able to remain resilient in the face of continuous change and maltreatment, a new challenge now awaits them. Environmental damage to the Nenets&#x27; is significant due to industrialisation of their land, colonization and climate change. The Nenet people depend heavily on fishing and reindeer herding to support their lifestyle. However, these practices are highly reliant on the environment which is under threat from the oil industry. Specifically, the nomadic lifestyle the Nenet people have been accustomed to for generations is in danger as the oil industries encroach on reindeer pasture and territory. Approximately half of the 10,000 Nenets people in the Yamal Peninsula are nomadic and herd reindeer. With oil industries continuing to expand, the impact on the Nenets people is expected to increase.

=== Oil drilling in the peninsula ===
Since the 1980s, the Arctic Circle has gained the interest of those in the energy and mining industry. Although expansion halted briefly in the 1990s post-USSR disintegration, development picked up in 2004. As oil and gas companies continue to expand, along with it has come an expansion of infrastructure coming in the form of roads, power lines as well as human and vehicle traffic. A big milestone was in 2008, when Gazprom, the largest natural gas company in the world, entered the Yamal peninsula in their efforts to launch the Yamal Megaproject. Gazprom&#x27;s arrival to the Yamal peninsula has brought about significant change to the area. According to the company&#x27;s website, they operate a total of 32 fields. These fields bring in up to 360 billion cubic meters of gas per year and in 2019, Gazprom alone produced 96.3 billion cubic meters of gas. Another milestone was when Yamal LNG Project: Novatek, another Russian owned company, partnered with two other international corporations to build a plant on the Yamal peninsula in July 2013.

=== The impact on the Nenets people ===

The impact of large energy corporations in the Yamal peninsula can be felt in numerous ways. The largest of these can be seen in the effects on migration routes. With the Nenets people being nomadic and reliant on reindeer husbandry, the migratory routes for the reindeer are very important to them. These migratory routes are very specific and a lot of consideration goes into planning them. Additionally, the herders believe that it is necessary for the reindeer to migrate in order for them to maintain their good health. The herders claim that this is because the vegetation found on the coast are good for reindeer as they are richer in salt and minerals. Also, by reaching the coast with the migrations, the reindeer are able to find relief from insects such as mosquito and botfly by avoiding infestation periods. These migratory routes that the herders and reindeer use are made of rugged terrain as they provide a good space to herd the reindeer. However, the companies that enter the Yamal peninsula also prefer this rugged terrain to build their infrastructure upon, causing a direct overlap in land of interest. For example, in the Bovanenko core area, a research study was conducted that found that industrial development targeted &quot;rugged, elevated drier land&quot; which is the type of land used by the reindeer herders. Thus, as the Nenets people rely on reindeer that, in turn, rely on the migratory routes, the expansion of industrial development has had a large impact on the Nenets people.

Although not directly related to migration routes, another impact is the effect on Nenets peoples&#x27; sacred spots. The Nenets people have a tradition of designating a sacred spot where they make a request of the spirits for a successful migration. Nenets sacred spots are made into a major sand/quarry pit and marked by wooden pegs. In one case, a sacred spot of the Nenets people was fenced in during the industrial development, dissolving it of its traditional significance. Many of the workers believed that their construction did not actually intrude on the sacred spot, however many of the herders believed that the spot had been &quot;desecrated&quot;. This difference in perceptions highlights how many non-indigenous people are only able to view land as something to be owned. Meanwhile, for indigenous people, such a viewpoint is non-existent. Herders have a spiritual relationship with the land and do not view it as simply owned vs not-owned.

Another smaller effect of the industrial development has been its impact on fish. Due to the industrial development, there has been a degradation of freshwater sources which has led to a decrease in the population. Additionally, the industrial development has spilled over to occupy much of the fishing grounds necessary for the Nenets people. As the Nenets people depend on the fish as their source of food in the summer, the depletion of fish has directly impacted the Nenets people.

Lastly, an impact that is loosely related with the migration routes is accessibility to health care clinics by the Nenets people. Since the arrival of large oil and gas companies in the 1990s, climate in the region has been impacted. In fact, since 1991 temperature anomalies in the Kanin have increased an estimated 1.4 degrees Celsius per decade. Within this same period, researchers found a trend of delayed herder arrivals to their local health clinic. Researchers cite the lengthening of the migrations as the reason for the delay. As the herders need open water to freeze to make crossings of reindeer and herders possible, there is a specific window in which herders can visit their local health clinics. Since 1991, the arrival of herders at one health clinic can be observed shifting from October to December, marking an evident postponement in arrival.

=== Nenets activism ===

There are some Nenets people, activists, and researchers who are nervous about the current situation in the Yamal peninsula. They worry that the authorities of the Nenets people will make a deal to merge with another region. Nenets people worry that the deal will lead to a further decline in their autonomy as well as their language and traditions.

Nenets people also face danger from industrial companies. Although the industrial companies have paid compensated the Nenets people and made efforts to assist them, some experts say that the current process does not allow for participation from the Nenets people. The relationship is described by some as &quot;paternalistic&quot; because it does not allow Nenets people to make their own decisions.

The Nenets people have previously attempted to organize and protest against these oil and gas companies. However, it is difficult for the nomadic people to gather as a collective unit as they live so far apart from each other. Yuri Vella is a notable example of an individual protestor. Vella was a Nenets writer and, having lived near a lake that was licensed over to an oil company, protested often. Most notably, he is remembered for having stood up against a bulldozer alone with an axe.

Vella is not alone in his activism. There exists a rural protest community called Voice of the Tundra that currently speaks on topics such as the rights of the Nenets people. As aforementioned, it is difficult to gather collectively and so this community relies on VKontakte, a Russian online service, to mobilize and communicate. Additionally, rather than being led by lawyers or journalists or scholars, the community has a young reindeer herder from the tundra as their leaders. The Voice of the Tundra focuses its attention on three main issues: a shortage of land for the reindeer due to oil and gas companies expanding use of the territories, the uncertainty surrounding the future of nomadic reindeer herding, and the lack of Indigenous leadership and organization.

The Voice of the Tundra project is being celebrated as it symbolizes a return of politics to Russia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples. Specifically, a reindeer herder by the name of Eiko Serotetto is being heralded as the main activist generating the change. Serotetto is not someone who has had a traditional background or education. However, in 2016, he demonstrated that this would not weigh him down when he began to take action in the aftermath of the anthrax epidemic. Serotetto posted a petition on social media that asked for attention to be brought to the Indigenous peoples and their reindeers. Serotetto requested protection of Indigenous habitats, reindeer, and rights. This petition brought attention to the Russian officials who were not addressing the &quot;real life of the tundra and Indigenous people&quot;. Later, Serotetto&#x27;s most impactful petition was made when he advocated for the boycott of Russian oil and gas.

Although there are many Nenets people who are against the industrial development going on in the Yamal peninsula such as the activists aforementioned, there are also many who are in support of the developments. Those who are in favour of the developments highlight the economic benefits that they are able to receive. In a research study conducted in the area, one villager reported that they were able to coexist with the industries through social agreements, voluntary giving, and compensation for damages.

Some argue that this variance in support for the industrial companies from the Nenets people lies in factors such as active leadership from community leaders. This reasoning can be seen as falling similarly in line with what the Voice of the Tundra was fighting for, as it can be seen that proper Indigenous leadership and involvement can lead to higher satisfaction among the Nenets people.

== Genetics ==
Nenets men typically carry the haplogroup N. 57.4 percent of them belong to the subclade N1b-P43 and 40.5 percent have the subclade N1c. Autosomally Nenets&#x27; ancestry can be modelled to be 79 percent Nganasan-like.

<text>Jules François Simon (; 31 December 1814 – 8 June 1896) was a French statesman and philosopher, and one of the leaders of the Moderate Republicans in the Third French Republic.

==Biography==
Simon was born at Lorient. His father was a linen-draper from Lorraine, who renounced Protestantism before his second marriage with a Catholic Breton. Jules Simon was the son of this second marriage. The family name was Suisse, which Simon dropped in favour of his third forename. By considerable sacrifice he was enabled to attend a seminary at Vannes, and worked briefly as usher in a school before, in 1833, he became a student at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. There he came in contact with Victor Cousin, who sent him to Caen and then to Versailles to teach philosophy. He helped Cousin, without receiving any recognition, in his translations from Plato and Aristotle, and in 1839 became his deputy in the chair of philosophy at the University of Paris, with the meagre salary of 83 francs per month. He also lectured on the history of philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure.

At this period he edited the works of Nicolas Malebranche (2 vols, 1842), of René Descartes (1842), Bossuet (1842) and of Antoine Arnauld (1843), and in 1844–1845 appeared the two volumes of his &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;école d&#x27;Alexandrie&quot;. He became a regular contributor to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, and in 1847, with Amédée Jacques and Émile Saisset, founded the &quot;Liberté de penser&quot;, with the intention of throwing off the yoke of Cousin, but he retired when Jacques allowed the insertion of an article advocating the principles of collectivism, with which he was at no time in sympathy.

== Political career from 1848 to 1871 ==

In 1848 he represented the Côtes-du-Nord in the National Assembly, and next year entered the Council of State, but was retired on account of his republican opinions. His refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the government of Louis Napoleon after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was followed by his dismissal from his professorship, and he devoted himself to philosophical and political writings of a popular order. &quot;Le Devoir&quot; (1853), which was translated into modern Greek and Swedish, was followed by &quot;La Religion naturelle&quot; (1856, Eng. trans., 1887), &quot;La Liberté de conscience&quot; (1857), &quot;La Liberté politique&quot; (1859), &quot;La Liberté civile&quot; (1859), &quot;L&#x27;Ouvrière&quot; (1861), &quot;L&#x27;Ecole&quot; (1864), &quot;Le Travail&quot; (1866), &quot;L&#x27;Ouvrier de huit ans&quot; (1867) and others.

In 1863 he was returned to the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot; for the 8th circonscription of the Seine &quot;département&quot;, and supported &quot;les Cinq&quot; (Darimon, Favre, Hénon, Ollivier and Picard) in their opposition to the government. He became minister of instruction in the Government of National Defense on 5 September 1870. After the capitulation of Paris in January 1871 he was sent down to Bordeaux to prevent the resistance of Léon Gambetta to the peace. But at Bordeaux, Gambetta, who had issued a proclamation excluding from the elections those who had been officials under the Empire, was all-powerful. Pretending to dispute Jules Simon&#x27;s credentials, he issued orders for his arrest. Meanwhile, Simon had found means of communication with Paris, and on 6 February was reinforced by Eugène Pelletan, E. Arago and Garnier-Pages. Gambetta resigned, and the ministry of the Interior, though nominally given to Arago, was really in Simon&#x27;s hands.

== Third Republic ==

Defeated in the département of the Seine, he sat for the Marne in the National Assembly, and resumed the portfolio of Education in the first cabinet of Adolphe Thiers&#x27;s presidency. He advocated free primary education yet sought to conciliate the clergy by all the means in his power; but no concessions removed the hostility of Dupanloup, who presided over the commission appointed to consider his draft of an elementary education bill. The reforms he was actually able to carry out were concerned with secondary education. He encouraged the study of living languages, and limited the attention given to the making of Latin verse; he also encouraged independent methods at the École Normale, and set up a school at Rome where members of the French school of Athens should spend some time.

He retained office until a week before the fall of Thiers in 1873. He was regarded by the monarchical right as one of the most dangerous obstacles in the way of a restoration, which he did as much as any man (except perhaps the comte de Chambord himself) to prevent, but by the extreme left he was distrusted for his moderate views, and Gambetta never forgave his victory at Bordeaux. In 1875, he became a member of the Académie Française and a life senator, and in 1876, on the resignation of Jules Dufaure, was summoned to form a cabinet. He replaced anti-republican functionaries in the civil service by republicans, and held his own until 3 May 1877, when he adopted a motion carried by a large majority in the Chamber inviting the cabinet to use all means for the repression of clerical agitation.

His clerical enemies then induced Marshal MacMahon to take advantage of a vote on the press law carried in Jules Simon&#x27;s absence from the Chamber to write him a letter regretting that he no longer preserved his influence in the Chamber, and thus practically demanding his resignation. His resignation in response to this act of the president, known as the &quot;Seize Mai&quot;, which he might have resisted by an appeal to the Chamber, proved his ruin, and he never again held office. He justified his action by his fear of providing an opportunity for a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on the part of the Marshal. However, the May 1877 crisis eventually ended in MacMahon&#x27;s demise and in the victory of the Republicans over the monarchist Orleanists and Legitimists.

The rejection (1880) of article 7 of Ferry&#x27;s Education Act, by which the profession of teaching would have been forbidden to members of non-authorized congregations, was due to his intervention. He was in fact one of the chief of the left centre Opportunist Republicans faction, opposed in the same faction to Jules Grévy and also to the Radical Gambetta. He was director of &quot;Le Gaulois&quot; from 1879 to 1881, and his influence in the country among moderate republicans was retained by his articles in &quot;Le Matin&quot; from 1882 onwards, in the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;, which he joined in 1886, and in &quot;Le Temps&quot; from 1890.

== Works ==

His own accounts of some of the events in which he had been involved appear in &quot;Souvenirs du 4 septembre&quot; (1874), &quot;Le Gouvernement de M. Thiers&quot; (2 vols., 1878), in &quot;Mémoires des autres&quot; (1889), &quot;Nouveaux mémoires des autres&quot; (1891) and &quot;Les Derniers mémoires des autres&quot; (1897), while his sketch of Victor Cousin (1887) was a further contribution to contemporary history. For his personal history, the &quot;Premiers mémoires&quot; (1900) and &quot;Le Soir de ma journée&quot; (1902), edited by his son Gustave Simon, may be supplemented by Léon Séché&#x27;s &quot;Figures bretonnes, Jules Simon, sa vie, son œuvre&quot; (new ed., 1898), and Georges Picot, &quot;Jules Simon: notice historique&quot; (1897); also by many references to periodical literature and collected essays in Hugo Paul Thieme&#x27;s &quot;Guide bibliographique de la littérature française de 1800 à 1906&quot; (1907).

<doc id="174693" wikidata="Q289785" url="?curid=174693" title="Étienne Joseph Louis Garnier-Pagès">
<text>Étienne Joseph Louis Garnier-Pagès (December 27, 1801June 23, 1841) was a French politician, born at Marseille.

Soon after his birth his father Jean Francois Garnier, a naval surgeon, died, and his mother married Simon Pagès, a college professor, by whom she had a son. The boys were brought up together, and took the double name Garnier-Pagès.

Étienne found employment first in a commercial house in Marseille, and then in an insurance office in Paris. In 1825 he began to study law, and made some mark as an advocate. A keen opponent of the Restoration, he joined various democratic societies, notably the Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera, an organization for purifying the elections.

He took part in the revolution of July 1830; became secretary of the &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot;, whose propaganda he brought into line with his anti-monarchical ideas; and in 1831 was sent from Isère to the chamber of deputies. He was concerned in the preparation of the Compte rendu of 1832, and advocated universal suffrage. He was an eloquent speaker, and his sound knowledge of business and finance gave him a marked influence among all parties in the chamber.

His half-brother, Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès (1803October 31, 1878), fought on the barricades during the revolution of July.

<doc id="174698" wikidata="Q153940" url="?curid=174698" title="Christian I of Denmark">
<text>Christian I &quot;(Christiern I)&quot; (February 1426 – 21 May 1481) was a German noble and Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was king of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464). From 1460 to 1481, he was also duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and count (after 1474, duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first king of the House of Oldenburg.

In the power vacuum that arose following the death of King Cristopher (1416–1448) without a direct heir, Sweden elected Karl Knutsson (14081470) king with the intent to reestablish the union under a Swedish king. Karl was elected king of Norway in the following year. However the counts of Holstein made the Danish Privy Council appoint Christian as king of Denmark. His subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457) restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1464, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian&#x27;s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.

In 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, Christian also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.

==Biography==
===Early years===
&quot;Christiern&quot; was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Hedvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.

Through his father, he belonged to the House of Oldenburg, a comital family established since the 12th century in an area west of the River Weser in north-western Germany. Based on the two strongholds of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, the family had gradually expanded its rule over the neighbouring Frisian tribes of the area. Christian&#x27;s father was called &quot;the Fortunate&quot; as he had reunited and expanded the family&#x27;s territory. Christian&#x27;s mother, Hedvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig. Through his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie. Through his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Berengaria of Portugal. He was also a cognatic descendant of King Magnus III of Sweden.

At the death of their father in 1440, Christian and his brothers jointly succeeded Dietrich as Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Christian was raised by his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein (1401–1459) as the childless duke wished for his young nephew to become his heir, and also succeeded in having Christian elected as his successor in the Duchy of Schleswig.

===King of Denmark===


In January 1448, King Christopher of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway&#x27;s affiliation was unclear. The vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg. Before being elected, Christian had to promise to obey to the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously. The council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III. On 1 September 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as king Christian I at the assembly in Viborg. His coronation was held on 28 October 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager queen Dorothea was also celebrated.

===King of Sweden and Norway===

Meanwhile, Sweden had on 20 June 1448 elected Karl Knutsson Bonde as king. Norway was now faced with the choice between a union with Denmark or Sweden, or electing a separate king. The latter option was quickly discarded, and a power-struggle ensued between the supporters of Christian of Denmark and Karl of Sweden. The Norwegian Council of the Realm was divided. In February 1449, a part of the Council declared in favour of Karl as king, but on 15 June the same year, a different group of councillors paid homage to Christian. On 20 November, Karl was crowned king of Norway in Trondheim.

However, the Swedish nobility now took steps to avoid war with Denmark. In June 1450, the Swedish Council of the Realm forced Karl to renounce his claim on Norway to Christian. In the summer of 1450, Christian sailed to Norway with a large fleet, and on 2 August he was crowned king of Norway in Trondheim. On 29 August, a union treaty between Denmark and Norway was signed in Bergen. Norway had of old been a hereditary monarchy, but this had become less and less a reality, as at the last royal successions, hereditary claims had been bypassed for political reasons. It was now explicitly stated that Norway, as well as Denmark, was an elective monarchy. The treaty stipulated that Denmark and Norway should have the same king in perpetuity, and that he would be elected among the legitimate sons of the previous king, if such existed.

Karl Knutsson became increasingly unpopular as king of Sweden, and was driven into exile in 1457. Christian achieved his aim of being elected as king of Sweden, thus re-establishing the Kalmar Union. He received the power from temporary Swedish regents Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and lord Erik Axelsson Tott. However, Sweden being volatile and split by factions (benefits of union being against nationalistic benefits), his reign there ended in 1464 when Kettil Karlsson Vasa, Bishop of Linköping was installed as the next regent. Karl Knutsson was recalled as King of Sweden, although he was later exiled a second time, recalled again and died during his third term as king. Christian&#x27;s final attempt at regaining Sweden ended in a total military failure at the Battle of Brunkeberg (outside Stockholm) October 1471 where he was defeated by forces on Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder (). Christian maintained his claim to the Swedish kingdom up to his death in 1481.

===Duke and Count===
In 1460 King Christian also became Duke of Schleswig, a Danish fief, and Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, a Saxe-Lauenburgian subfief within the Holy Roman Empire. Christian inherited Holstein-Rendsburg and Schleswig after a short &quot;interregnum&quot; as the eldest son of the sister of late Duke Adolphus VIII, Duke of Schleswig (Southern Jutland) and Count of Holstein, of the Schauenburg fürst clan, who died 4 December 1459, without heirs. Christian&#x27;s succession was confirmed by the Estates of the Realm (nobility and representatives) of these duchies in Ribe 5 March 1460 (Treaty of Ribe). In 1474 Lauenburg&#x27;s liege lord Emperor Frederick III elevated Christian I as Count of Holstein to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial vassal (see imperial immediacy).

===Later reign===
Christian&#x27;s personal territory was at its largest in 1460–1464, before the loss of Sweden. However, many parts of his realm wanted to govern themselves locally, and there were constant struggles. Denmark was his most important center of power.

In 1474 Christian travelled two times: in April he went to Milan (his stay in Lombardy is celebrated by frescoes by Il Romanino in the Malpaga Castle) and Rome, in Italy, where he met Pope Sixtus IV. In the autumn same year he visited Charles of Burgundy, acting as intermediary between him and future emperor Maximilian I. He stayed in Burgundy for several months, moving to the Netherlands in the early 1475.
Acting on a permission from Pope Sixtus IV in 1475 to establish a university in Denmark, the University of Copenhagen was inaugurated by Christian on 1 June 1479.

===Death and burial===

King Christian died at Copenhagen Castle on 21 May 1481 at the age of 55. He was interred at the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral, a richly decorated chapel he and Queen Dorothea had erected to serve as a family sepulchral chapel for the House of Oldenburg. The burials of Christian I and Queen Dorothea are marked with a pair of simple stones, as the chapel itself was to be considered their sepulchral monument.

==Legacy==
The dynasty he founded, the House of Oldenburg, remains on the throne of Denmark. It was on the throne of Norway until 1818, returning there again from 1905, and also on the throne of Sweden during Christian&#x27;s reign there and those of his son and grandson, but also 1751–1818.

<doc id="174702" wikidata="Q311594" url="?curid=174702" title="Philippe Pinel">
<text>Philippe Pinel (; 20 April 1745 – 25 October 1826) was a French physician, precursor of psychiatry and incidentally a zoologist. He was instrumental in the development of a more humane psychological approach to the custody and care of psychiatric patients, referred to today as moral therapy. He worked for the abolition of the shackling of mental patients by chains and, more generally, for the humanisation of their treatment. He also made notable contributions to the classification of mental disorders and has been described by some as &quot;the father of modern psychiatry&quot;.

After the French Revolution, Dr. Pinel changed the way we look at the mentally ill (or &quot;aliénés&quot;, &quot;alienated&quot; in English) by claiming that they can be understood and cured.
An 1809 description of a case that Pinel recorded in the second edition of his textbook on insanity is regarded by some as the earliest evidence for the existence of the form of mental disorder later known as dementia praecox or schizophrenia, although Emil Kraepelin is generally accredited with its first conceptualisation.

&quot;Father of modern psychiatry&quot;, he was credited with the first classification of mental illnesses. He had a great influence on psychiatry and the treatment of the alienated in Europe and the United States.

== Early life ==

Pinel was born in Jonquières, the South of France, in the modern department of Tarn. He was the son and nephew of physicians. After receiving a degree from the faculty of medicine in Toulouse, he studied an additional four years at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier. He arrived in Paris in 1778.

He spent fifteen years earning his living as a writer, translator, and editor because the restrictive regulations of the old regime prevented him from practicing medicine in Paris. The faculty did not recognize a degree from a provincial university like Toulouse. He failed twice in a competition which would have awarded him funds to continue his studies. In the second competition, the jury stressed his ‘painful’ mediocrity in all areas of medical knowledge, an assessment seemingly so grossly incompatible with his later intellectual accomplishments that political motives have been suggested. Discouraged, Pinel considered emigrating to America. In 1784 he became editor of the medical journal the &quot;Gazette de santé&quot;, a four-page weekly. He was also known among natural scientists as a regular contributor to the &quot;Journal de physique&quot;. He studied mathematics, translated medical works into French, and undertook botanical expeditions.

At about this time he began to develop an intense interest in the study of mental illness. The incentive was a personal one. A friend had developed a ‘nervous melancholy’ that had ‘degenerated into mania’ and resulted in suicide. What Pinel regarded as an unnecessary tragedy due to gross mismanagement seems to have haunted him. It led him to seek employment at one of the best-known private sanatoria for the treatment of insanity in Paris. He remained there for five years prior to the Revolution, gathering observations on insanity and beginning to formulate his views on its nature and treatment.

Pinel was an Ideologue, a disciple of the abbé de Condillac. He was also a clinician who believed that medical truth was derived from clinical experience. Hippocrates was his model.

During the 1780s, Pinel was invited to join the salon of Madame Helvétius. He was in sympathy with the French Revolution. After the revolution, friends he had met at Madame Helvétius’ salon came to power. In August 1793 Pinel was appointed &quot;physician of the infirmeries&quot; at Bicêtre Hospital. At the time it housed about four thousand imprisoned men—criminals, petty offenders, syphilitics, pensioners and about two hundred mental patients. Pinel’s patrons hoped that his appointment would lead to therapeutic initiatives. His experience at the private sanatoria made him a good candidate for the job.

== The Bicêtre and Salpêtrière ==
Soon after his appointment to Bicêtre Hospital, Pinel became interested in the seventh ward where 200 mentally ill men were housed. He asked for a report on these inmates. A few days later, he received a table with comments from the &quot;governor&quot; Jean-Baptiste Pussin. In the 1770s Pussin had been successfully treated for scrofula at Bicêtre; and, following a familiar pattern, he was eventually recruited, along with his wife, Marguerite Jubline, on to the staff of the hospice.

Appreciating Pussin&#x27;s outstanding talent, Pinel virtually apprenticed himself to that unschooled but experienced custodian of the insane. His purpose in doing this was to &quot;enrich the medical theory of mental illness with all the insights that the empirical approach affords&quot;. What he observed was a strict nonviolent, nonmedical management of mental patients that came to be called moral treatment or moral management, though psychological might be a more accurate term.

Although Pinel always gave Pussin the credit he deserved, a legend grew up about Pinel single-handedly liberating the insane from their chains at Bicetre. This legend has been commemorated in paintings and prints, and has lived on for 200 years and is repeated in textbooks. In fact, it was Pussin who removed the iron shackles (but sometimes using straitjackets) at Bicêtre in 1797, after Pinel had left for the Salpêtrière. Pinel did remove the chains from patients at the Salpêtrière three years later, after Pussin joined him there. There is some suggestion that the Bicetre myth was actually deliberately fabricated by Pinel&#x27;s son, Dr Scipion Pinel, along with Pinel&#x27;s foremost pupil, Dr Esquirol. The argument is that they were &#x27;solidists&#x27;, which meant then something akin to biological psychiatry with a focus on brain disease, and were embarrassed by Pinel&#x27;s focus on psychological processes. In addition, unlike Philippe, they were both royalists.

While at Bicêtre, Pinel did away with bleeding, purging, and blistering in favor of a therapy that involved close contact with and careful observation of patients. Pinel visited each patient, often several times a day, and took careful notes over two years. He engaged them in lengthy conversations. His objective was to assemble a detailed case history and a natural history of the patient&#x27;s illness.

In 1795, Pinel became chief physician of the Hospice de la Salpêtrière, a post that he retained for the rest of his life. The Salpêtrière was, at the time, like a large village, with seven thousand elderly indigent and ailing women, an entrenched bureaucracy, a teeming market and huge infirmaries. Pinel missed Pussin and in 1802 secured his transfer to the Salpêtrière. It has also been noted that a Catholic nursing order actually undertook most of the day to day care and understanding of the patients at Salpêtrière, and there were sometimes power struggles between Pinel and the nurses.

Pinel created an inoculation clinic in his service at the Salpêtrière in 1799, and the first vaccination in Paris was given there in April 1800.

In 1795 Pinel had also been appointed as a professor of medical pathology, a chair that he held for twenty years. He was briefly dismissed from this position in 1822, with ten other professors, suspected of political liberalism, but reinstated as an honorary professor shortly thereafter.

A statue in honour of Pinel now stands outside the Salpêtrière.

== Publications ==
In 1794 Pinel made public his essay &#x27;Memoir on Madness&#x27;, recently called a fundamental text of modern psychiatry. In it Pinel makes the case for the careful psychological study of individuals over time, points out that insanity isn&#x27;t always continuous, and calls for more humanitarian asylum practices.

In 1798 Pinel published an authoritative classification of diseases in his &quot;Nosographie philosophique ou méthode de l&#x27;analyse appliquée à la médecine&quot;. Although he is properly considered one of the founders of psychiatry, this book also establishes him as the last great nosologist of the eighteenth century. While the &quot;Nosographie&quot; appears completely dated today, it was so popular in its time that it went through six editions between its initial publication and 1818. Pinel based his nosology on ideas of William Cullen, employing the same biologically-inspired terminology of &#x27;genera&#x27; and &#x27;species&#x27; of disorder. Pinel&#x27;s classification of mental disorder simplified Cullen&#x27;s &#x27;neuroses&#x27; down to four basic types of mental disorder: melancholia, mania (insanity), dementia, and idiotism. Later editions added forms of &#x27;partial insanity&#x27; where only that of feelings which seem to be affected rather than reasoning ability. 

The first mental derangement is called melancholia. The symptoms are described as “taciturnity, a thoughtful pensive air, gloomy suspicions, and a love of solitude.”
 It is noted that Tiberius and Louis XI were subjected to this temperament. Louis was characterized by the imbalance between the state of bitterness and passion, gloom, love of solitude, and the embarrassment of artistic talents. However, Louis and Tiberius were similar in that they both were deceitful and planned a delusional trip to military sites. Eventually both were exiled, one to the Isle of Rhodes and the other to a province of Belgium. People with melancholia are often immersed with one idea that their whole attention is fixated on. On one hand they stay reserved for many years, withholding friendships and affection while on the other, there are some who make reasonable judgment and overcome the gloomy state. Melancholia can also express itself in polar opposite forms. The first is distinguished by an exalted sense of self-importance and unrealistic expectations such as attaining riches and power. The second form is marked by deep despair and great depression.

Overall individuals with melancholia generally do not display acts of violence, though they may find it wildly fanciful. Depression and anxiety occurs habitually as well as frequent moroseness of character. Pinel remarks that melancholia can be explained by drunkenness, abnormalities in the structure of the skull, trauma in the skull, conditions of the skin, various psychological causes such as household disasters and religious extremism, and in women, menstruation and menopause.

The second mental derangement is called mania without delirium. It is described as madness independent of a disorder that impairs the intellectual faculties. The symptoms are described as perverse and disobedient. An instance where this type of species of mental derangement occurs where a mechanic, who was confined at the Asylum de Bicetre, experienced violent outbursts of maniacal fury. The paroxysms consisted of a burning sensation located in the abdominal area that was accompanied by constipation and thirst. The symptom spread to the chest, neck, and face area. When it reached the temples, the pulsation of the arteries increased in those areas. The brain was affected to some length but nonetheless, the patient was able to reason and cohere to his ideas. One time the mechanic experienced furious paroxysm at his own house where he warned his wife to flee to avoid death. He also experienced the same periodical fury at the asylum where he plotted against the governor. The specific character of mania without delirium is that it can either be perpetual or sporadic. However, there was no reasonable change in the cognitive functions of the brain; only perversive thoughts of fury and a blind tendency to acts of violence.

The third mental derangement is called mania with delirium. It is mainly characterized by indulgence and fury, and affects cognitive functions. Sometimes it may be distinguished by a carefree, gay humor that can venture off path in incoherent and absurd suggestions. Other times it can be distinguished by prideful and imaginary claims to grandeur. Prisoners of this species are highly delusional. For example, they would proclaim having fought an important battle, or witness the prophet Mohammad conjuring wrath in the name of the Almighty. Some declaim ceaselessly with no evidence of things seen or heard while others saw illusions of objects in various forms and colors. Delirium sometimes persists with some degree of frenzied uproar for a period of years, but it can also be constant and the paroxysm of fury repeat at different intervals. The specific character of mania with delirium is the same as mania without delirium in the sense that it can either be continued or cyclical with regular or irregular paroxysms. It is marked by strong nervous excitement, accompanied by a deficit of one or more of the functions of the cognitive abilities with feelings of liveliness, depression or fury.

The fourth mental derangement is called dementia, or otherwise known as the abolition of thinking. The characteristics include thoughtlessness, extreme incorrectness, and wild abnormalities. For instance, a man who had been educated on the ancient nobility was marching on about the beginning of the revolution. He moved restlessly about the house, talking endlessly and shouting passionately on insignificant reasons. Dementia is usually accompanied by raging and rebellious movement, by a quick succession of ideas formed in the mind, and by passionate feelings that are felt and forgotten without attributing it to objects. Those who are in captive of dementia have lost their memory, even those attributed to their loved ones. Their only memory consists of those in the past. They forget instantaneously things in the present – seen heard or done. Many are irrational because the ideas do not flow coherently.

The characteristic properties of dementia are that there is no judgment value and the ideas are spontaneous with no connection. The specific character of dementia contains a rapid progression or continual succession of isolated ideas, forgetfulness of previous condition, repetitive acts of exaggeration, decreased responsiveness to external influence, and complete lack of judgment.

The fifth and last mental derangement is called idiotism, or otherwise known as “obliteration of the intellectual faculties and affections.” This disorder is derived from a variety of causes, such as extravagant and debilitating delight, alcohol abuse, deep sorrow, diligent study, aggressive blows to the head, tumors in the brain, and loss of consciousness due to blockage in vein or artery. Idiotism embodies a variety of forms. One such form is called Cretinism, which is a kind of idiotism that is relative to personal abnormalities. It is well known in the Valais and in parts of Switzerland.
 Most people who belong in this group are either deficient in speech or limited to the inarticulate utterances of sounds. Their expressions are emotionless, senses are dazed and motions are mechanical. Idiots also constitute the largest number of patients at hospitals. Individuals who have acute responsiveness can experience a violent shock to the extreme that all the activities of the brain can either be arrested in an action or eradicated completely. Unexpected happiness and exaggerated fear may likely occur as a result of a violent shock. As mentioned previously, idiotism is the most common among hospital patients and is incurable. At the Bicetre asylum, these patients constitute one fourth of the entire population. Many die after a few days of arrival, having been reduced to states of stupor and weakness. However, some who recover with the progressive regeneration of their strength also regain their intellectual capabilities. Many of the young people that have remained in the state of idiotism for several months or years are attacked by a spasm of active mania between twenty and thirty days. The specific character of idiotism includes partial or complete extermination of the intellect and affections, apathy, disconnected, inarticulate sounds or impairment of speech, and nonsensical outbursts of passion.

In his book &quot;Traité médico-philosophique sur l&#x27;aliénation mentale; ou la manie&quot;, published in 1801, Pinel discusses his psychologically oriented approach. This book was translated into English by D. D. Davis as a &quot;Treatise on Insanity&quot; in 1806, although Davis substituted Pinel&#x27;s introduction for his own, leaving out among other things Pinel&#x27;s strong praise for Alexander Crichton. Pinel&#x27;s book had an enormous influence on both French and Anglo-American psychiatrists during the nineteenth century. He meant by alienation that the patient feels like a stranger (alienus) to the world of the &#x27;sane&#x27;. A sympathetic therapist living in that world might be able to journey into the patient&#x27;s experience, understand the &#x27;alienated&#x27;, their language, and possibly lead them back into society.

In 1802 Pinel published &quot;La Médecine Clinique&quot; which was based on his experiences at the Salpêtrière and in which he extended his previous book on classification and disease.

Pinel was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1804 and was a member of the Académie de Médecine from its founding in 1820. He died in Paris on 25 October 1826.

== Clinical approach ==

=== Psychological understanding ===
The central and ubiquitous theme of Pinel&#x27;s approach to etiology (causation) and treatment was &quot;moral,&quot; meaning the emotional or the psychological not ethical. He observed and documented the subtleties and nuances of human experience and behavior, conceiving of people as social animals with imagination.

Pinel noted, for example, that: &quot;being held in esteem, having honor, dignity, wealth, fame, which though they may be factitious, always distressing and rarely fully satisfied, often give way to the overturning of reason&quot;. He spoke of avarice, pride, friendship, bigotry, the desire for reputation, for conquest, and vanity. He noted that a state of love could turn to fury and desperation, and that sudden severe reversals in life, such as &quot;from the pleasure of success to an overwhelming idea of failure, from a dignified state—or the belief that one occupies one—to a state of disgrace and being forgotten&quot; can cause mania or &#x27;mental alienation&#x27;. He identified other predisposing psychosocial factors such as an unhappy love affair, domestic grief, devotion to a cause carried to the point of fanaticism, religious fear, the events of the revolution, violent and unhappy passions, exalted ambitions of glory, financial reverses, religious ecstasy, and outbursts of patriotic fervor.

=== Treatments ===

Pinel developed specific practical techniques, rather than general concepts and assumptions. He engaged in therapeutic conversations to dissuade patients from delusions. He offered benevolent support and encouragement, although patients who persistently resisted or caused trouble might be threatened with incarceration or punishment if they were not able to control themselves.

Pinel argued that psychological intervention must be tailored to each individual rather than be based solely on the diagnostic category, and that it must be grounded in an understanding of the person&#x27;s own perspective and history. He noted that &quot;the treatment of insanity (l’aliénation mentale) without considering the differentiating characteristics of the patients [la distinction des espèces] has been at times superfluous, rarely useful, and often harmful&quot;, describing the partial or complete failures of some psychological approaches, as well as the harm that the usual cruel and harsh treatments caused to patients before they came to his hospital. He saw improvement as often resulting from natural forces within the patient, an improvement that treatment could at best facilitate and at worst interfere with.

Pinel’s approach to medical treatments has been described as ambiguous, complex, and ambivalent. He insisted that psychological techniques should always be tried first, for example &quot;even where a violent and destructive maniac could be calmed by a single dose of an antispasmodic [he referred to opium], observation teaches that in a great number of cases, one can obtain a sure and permanent cure by the sole method of expectation, leaving the insane man to his tumultuous excitement... ...and [furthermore] seeing, again and again, the unexpected resources of nature left to itself or wisely guided, has rendered me more and more cautious with regard to the use of medications, which I no longer employ—except when the insufficiencies of psychological means have been proven.&quot;

For those cases regarded as psychologically incurable, Pinel would employ baths, showers, opium, camphor and other antispasmodics, as well as vesicants, cauterization, and bloodletting in certain limited cases only. He also recommended the use of laxatives for the prevention of nervous excitement and relapse.

Pinel often traced mental states to physiological states of the body, and in fact could be said to have practiced psychosomatic medicine. In general, Pinel traced organic causes to the gastrointestinal system and peripheral nervous system more often than to brain dysfunction. This was consistent with his rarely finding gross brain pathology in his post-mortem examinations of psychiatric patients, and his view that such findings that were reported could be correlational rather than causative.

=== Management ===
Pinel was concerned with a balance between control by authority and individual liberty. He believed in &quot;the art of subjugating and taming the insane&quot; and the effectiveness of &quot;a type of apparatus of fear, of firm and consistent opposition to their dominating and stubbornly held ideas&quot;, but that it must be proportional and motivated only by a desire to keep order and to bring people back to themselves. The straitjacket and a period of seclusion were the only sanctioned punishments. Based on his observations, he believed that those who were considered most dangerous and carried away by their ideas had often been made so by the blows and bad treatment they had received, and that it could be ameliorated by providing space, kindness, consolation, hope, and humor. 

Because of the dangers and frustrations that attendants experienced in their work, Pinel put great emphasis on the selection and supervision of attendants in order to establish a custodial setting dedicated to norms of constraint and liberty that would facilitate psychological work. He recommended that recovered patients be employed, arguing that &quot;They are the ones who are most likely to refrain from all inhumane treatment, who will not strike even in retaliation, who can stand up to pleading, menaces, repetitive complaining, etc. and retain their inflexible firmness.&quot; Pinel also emphasized the necessity for leadership that was &quot;thoughtful, philanthropic, courageous, physically imposing, and inventive in the development of maneuvers or tactics to distract, mollify, and impress&quot; and &quot;devoted to the concept of order without violence&quot;, so that patients are &quot;led most often with kindness, but always with an inflexible firmness.&quot; He noted that his ex-patient and superintendent Pussin had showed him the way in this regard, and had also often been better placed to work with patients and develop techniques due to his greater experience and detailed knowledge of the patients as individuals.

=== Moral judgments ===
Pinel generally expressed warm feelings and respect for his patients, as exemplified by: &quot;I cannot but give enthusiastic witness to their moral qualities. Never, except in romances, have I seen spouses more worthy to be cherished, more tender fathers, passionate lovers, purer or more magnanimous patriots, than I have seen in hospitals for the insane, in their intervals of reasonableness and calm; a man of sensibility may go there any day and take pleasure in scenes of compassion and tenderness&quot;. He argued that otherwise positive character traits could cause a person to be vulnerable to the distressing vicissitudes of life, for example &quot;those persons endowed with a warmth of imagination and a depth of sensitivity, who are capable of experiencing powerful and intense emotions, [since it is they] who are most predisposed to mania&quot;.

Pinel distanced himself from religious views, and in fact considered that excessive religiosity could be harmful.

However, he sometimes took a moral stance himself as to what he considered to be mentally healthy and socially appropriate. Moreover, he sometimes showed a condemnatory tone toward what he considered personal failings or vice, for example noting in 1809: &quot;On one side one sees families which thrive over a course of many years, in the bosom of order and concord, on the other one sees many others, especially in the lower social classes, who offend the eye with the repulsive picture of debauchery, arguments, and shameful distress!&quot;. He goes on to describe this as the most prolific source of alienation needing treatment, adding that while some such examples were a credit to the human race many others are &quot;a disgrace to humanity!&quot;

== Influence ==

Pinel is generally seen as the physician who more than any other transformed the concept of &#x27;the mad&#x27; into that of patients needing care and understanding, establishing a field that would eventually be called psychiatry. His legacy included improvement of asylum conditions; broadly psychosocial (incl. milieu) therapeutic approaches; history-taking; nosography (the science of the description of syndromes); broadly-numerical assessments of courses of illness and treatment responses; and a record of clinical teaching.

Pinel&#x27;s actions took place in the context of the Enlightenment, and a number of others were also reforming asylums along humanitarian lines. For example, Vincenzo Chiarugi, in the 1780s in Italy, removed metal chains from patients but did not enjoy the same renown bestowed on the more explicitly humanitarian Pinel who was so visible from late 18th century revolutionary France. In France, Joseph D&#x27;Aquin in Chambéry permitted patients to move about freely and published a book in 1791 urging humanitarian reforms, dedicating the second edition in 1804 to Pinel. The movement as a whole become known as moral treatment or moral management, and influenced asylum development and psychological approaches throughout the Western world. 

Pinel&#x27;s most important contribution may have been the observation and conviction that there could be sanity and rationality even in cases that seemed on the surface impossible to understand, and that this could appear for periods in response to surrounding events (and not just because of such things as the phase of the moon, a still common assumption and the origin of the term lunatic). The influential philosopher Hegel praised Pinel for this approach.

Pinel also started a trend for diagnosing forms of insanity that seemed to occur &#x27;without delerium&#x27; (confusion, delusions or hallucinations). Pinel called this Manie sans délire, folie raisonnante or folie lucide raisonnante. He described cases who seemed to be overwhelmed by instinctive furious passions but still seemed sane. This was influential in leading to the concept of moral insanity, which became an accepted diagnosis through the second half of the 19th century. Pinel&#x27;s main psychiatric heir, Esquirol, built on Pinel&#x27;s work and popularised various concepts of monomania.

However, Pinel was also criticised and rejected in some quarters. A new generation favoured pathological anatomy, seeking to locate mental disorders in brain lesions. Pinel undertook comparisons of skull sizes, and considered possible physiological substrates, but he was criticized for his emphasis on psychology and the social environment. Opponents were bolstered by the discovery of brain anomalies as the cause of some mental disorder. Pinel&#x27;s humanitarian achievements were emphasized and mythologised instead.

With increasing industrialization, asylums generally became overcrowded, misused, isolated and run-down. The moral treatment principles were often neglected along with the patients. There was recurrent debate over the use of psychological-social oppression even if some physical forces were removed. By the mid-19th century in England, the Alleged Lunatics&#x27; Friend Society was proclaiming the moral treatment approach was achieved &quot;by mildness and coaxing, and by solitary confinement&quot;, treating people like children without rights to make their own decisions.

Similarly in the mid-20th century, Foucault&#x27;s influential book, &quot;Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason&quot;, also known as History of Madness, focused on Pinel, along with Tuke, as the driving force behind a shift from physical to mental oppression. Foucault argued that the approach simply meant that patients were ignored and verbally isolated, and were worse off than before. They were made to see madness in others and then in themselves until they felt guilt and remorse. The doctor, despite his lack of medical knowledge about the underlying processes, had all powers of authority, and defined insanity. Foucault also suggested that a focus on the rights of patients at Bicetre was partly due to revolutionary concerns that it housed and chained victims of arbitrary or political power, or alternatively that it might be enabling refuge for anti-revolutionary suspects, as well as just &#x27;the mad&#x27;.

Scull argues that the &quot;...manipulations and ambiguous &#x27;kindness&#x27; of Tuke and Pinel...&quot; may nevertheless have been preferable to the harsh coercion and physical &quot;treatments&quot; of previous generations, though he does recognise its &quot;...less benevolent aspects and its latent potential ... for deterioration into a repressive form...&quot; Some have criticised the process of deinstitutionalization that took place in the 20th century and called for a return to Pinel&#x27;s approach, so as not to underestimate the needs that mentally ill people might have for protection and care.

<text>Space syntax is a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by Bill Hillier, Julienne Hanson, and colleagues at The Bartlett, University College London in the late 1970s to early 1980s to develop insights into the mutually constructive relation between society and space. As space syntax has evolved, certain measures have been found to correlate with human spatial behaviour, and space syntax has thus come to be used to forecast likely effects of architectural and urban space on users.

==Thesis==
The general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components, analysed as networks of choices, then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces. It rests on three basic conceptions of space:
* an isovist (popularised by Michael Benedikt at University of Texas), or viewshed or visibility polygon, the field of view from any particular point
* axial space (idea popularised by Bill Hillier at UCL), a straight sight-line and possible path
* convex space (popularised by John Peponis, and his collaborators at Georgia Tech), an occupiable void where, if imagined as a wireframe diagram, no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter: all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon.

The three most popular ways of analysing a street network are integration, choice and depth distance.

===Integration===
Integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment, to reach all other street segments in the network, using shortest paths. The graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius &#x27;n&#x27;, for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account. The first intersecting segment requires only one transition, the second two transitions and so on. The result of the analysis finds street segments that require fewest turns to reach all other streets, which are called &#x27;most integrated&#x27; and are usually represented with hotter colours, such as red or yellow. Integration can also be analysed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network. In the case of radius 4, for instance, only four turns are counted departing from each street segment. Measure also is highly related to network analysis Centrality.

Theoretically, the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street, and is often argued to &#x27;predict&#x27; the pedestrian use of a street: the easier it is to reach a street, the more popular it should be.
While there is some evidence of this being true, the method is biased towards long, straight streets that intersect with many other streets. Such streets, as Oxford Street in London, come out as especially strongly integrated. However, a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments, not counted as a single line, which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis.

===Choice===
The choice measure is easiest to understand as a &#x27;water-flow&#x27; in the street network. Imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water, which then starts pouring from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it. Each time an intersection appears, the remaining value of flow is divided equally among the splitting streets, until all the other street segments in the graph are reached. For instance, at the first intersection with a single other street, the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half, and allocated to the two intersecting street segments. Moving further down, the remaining one half value is again split among the intersecting streets and so on. When the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one, a graph of final values appears. The streets with the highest total values of accumulated flow are said to have the highest choice values.

Like integration, choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii, for instance 400m, 800m, 1600m. Interpreting Choice analysis is trickier than integration. Space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets, but, strictly speaking, choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street. However, since flow values are divided (not subtracted) at each intersection, the output shows an exponential distribution. It is considered best to take a log of base two of the final values in order to get a more accurate picture.

===Depth distance===
Depth distance is the most intuitive of the analysis methods. It explains the linear distance from the center point of each street segment to the center points of all the other segments. If every segment is successively chosen as a starting point, a graph of cumulative final values is achieved. The streets with lowest Depth Distance values are said to be nearest to all the other streets. Again, the search radius can be limited to any distance.

==Applications==
From these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is, useful for the design of museums, airports, hospitals, and other settings where wayfinding is a significant issue. Space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime, traffic flow, and sales per unit area.

In general, the analysis uses one of many software programs that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one (or more) of the primary spatial components.

==History==
Space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when Bill Hillier, Adrian Leaman and Alan Beattie came together at the School of Environmental Studies at University College London (now part of the Bartlett School of Architecture). Bill Hillier had been appointed Director of the Unit for Architectural Studies (UAS) as successor to John Musgrove. They established a new MSc programme in Advanced Architectural Studies and embarked on a programme of research aimed at developing a theoretical basis for architecture. Previously Bill Hillier had written papers with others as secretary to the RIBA, notably &#x27;Knowledge and Design&#x27; and &#x27;How is Design Possible&#x27;. These laid the theoretical foundation for a series of studies that sought to clarify how the built environment relates to society. One of the first cohorts of students on the MScAAS was Julienne Hanson who went on to co-author &quot;The Social Logic of Space&quot; (SLS) with Bill Hillier (CUP, 1984). This brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point, but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes, but also play a role in producing social forms. SLS also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale, making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment. These methods coupled to the social theories have turned out to have a good deal of explanatory power. Space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in architecture, urban design, urban planning, transport and interior design. Many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice Space Syntax Limited, which was founded at The Bartlett, University College London in 1989. These include the redesign of Trafalgar Square with Foster and Partners and the Pedestrian Movement Model for the City of London.

Over the past decade, Space syntax techniques have been used for research in archaeology, information technology, urban and human geography, and anthropology. Since 1997, the Space syntax community has held biennial conferences, and many journal papers have been published on the subject, chiefly in Environment and Planning B.

==Criticism==
Space syntax&#x27;s mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with &#x27;axial maps&#x27;, one of the method&#x27;s primary representations of spatial configuration. This paradox was proposed by Carlo Ratti at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with Bill Hillier and Alan Penn. There have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional transport engineering models, using intersections as nodes and constructing visibility graphs to link them, by researchers including Bin Jiang, Valerio Cutini and Michael Batty. Recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in GIS, such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group Spatial Analysis and Design at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. A series of interdisciplinary works published in 2006 by Vito Latora, Sergio Porta and colleagues, proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design, have highlighted space syntax&#x27; contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks.

<doc id="174705" wikidata="Q613048" url="?curid=174705" title="Algebraic number theory">
<text>Algebraic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses the techniques of abstract algebra to study the integers, rational numbers, and their generalizations. Number-theoretic questions are expressed in terms of properties of algebraic objects such as algebraic number fields and their rings of integers, finite fields, and function fields. These properties, such as whether a ring admits unique factorization, the behavior of ideals, and the Galois groups of fields, can resolve questions of primary importance in number theory, like the existence of solutions to Diophantine equations.

==History==
===Diophantus===
The beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to Diophantine equations, named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician, Diophantus, who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of Diophantine equations. A typical Diophantine problem is to find two integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that their sum, and the sum of their squares, equal two given numbers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively:

:formula_1
:formula_2

Diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years. For example, the solutions to the quadratic Diophantine equation &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;z&quot;2 are given by the Pythagorean triples, originally solved by the Babylonians (). Solutions to linear Diophantine equations, such as 26&quot;x&quot; + 65&quot;y&quot; = 13, may be found using the Euclidean algorithm (c. 5th century BC).

Diophantus&#x27;s major work was the &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, of which only a portion has survived.

===Fermat===
Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, famously in the margin of a copy of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. No successful proof was published until 1995 despite the efforts of countless mathematicians during the 358 intervening years. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century.

===Gauss===
One of the founding works of algebraic number theory, the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (Latin: &quot;Arithmetical Investigations&quot;) is a textbook of number theory written in Latin by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1798 when Gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre and adds important new results of his own. Before the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; was published, number theory consisted of a collection of isolated theorems and conjectures. Gauss brought the work of his predecessors together with his own original work into a systematic framework, filled in gaps, corrected unsound proofs, and extended the subject in numerous ways.

The &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; was the starting point for the work of other nineteenth century European mathematicians including Ernst Kummer, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind. Many of the annotations given by Gauss are in effect announcements of further research of his own, some of which remained unpublished. They must have appeared particularly cryptic to his contemporaries; we can now read them as containing the germs of the theories of L-functions and complex multiplication, in particular.

===Dirichlet===
In a couple of papers in 1838 and 1839 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet proved the first class number formula, for quadratic forms (later refined by his student Leopold Kronecker). The formula, which Jacobi called a result &quot;touching the utmost of human acumen&quot;, opened the way for similar results regarding more general number fields. Based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields, he proved the Dirichlet unit theorem, a fundamental result in algebraic number theory.

He first used the pigeonhole principle, a basic counting argument, in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat&#x27;s last theorem, for which he proved the cases &quot;n&quot; = 5 and &quot;n&quot; = 14, and to the biquadratic reciprocity law. The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other researchers.

===Dedekind===
Richard Dedekind&#x27;s study of Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s work was what led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals. In 1863, he published Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s lectures on number theory as &quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot; (&quot;Lectures on Number Theory&quot;) about which it has been written that:
1879 and 1894 editions of the &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; included supplements introducing the notion of an ideal, fundamental to ring theory. (The word &quot;Ring&quot;, introduced later by Hilbert, does not appear in Dedekind&#x27;s work.) Dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients. The concept underwent further development in the hands of Hilbert and, especially, of Emmy Noether. Ideals generalize Ernst Eduard Kummer&#x27;s ideal numbers, devised as part of Kummer&#x27;s 1843 attempt to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

===Hilbert===
David Hilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise &quot;Zahlbericht&quot; (literally &quot;report on numbers&quot;). He also resolved a significant number-theory problem formulated by Waring in 1770. As with the finiteness theorem, he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers. He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.

He made a series of conjectures on class field theory. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution lives on in the names of the Hilbert class field and of the Hilbert symbol of local class field theory. Results were mostly proved by 1930, after work by Teiji Takagi.

===Artin===
Emil Artin established the Artin reciprocity law in a series of papers (1924; 1927; 1930). This law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory. The term &quot;reciprocity law&quot; refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it generalized, from the quadratic reciprocity law and the reciprocity laws of Eisenstein and Kummer to Hilbert&#x27;s product formula for the norm symbol. Artin&#x27;s result provided a partial solution to Hilbert&#x27;s ninth problem.

===Modern theory===
Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama observed a possible link between two apparently completely distinct, branches of mathematics, elliptic curves and modular forms. The resulting modularity theorem (at the time known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that every elliptic curve is modular, meaning that it can be associated with a unique modular form.

It was initially dismissed as unlikely or highly speculative, but was taken more seriously when number theorist André Weil found evidence supporting it, yet no proof; as a result the &quot;astounding&quot; conjecture was often known as the Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture. It became a part of the Langlands program, a list of important conjectures needing proof or disproof.

From 1993 to 1994, Andrew Wiles provided a proof of the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which, together with Ribet&#x27;s theorem, provided a proof for Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Almost every mathematician at the time had previously considered both Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem and the Modularity Theorem either impossible or virtually impossible to prove, even given the most cutting-edge developments. Wiles first announced his proof in June 1993 in a version that was soon recognized as having a serious gap at a key point. The proof was corrected by Wiles, partly in collaboration with Richard Taylor, and the final, widely accepted version was released in September 1994, and formally published in 1995. The proof uses many techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory, and has many ramifications in these branches of mathematics. It also uses standard constructions of modern algebraic geometry, such as the category of schemes and Iwasawa theory, and other 20th-century techniques not available to Fermat.

==Basic notions==
===Failure of unique factorization===
An important property of the ring of integers is that it satisfies the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, that every (positive) integer has a factorization into a product of prime numbers, and this factorization is unique up to the ordering of the factors. This may no longer be true in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field .

A &quot;prime element&quot; is an element of such that if divides a product , then it divides one of the factors or . This property is closely related to primality in the integers, because any positive integer satisfying this property is either or a prime number. However, it is strictly weaker. For example, is not a prime number because it is negative, but it is a prime element. If factorizations into prime elements are permitted, then, even in the integers, there are alternative factorizations such as
:formula_3
In general, if is a unit, meaning a number with a multiplicative inverse in , and if is a prime element, then is also a prime element. Numbers such as and are said to be &quot;associate&quot;. In the integers, the primes and are associate, but only one of these is positive. Requiring that prime numbers be positive selects a unique element from among a set of associated prime elements. When &quot;K&quot; is not the rational numbers, however, there is no analog of positivity. For example, in the Gaussian integers , the numbers and are associate because the latter is the product of the former by , but there is no way to single out one as being more canonical than the other. This leads to equations such as
:formula_4
which prove that in , it is not true that factorizations are unique up to the order of the factors. For this reason, one adopts the definition of unique factorization used in unique factorization domains (UFDs). In a UFD, the prime elements occurring in a factorization are only expected to be unique up to units and their ordering.

However, even with this weaker definition, many rings of integers in algebraic number fields do not admit unique factorization. There is an algebraic obstruction called the ideal class group. When the ideal class group is trivial, the ring is a UFD. When it is not, there is a distinction between a prime element and an irreducible element. An &quot;irreducible element&quot; is an element such that if , then either or is a unit. These are the elements that cannot be factored any further. Every element in &quot;O&quot; admits a factorization into irreducible elements, but it may admit more than one. This is because, while all prime elements are irreducible, some irreducible elements may not be prime. For example, consider the ring . In this ring, the numbers , and are irreducible. This means that the number has two factorizations into irreducible elements,
:formula_5
This equation shows that divides the product . If were a prime element, then it would divide or , but it does not, because all elements divisible by are of the form . Similarly, and divide the product , but neither of these elements divides itself, so neither of them are prime. As there is no sense in which the elements , and can be made equivalent, unique factorization fails in . Unlike the situation with units, where uniqueness could be repaired by weakening the definition, overcoming this failure requires a new perspective.

===Factorization into prime ideals===
If is an ideal in , then there is always a factorization
:formula_6
where each formula_7 is a prime ideal, and where this expression is unique up to the order of the factors. In particular, this is true if is the principal ideal generated by a single element. This is the strongest sense in which the ring of integers of a general number field admits unique factorization. In the language of ring theory, it says that rings of integers are Dedekind domains.

When is a UFD, every prime ideal is generated by a prime element. Otherwise, there are prime ideals which are not generated by prime elements. In , for instance, the ideal is a prime ideal which cannot be generated by a single element.

Historically, the idea of factoring ideals into prime ideals was preceded by Ernst Kummer&#x27;s introduction of ideal numbers. These are numbers lying in an extension field of . This extension field is now known as the Hilbert class field. By the principal ideal theorem, every prime ideal of generates a principal ideal of the ring of integers of . A generator of this principal ideal is called an ideal number. Kummer used these as a substitute for the failure of unique factorization in cyclotomic fields. These eventually led Richard Dedekind to introduce a forerunner of ideals and to prove unique factorization of ideals.

An ideal which is prime in the ring of integers in one number field may fail to be prime when extended to a larger number field. Consider, for example, the prime numbers. The corresponding ideals are prime ideals of the ring . However, when this ideal is extended to the Gaussian integers to obtain , it may or may not be prime. For example, the factorization implies that
:formula_8
note that because , the ideals generated by and are the same. A complete answer to the question of which ideals remain prime in the Gaussian integers is provided by Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares. It implies that for an odd prime number , is a prime ideal if and is not a prime ideal if . This, together with the observation that the ideal is prime, provides a complete description of the prime ideals in the Gaussian integers. Generalizing this simple result to more general rings of integers is a basic problem in algebraic number theory. Class field theory accomplishes this goal when &quot;K&quot; is an abelian extension of Q (that is, a Galois extension with abelian Galois group).

===Ideal class group===
Unique factorization fails if and only if there are prime ideals that fail to be principal. The object which measures the failure of prime ideals to be principal is called the ideal class group. Defining the ideal class group requires enlarging the set of ideals in a ring of algebraic integers so that they admit a group structure. This is done by generalizing ideals to fractional ideals. A fractional ideal is an additive subgroup of which is closed under multiplication by elements of , meaning that if . All ideals of are also fractional ideals. If and are fractional ideals, then the set of all products of an element in and an element in is also a fractional ideal. This operation makes the set of non-zero fractional ideals into a group. The group identity is the ideal , and the inverse of is a (generalized) ideal quotient:

:formula_9

The principal fractional ideals, meaning the ones of the form where , form a subgroup of the group of all non-zero fractional ideals. The quotient of the group of non-zero fractional ideals by this subgroup is the ideal class group. Two fractional ideals and represent the same element of the ideal class group if and only if there exists an element such that . Therefore, the ideal class group makes two fractional ideals equivalent if one is as close to being principal as the other is. The ideal class group is generally denoted , , or (with the last notation identifying it with the Picard group in algebraic geometry).

The number of elements in the class group is called the class number of &quot;K&quot;. The class number of is 2. This means that there are only two ideal classes, the class of principal fractional ideals, and the class of a non-principal fractional ideal such as .

The ideal class group has another description in terms of divisors. These are formal objects which represent possible factorizations of numbers. The divisor group is defined to be the free abelian group generated by the prime ideals of . There is a group homomorphism from , the non-zero elements of up to multiplication, to . Suppose that satisfies
:formula_10
Then is defined to be the divisor
:formula_11
The kernel of is the group of units in , while the cokernel is the ideal class group. In the language of homological algebra, this says that there is an exact sequence of abelian groups (written multiplicatively),
:formula_12

===Real and complex embeddings===
Some number fields, such as , can be specified as subfields of the real numbers. Others, such as , cannot. Abstractly, such a specification corresponds to a field homomorphism or . These are called real embeddings and complex embeddings, respectively.

A real quadratic field , with , and not a perfect square, is so-called because it admits two real embeddings but no complex embeddings. These are the field homomorphisms which send to and to , respectively. Dually, an imaginary quadratic field admits no real embeddings but admits a conjugate pair of complex embeddings. One of these embeddings sends to , while the other sends it to its complex conjugate, .

Conventionally, the number of real embeddings of is denoted , while the number of conjugate pairs of complex embeddings is denoted . The signature of &quot;K&quot; is the pair . It is a theorem that , where is the degree of .

Considering all embeddings at once determines a function formula_13, or equivalently formula_14
This is called the Minkowski embedding.

The subspace of the codomain fixed by complex conjugation is a real vector space of dimension called Minkowski space. Because the Minkowski embedding is defined by field homomorphisms, multiplication of elements of by an element corresponds to multiplication by a diagonal matrix in the Minkowski embedding. The dot product on Minkowski space corresponds to the trace form formula_15.

The image of under the Minkowski embedding is a -dimensional lattice. If is a basis for this lattice, then is the discriminant of . The discriminant is denoted or . The covolume of the image of is formula_16.

===Places===
Real and complex embeddings can be put on the same footing as prime ideals by adopting a perspective based on valuations. Consider, for example, the integers. In addition to the usual absolute value function |·| : Q → R, there are p-adic absolute value functions |·|p : Q → R, defined for each prime number &quot;p&quot;, which measure divisibility by &quot;p&quot;. Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem states that these are all possible absolute value functions on Q (up to equivalence). Therefore, absolute values are a common language to describe both the real embedding of Q and the prime numbers.

A place of an algebraic number field is an equivalence class of absolute value functions on &quot;K&quot;. There are two types of places. There is a formula_17-adic absolute value for each prime ideal formula_17 of &quot;O&quot;, and, like the &quot;p&quot;-adic absolute values, it measures divisibility. These are called finite places. The other type of place is specified using a real or complex embedding of &quot;K&quot; and the standard absolute value function on R or C. These are infinite places. Because absolute values are unable to distinguish between a complex embedding and its conjugate, a complex embedding and its conjugate determine the same place. Therefore, there are real places and complex places. Because places encompass the primes, places are sometimes referred to as primes. When this is done, finite places are called finite primes and infinite places are called infinite primes. If is a valuation corresponding to an absolute value, then one frequently writes formula_19 to mean that is an infinite place and formula_20 to mean that it is a finite place.

Considering all the places of the field together produces the adele ring of the number field. The adele ring allows one to simultaneously track all the data available using absolute values. This produces significant advantages in situations where the behavior at one place can affect the behavior at other places, as in the Artin reciprocity law.

==== Places at infinity geometrically ====
There is a geometric analogy for places at infinity which holds on the function fields of curves. For example, let formula_21 and formula_22 be a smooth, projective, algebraic curve. The function field formula_23 has many absolute values, or places, and each corresponds to a point on the curve. If formula_24 is the projective completion of an affine curve formula_25 then the points in formula_26 correspond to the places at infinity. Then, the completion of formula_27 at one of these points gives an analogue of the formula_28-adics.

For example, if formula_29 then its function field is isomorphic to formula_30 where formula_31 is an indeterminant and the field formula_27 is the field of fractions of polynomials in formula_31. Then, a place formula_34 at a point formula_35 measures the order of vanishing or the order of a pole of a fraction of polynomials formula_36 at the point formula_28. For example, if formula_38, so on the affine chart formula_39 this corresponds to the point formula_40, the valuation formula_41 measures the order of vanishing of formula_42 minus the order of vanishing of formula_43 at formula_44. The function field of the completion at the place formula_41 is then formula_46 which is the field of power series in the variable formula_47, so an element is of the formfor some formula_48. For the place at infinity, this corresponds to the function field formula_49 which are power series of the form

===Units===
The integers have only two units, and . Other rings of integers may admit more units. The Gaussian integers have four units, the previous two as well as . The Eisenstein integers have six units. The integers in real quadratic number fields have infinitely many units. For example, in , every power of is a unit, and all these powers are distinct.

In general, the group of units of , denoted , is a finitely generated abelian group. The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups therefore implies that it is a direct sum of a torsion part and a free part. Reinterpreting this in the context of a number field, the torsion part consists of the roots of unity that lie in . This group is cyclic. The free part is described by Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem. This theorem says that rank of the free part is . Thus, for example, the only fields for which the rank of the free part is zero are and the imaginary quadratic fields. A more precise statement giving the structure of &quot;O&quot;× ⊗Z Q as a Galois module for the Galois group of &quot;K&quot;/Q is also possible.

The free part of the unit group can be studied using the infinite places of . Consider the function

:formula_50
where varies over the infinite places of and |·|&quot;v&quot; is the absolute value associated with . The function is a homomorphism from to a real vector space. It can be shown that the image of is a lattice that spans the hyperplane defined by formula_51 The covolume of this lattice is the regulator of the number field. One of the simplifications made possible by working with the adele ring is that there is a single object, the idele class group, that describes both the quotient by this lattice and the ideal class group.

===Zeta function===
The Dedekind zeta function of a number field, analogous to the Riemann zeta function, is an analytic object which describes the behavior of prime ideals in . When is an abelian extension of , Dedekind zeta functions are products of Dirichlet L-functions, with there being one factor for each Dirichlet character. The trivial character corresponds to the Riemann zeta function. When is a Galois extension, the Dedekind zeta function is the Artin L-function of the regular representation of the Galois group of , and it has a factorization in terms of irreducible Artin representations of the Galois group.

The zeta function is related to the other invariants described above by the class number formula.

===Local fields===

Completing a number field &quot;K&quot; at a place &quot;w&quot; gives a complete field. If the valuation is Archimedean, one obtains R or C, if it is non-Archimedean and lies over a prime &quot;p&quot; of the rationals, one obtains a finite extension formula_52 a complete, discrete valued field with finite residue field. This process simplifies the arithmetic of the field and allows the local study of problems. For example, the Kronecker–Weber theorem can be deduced easily from the analogous local statement. The philosophy behind the study of local fields is largely motivated by geometric methods. In algebraic geometry, it is common to study varieties locally at a point by localizing to a maximal ideal. Global information can then be recovered by gluing together local data. This spirit is adopted in algebraic number theory. Given a prime in the ring of algebraic integers in a number field, it is desirable to study the field locally at that prime. Therefore, one localizes the ring of algebraic integers to that prime and then completes the fraction field much in the spirit of geometry.

==Major results==
===Finiteness of the class group===
One of the classical results in algebraic number theory is that the ideal class group of an algebraic number field &quot;K&quot; is finite. This is a consequence of Minkowski&#x27;s theorem since there are only finitely many Integral ideals with norm less than a fixed positive integer page 78. The order of the class group is called the class number, and is often denoted by the letter &quot;h&quot;.

===Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem===

Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem provides a description of the structure of the multiplicative group of units &quot;O&quot;× of the ring of integers &quot;O&quot;. Specifically, it states that &quot;O&quot;× is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; × Z&quot;r&quot;, where &quot;G&quot; is the finite cyclic group consisting of all the roots of unity in &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; = &quot;r&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2 − 1 (where &quot;r&quot;1 (respectively, &quot;r&quot;2) denotes the number of real embeddings (respectively, pairs of conjugate non-real embeddings) of &quot;K&quot;). In other words, &quot;O&quot;× is a finitely generated abelian group of rank &quot;r&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2 − 1 whose torsion consists of the roots of unity in &quot;O&quot;.

===Reciprocity laws===
In terms of the Legendre symbol, the law of quadratic reciprocity for positive odd primes states
:formula_53

A reciprocity law is a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity.

There are several different ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol (&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;) generalizing the quadratic reciprocity symbol, that describes when a prime number is an &quot;n&quot;th power residue modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;) and (&quot;q&quot;/&quot;p&quot;). Hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over &quot;p&quot; of Hilbert symbols (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;/&quot;p&quot;), taking values in roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin&#x27;s reformulated reciprocity law states that the Artin symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup. Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see.

===Class number formula===

The class number formula relates many important invariants of a number field to a special value of its Dedekind zeta function.

==Related areas==
Algebraic number theory interacts with many other mathematical disciplines. It uses tools from homological algebra. Via the analogy of function fields vs. number fields, it relies on techniques and ideas from algebraic geometry. Moreover, the study of higher-dimensional schemes over Z instead of number rings is referred to as arithmetic geometry. Algebraic number theory is also used in the study of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

<text>In mathematics, the Laplace operator or Laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function on Euclidean space. It is usually denoted by the symbols formula_1, formula_2 (where formula_3 is the nabla operator), or formula_4. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the Laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable. In other coordinate systems, such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates, the Laplacian also has a useful form. Informally, the Laplacian of a function at a point measures by how much the average value of over small spheres or balls centered at deviates from .

The Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics: the Laplacian of the gravitational potential due to a given mass density distribution is a constant multiple of that density distribution. Solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation are called harmonic functions and represent the possible gravitational potentials in regions of vacuum.

The Laplacian occurs in many differential equations describing physical phenomena. Poisson&#x27;s equation describes electric and gravitational potentials; the diffusion equation describes heat and fluid flow; the wave equation describes wave propagation; and the Schrödinger equation describes the wave function in quantum mechanics. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks, such as blob and edge detection. The Laplacian is the simplest elliptic operator and is at the core of Hodge theory as well as the results of de Rham cohomology.

==Definition==
The Laplace operator is a second-order differential operator in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, defined as the divergence (formula_5) of the gradient (formula_6). Thus if formula_7 is a twice-differentiable real-valued function, then the Laplacian of formula_7 is the real-valued function defined by:

where the latter notations derive from formally writing:
formula_9
Explicitly, the Laplacian of is thus the sum of all the &quot;unmixed&quot; second partial derivatives in the Cartesian coordinates :
As a second-order differential operator, the Laplace operator maps functions to functions for . It is a linear operator , or more generally, an operator for any open set .

Alternatively, the Laplace operator can be defined as:formula_10

Where formula_11 is the dimension of the space, formula_12 is the average value of formula_7 on the surface of a n-sphere of radius R, formula_14 is the surface integral over a n-sphere of radius R, and formula_15 is the hypervolume of the boundary of a unit n-sphere.

== Motivation ==

=== Diffusion ===
In the physical theory of diffusion, the Laplace operator arises naturally in the mathematical description of equilibrium. Specifically, if is the density at equilibrium of some quantity such as a chemical concentration, then the net flux of through the boundary (also called ) of any smooth region is zero, provided there is no source or sink within :
formula_16
where is the outward unit normal to the boundary of . By the divergence theorem,
formula_17

Since this holds for all smooth regions , one can show that it implies:
formula_18
The left-hand side of this equation is the Laplace operator, and the entire equation is known as Laplace&#x27;s equation. Solutions of the Laplace equation, i.e. functions whose Laplacian is identically zero, thus represent possible equilibrium densities under diffusion.

The Laplace operator itself has a physical interpretation for non-equilibrium diffusion as the extent to which a point represents a source or sink of chemical concentration, in a sense made precise by the diffusion equation. This interpretation of the Laplacian is also explained by the following fact about averages.

=== Averages ===
Given a twice continuously differentiable function formula_19 and a point formula_20, the average value of formula_21 over the ball with radius formula_22 centered at formula_23 is:
formula_24

Similarly, the average value of formula_21 over the sphere (the boundary of a ball) with radius formula_22 centered at formula_23 is:
formula_28

=== Density associated with a potential ===
If denotes the electrostatic potential associated to a charge distribution , then the charge distribution itself is given by the negative of the Laplacian of :
formula_29
where is the electric constant.

This is a consequence of Gauss&#x27;s law. Indeed, if is any smooth region with boundary , then by Gauss&#x27;s law the flux of the electrostatic field across the boundary is proportional to the charge enclosed:
formula_30
where the first equality is due to the divergence theorem. Since the electrostatic field is the (negative) gradient of the potential, this gives:
formula_31

Since this holds for all regions , we must have
formula_32

The same approach implies that the negative of the Laplacian of the gravitational potential is the mass distribution. Often the charge (or mass) distribution are given, and the associated potential is unknown. Finding the potential function subject to suitable boundary conditions is equivalent to solving Poisson&#x27;s equation.

=== Energy minimization ===
Another motivation for the Laplacian appearing in physics is that solutions to in a region are functions that make the Dirichlet energy functional stationary:
formula_33

To see this, suppose is a function, and is a function that vanishes on the boundary of . Then:
formula_34

where the last equality follows using Green&#x27;s first identity. This calculation shows that if , then is stationary around . Conversely, if is stationary around , then by the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations.

== Coordinate expressions ==

=== Two dimensions ===
The Laplace operator in two dimensions is given by:

In Cartesian coordinates,
formula_35
where and are the standard Cartesian coordinates of the -plane.

In polar coordinates,
formula_36
where represents the radial distance and the angle.

===Three dimensions===

In three dimensions, it is common to work with the Laplacian in a variety of different coordinate systems.

In Cartesian coordinates,
formula_37

In cylindrical coordinates,
formula_38
where formula_39 represents the radial distance, the azimuth angle and the height.

In spherical coordinates:
formula_40
or 
formula_41
by expanding the first and second term, these expressions read
formula_42

where represents the azimuthal angle and the zenith angle or co-latitude. In particular, the above is equivalent to

formula_43

where formula_44 is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the unit sphere. 
In general curvilinear coordinates ():
formula_45

where summation over the repeated indices is implied,
 is the inverse metric tensor and are the Christoffel symbols for the selected coordinates.

=== dimensions ===
In arbitrary curvilinear coordinates in dimensions (), we can write the Laplacian in terms of the inverse metric tensor, formula_46:
formula_47
from the Voss-Weyl formula for the divergence.

In spherical coordinates in dimensions, with the parametrization with representing a positive real radius and an element of the unit sphere ,
formula_48
where is the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the -sphere, known as the spherical Laplacian. The two radial derivative terms can be equivalently rewritten as:
formula_49

As a consequence, the spherical Laplacian of a function defined on can be computed as the ordinary Laplacian of the function extended to so that it is constant along rays, i.e., homogeneous of degree zero.

==Euclidean invariance==
The Laplacian is invariant under all Euclidean transformations: rotations and translations. In two dimensions, for example, this means that:
formula_50
for all &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;b&quot;. In arbitrary dimensions,
formula_51
whenever &quot;ρ&quot; is a rotation, and likewise:
formula_52
whenever &quot;τ&quot; is a translation. (More generally, this remains true when &quot;ρ&quot; is an orthogonal transformation such as a reflection.)

In fact, the algebra of all scalar linear differential operators, with constant coefficients, that commute with all Euclidean transformations, is the polynomial algebra generated by the Laplace operator.

==Spectral theory==

The spectrum of the Laplace operator consists of all eigenvalues for which there is a corresponding eigenfunction with:
formula_53

This is known as the Helmholtz equation.

If is a bounded domain in , then the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space . This result essentially follows from the spectral theorem on compact self-adjoint operators, applied to the inverse of the Laplacian (which is compact, by the Poincaré inequality and the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem). It can also be shown that the eigenfunctions are infinitely differentiable functions. More generally, these results hold for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on any compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, or indeed for the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of any elliptic operator with smooth coefficients on a bounded domain. When is the -sphere, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are the spherical harmonics.

==Vector Laplacian==
The vector Laplace operator, also denoted by formula_2, is a differential operator defined over a vector field. The vector Laplacian is similar to the scalar Laplacian; whereas the scalar Laplacian applies to a scalar field and returns a scalar quantity, the vector Laplacian applies to a vector field, returning a vector quantity. When computed in orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar Laplacian applied to each vector component.

The vector Laplacian of a vector field formula_55 is defined as
formula_56
This definition can be seen as the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector Laplacian.

In Cartesian coordinates, this reduces to the much simpler form as
formula_57
where formula_58, formula_59, and formula_60 are the components of the vector field formula_61, and formula_62 just on the left of each vector field component is the (scalar) Laplace operator. This can be seen to be a special case of Lagrange&#x27;s formula; see Vector triple product.

For expressions of the vector Laplacian in other coordinate systems see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates.

===Generalization===
The Laplacian of any tensor field formula_63 (&quot;tensor&quot; includes scalar and vector) is defined as the divergence of the gradient of the tensor:
formula_64

For the special case where formula_63 is a scalar (a tensor of degree zero), the Laplacian takes on the familiar form.

If formula_63 is a vector (a tensor of first degree), the gradient is a covariant derivative which results in a tensor of second degree, and the divergence of this is again a vector. The formula for the vector Laplacian above may be used to avoid tensor math and may be shown to be equivalent to the divergence of the Jacobian matrix shown below for the gradient of a vector:
formula_67

And, in the same manner, a dot product, which evaluates to a vector, of a vector by the gradient of another vector (a tensor of 2nd degree) can be seen as a product of matrices:
formula_68
This identity is a coordinate dependent result, and is not general.

===Use in physics===
An example of the usage of the vector Laplacian is the Navier-Stokes equations for a Newtonian incompressible flow:
formula_69
where the term with the vector Laplacian of the velocity field formula_70 represents the viscous stresses in the fluid.

Another example is the wave equation for the electric field that can be derived from Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the absence of charges and currents:
formula_71

This equation can also be written as:
formula_72
where formula_73 is the D&#x27;Alembertian, used in the Klein–Gordon equation.

==Some properties==
First of all, we say that a smooth function formula_74 is superharmonic whenever formula_75.

Let formula_76 be a smooth function, and let formula_77 be a connected compact set. If formula_78 is superharmonic, then, for every formula_79, we have
formula_80
for some constant formula_81 depending on formula_82 and formula_83. 

== Generalizations ==
A version of the Laplacian can be defined wherever the Dirichlet energy functional makes sense, which is the theory of Dirichlet forms. For spaces with additional structure, one can give more explicit descriptions of the Laplacian, as follows.

=== Laplace–Beltrami operator ===
The Laplacian also can be generalized to an elliptic operator called the Laplace–Beltrami operator defined on a Riemannian manifold. The Laplace–Beltrami operator, when applied to a function, is the trace () of the function&#x27;s Hessian:
formula_84
where the trace is taken with respect to the inverse of the metric tensor. The Laplace–Beltrami operator also can be generalized to an operator (also called the Laplace–Beltrami operator) which operates on tensor fields, by a similar formula.

Another generalization of the Laplace operator that is available on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds uses the exterior derivative, in terms of which the &quot;geometer&#x27;s Laplacian&quot; is expressed as
formula_85

Here is the codifferential, which can also be expressed in terms of the Hodge star and the exterior derivative. This operator differs in sign from the &quot;analyst&#x27;s Laplacian&quot; defined above. More generally, the &quot;Hodge&quot; Laplacian is defined on differential forms by
formula_86

This is known as the Laplace–de Rham operator, which is related to the Laplace–Beltrami operator by the Weitzenböck identity.

===D&#x27;Alembertian===
The Laplacian can be generalized in certain ways to non-Euclidean spaces, where it may be elliptic, hyperbolic, or ultrahyperbolic.

In Minkowski space the Laplace–Beltrami operator becomes the D&#x27;Alembert operator formula_87 or D&#x27;Alembertian:
formula_88

It is the generalization of the Laplace operator in the sense that it is the differential operator which is invariant under the isometry group of the underlying space and it reduces to the Laplace operator if restricted to time-independent functions. The overall sign of the metric here is chosen such that the spatial parts of the operator admit a negative sign, which is the usual convention in high-energy particle physics. The D&#x27;Alembert operator is also known as the wave operator because it is the differential operator appearing in the wave equations, and it is also part of the Klein–Gordon equation, which reduces to the wave equation in the massless case.

The additional factor of in the metric is needed in physics if space and time are measured in different units; a similar factor would be required if, for example, the direction were measured in meters while the direction were measured in centimeters. Indeed, theoretical physicists usually work in units such that in order to simplify the equation.

The d&#x27;Alembert operator generalizes to a hyperbolic operator on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

<doc id="174710" wikidata="Q157789" url="?curid=174710" title="Frederick I of Denmark">
<text>Frederick I (Danish and ; ; ; 7 October 1471 – 10 April 1533) was King of Denmark and Norway. He was the last Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation. As king of Norway, Frederick is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as such. Therefore, he was styled &quot;King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway&quot;. Frederick&#x27;s reign began the enduring tradition of calling kings of Denmark alternately by the names Christian and Frederick.

==Background==
Frederick was the younger son of the first Oldenburg King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95). Soon after the death of his father, the underage Frederick was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King John of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederick&#x27;s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.

In 1500, he had convinced his brother King John to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one-third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.

==Reign==
When his brother, King John died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederick the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew Christian II. In 1523, Christian was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate as king of Denmark and Norway, and Frederick took the throne of Denmark in 1523 and was elected king of Norway in 1524. It is not certain that Frederick ever learned to speak Danish. After becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.

In 1524 and 1525, Frederick had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (&quot;statholder&quot;) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power. He raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (&quot;Helsingborgs slott&quot;), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederick&#x27;s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.

Frederick played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teachings throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (&quot;værner&quot;) of the Catholic Church in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Catholic dioceses in the country. Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but Frederick took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Catholics and Lutherans share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language. In 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, Frederick appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.

Starting in 1527, Frederick authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Catholic nobles. 
During his reign, Frederick was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Catholics and Protestants. In 1532, he succeeded in capturing Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country. Frederick died on 10 April 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederick&#x27;s death, tensions between Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count&#x27;s Feud (&quot;Grevens Fejde&quot;).

==Family and children==

On 10 April 1502, Frederick married Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia. The couple had two children:

# Christian III, King of Denmark and Norway (12 August 1503 – 1 January 1559)
# Dorothea of Denmark (1 August 1504 – 11 April 1547), married 1 July 1526 to Albert, Duke of Prussia.

Frederick&#x27;s wife Anna died on 5 May 1514, 26 years old. Four years later on 9 October 1518 at Kiel, Frederick married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw &quot;the Great&quot;, Duke of Pomerania. Sophie and Frederick had six children:

# John II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (28 June 1521 – 2 October 1580)
# Elizabeth of Denmark (14 October 1524 – 15 October 1586), married:
## on 26 August 1543 to Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
## on 14 February 1556 to Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.
# Adolf of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (25 January 1526 – 1 October 1586)
# Anna of Denmark (1527 – 4 June 1535)
# Dorothea of Denmark (1528 – 11 November 1575), married on 27 October 1573 to Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.
# Frederick of Denmark (13 April 1532 – 27 October 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.

<doc id="174712" wikidata="Q1336488" url="?curid=174712" title="Fifth Republic Movement">
<text>The Fifth Republic Movement (Spanish: &quot;Movimiento V [Quinta] República&quot;, MVR) was a socialist political party in Venezuela. It was founded in July 1997, following a national congress of the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200, to support the candidacy of Hugo Chávez, the former President of Venezuela, in the 1998 presidential election. The &quot;Fifth Republic&quot; refers to the fact that in 1997 the Republic of Venezuela was the fourth in Venezuelan history, and the Movement aimed to re-found the Republic through a constituent assembly. Following Chávez&#x27; 1998 election victory, this took place in 1999, leading to the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela.

At the legislative elections on 30 July 2000, the party won 91 out of 165 seats in the National Assembly. On the same day, Hugo Chávez was elected president in the presidential elections with 59.5% of votes. In the parliamentary elections of 4 December 2005, the party won 114 out of 167 seats, with allied parties winning the remaining seats.

In December 2006 and January 2007, the party started its dissolution, to form the proposed United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). It merged into the PSUV on 20 October 2007.

==Foundation==
The MVR was founded in July 1997 to support the electoral aims of the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. In the early years after his release, Chávez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections. In July 1997, Chávez registered the new Fifth Republic Movement with the National Electoral Council.

==Aims==
The party was committed to the Bolivarian Revolution and claimed to be the political voice of the country&#x27;s poor. The MVR also pursued radical anti-americanism and Marxism. Party leaders often had contacts with Fidel Castro and the Cuban Communist Party, for example.

==Primary elections==

The Movement for a Fifth Republic (MVR), formerly Venezuela&#x27;s governing party, was the first political party in Venezuela to incorporate primary elections as the primary method for selecting its candidates.

Led by Hugo Chávez, but involving organizations and movements that are broader than the MVR, the question of how to select MVR candidates had been controversial. Until the implementation of this primary mechanism, candidates tended to be hand-picked by the leadership of the parties. The result had been that a number of those elected on MVR platforms were distrusted by the masses, and in some cases proved to be disloyal.

The issue came to a head in the lead-up to the regional elections of October 2005. Despite opposition from within the grassroots movements, a candidate list was drawn up by the leadership of various MVR allied parties. The decision not to hold primaries was justified by the claim that there wasn&#x27;t time. After the elections, Chavez stated that in the future, primaries would be held to empower the rank and file to select candidates.

Provisions introduced into the constitution and adopted by referendum in 1999 already mean that elected officials can have their mandate revoked half-way through their term if 20% of their electors sign a petition requesting a fresh election.

A total of 2.4 million people voted in the MVR primaries. More than 5200 candidates were pre-selected to compete for the 5618 positions up for grabs in the August elections. The remaining 418 positions will go to other pro-Chavez parties. However, other pro-Chavez groups have publicly criticized the MVR for taking these positions.

==The use of Venezuelan history==
Venezuela historiography recognizes four &quot;republics,&quot; or major regime changes, since the country was founded in 1811. The First Republic, known as the &quot;Venezuelan Confederation,&quot; lasted until 1812. The Second Republic is the restored republican regime that was instituted by Simón Bolívar after his Admirable Campaign in 1813, and which lasted until 1814. The Third Republic refers to the period after 1816 in which various patriot guerrilla bands joined under Bolívar&#x27;s leadership in the Llanos of Venezuela and set up an independent government. This process culminated in the Congress of Angostura, but shortly thereafter the Congress declared Venezuela to be part of a larger Gran Colombia. Gran Colombia lasted only a decade and at its dissolution Venezuela became once again the &quot;Republic of Venezuela,&quot; which is considered the start of the Fourth Republic. In 1864, the country was then restructured into the &quot;United States of Venezuela&quot;, before reverting once again to the name &quot;Republic of Venezuela&quot; in 1953. Although both periods began with the implementation of new constitutions (the fourth and twenty-fourth constitutions, respectively), both have been deemed by Venezuelan historiography as a continuation of the Fourth Republic.

Since Chávez&#x27;s election to the Presidency in 1998, the country has been known as the &quot;Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&quot;, signaling Chávez&#x27; desires to usher in a new era of politics and government. This unique &quot;Bolivarian&quot; government is the &quot;Fifth Republic&quot; referred to in the party&#x27;s title. The use of the phrase also echoes the French Fifth Republic, which was another sweeping political change to deal with political instability during decolonisation.

==Dissolution==
On 18 December 2006, Hugo Chávez announced plans to dissolve the party, hoping that the 23 other parties that supported his government would follow suit and collectively form the proposed United Socialist Party of Venezuela.

Elections the MVR participated in:
* 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, 2000 Venezuelan presidential election, 2006 Venezuelan presidential election
* 1998 Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2000 Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2005 Venezuelan parliamentary election
* 1998 Venezuelan regional elections, 2000 Venezuelan regional elections, 2004 Venezuelan regional elections
* April 1999 Venezuelan constitutional referendum, December 1999 Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum

* Diosdado Cabello
* Jesse Chacón
* Cilia Flores
* Willian Lara
* Nicolás Maduro

<doc id="174716" wikidata="Q134333" url="?curid=174716" title="Roger Moore">
<text>Sir Roger George Moore (14 October 192723 May 2017) was an English actor. He was the actor to portray Ian Fleming&#x27;s fictional secret agent James Bond in the Eon Productions/MGM Studios film series, playing the character in seven feature films: &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). Moore&#x27;s seven appearances as Bond are the most of any actor in the Eon-produced entries. 

On television, Moore played the lead role of Simon Templar, the title character in the British mystery thriller series &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–1969). He also had roles in American series, including Beau Maverick on the Western &quot;Maverick&quot; (1960–1961), in which he replaced James Garner as the lead, and a co-lead, with Tony Curtis, in the action-comedy &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1971–1972). Continuing to act on screen in the decades after his retirement from the Bond franchise, Moore&#x27;s final appearance was in a pilot for a new &quot;Saint&quot; series that became a 2017 television film.

Moore was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1991 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for services to charity. In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry. He was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 2008.

==Early life==
Roger George Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in Stockwell, London. He was the only child of George Alfred Moore (1904–1997), a policeman based in Bow Street, London, and Lillian &quot;Lily&quot; Pope (1904–1986). His mother was born in Calcutta, India, to an English family. He attended Battersea Grammar School, but was evacuated to Holsworthy in Devon during the Second World War, and attended Launceston College in Cornwall. He was further educated at Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.

Moore was apprenticed to an animation studio, but he was fired after he made a mistake with some animation cels. When his father investigated a robbery at the home of film director Brian Desmond Hurst, Moore was introduced to the director and hired as an extra for the 1945 film &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;. While there, Moore attracted an off-camera female fan following, and Hurst decided to pay Moore&#x27;s fees at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Moore spent three terms at RADA, where he was a classmate of his future Bond co-star Lois Maxwell, the original Miss Moneypenny. During his time there, he developed the relaxed demeanour that became his screen persona. He graduated RADA in 1948.

At 18, shortly after the end of the Second World War, Moore was conscripted for national service. On 21 September 1946, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant. He was an officer in the Combined Services Entertainment section, eventually becoming a captain commanding a small depot in West Germany, where he looked after entertainers for the armed forces passing through Hamburg.

==Career==
===Early work (1945–1953)===
Moore made his professional debut in Alexander Korda&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1945) alongside actors Robert Donat, Deborah Kerr, and Glynis Johns. Other early uncredited appearances include &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945), &quot;Gaiety George&quot;, &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot; (both 1946), and &quot;Trottie True&quot; (1949), in which he appeared alongside an uncredited Christopher Lee (both actors being cast by Brian Desmond Hurst as stage-door Johnnies).

In his book &quot;Last Man Standing: Tales from Tinseltown&quot;, Moore states that his first television appearance was on 27 March 1949 in &quot;The Governess&quot; by Patrick Hamilton, a live broadcast (as usual in that era), in which he played the minor part of Bob Drew. Other actors in the show included Clive Morton and Betty Ann Davies. He had uncredited parts in films including &quot;Paper Orchid&quot; and &quot;The Interrupted Journey&quot; (both 1949). He was in &quot;Drawing-Room Detective&quot; on TV and appeared in the films &quot;One Wild Oat&quot; and &quot;Honeymoon Deferred&quot; (both 1951).

In the early 1950s Moore worked as a model, appearing in print advertisements in the UK for knitwear (earning him the nickname &quot;The Big Knit&quot;) and a wide range of other products such as toothpaste.

Moore travelled to the United States and began to work in television. He appeared in adaptations of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Black Chiffon&quot;, and in two episodes of &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, as well as the TV movie &quot;The Clay of Kings&quot; (all 1953).

===MGM (1954–1956)===
In March 1954, MGM signed Moore to a seven-year contract. He started his MGM contract with a small role in &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (1954), flirting with Elizabeth Taylor. He appeared in &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;, a biographical movie about opera singer Marjorie Lawrence&#x27;s recovery from polio, in which he was billed third under Glenn Ford and Eleanor Parker as Lawrence&#x27;s brother Cyril. That same year, he played a supporting role in the swashbuckler &quot;The King&#x27;s Thief&quot; starring Ann Blyth, Edmund Purdom, David Niven and George Sanders.

In the 1956 film &quot;Diane&quot;, Moore was billed third again, this time under Lana Turner and Pedro Armendariz, in a 16th-century period piece set in France with Moore playing Prince Henri, the future king. Moore was released from his MGM contract after two years following the film&#x27;s critical and commercial failure. In his own words, &quot;At MGM, RGM [Roger George Moore] was NBG [no bloody good].&quot;

Moore then freelanced for a time, appearing in episodes of &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; (1956), &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (1957) and &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; (1957).

===&quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1958–1959)===
Moore&#x27;s first success was playing the eponymous hero, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in the 1958–59 series &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, a loose adaptation of the 1819 romantic novel by Sir Walter Scott set in the 12th century during the era of Richard the Lionheart, delving into Ivanhoe&#x27;s conflict with Prince John. Shot mainly in England at Elstree Studios and Buckinghamshire, some of the show was also filmed in California owing to a partnership with Columbia Studios&#x27; Screen Gems. Aimed at younger audiences, the pilot was filmed in colour, a reflection of its comparatively high budget for a British children&#x27;s adventure series of the period, but subsequent episodes were shot in black and white. Christopher Lee and John Schlesinger were among the show&#x27;s guest stars, and series regulars included Robert Brown (who in the 1980s played M in several James Bond films) as the squire Gurth, Peter Gilmore as Waldo Ivanhoe, Andrew Keir as villainous Prince John, and Bruce Seton as noble King Richard. Moore suffered broken ribs and a battle-axe blow to his helmet while performing some of his own stunts filming a season of 39 half-hour episodes, and later reminisced, &quot;I felt a complete Charlie riding around in all that armour and damned stupid plumed helmet. I felt like a medieval fireman.&quot;

=== Warner Bros. (1959–1961) ===

After that, Moore spent a few years mainly doing one-shot parts in television series, including an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in 1959 titled &quot;The Avon Emeralds&quot;. He signed another long-term contract to a studio, this time to Warner Bros.

In 1959, he took the lead role in &quot;The Miracle&quot;, a version of the play &quot;Das Mirakel&quot; for Warner Bros. showcasing Carroll Baker as a nun. The part had been turned down by Dirk Bogarde. That same year, Moore was directed by Arthur Hiller in &quot;The Angry Young Man&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;The Third Man&quot; starring Michael Rennie as criminal mastermind Harry Lime, the role portrayed by Orson Welles in the film version.

====&quot;The Alaskans&quot; (1959–1960)====

Moore&#x27;s next television series involved playing the lead as &quot;Silky&quot; Harris for the ABC/Warner Bros. 1959–60 Western &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, with co-stars Dorothy Provine as Rocky, Jeff York as Reno, and Ray Danton as Nifty. The show ran for a single season of 37 hour-long episodes on Sunday nights. Though set in Skagway, Alaska, with a focus on the Klondike Gold Rush around 1896, the series was filmed in the hot studio lot at Warner Bros. in Hollywood with the cast costumed in fur coats and hats. Moore found the work highly taxing, and his off-camera affair with Provine complicated matters even more. Moore later referred to the experience as his &quot;most appalling television series.&quot;

He subsequently appeared as the questionable character &quot;14 Karat John&quot; in the two-part episode &quot;Right Off the Boat&quot; of the ABC/WB crime drama &quot;The Roaring 20s&quot;—alongside Rex Reason, John Dehner, Gary Vinson, and Dorothy Provine—appearing in a similar role but with a different character name.

====&quot;Maverick&quot; (1960–1961)====
In the wake of &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, Moore was cast as Beau Maverick, an English-accented cousin of frontier gamblers Bret Maverick (James Garner), Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly), and Brent Maverick (Robert Colbert) in the much more successful ABC/WB Western series &quot;Maverick&quot;.

Moore appeared as the character in 14 episodes after Garner had left the series at the end of the previous season, wearing some of Garner&#x27;s costumes; while filming &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, he had already recited much of Garner&#x27;s dialogue, for the Alaskan series frequently recycled &quot;Maverick&quot; scripts, changing only the names and locales. He had also filmed a &quot;Maverick&quot; episode with Garner two seasons earlier, in which Moore played a different character, in a retooling of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s 1775 comedy of manners play &quot;The Rivals&quot;. In the course of the story, Moore and Garner&#x27;s characters switched names on a bet, with Moore consequently identifying himself as &quot;Bret Maverick&quot; through most of the episode.

Moore&#x27;s debut as Beau Maverick occurred in the first episode of the 1960–61 fourth season, &quot;The Bundle from Britain&quot;, one of four episodes in which he shared screen time with cousin Bart (Jack Kelly). Robert Altman wrote and directed &quot;Bolt from the Blue&quot;, an episode featuring Will Hutchins as a frontier lawyer similar to his character in the series &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, and &quot;Red Dog&quot; found Beau mixed up with vicious bank robbers Lee Van Cleef and John Carradine. Kathleen Crowley was Moore&#x27;s leading lady in two episodes (&quot;Bullet for the Teacher&quot; and &quot;Kiz&quot;), and others included Mala Powers, Roxane Berard, Fay Spain, Merry Anders, Andra Martin, and Jeanne Cooper. Upon leaving the series, Moore cited a decline in script quality since the Garner era as the key factor in his decision to depart; ratings for the show were also down. Moore was originally slated to appear with both Jack Kelly and Robert Colbert in the series but by the time Colbert starred in his first episode, Moore had already left the series. Numerous early publicity stills of Kelly, Moore and Colbert posing together exist, however.

Moore was still under contract with Warners, who cast him in &quot;The Sins of Rachel Cade&quot; (1961), making love to a nun played by Angie Dickinson, and &quot;Gold of the Seven Saints&quot; (1961), supporting Clint Walker. He also went to Italy to make the adventure comedy &quot;Romulus and the Sabines&quot; (1961).

===&quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–1969)===

Lew Grade cast Moore as Simon Templar in a new adaptation of &quot;The Saint&quot;, based on the novels by Leslie Charteris. Moore said in an interview in 1963 that he wanted to buy the rights to Leslie Charteris&#x27;s character and the trademarks. The television series was broadcast by ITV in the UK between 1962 and 1969, and its overseas success made Moore a household name. After the strong performance in the US of the first two series in first-run syndication, NBC picked up the show in 1966. By early 1967, Moore had achieved international stardom. The series established his suave, quipping style which he carried forward to James Bond, and it also saw him exhibit his trademark raised eyebrow. Francis Blagburn in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; writes,

&quot;The Saint&quot; ran from 1962 for six seasons and 118 episodes. Moore went on to direct nine episodes of the later series, which moved into colour in 1967. Several episodes were edited together to form two films, &quot;The Saint and the Fiction Makers&quot; (1968) and &quot;Vendetta for the Saint&quot; (1969).

===Post-&quot;Saint&quot; films and &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1969–1972)===
He made two films immediately after the series ended: &quot;Crossplot&quot; (1969), a lightweight &#x27;spy caper&#x27; movie, and the more challenging &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot; (1970). Directed by Basil Dearden, it gave Moore the opportunity to demonstrate greater versatility than the role of Simon Templar had allowed. In 2004, Moore said of &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot;: &quot;It was one of the few times I was allowed to act... Many say my best role was in &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot;. Being a modest actor, I won&#x27;t disagree.&quot;

Lew Grade lured Moore to star alongside Tony Curtis in &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;. The show featured the adventures of two millionaire playboys across Europe. Moore was paid the then-unheard-of sum of £1 million for a single series, making him the highest-paid television actor in the world. Lew Grade claimed in his autobiography, &quot;Still Dancing&quot;, that Moore and Curtis &quot;didn&#x27;t hit it off all that well&quot;. Curtis refused to spend more time on set than was strictly necessary, while Moore was always willing to work overtime. According to the DVD commentary, neither Roger Moore, an uncredited co-producer, nor Robert S. Baker, the credited producer, ever had a contract other than a handshake with Lew Grade.

Despite its focus on the UK and US markets, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; became more successful in other international markets. On its premiere on the ITV network, it was beaten in the ratings by repeats of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; on BBC One. It did however place in the Top 20 most-viewed television series in the UK throughout 1971. The lack of success in the US, where it had been sold to ABC, Curtis put down to its showing at the Saturday 10pm slot, but it was successful in continental Europe and Australia. In Germany, where the series was aired under the name &quot;Die Zwei&quot; (&quot;The Two&quot;), it became a hit through especially amusing dubbing which only barely used translations of the original dialogue.

===James Bond era (1973–1985)===

====Moore as Bond====
Moore&#x27;s Bond was very different from the version created by Ian Fleming and the one portrayed by Connery. Screenwriters such as George MacDonald Fraser provided scenarios in which Moore was cast as a seasoned, debonair playboy who would always have a trick or gadget in stock when he needed it. This was designed to serve the contemporary taste of the 1970s. Moore&#x27;s version of Bond was also known for his sense of humour and witty one liners; as Moore himself said, &quot;My personality is different from previous Bonds. I&#x27;m not that cold-blooded-killer type. Which is why I play it mostly for laughs.&quot;

====&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973)====

Due to his commitment to several television shows, in particular &quot;The Saint&quot;, Roger Moore was unavailable for the James Bond films for a considerable time. His participation in &quot;The Saint&quot; was as actor, producer, and director, and he also became involved in developing the series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;. In 1964, he made a guest appearance as James Bond in the comedy series &quot;Mainly Millicent&quot;. Moore stated in his autobiography &quot;My Word Is My Bond&quot; (2008) that he had neither been approached to play the character in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, nor did he feel that he had ever been considered. Only after Sean Connery had declared in 1966 that he would not play Bond any longer did Moore become aware that he might be a contender for the role. After George Lazenby was cast in 1969&#x27;s &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and Connery was enticed back to the role of Bond again for &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), Moore did not consider the possibility until it seemed clear that Connery had stepped down as Bond for good. With &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; having been cancelled following poor ratings in the US, Moore was approached, and he accepted producer Albert Broccoli&#x27;s offer in August 1972. In his autobiography, Moore writes that he had to cut his hair and lose weight for the role. Although he resented having to make those changes, he was finally cast as James Bond in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973). Being 44 when he was cast in the role, Moore remains the oldest actor to portray James Bond.

Moore then made &quot;Gold&quot; (1974), based on a novel by Wilbur Smith for producer Michael Klinger and director Peter R. Hunt. He was paid US$200,000 plus a percentage of the profits.

====&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974)====
Moore made his second Bond film, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), which was a hit, though less successful than &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. It featured Christopher Lee as the main antagonist. Also appearing are Britt Ekland, Herve Villechaize, and Maud Adams. He then made a comedy &quot;That Lucky Touch&quot; (1975) which was a box office disaster. Moore made an Italian-shot action film &quot;Street People&quot; (1976), then went back to South Africa for another Klinger-Hunt movie from a Wilbur Smith novel, &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1976), which was successful in Britain, though less so in the US. Lee Marvin was a main cast member. Ian Holm was also featured, as well as Barbara Parkins.

==== &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) ====
Moore returned for a third outing as Bond in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), which was a massive box-office success. It also starred Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel in his first appearance as the villain Jaws. He returned to South Africa for a third action movie shot there, &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978), produced by Euan Lloyd and directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. It was a sizeable hit in Britain and Europe but, like &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, less so in the US. The cast featured Richard Burton, who had top billing, and Richard Harris.

Moore played the lead in &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1979) partly financed by Lew Grade. It was a heist adventure set in war-time Greece, and stars Telly Savalas and David Niven, and features mostly American character actors, including Elliott Gould, Stefanie Powers, Richard Roundtree, Sonny Bono, and Italian actress Claudia Cardinale. Roger Moore (with top billing) plays a charming former Austrian antiquities dealer turned crooked camp commandant, asked to guard Greek antiquities desired by the Third Reich, and also guard the collection of archaeologists who are being forced to work to find and recover these objects, but he has other plans for the treasure he guards and for the people under his watch.

====&quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979)====

Moore followed the success of his fourth outing as Bond, &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), with an action film, &quot;North Sea Hijack&quot; (1980), also known as &quot;ffolkes&quot;. Moore played a very un-Bond-like hero, opposite Anthony Perkins. The film was a box-office disappointment.

Better received was &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot; (1980), another World War Two adventure which reunited many of the crew from &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; including Euan Lloyd and McLaglen. It was based on the true story of a March 1943 event in British India and Portuguese Goa, in which a group of retired members of the Calcutta Light Horse, colonelled by David Niven&#x27;s character, assist regular British Army operatives, played by Moore and Gregory Peck, in destroying German ships in neutral Mormugao harbour, all the time surrounded by German spies and Indian nationalist intrigue. Trevor Howard, Patrick Macnee, and Barbara Kellerman also co-star, with a who&#x27;s-who lineup of British character actors.

Moore was in two all-star comedies: &quot;Sunday Lovers&quot; (1980), which flopped at the box office, and &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), which was a hit. The latter featured an ensemble cast, including Jackie Chan, Burt Reynolds, Dean Martin, Dom DeLuise, Sammy Davis Jr, and Farrah Fawcett.

====&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981)====
Moore returned for his fifth outing as Bond in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981).

====&quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983)====
Following the film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Moore expressed a desire to leave the role, and other actors were screen tested including James Brolin, but Moore was eventually enticed back for &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983).

The circumstances around &quot;Octopussy&quot;&#x27;s release were highly unusual in that another James Bond film was being released in the same year. Spearheaded by &quot;Thunderball&quot; producer Kevin McClory (who retained film rights to the property because the antecedent 1961 Ian Fleming novel was based on an unfilmed 1959 screenplay produced under the aegis of McClory, Jack Whittingham and Fleming), the non-Eon production &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; featured his predecessor Sean Connery returning to the role of Bond. Although tantamount to a loose remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, it was not set in the continuity of the previous Eon Bond films. This led to the media dubbing the one-time situation the &quot;Battle of the Bonds&quot;.

He made a cameo as Chief Inspector Clouseau, posing as a famous movie star, in &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983) (for which he was credited as &quot;Turk Thrust II&quot;). Then he tried a thriller &quot;The Naked Face&quot; (1984), written and directed by Bryan Forbes.

====&quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985)====
Moore starred in his final Bond film, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). He was the oldest actor to have played Bond – he was 45 in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, and 58 when he announced his retirement on 3 December 1985, having played the part for over twelve years. With seven films Moore holds the record for playing Bond the most times in the Eon series but is tied with Sean Connery in number of times playing Bond when counting Connery&#x27;s non-Eon appearance in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983).

In 1987, he hosted &quot;Happy Anniversary 007: 25 Years of James Bond&quot;.

===Post-James Bond career (1986–2017)===

Moore did not act on screen for five years after he stopped playing Bond; in 1990, he appeared in several films and in the writer-director Michael Feeney Callan&#x27;s television series &quot;My Riviera&quot; and starred in the film &quot;Bed &amp; Breakfast&quot; which was shot in 1989; and also had a large role in the 1996 film &quot;The Quest&quot;; in 1997, he starred as the Chief in &quot;Spice World&quot;. At the age of 73, he played a flamboyant homosexual man in &quot;Boat Trip&quot; (2002) with Cuba Gooding Jr.

The British satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; had a sketch in which their latex likeness of Moore, when asked to display emotions by an offscreen director, did nothing but raise an eyebrow; Moore himself stated that he thought the sketch was funny and took it in good humour. Indeed, he had always embraced the &quot;eyebrows&quot; gag wholeheartedly, and quipped that he &quot;only had three expressions as Bond: right eyebrow raised, left eyebrow raised, and eyebrows crossed when grabbed by Jaws&quot;. &quot;Spitting Image&quot; continued the joke, featuring a Bond film spoof, &quot;The Man with the Wooden Delivery&quot;, with Moore&#x27;s puppet receiving orders from Margaret Thatcher to kill Mikhail Gorbachev. Other comedy shows at that time ridiculed Moore&#x27;s acting, with Rory Bremner once claiming to have had a death threat from one of his irate fans following one such routine.

In a nod to his 1960s TV show, Moore had a vocal cameo in &quot;The Saint&quot; (1997) as a radio newsreader as Simon Templar drives away at the end of the film. In the year 2000, he played the role of a secret agent in the Christmas special &quot;Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings&quot;, shown on BBC One on Christmas Day. Filming all his scenes in the London Eye, his mission was to eliminate another agent whose file photo looks like Pierce Brosnan. In 2002 he had a small cameo role in the German police procedural series &quot;Tatort&quot; (episode 506: &quot;Schatten&quot; – &quot;Shadow&quot;, 28 July 2002) as himself signing an autograph on a Unicef card.

In the 1981 film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, Moore played Seymour Goldfarb, a parody of both himself and James Bond, driving an Aston Martin DB5.

In support of his charitable work for UNICEF, Moore lent his voice to the character of the magic snowman, Lumi Ukko, for a 1990 feature film produced by Pavlina Ltd/FIT. The film is UNICEF-endorsed and is dedicated to the &quot;world’s children&quot;. A recently published audio book entitled, &quot;The Magic Snowman and The Rusty Ice Skates&quot; features his voice. His daughter, actress Deborah Moore, narrated the book in honor of her father’s legacy and his work for UNICEF. 20 percent of the book’s proceeds are pledged to the organization.

In 2009, Moore appeared in an advertisement for the Post Office. In 2010, he provided the voice of a talking cat called Lazenby&quot; which contained several references to, and parodies of, Bond films. In 2011, he co-starred in the film &quot;A Princess for Christmas&quot; with Katie McGrath and Sam Heughan, and in 2012, he took to the stage for a series of seven &#x27;Evenings with&#x27; in UK theatres and, in November, guest-hosted &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. A slightly thinner-faced Moore contributed to a charity song in 2017. His last on-screen performance was in 2017, a brief appearance near the end of the remake of &quot;The Saint&quot;.

In 2015, Moore was named one of &quot;GQ&quot;&#x27;s 50 best-dressed British men. In 2015, he read Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; for the children&#x27;s fairy tales app GivingTales in aid of UNICEF with other British celebrities, including Michael Caine, Ewan McGregor, Joan Collins, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, David Walliams, Charlotte Rampling, Paul McKenna, and Michael Ball.

==Advocacy==
===Humanitarian work===
Moore&#x27;s friend Audrey Hepburn had impressed him with her work for UNICEF, and consequently he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in August 1991. His character, Simon Templar, made a pitch for UNICEF near the end of &quot;The Revolution Racket&quot;, airing 5 November 1964. He was the voice of Father Christmas or &#x27;Santa&#x27; in the 2004 UNICEF cartoon &quot;The Fly Who Loved Me&quot;.

===Animal welfare===
Moore was an active proponent of animal welfare causes, particularly in his later life. He worked prolifically alongside PETA in campaigning against foie gras, narrating short exposés in 2006 and 2012, as well as appearing in ad campaigns, some of which he personally funded. He also wrote columns in various publications, and directly to politicians and businesses, regarding the issue. For his efforts, he was named PETA UK Person of the Year in 2009. The campaign against Selfridges successfully prompted them to discontinue sales in 2009, while another British company (Creek Projects Investments Ltd) shuttered plans to build a large foie gras facility in China in 2012, in response to Moore&#x27;s advocacy.

Moore also voiced concern for issues of wild animal welfare. He publicly raised awareness regarding the living conditions of Morgan, a wild-caught killer whale who had been taken into captivity, as well as successfully leading the campaign to ban the use of wild animals in UK circuses. He was an outspoken critic of sport hunting; in response to the killing of Cecil the lion, an incident which sparked global outrage, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; published an opinion piece by Moore:
==Personal life==
===Doorn Van Steyn===
In 1946, aged 18, Moore married a fellow RADA student, the actress and ice skater Doorn Van Steyn (born Lucy Woodard), who was six years his senior; Moore and Van Steyn lived in Streatham with her family, but tension over money matters and her lack of confidence in his acting ability took their toll on the relationship, during which he allegedly suffered domestic abuse.

===Dorothy Squires===
In 1952, Moore met the Welsh singer Dorothy Squires, who was 12 years his senior, and Van Steyn and Moore divorced the following year. Squires and Moore were married in New York. They lived in Bexley, Kent, after their wedding.

They moved to the United States in 1954 to develop their careers, but tension developed in their marriage due to their age difference and Moore&#x27;s infatuation with starlet Dorothy Provine, and they moved back to the United Kingdom in 1961, where they resided in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham. Squires suffered a series of miscarriages during their marriage, and Moore later said the outcome of their marriage might have been different if they had been able to have children.

During their tempestuous relationship Squires smashed a guitar over his head, and after learning of his affair with the Italian actress Luisa Mattioli, who became Moore&#x27;s third wife, Moore said, &quot;She threw a brick through my window. She reached through the glass and grabbed my shirt and she cut her arms doing it...The police came and they said, &#x27;Madam, you&#x27;re bleeding&#x27; and she said, &#x27;It&#x27;s my heart that&#x27;s bleeding&#x27;.&quot; Squires intercepted letters from Mattioli to Moore and planned to include them in her autobiography, but the couple won injunctions against the publication in 1977, which led Squires to unsuccessfully sue them for loss of earnings. The numerous legal cases launched by Squires led her to be declared a vexatious litigant in 1987. Moore paid Squires&#x27;s hospital bills after her cancer treatment in 1996; she died in 1998.

===Luisa Mattioli===

In 1961, while filming &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot; in Italy, Moore left Squires for the Italian actress Luisa Mattioli. Squires refused to accept their separation, and sued Moore for loss of conjugal rights, but Moore refused the court&#x27;s order to return to Squires in 28 days. Squires also smashed windows at a house in France where Moore and Mattioli were living, and unsuccessfully sued actor Kenneth More for libel, as Kenneth More had introduced Moore and Mattioli at a charity event as &quot;Mr Roger Moore and his wife&quot;. Moore and Mattioli lived together until 1969, when Squires finally granted him a divorce, after they had been separated for seven years. At Moore&#x27;s and Mattioli&#x27;s marriage in April 1969 at the Caxton Hall in Westminster, London, a crowd of 600 people was outside, with women screaming his name.

Moore had three children with Mattioli: actress-daughter Deborah (b. 27 October 1963) and two sons, Geoffrey (b. 28 July 1966) and Christian (b. 23 August 1973). Geoffrey is also an actor, and appeared alongside his father in the films &quot;Sherlock Holmes in New York&quot; (1976) and &quot;Fire, Ice and Dynamite&quot; (1990). In later life, he co-founded Hush Restaurant in Mayfair, London, with Jamie Barber, and would release a single in 2023 under the name Jaffa Moore called &quot;You and I&quot; which featured vocals from the late Glee actor Naya Rivera and included host of stars in the music video miming along to the song. Geoffrey and his wife Loulou have two daughters. Moore&#x27;s younger son, Christian, is a film producer and has four children: a daughter from his first marriage to Heidi Moore, and two sons and a daughter from his second marriage to Lara Sidawi.

===Kristina &quot;Kiki&quot; Tholstrup===
Moore and Mattioli separated in 1993 after Moore developed feelings for a Swedish-born Danish socialite, Kristina &quot;Kiki&quot; Tholstrup. Moore later described his prostate cancer diagnosis in 1993 as &quot;life-changing&quot;, which led him to reassess his life and marriage. Mattioli and Tholstrup had long been friends, but Mattioli was scathing of her in the book she subsequently wrote about her relationship with Moore, &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, describing how she felt betrayed by Tholstrup and discarded by Moore.

Moore remained silent on his divorce from Mattioli, later saying that he did not wish to hurt his children by &quot;engaging in a war of words&quot;. Moore&#x27;s children refused to speak to him for a period after the divorce, but they were later reconciled with their father. Mattioli refused to grant Moore a divorce until 2000, when a £10 million settlement was agreed. Moore subsequently married Tholstrup in 2002. Moore said that he loved Tholstrup as she was &quot;organised&quot;, &quot;serene&quot;, &quot;loving&quot;, and &quot;calm&quot;, saying, &quot;I have a difficult life. I rely on Kristina totally. When we are travelling for my job, she is the one who packs. Kristina takes care of all that&quot;. Moore also said that his marriage to Tholstrup was &quot;a tranquil relationship, there are no arguments&quot;. Tholstrup had two children, Hans-Christian Knudsen Jr. and Christina Knudsen, from a previous marriage; Christina described her stepfather as a positive influence, saying, &quot;I was in difficult relationships but that all changed&quot; when her mother met Moore. Christina Knudsen died from cancer on 25 July 2016, at the age of 47; Moore wrote, &quot;We are heartbroken&quot; and &quot;We were all with her, surrounding her with love, at the end&quot;.

==Political views==

On politics, Moore stated he was a conservative and thought that conservatism is the way to run a country. He was described as a &quot;lifelong&quot; supporter of the Conservative Party and endorsed the party during the 2001 UK general election. However, Moore also expressed a reluctance to be seen as an overtly political figure and felt his work with UNICEF meant that he could not involve himself directly in politics.

In 2011, Moore expressed his support to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron regarding his policy on the European Union, stating: &quot;I think he&#x27;s doing absolutely wonderfully well, despite the opposition from many members of his own party. Traitors, I call them. I mean any hardliner within the Conservative Party who speaks out against their leader. You should support your leader.&quot;

Moore also expressed support for Britain keeping the pound sterling as its national currency and was glad the British government had not joined the single EU currency, stating: &quot;I would have been very upset if we&#x27;d had to take the Queen off our currency. They&#x27;d probably have to take her off the stamps and everything. I am British and I&#x27;m fiercely independent. And I think we should be independent, as Sean Connery is about Scotland.&quot;

In 2015, Moore criticised what he regarded as excessive political correctness within the film industry and felt that rewriting James Bond&#x27;s sexuality, gender or ethnicity would be a mistake, arguing &quot;it is not about being homophobic or, for that matter, racist – it is simply about being true to the character.&quot; Despite his conservative politics, Moore retained membership of the entertainment and media trade union BECTU (now part of Prospect) until his death, having joined as an apprentice animation technician before his acting career took off. At his death, he was the union&#x27;s longest-tenured member. In 2007, Moore also voiced his support to workers from the Cadbury chocolate factory at Keynsham who were protesting against the plant&#x27;s closure.

==Tax exile==
Moore became a tax exile from the United Kingdom in 1978, originally to Switzerland, and divided his year between his four homes: an apartment in Monte Carlo, a holiday house in the coastal Tuscan town of Castiglione della Pescaia, a chalet in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, and a home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France. Moore became a resident of Monaco, having been appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of Monaco by Prince Albert II for his efforts in internationally promoting and publicising the principality. Moore was scathing of the Russian population in Monaco, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;re overstuffed with Russians. All the restaurant menus are in Russian now.&quot;

Moore was vocal in his defence of his tax exile status, saying that in the 1970s, with taxes levied on top earners under the Labour government of James Callaghan, he had been urged by his &quot;accountants, agents, and lawyers&quot; to move abroad because, &quot;At that point we were taxed up to 98% on unearned income, so you would never be able to save enough to ensure that you had any sort of livelihood if you didn&#x27;t work.&quot; Moore said in 2011 that his decision to live abroad was &quot;not about tax. That&#x27;s a serious part of it. I come back to England often enough not to miss it, to see the changes, to find some of the changes good...I paid my taxes at the time that I was earning a decent income, so I&#x27;ve paid my due&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Moore had a series of diseases during his childhood, including chickenpox, measles, mumps, double pneumonia and jaundice, and had his appendix, tonsils, and adenoids removed.

Moore was a long-term sufferer of kidney stones and as a result was briefly hospitalised during the making of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; in 1973 and again whilst filming the 1979 film &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

In 1993, Moore was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent successful treatment for the disease.

In 2003, Moore collapsed on stage while appearing on Broadway, and was fitted with a pacemaker to treat a potentially deadly slow heartbeat. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2013. Some years before his final cancer illness, a tumour spot was found in his liver. Then, in 2017, during the period that he was treated for cancer, he fell, badly injuring his collarbone.
Moore died in the presence of his family at his home in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on 23 May 2017, from cancers of the lung and liver. Former 007 actors Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig paid tribute to Moore. He was buried in Monaco Cemetery.

==Royal circles==
Moore had friendships with some of Denmark&#x27;s royal family; Prince Joachim and his then-wife Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, invited Moore and his wife Kiki to attend the christening of their youngest son, Prince Felix. In 2004 he attended the Wedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson. On 24 May 2008, Moore and his wife attended the wedding of Prince Joachim to his French fiancée Marie Cavallier.

Moore also had a long-standing friendship with Princess Lilian of Sweden, whom he first met on a visit to Stockholm for UNICEF. Moore&#x27;s wife Kristina, who was born in Sweden, was already a friend of Princess Lilian&#x27;s through mutual friends. In his autobiography, Moore recalled meeting the princess for tea and dinners whenever his wife and he visited Stockholm. He spoke of his recollections at the princess&#x27;s memorial service at St Peter and St Sigfrid&#x27;s Church in Stockholm, on 8 September 2013.

On 1 and 2 July 2011, Moore and his wife attended the wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco and Charlene Wittstock.

==Awards and legacy==

Moore was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 New Year Honours and was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours for charitable services, especially UNICEF and latterly Kiwanis International, which had dominated his public life for more than a decade. On being knighted, Moore said that the citation &quot;meant far more to me than if I had got it for acting... I was proud because I received it on behalf of UNICEF as a whole and for all it has achieved over the years&quot;.

On 11 October 2007, three days before he turned 80, Moore was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work on television and in film. Attending the ceremony were family, friends, and Richard Kiel, with whom he had acted in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;. Moore&#x27;s star was the 2,350th star installed, and is appropriately located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard.

On 28 October 2008, the French government appointed Moore a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. On 21 November 2012, Moore was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Hertfordshire for his outstanding contributions to the UK film and television industry for over 50 years, in particular film and television productions in Hertfordshire.

After his death, the Roger Moore Stage was opened at Pinewood Studios at a ceremony held in October 2017 to celebrate his life and work. His wife and family were in attendance along with Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and guests at the event included Joan Collins, Michael Caine, Stephen Fry, Tim Rice and Stefanie Powers.

In the 2018 film &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot;, Moore was portrayed by actor Mark Umbers.

==In popular culture==
Roger Moore is contentiously credited with inspiring the Walls Magnum ice cream. In the 1960s, he reportedly said that his one wish would be for a choc ice on a stick. Walls created this product and sent one to Moore. They later launched the Magnum in 1989, which is now the world&#x27;s top-selling ice cream brand.

==Publications==
Moore&#x27;s book about the filming of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, based on his diaries, titled &quot;Roger Moore as James Bond: Roger Moore&#x27;s Own Account of Filming Live and Let Die&quot;, was published in London in 1973, by Pan Books. The book includes an acknowledgment to Sean Connery, with whom Moore was friends for many years: &quot;I would also like to thank Sean Connery – &quot;with&quot; whom it would not have been possible.&quot;

Moore&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Word is My Bond&quot; () was published by Collins in the US, in November 2008 and by Michael O&#x27;Mara Books Ltd in the UK, on 2 October 2008 ().

On 16 October 2012, &quot;Bond on Bond&quot; was published to tie in with the 50th anniversary of the James Bond films. The book, with many pictures, is based on Moore&#x27;s own memories, thoughts, and anecdotes about all things 007, with some of the profits of the book going to UNICEF.

<text>Dugald Stewart (; 22 November 175311 June 1828) was a Scottish philosopher and mathematician. Today regarded as one of the most important figures of the later Scottish Enlightenment, he was renowned as a populariser of the work of Francis Hutcheson and of Adam Smith. Trained in mathematics, medicine and philosophy, his lectures at the University of Edinburgh were widely disseminated by his many influential students. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In most contemporary documents he is referred to as Prof Dougal Stewart.

==Early life==
He was the son of Matthew Stewart (1715–1785), professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (1747–1772), and was born in his father&#x27;s quarters at Old College. His mother was Marjory Stewart, his father&#x27;s cousin.

He was educated at the High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied mathematics and moral philosophy under Adam Ferguson. In 1771, in the hope of gaining a Snell Exhibition Scholarship and proceeding to Oxford to study for the English Church, he went to the University of Glasgow to attend the classes of Thomas Reid. To Reid he later owed his theory of morality. In Glasgow, Stewart boarded in the same house as Archibald Alison, author of the &quot;Essay on Taste&quot;, and a lasting friendship sprang up between them.

After a single session in Glasgow University, at the age of nineteen, Dugald was asked by his father, whose health was beginning to fail, to give his mathematical classes in the University of Edinburgh. After three years there, in 1775, Dugald was elected joint professor of mathematics in conjunction with his father. Three years later Ferguson was appointed secretary to the commissioners sent out to the American colonies, and at his request Stewart lectured as his substitute during the session 1778–1779, delivering an original course of lectures on morals. In his early years he was influenced by Lord Monboddo, with whom he corresponded.

==Professor at Edinburgh==
In 1785 Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the chair of moral philosophy, which he filled for twenty-five years, making it a centre of intellectual and moral influence. Young men were attracted by his reputation from England, Europe and America. Greatly influenced by the Irish Presbyterian Francis Hutcheson who, in the preceding generation, had held the chair of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow, Stewart&#x27;s course on moral philosophy embraced, besides ethics proper, lectures on political philosophy or the theory of government.

William Drennan, whose father Thomas Drennan had been secretary to Hutcheson, and who 1791 moved the formation of the Society of United Irishmen in Belfast and in Dublin, was a student and friend. It is from Stewart that Drennan is said to have &quot;imbibed the classical tradition of republican theory, in its most famous English embodiment in the works of John Locke, and its contemporary reincarnation in the works of Richard Price and Joseph Priestley&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s dissident rationalism greatly influenced Maria Edgeworth and Elizabeth Hamilton. They drew extensively on his work in constructing educational programmes that rested on the assumption that women, and especially mothers, were intellectually capable of understanding the importance of the early association of ideas in the training of children&#x27;s emotions and reasoning powers.

Stewart spent the summers of 1788 and 1789 in France, where he met Suard, Degérando, and Raynal, and came to sympathise with the revolutionary movement. His political teaching, after the French Revolution, drew suspicion on him. His Edinburgh residence for several years was Whitefoord House on the Royal Mile.

From 1800 to 1801, Stewart gave lectures to undergraduate students on the subject of political economy, the first person to do so. Stewart made himself the leading disciple of Adam Smith and, after Smith&#x27;s death became his first biographer. In 1793 Stewart had read his &quot;Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith&quot; to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

In 1797 he appears as &quot;Dougald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy&quot; living at Lothian House (aka Lothian Hutt) near the bottom of the Canongate. Lothian Hutt was built in 1750 by William, Marquess of Lothian, who appears to have been a friend od Stewart. Stewart was still staying here in 1813.

==Family==
In 1783 Stewart married Helen Bannatyne (a distant cousin), who died in 1787, leaving him an only son, Matthew Stewart FRSE (1784-1851). In 1790 he married Helen D&#x27;Arcy Cranstoun, sister of George Cranstoun. His second wife was well-born and accomplished, and he was in the habit of submitting to her criticism whatever he wrote. They had a son and a daughter. The son&#x27;s death in 1809 brought about his retirement from the active duties of his chair.

His sister, Janet Stewart, married Rev Thomas Miller of Cumnock, and they were parents to Dr Patrick Miller FRSE (1782-1871).

==Later life==
In 1806 Stewart received in lieu of a pension the nominal office of the writership of the &quot;Edinburgh Gazette&quot;, with a salary of £300. When he ceased lecturing during the session of 1809–1810, his place was taken, at his own request, by Thomas Brown, who in 1810 was appointed conjoint professor. On the death of Brown in 1820 Stewart retired altogether from the professorship. His successor was John Wilson, known as &quot;Christopher North&quot;.

From 1809 onwards Stewart lived mainly at Kinneil House, Bo&#x27;ness, which was placed at his disposal by the Duke of Hamilton. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1791. In June 1814 Stewart was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1817.

==Freemasonry==
Like his father, Rev Dr Matthew Stewart, he was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in the Lodge of his father - Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, on 4 December 1775.

His friend and fellow Freemason, Robert Burns, made him an honorary member of Lodge St David, Tarbolton, No. 133, on 25 July 1787. This was whilst Stewart was staying at the family seat at Catrine, Ayrshire.

==Death==

In 1822 he was struck with paralysis, but recovered a fair degree of health, sufficient to enable him to resume his studies. He died in Edinburgh on 11 June 1828, where he was buried in Canongate Churchyard, close to his Edinburgh residence. He is buried in an enclosed vault in the lower section, on its west side.

==Memorials==

In 1831, and of great public note, a monument was erected by the city on Calton Hill. This is to a design by William Henry Playfair and holds a commanding position in the city skyline, forming one of the city&#x27;s iconic landmarks.

His memory is also honoured by the &quot;Dugald Stewart Building&quot; (erected 2011) for the University of Edinburgh to house its Philosophy Department, on Charles Street, off George Square.

==Works==
Stewart as a student in Glasgow wrote an essay on &quot;Dreaming&quot;. In 1792 he published the first volume of the &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind&quot;; the second volume appeared in 1814, the third not till 1827. In 1793 he printed a textbook, &quot;Outlines of Moral Philosophy&quot;, which went through many editions; and in the same year he read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh his &quot;Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith&quot;. Similar memoirs of William Robertson the historian and of Reid were afterwards read before the same body and appear in his published works.

In 1805 Stewart published pamphlets defending John Leslie against the charges of unorthodoxy made by the presbytery of Edinburgh. In 1810 appeared the &quot;Philosophical Essays&quot;, in 1814 the second volume of the &quot;Elements&quot;, in 1815 the first part and in 1821 the second part of the &quot;Dissertation&quot; written for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Supplement&quot;, entitled &quot;A General View of the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters.&quot; In 1827 he published the third volume of the &quot;Elements&quot;, and in 1828, a few weeks before his death, &quot;The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s works were edited in 11 vols. (1854–1858) by Sir William Hamilton and completed with a memoir by John Veitch.

==Influence==
Among Stewart&#x27;s pupils were Lord Palmerston, Sir Walter Scott, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Thomas Cockburn, Francis Horner, Sydney Smith, John William Ward, Lord Brougham, Dr. Thomas Brown, James Mill, Sir James Mackintosh and Sir Archibald Alison.

His reputation rested as much on his eloquence, populism, and style as on original work. He was principally responsible for making the &quot;Scottish philosophy&quot; predominant in early 19th-century Europe. In the second half of the century, Stewart&#x27;s reputation fell to that of a follower of the work of Thomas Reid.

Stewart upheld Reid&#x27;s psychological method and expounded the Scottish Common Sense Realism, which was attacked by James Mill and John Stuart Mill. Part of his originality lay in his incorporation of elements of moderate empiricism and the French ideologists Laromiguière, Cabanis and Destutt de Tracy. He opposed the argument of ontology, and Condillac&#x27;s sensationalism. Immanuel Kant, he said, he could not understand.

<text>A village green is a common open area within a village or other settlement. Historically, a village green was common grassland with a pond for watering cattle and other stock, often at the edge of a rural settlement, used for gathering cattle to bring them later on to a common land for grazing. Later, planned greens were built into the centres of villages.

The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as May Day festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings, roads and urban parks.

==History==

Most village greens in England originated in the Middle Ages. Individual greens may have been created for various reasons, including protecting livestock from wild animals or human raiders during the night, or providing a space for market trading.

In most cases where a village green is planned, it is placed in the centre of a settlement. Village greens can also be formed when a settlement expands to the edge of an existing area of common land, or when an area of waste land between two settlements becomes developed.

Some historical village greens have been lost as a result of the agricultural revolution and urban development. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States.

Some greens that used to be commons, or otherwise at the centres of villages, have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these; one example is Newington Green, with Newington Green Unitarian Church anchoring the northern end.

In mid-20th-century England, town expansion led to the formation of local conservation societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in The Kinks&#x27; album &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;. The Open Spaces Society is a present-day UK national campaigning body that continues this movement.

==Examples==
===United States===

In the United States, the most famous example of a town green is probably the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of the city centre.

The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length and can be found in Lebanon, Connecticut. This is the only village green in the United States still used for agriculture. One of the most unusual examples is the Dartmouth College Green in Hanover, New Hampshire, which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent.

An example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown Morristown, NJ. The Morristown Green dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives.

There are two places in the United States called Village Green: Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania, and Village Green, New York. Some New England towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve, refer to their town square as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of Bedford Village Historic District.

===Europe===

A notable example of a village green is that in the village of Finchingfield in Essex, England, which is said to be &quot;the most photographed village in England&quot;. The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of Car Colston in Nottinghamshire, England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha), and the village of Burton Leonard in North Yorkshire has three.

The Open Spaces Society states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering and about 220 in Wales covering about .
The northern part of the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands is also known for its village greens. Zuidlaren is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands.

The Błonia Park, originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in Kraków, Poland.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, especially in Java, a similar place is called &quot;Alun-Alun&quot;. It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture.

==Legal definitions==
===England and Wales===
Apart from the general use of the term, &quot;village green&quot; has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term &quot;town green&quot;. Town and village greens were defined in the Commons Registration Act 1965, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as land:
# which has been allotted by or under any act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality
# or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes
# or if it is land on which for not fewer than twenty years a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right.

Registered greens in England and Wales are now governed by the Commons Act 2006, but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (&quot;nec vi, nec clam, nec precario&quot;). Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (&quot;Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson&quot;) makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as criminal activity under the Inclosure Act 1857 and the Commons Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 56). This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand, two lakes and a beach.

On 11 December 2019, a Supreme Court decision put the future of some village greens at risk in England and Wales. The case involved five fields (13 hectares) in south Lancaster, the Moorside Fields, owned by Lancashire County Council. The lands had been available for public use for over 50 years. According to the Commons Act 2006, land used for informal recreation for at least 20 years can be registered as green and is then protected from development. (Granted, the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 specified that land designated for planning applications could not be registered as a village green, but that did not apply in the Moorside Fields case.)

The Moorside Fields Community Group attempted to register the lands in 2016 under the Commons Act 2006. The local authority challenged the registration, wanting to retain control of the lands for future expansion of the nearby Moorside Primary School&#x27;s playing fields. The council&#x27;s challenge failed in the High Court and then in the Court of Appeal; the registration of the land as a village green could proceed. Lancashire County Council subsequently appealed to the UK Supreme Court.

In the appeal decision, cited as &quot;R (on the application of Lancashire County Council) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Respondent)&quot; the court overturned the previous judgments. At the same time, the Supreme Court also ruled against the registration of lands in a separate case in Surrey involving the 2.9 hectare Leach Grove Wood at Leatherhead, owned by the National Health Service. After publication of the decision in the Moorside Fields case, Lancashire County Council told the news media that the court had &quot;protect[ed] this land for future generations&quot;.

In effect, the Supreme Court decision left lands owned by public authorities by their statutory powers open to development for any purpose that they deem to be appropriate. This could have far-reaching ramifications in England and Wales, according to the Open Spaces Society, a national conservation group that was founded in 1865. A representative made this comment to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;This is a deeply worrying decision as it puts at risk countless publicly owned green spaces which local people have long enjoyed, but which, unknown to them, are held for purposes which are incompatible with recreational use&quot;.

<doc id="174722" wikidata="Q1105649" url="?curid=174722" title="Code Red (computer worm)">
<text>Code Red was a computer worm observed on the Internet on July 15, 2001. It attacked computers running Microsoft&#x27;s IIS web server. It was the first large-scale, mixed-threat attack to successfully target enterprise networks.

The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh when it exploited a vulnerability discovered by Riley Hassell. They named it &quot;Code Red&quot; because they were drinking the Mountain Dew with the same flavor name at the time of discovery.

Although the worm had been released on July 13, the largest group of infected computers was seen on July 19, 2001. On that day, the number of infected hosts reached 359,000.

The worm spread worldwide, becoming particularly prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia (including China and India).

==Concept==

===Exploited vulnerability===
The worm showed a vulnerability in software distributed with IIS, described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-033 (CVE-2001-0500), for which a patch had become available a month earlier.

The worm spread itself using a common type of vulnerability known as a buffer overflow. It did this by using a long string of the repeated letter &#x27;N&#x27; to overflow a buffer, allowing the worm to execute arbitrary code and infect the machine with the worm. Kenneth D. Eichman was the first to discover how to block it, and was invited to the White House for his discovery.

===Worm payload ===
The payload of the worm included:

* Defacing the affected web site to display:

 HELLO! Welcome to http://www.worm.com ! Hacked By Chinese!

* Other activities based on the day of the month:
** Days 1-19: Trying to spread itself by looking for more IIS servers on the Internet.
** Days 20–27: Launch denial of service attacks on several fixed IP addresses. The IP address of the White House web server was among these.
** Days 28-end of month: Sleeps, no active attacks.

When scanning for vulnerable machines, the worm did not test whether the server running on a remote machine was running a vulnerable version of IIS, or even whether it was running IIS at all. Apache access logs from this time frequently had entries such as these:

The worm&#x27;s payload is the string following the last &#x27;N&#x27;. Due to a buffer overflow, a vulnerable host interpreted this string as computer instructions, propagating the worm.

==Similar worms==

On August 4, 2001, Code Red II appeared. Although it used the same injection vector, it had a completely different payload. It pseudo-randomly chose targets on the same or different subnets as the infected machines according to a fixed probability distribution, favoring targets on its own subnet more often than not. Additionally, it used the pattern of repeating &#x27;X&#x27; characters instead of &#x27;N&#x27; characters to overflow the buffer.

eEye believed that the worm originated in Makati, Philippines, the same origin as the VBS/Loveletter (aka &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot;) worm.
