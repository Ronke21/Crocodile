<text>Alternative rock (also known as alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a category of rock music that evolved from the independent music underground of the 1970s. Alternative rock acts achieved mainstream success in the 1990s with the likes of the grunge subgenre in the United States, and the Britpop and shoegaze subgenres in the United Kingdom and Ireland. During this period, many record labels were looking for &quot;alternatives&quot;, as many corporate rock, hard rock, and glam metal acts from the 1980s were beginning to grow stale throughout the music industry. The emergence of Generation X as a cultural force in the 1990s also contributed greatly to the rise of alternative music.

&quot;Alternative&quot; refers to the genre&#x27;s distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop. The term&#x27;s original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock. Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock&#x27;s distinct styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In September 1988, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced &quot;alternative&quot; into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.

Initially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as R.E.M. and Jane&#x27;s Addiction, were signed to major labels. Most alternative bands at the time, like the Smiths, one of the key British alternative rock bands during the 1980s, remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream, and many alternative bands became successful.

Emo found mainstream success in the 2000s with multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Paramore and Panic! at the Disco. Bands such as the White Stripes and the Strokes found commercial success in the early 2000s, influencing an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from garage rock, post-punk and new wave, establishing a revival of the genres.

==Origin of term==

In the past, popular music tastes were largely dictated by music executives within large entertainment corporations. Record companies signed contracts with those entertainers who were thought to become the most popular, and therefore who could generate the most sales. These bands were able to record their songs in expensive studios, and their works were then offered for sale through record store chains that were owned by the entertainment corporations, along with eventually selling the merchandise into big box retailers. Record companies worked with radio and television companies to get the most exposure for their artists. The people making the decisions were business people dealing with music as a product, and those bands who were not making the expected sales figures were then excluded from this system.

Before the term &quot;alternative rock&quot; came into common usage around 1990, the sorts of music to which it refers were known by a variety of terms. In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term &quot;Alternative Music&quot; to describe the groups he was writing about. In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled &quot;Rock and Roll Alternative&quot;. &quot;College rock&quot; was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college radio circuit and the tastes of college students. In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged as a result of the punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; magazines published charts based on small record stores called &quot;Alternative Charts&quot;. The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term &quot;indie&quot; was used literally to describe independently distributed records. By 1985, &quot;indie&quot; had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.

The use of the term &quot;alternative&quot; to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s; at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were &quot;new music&quot; and &quot;postmodern&quot;, respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to recontextualize sounds of the past. A similar term, &quot;alternative pop&quot;, emerged around 1985.

In 1987, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine categorized college rock band Camper Van Beethoven as &quot;alternative/indie&quot;, saying that their 1985 song &quot;Where the Hell Is Bill&quot; (from &quot;Telephone Free Landslide Victory&quot;) &quot;called out the alternative/independent scene and dryly tore it apart.&quot; David Lowery, then frontman of Camper Van Beethoven, later recalled: &quot;I remember first seeing that word applied to us... The nearest I could figure is that we seemed like a punk band, but we were playing pop music, so they made up this word &quot;alternative&quot; for those of us who do that.&quot; DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American FM radio of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to top 40 radio formats by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, &quot;Somehow this term &#x27;alternative&#x27; got rediscovered and heisted by college radio people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music.&quot;

At first the term referred to intentionally non-mainstream rock acts that were not influenced by &quot;heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave&quot; and &quot;high-energy dance anthems&quot;. Usage of the term would broaden to include new wave, pop, punk rock, post-punk, and occasionally &quot;college&quot;/&quot;indie&quot; rock, all found on the American &quot;commercial alternative&quot; radio stations of the time such as Los Angeles&#x27; KROQ-FM. Journalist Jim Gerr wrote that &quot;Alternative&quot; also encompassed variants such as &quot;rap, trash, metal and industrial&quot;. The bill of the first Lollapalooza, an itinerant festival in North America conceived by Jane&#x27;s Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, reunited &quot;disparate elements of the alternative rock community&quot; including Henry Rollins, Butthole Surfers, Ice-T, Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees (as second headliners) and Jane&#x27;s Addiction (as the headlining act). Covering for MTV the opening date of Lollapalooza in Phoenix in July 1991, Dave Kendall introduced the report saying the festival presented the &quot;most diverse lineups of alternative rock&quot;. That summer, Farrell had coined the term &quot;Alternative Nation&quot;.

In December 1991, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine noted: &quot;this year, for the first time, it became resoundingly clear that what has formerly been considered &quot;alternative rock&quot;—a college-centered marketing group with fairly lucrative, if limited, potential—has in fact moved into the mainstream.&quot;

In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific. In 1997, Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; defined alternative rock as &quot;hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, &#x27;70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions.&quot;

Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. &quot;Alternative&quot; can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is &quot;fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream&quot;, and the term is also used in the music industry to denote &quot;the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet.&quot; However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term &quot;alternative&quot; to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach. Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; cites the formation of the Sex Pistols as well as the release of the albums &quot;Horses&quot; by Patti Smith and &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; by Lou Reed as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock. Until the early 2000s, when indie rock became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms &quot;indie rock&quot; and &quot;alternative rock&quot; were often used interchangeably; while there are aspects which both genres have in common, &quot;indie rock&quot; was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American &quot;alternative rock&quot;.

==Characteristics==
The name &quot;alternative rock&quot; essentially serves as an umbrella term for underground music that has emerged in the wake of punk rock since the mid-1980s. Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the commercialism of mainstream culture, although this could be contested since some of the major alternative artists have eventually achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onward (especially into the 2000s, and beyond). In the 1980s, alternative bands generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth. As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although in 1989 &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that the genre is &quot;guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback.&quot; More often than in other rock styles since the mainstreaming of rock music, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism. This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.

== 1960s–1970s: Precursors ==
Precursors to alternative rock existed in the 1960s with proto-punk. The origins of alternative rock can be traced back to &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967) by the Velvet Underground, which influenced many alternative rock bands that would come after it. Eccentric and quirky figures of the 1960s, such as Syd Barrett have influence on alternative rock in general.

The Dead Kennedys formed the independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 1979, releasing influential underground music such as the 1983 self-titled EP from the Butthole Surfers. By 1984, a majority of groups that were signed to indie labels drew from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.

== 1980s: Origins ==
Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit, or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit filled with different scenes in various parts of the country. College radio formed an essential part of breaking new alternative music. In the mid-1980s, college station KCPR in San Luis Obispo, California, described in a DJ handbook the tension between popular and &quot;cutting edge&quot; songs as played on &quot;alternative radio&quot;.

Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success. On September 10, 1988, an Alternative Songs chart was created by &quot;Billboard&quot;, listing the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations in the US: the first number one was &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees. By 1989, the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and the Sugarcubes toured the US arena circuit.

Early on, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the US by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s, alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists with cult followings in the US received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.

===United States in 1980s===

Early American alternative bands such as the Dream Syndicate, the Bongos, 10,000 Maniacs, R.E.M., the Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; their debut album, &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles&#x27; Paisley Underground revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as the Velvet Underground.

American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. Minneapolis bands Hüsker Dü and the Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic. Michael Azerrad asserted that Hüsker Dü was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, &quot;Hüsker Dü played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren&#x27;t antithetical.&quot; The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as &quot;a viable commercial enterprise&quot;. By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, the Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that &quot;along with R.E.M., they were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked.&quot;

By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard) and industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston&#x27;s Pixies and Los Angeles&#x27; Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Around the same time, the grunge subgenre emerged in Seattle, Washington, initially referred to as &quot;The Seattle Sound&quot; until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s. Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that syncretized heavy metal and punk rock. Promoted largely by Seattle indie label Sub Pop, grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather. Early grunge bands Soundgarden and Mudhoney found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively.

By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings Hüsker Dü and the Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane&#x27;s Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative&#x27;s later breakthrough. Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.

In the middle of the decade, Hüsker Dü&#x27;s album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s hardcore scene what was called &quot;emocore&quot; or, later, &quot;emo&quot; emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional, very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. Rites of Spring has been described as the first &quot;emo&quot; band. Former Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye founded Dischord Records which became the center for the city&#x27;s emo scene.

=== Great Britain in 1980s ===

Gothic rock developed out of late-1970s British post-punk. With a reputation as the &quot;darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock&quot;, gothic rock uses a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct &quot;foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes&quot;, and the subgenre&#x27;s lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism. Bands of this subgenre took inspiration from two British post-punk groups, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Joy Division. Bauhaus&#x27; debut single &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock subgenre. The Cure&#x27;s &quot;oppressively dispirited&quot; albums including &quot;Pornography&quot; (1982) cemented that group&#x27;s stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.

The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was Manchester&#x27;s the Smiths. Music journalist Simon Reynolds singled out the Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as &quot;the two most important alt-rock bands of the day&quot;, commenting that they &quot;were eighties bands only in the sense of being &quot;against&quot; the eighties&quot;. The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer Morrissey&#x27;s English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist Johnny Marr&#x27;s jangly guitar-playing style. The &quot;C86&quot; cassette, a 1986 &quot;NME&quot; premium featuring Primal Scream, the Wedding Present and others, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole.

Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s sound combined the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;melancholy noise&quot; with Beach Boys pop melodies and Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; production, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with disco and dance music. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., C86 and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the formative influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members&#x27; tendency to stare at their feet and guitar effects pedals onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive created an overwhelmingly loud &quot;wash of sound&quot; that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the Madchester scene. Performing for the most part in the Haçienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.

== 1990s: Mainstream success ==

By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock&#x27;s commercial possibilities and major labels had already signed Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dinosaur Jr. In early 1991, R.E.M. went mainstream worldwide with &quot;Out of Time&quot; while becoming a blueprint for many alternative bands.

The first edition of the Lollapalooza festival became the most successful tour in North America in July and August 1991. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who attended the festival at an open-air amphitheater in Southern California, &quot;it felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all&quot;. The tour helped change the mentalities in the music industry: &quot;by that fall, radio and MTV and music had changed. I really think that if it weren&#x27;t for Perry [Farrell], if it weren&#x27;t for &quot;Lollapalooza&quot;, you and I wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation right now&quot;.

The release of Nirvana&#x27;s single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; in September 1991 &quot;marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon&quot;. Helped by constant airplay of the song&#x27;s music video on MTV, their album &quot;Nevermind&quot; was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991. Its success surprised the music industry. &quot;Nevermind&quot; not only popularized grunge, but also established &quot;the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.&quot; Michael Azerrad asserted that &quot;Nevermind&quot; symbolized &quot;a sea-change in rock music&quot; in which the hair metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant. The breakthrough success of Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s. It heralded a &quot;new openness to alternative rock&quot; among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular. In the wake of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, alternative rock &quot;found itself dragged-kicking and screaming ... into the mainstream&quot; and record companies, confused by the genre&#x27;s success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared in 1993, &quot;Alternative rock doesn&#x27;t seem so alternative anymore. Every major label has a handful of guitar-driven bands in shapeless shirts and threadbare jeans, bands with bad posture and good riffs who cultivate the oblique and the evasive, who conceal catchy tunes with noise and hide craftsmanship behind nonchalance.&quot; However, many alternative rock artists rejected success, for it conflicted with the rebellious, DIY ethic the genre had espoused before mainstream exposure and their ideas of artistic authenticity.

=== Grunge ===

Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana&#x27;s success. Pearl Jam had released its debut album &quot;Ten&quot; a month before &quot;Nevermind&quot; in 1991, but album sales only picked up a year later. By the second half of 1992 &quot;Ten&quot; became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Soundgarden&#x27;s album &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot; and Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; &quot;Core&quot; along with the &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; album collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992. The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to nickname Seattle &quot;the new Liverpool&quot;. Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success. At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented in a 1993 article, &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the &#x27;60s.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the &quot;grunging of America&quot; to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years. As a result of the genre&#x27;s popularity, a backlash against grunge developed in Seattle.

Nirvana&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;In Utero&quot; (1993) was an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a &quot;wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record.&quot; Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993 &quot;In Utero&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, &quot;Vs.&quot; (1993), which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts by selling a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release. In 1993, the Smashing Pumpkins released their major breakthrough album, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;—which debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold over 4 million copies by 1996, receiving multi-platinum certification by the RIAA. The strong influence of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio. In 1995, the band released their double album, &quot;Mellon Collie &amp; the Infinite Sadness—&quot;which went on to sell 10 million copies in the US alone, certifying it as a Diamond record.

=== Britpop ===
With the decline of the Madchester scene and the unglamorousness of shoegazing, the tide of grunge from America dominated the British alternative scene and music press in the early 1990s. As a reaction, a flurry of British bands emerged that wished to &quot;get rid of grunge&quot; and &quot;declare war on America&quot;, taking the public and native music press by storm. Dubbed &quot;Britpop&quot; by the media, and represented by Pulp, Blur, Suede, and Oasis, this movement was the British equivalent of the grunge explosion, in that the artists propelled alternative rock to the top of the charts in their home country.

Britpop bands were influenced by and displayed reverence for British guitar music of the past, particularly movements and genres such as the British Invasion, glam rock, and punk rock. In 1995, the Britpop phenomenon culminated in a rivalry between its two chief groups, Oasis and Blur, symbolized by their release of competing singles &quot;Roll With It&quot; and &quot;Country House&quot; on the same day on 14 August 1995. Blur won &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;, but they were soon eclipsed in popularity by Oasis whose second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995), went on to become the third best-selling album in the UK&#x27;s history.

=== Indie rock ===
Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the U.S., indie rock became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana. Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of alternative rock&#x27;s absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its &quot;macho&quot; aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as &quot;the general assumption is that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to make indie rock&#x27;s varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place&quot;.

Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like Pavement, Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney dominated the American indie scene for most of the 1990s. One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was lo-fi. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality cassette tapes, initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences. The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, PJ Harvey fit into this sub group.

In the mid-1990s, Sunny Day Real Estate defined the emo genre. Weezer&#x27;s album &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996) was also influential.

=== Post-rock ===

Post-rock was established by Talk Talk&#x27;s &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; and Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot; albums, both released in 1991. Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including Krautrock, progressive rock, and jazz. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music. While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994 referring to &quot;Hex&quot; by the London group Bark Psychosis, the style of the genre was solidified by the release of &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot; (1996) by the Chicago group Tortoise. Post-rock was the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure.

A related genre, math rock, peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock relies on more complex time signatures and intertwining phrases. By the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its &quot;dispassionate intellectuality&quot; and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur Rós emerged who further expanded the genre.

== 2000s: Diversification ==
In the early 21st century, many alternative rock bands that experienced mainstream success struggled following the suicide of Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain in April 1994, Pearl Jam&#x27;s failed lawsuit against concert venue promoter Ticketmaster, Soundgarden&#x27;s break-up in 1997, the Smashing Pumpkins losing its original members in 2000, L7&#x27;s hiatus in 2001, the death of Layne Staley and the subsequent disbanding of Alice in Chains in 2002, and the disbanding of both the Cranberries and Stone Temple Pilots in 2003. Britpop also began fading after Oasis&#x27; third album, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997), was met with lackluster reviews.

A signifier of alternative rock&#x27;s changes was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival&#x27;s troubles that year, &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now&quot;. Despite these changes in style however, alternative rock remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century.

=== Post-grunge ===

During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely &quot;a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock.&quot;; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, &quot;but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists.&quot; Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.

Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an &quot;authentic&quot; rock movement. Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of About.com, is &quot;suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music.&quot; Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s and 2000s as newer bands such as Foo Fighters, Matchbox Twenty, Creed and Nickelback emerged, becoming among the most popular rock bands in the United States.

===Post-Britpop===
At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), and its follow-ups &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis, Stereophonics and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.

=== Third-wave ska ===

After almost a decade in the underground, ska punk, a mixture of earlier British ska and punk acts, became popular in the United States. Rancid was the first of the &quot;third-wave ska revival&quot; acts to break. From the mid-1990s to early 2000s, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt, Sublime, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and Save Ferris charted or received radio exposure.

=== Post-punk revival and garage rock revival ===

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, and the Rapture that drew primary inspiration from post-punk and new wave, establishing the post-punk revival movement. Preceded by the success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes earlier in the decade, an influx of new alternative rock bands, including several post-punk revival artists and others such as the Killers, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s. Owing to the success of these bands, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared in 2004, &quot;After almost a decade of domination by rap-rock and nu-metal bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again.&quot; Arctic Monkeys were a prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two UK No. 1 singles and &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.

=== Emo ===
By 2000 and on into the new decade, emo was one of the most popular rock music genres. Popular acts included the sales success of &quot;Bleed American&quot; by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal among adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, the use of the term &quot;emo&quot; expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. Emo&#x27;s mainstream success continued with bands emerging in the 2000s, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and mainstream groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco.

=== Other trends ===

American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album &quot;Californication&quot; (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s. Thirty Seconds to Mars experienced a notable rise in popularity during the latter half of the 2000s.

== 2010–present: The future ==
Most references to alternative rock music in the United States in the 2010s are to the indie rock genre, a term that previously had limited usage on alternative rock channels and media. Some radio stations in the 2010s had changed formats outside of alternative rock music, but this is mostly motivated by conglomeration efforts coupled with advertisers seeking more Top 40/Top 100 stations for sales. While there have been conflicting opinions on the relevance of alternative rock to mainstream audiences beyond 2010, Dave Grohl commented on an article from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; about the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August 2013, stating that rock is dead: &quot;speak for yourself... rock seems pretty alive to me.&quot;

=== Trends of the 2010s ===

Contemporary mainstream alternative rock bands tend to fuse musical elements of hard rock, electronica, hip hop, indie, and punk while placing emphasis on keyboards and guitar. In the 2010s, British rock band Muse gained a worldwide recognition with their album &quot;The Resistance&quot; and &quot;Drones&quot; which won Grammy Awards.

American alternative duo Twenty One Pilots blurs between the lines of multiple genres including hip-hop, emo, rock, indie pop and reggae and has managed to break numerous records. They became the first alternative act to have two concurrent top five singles in the United States while their fourth studio album &quot;Blurryface&quot; (2015) was the first album in history to have every song receive at least a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Twenty One Pilots also became the first rock act to have a song reach a billion streams on Spotify. Their breakout hit single &quot;Stressed Out&quot; was the twenty-fifth song to achieve the rare feat of at least one billion plays on the streaming platform. The milestone comes at a time when music genres represented on streaming platforms like Spotify are fairly homogeneous, being dominated by genres such as hip hop, EDM, and adult contemporary-styled pop.

===Alternative pop===
Alternative pop (also known as alt-pop) is pop music with broad commercial appeal that is made by figures outside the mainstream, or which is considered more original, challenging, or eclectic than traditional pop music. &quot;The Independent&quot; described alt-pop as &quot;a home-made, personalized imitation of the mainstream that speaks far closer to actual teenage experience&quot;, and which is commonly characterized by a dark or downbeat emotional tone with lyrics about insecurity, regret, drugs, and anxiety.

According to AllMusic, the alternative scene&#x27;s &quot;left-of-center pop&quot; failed to experience mainstream success during the 1980s, although the UK alternative pop band Siouxsie and the Banshees saw success in that decade. Canadian singer Avril Lavigne&#x27;s success in the early 2000s, including her hit single &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, helped set the stage for a subsequent generation of female alt-pop singers. In the late 2000s, American singer Santigold established herself as an &quot;alternative pop hero&quot; due to her apparent artistic conviction.

In the early 2010s, American singer Lana Del Rey developed a &quot;cult-like following&quot; with her &quot;cinematic, beat-heavy alt-pop&quot;, which was characterized by an &quot;alluring sadness and melodrama&quot;. New Zealand alt-pop singer Lorde achieved global success in 2013 and 2014, topping charts and winning awards. In 2022, American singer Billie Eilish was credited with marking the &quot;ascendence&quot; of alternative pop in the mainstream with her dark, downbeat pop.

<text>Pax Britannica (Latin for , modelled after &quot;Pax Romana&quot;) refers to the relative peace between the great powers in the time period roughly bounded by the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. During this time, the British Empire became the global hegemonic power, developed additional informal empire, and adopted the role of a &quot;global policeman&quot;. 

Between 1815 and 1914, a period sometimes referred to as Britain&#x27;s &quot;imperial century&quot;, around of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire. Victory over Napoleonic France left the British without any serious international rival, other than perhaps Russia in Central Asia. When Russia tried expanding its influence in the Balkans, the British and French defeated them in the Crimean War (1853–1856), thereby protecting the weak Ottoman Empire.

Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy controlled most of the key maritime trade routes and enjoyed unchallenged sea power. Alongside the formal control exerted over its own colonies, Britain&#x27;s dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled access to many regions, such as Asia, South America, Oceania, and Africa. British merchants, shippers and bankers had such an overwhelming advantage over those of other empires that in addition to its colonies Britain developed an informal empire.

==History==

After losing the Thirteen Colonies, a significant part of British America, in the American Revolution, Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the Second British Empire (1783–1815). The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the late 18th century and new ideas emerged about free markets, such as Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776). Free trade became a central principle that Britain practiced by the 1840s. It played a key role in Britain&#x27;s economic growth and financial dominance.

From the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until World War I in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of global hegemon (most powerful actor). Imposition of a &quot;British Peace&quot; on key maritime trade routes began in 1815 with the annexation of British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Under the British Residency of the Persian Gulf, local Arab rulers agreed to a number of treaties that formalised Britain&#x27;s protection of the region. Britain imposed an anti-piracy treaty, known as the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, on all Arab rulers in the region. By signing the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, Arab rulers gave up their right to wage war at sea in return for British protection against external threats. The global superiority of British military and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental Europe, and the presence of the Royal Navy on all of the world&#x27;s oceans and seas. Even outside its formal empire, Britain controlled trade with many countries such as China, Siam, and Argentina. Following the Congress of Vienna, the British Empire&#x27;s economic strength continued to develop through naval dominance and diplomatic efforts to maintain a balance of power in continental Europe.

In this era, the Royal Navy provided services around the world that benefited other nations, such as suppressing piracy and blocking the slave trade. The Slave Trade Act 1807 had banned the trade across the British Empire, after which the Royal Navy established the West Africa Squadron and the government negotiated international treaties under which they could enforce the ban. Sea power, however, did not project on land. Land wars fought between the major powers include the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860) against Imperial China. The Royal Navy was superior to any other two navies in the world, combined. Between 1815 and the passage of the German naval laws of 1890 and 1898, only France was a potential naval threat. Apart from the Crimean War, it did not engage in any major warfare from 1815 to 1914.

The most decisive event emerged from the Anglo-Egyptian War, which resulted in the British occupation of Egypt for seven decades, even though the Ottoman Empire retained nominal ownership until 1914. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says that this &quot;was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war&quot;. Taylor emphasizes the long-term impact:

The &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; was weakened by the breakdown of the continental order which had been established by the Congress of Vienna. Relations between the Great Powers of Europe were strained to breaking point by issues such as the decline of the Ottoman Empire, which led to the Crimean War, and later the emergence of new nation states in the form of Italy and Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. Both of these wars involved Europe&#x27;s largest states and armies. The industrialisation of Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the United States contributed to the relative decline of British industrial supremacy in the late 19th century.

The start of World War I in 1914 marked the end of the &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;. However, the British Empire remained the biggest colonial empire until the start of decolonization after World War II ended in 1945, and Britain remained one of the leading powers until the Suez Crisis in 1956, during which British and French troops were forced to withdraw from Egypt under pressure from the United States and (to a lesser extent) the Soviet Union.

<text>Robert Moses &quot;Lefty&quot; Grove (March 6, 1900 – May 22, 1975) was an American professional baseball pitcher. After having success in the minor leagues during the early 1920s, Grove became a star in Major League Baseball with the American League&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox. One of the greatest pitchers in history, Grove led the American League in wins in four separate seasons, in strikeouts seven consecutive seasons, and had the league&#x27;s lowest earned run average a record nine times. Over the course of the three years from 1929 to 1931, he twice won the pitcher&#x27;s Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, while amassing a 79–15 record and leading the Athletics to three straight AL championships. Overall, Grove won 300 games in his 17-year MLB career. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947.

==Early life==
Grove was born in Lonaconing, Maryland, one of eight children of John Robert Grove (1865–1957) and Emma Catherine Beeman (1872–1959). His father and brothers mined coal.

Grove was a sandlot star in the Baltimore area during the 1910s. He did not play organized baseball until he was 19 years old. Grove purportedly gained the ability to throw hard by hurling rocks. In 1920, he made his professional debut with the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the class-D Blue Ridge League, where he appeared in six games. In 59 innings pitched, Grove gave up just 30 hits, and he had an earned run average (ERA) of 1.68. His performance attracted the attention of Jack Dunn, Sr. (1872–1928), the manager/owner of the minor league Baltimore Orioles, who also discovered Babe Ruth. Dunn acquired Grove&#x27;s services by giving Martinsburg enough cash to replace their center field wall.

==Baltimore Orioles (minor league)==
Grove joined the Baltimore Orioles in 1920, while they were playing a half-century in the minor leagues of first the old Eastern League (1903–1914) and then after 1916, in the reorganized International League of AAA ball. Grove broke into the team&#x27;s pitching rotation at midseason and had a 12–2 record the rest of the way. The Orioles were in the middle of winning six straight IL titles from 1919 to 1925. Over the next four seasons, Grove posted marks of 25–10, 18–8, 27–10 and 26–6, leading the International League in strikeouts each season.

Grove remained in the minor leagues through 1924, as owner Jack Dunn refused several offers from the majors to acquire him. At the time, the Orioles were an independent operation with no major league affiliation and the International League had declared its players not subject to a major league draft. Since the reserve clause in all contracts was honored throughout organized baseball, this meant that Grove had no way to reach the majors until the Orioles became willing to trade or sell his contract. Knowing he had such a talented pitcher in Grove, Dunn kept his contract until 1925, when he finally agreed to sell Grove&#x27;s rights to Connie Mack (1862–1956) and his Philadelphia Athletics in the American League for $100,600 (equivalent to $ million in ), the highest amount ever paid for a player at the time.

==Philadelphia Athletics==
Grove battled injuries as a major league rookie and posted a 10–12 mark (which would prove his only losing record in 17 major league seasons). He led the league in strikeouts but posted a high 4.75 ERA. Grove then settled down in 1926 and won the first of a record nine earned run average (ERA) titles with a mark of 2.51. In 1927, Grove won 20 games for the first time, and a year later he tied George Pipgras for the AL lead in wins with 24.

The Athletics won the AL pennant in three consecutive seasons (1929 to 1931), as well as consecutive World Series championships in 1929 and 1930. During the Athletics&#x27; championship run, Grove led the way as the league&#x27;s top pitcher, posting records of 20–6, 28–5 and 31–4. In 1931, Grove led the league in wins, ERA (2.06), strikeouts (175), winning percentage, complete games, and shutouts. His 2.06 ERA was 2.32 runs below the league average. He was also chosen as league MVP in 1931, making him one of only a handful of pitchers to achieve this honor. His MVP award is the only one not enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, instead being housed at the George&#x27;s Creek Library in Lonaconing, Maryland.

During the 1931 season, Grove tied Smokey Joe Wood&#x27;s and Walter Johnson&#x27;s AL record with 16 straight wins. He was attempting to win his 17th straight decision when a rookie outfielder filling in for Al Simmons, who had the day off, committed an error that led to the only run of the game. Grove stated, &quot;After that game I went in and tore the clubhouse up. Wrecked the place. Tore those stall lockers off the wall, giving Al Simmons hell all the while.&quot; He followed the loss with eight straight wins. He led the league in strikeouts for a record seven straight years to start his major league career.

The Athletics contended for the next two seasons, but finished second to the New York Yankees in 1932 and third behind the Washington Senators and Yankees in 1933. In 1933, Grove became the first player in Major League Baseball history to strike out five times in a nine-inning game. On December 12, 1933, team owner Connie Mack traded Grove, along with Max Bishop and Rube Walberg, to the Boston Red Sox for Bob Kline, Rabbit Warstler and $125,000.

==Boston Red Sox==

Grove was unable to contribute substantially during his first year in Boston, an arm injury holding him to an 8–8 record. In 1935, however, Grove returned to form with a 20–12 record and a league-leading 2.70 ERA. In the 1936 season, he had a 2.81 ERA (winning his seventh ERA title) while recording a 17–12 record and 130 strikeouts. Grove won his eighth ERA title a year later, while having a 17–9 record along with 153 strikeouts. He pitched 262 innings for the season; this was his 11th and final season where he pitched over 200 innings. Grove continued to post outstanding records, including 14–4 in 1938 and 15–4 in 1939, as well as leading the AL in ERA four times between 1935 and 1939. He had a 7–6 record in 1940 while recording a 3.99 ERA with 62 strikeouts in 153.1 innings. In Grove&#x27;s last season, he won and lost seven games, winning his 300th game on July 25 (giving up six runs on 12 hits, but winning 10–6), before losing his last three major league games, ending his career on September 28, pitching just one inning in the second game of a doubleheader.

==Personal life==
Grove married his childhood sweetheart, Ethel Gardner, in 1921. They had two children, Robert and Doris. The couple would later divorce after Grove had an affair with another woman.

Grove was elected to the town council in his native Lonaconing in the 1950s and also served as the town&#x27;s police chief. During offseasons and after retiring, Grove operated a bowling alley in Lonaconing. Grove befriended a sandlot baseball team whose games he passed on the way home from MLB games, purchasing new jerseys and equipment for the team. He often donated equipment to local youth baseball players in his retirement.

==Legacy==
Grove retired in 1941 with a career record of 300–141. His .680 lifetime winning percentage is eighth all-time; however, none of the seven men ahead of him won more than 236 games. His lifetime ERA of 3.06, when normalized to overall league ERA and adjusted for the parks in which Grove played during his career, is fifth all-time among pitchers with at least 1,000 innings pitched (behind Mariano Rivera, Clayton Kershaw, Jim Devlin, and Pedro Martínez) at 48 percent better than average.

As a hitter, Grove posted a .148 batting average (202-for-1,369) with 119 runs, 15 home runs, 121 RBI and 105 bases on balls. From 1929 through 1932, Grove had 56 RBI. Defensively, he recorded a .954 fielding percentage.

Grove was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. He died in Norwalk, Ohio, of a heart attack while watching a televised baseball game at his daughter-in-law&#x27;s home on May 22, 1975. Grove was interred in Section 9, Lot 94, of the Frostburg Memorial Park Cemetery in Frostburg, Maryland.

In 1969, Grove was voted the left-handed starting pitcher for Major League Baseball&#x27;s 100th anniversary team. In 1999, Grove was ranked number 23 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players. He ranked second, behind only Warren Spahn, among left-handed pitchers. That year, he was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James ranked Grove as the 19th best baseball player of all time and the second-best MLB pitcher of all time. According to baseball historian Frank Russo, Grove is usually thought to be the best left-handed pitcher in the history of the American League. Russo also writes, &quot;Normalized for league average and adjusted for home park, his 3.06 ERA is quite simply the best in baseball history.&quot;

At Game #4 of the 1972 World Series in Oakland, Grove threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

=== Memorial Park ===
The objective of the Lefty Grove Memorial Committee is to preserve the memory of Grove. The Lefty Grove Memorial committee is based in Grove&#x27;s hometown of Lonaconing, Maryland. The memorial was completed and opened to the public on June 22, 2019.

<doc id="167417" wikidata="Q1770470" url="?curid=167417" title="Archimedes Palimpsest">
<text>The Archimedes Palimpsest is a parchment codex palimpsest, originally a Byzantine Greek copy of a compilation of Archimedes and other authors. It contains two works of Archimedes that were thought to have been lost (the &quot;Ostomachion&quot; and the &quot;Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;) and the only surviving original Greek edition of his work &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;. The first version of the compilation is believed to have been produced by Isidore of Miletus, the architect of the geometrically complex Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople, sometime around AD 530. The copy found in the palimpsest was created from this original, also in Constantinople, during the Macedonian Renaissance (c. AD 950), a time when mathematics in the capital was being revived by the former Greek Orthodox bishop of Thessaloniki Leo the Geometer, a cousin of the Patriarch.

Following the sack of Constantinople by Western crusaders in 1204, the manuscript was taken to an isolated Greek monastery in Palestine, possibly to protect it from occupying crusaders, who often equated Greek script with heresy against their Latin church and either burned or looted many such texts (including two additional copies of Archimedes writing, at least). The complex manuscript was not appreciated at this remote monastery and was soon overwritten (1229) with a religious text. In 1899, nine hundred years after it was written, the manuscript was still in the possession of the Greek church, and back in Istanbul, where it was catalogued by the Greek scholar Papadopoulos-Kerameus, attracting the attention of Johan Heiberg. Heiberg visited the church library and was allowed to make detailed photographs in 1906. Most of the original text was still visible, and Heiberg published it in 1915. In 1922, the manuscript went missing in the midst of the evacuation of the Greek Orthodox library in Istanbul, during a tumultuous period following World War I. A Western businessman concealed the book for over 70 years, and at some point forged pictures were painted on top of some of the text to increase resale value. Unable to sell the book privately, in 1998, the businessman&#x27;s daughter risked a public auction in New York contested by the Greek church; the U.S. court ruled for the auction, and the manuscript was purchased by an anonymous buyer (rumored to be Jeff Bezos). The texts under the forged pictures, as well as previously unreadable texts, were revealed by analyzing images produced by ultraviolet, infrared, visible and raking light, and X-ray.

==History==
===Early===
Archimedes lived in the 3rd century BC and wrote his proofs as letters in Doric Greek addressed to contemporaries, including scholars at the Great Library of Alexandria. These letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by Isidorus of Miletus, the architect of the Hagia Sophia patriarchal church, sometime around AD 530 in the then Byzantine Greek capital city of Constantinople.

A copy of Isidorus&#x27; edition of Archimedes was made around AD 950 by an anonymous scribe, again in the Byzantine Empire, in a period during which the study of Archimedes flourished in Constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician, engineer, and former Greek Orthodox archbishop of Thessaloniki, Leo the Geometer, a cousin to the patriarch.

This medieval Byzantine manuscript then traveled from Constantinople to Jerusalem, likely sometime after the Crusader sack of Byzantine Constantinople in 1204. There, in 1229, the Archimedes codex was unbound, scraped and washed, along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts, including one with works of Hypereides. Their leaves were folded in half, rebound and reused for a Christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves, of which 174 are extant (each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book). The palimpsest remained near Jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba. At some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem to its library (the Metochion of the Holy Sepulcher) in Constantinople.

===Modern===
The Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf visited Constantinople in the 1840s, and, intrigued by the Greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a Greek Orthodox library, removed a leaf of it (which is now in the Cambridge University Library). In 1899, the Greek scholar Papadopoulos-Kerameus produced a catalog of the library&#x27;s manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text. Upon seeing these lines Johan Heiberg, the world&#x27;s authority on Archimedes, realized that the work was by Archimedes. When Heiberg studied the palimpsest in Constantinople in 1906, he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by Archimedes thought to have been lost. Heiberg was permitted by the Greek Orthodox Church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest&#x27;s pages, and from these he produced transcriptions, published between 1910 and 1915, in a complete works of Archimedes. Shortly thereafter Archimedes&#x27; Greek text was translated into English by T. L. Heath. Before that it was not widely known among mathematicians, physicists or historians.

The manuscript was still in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem&#x27;s library (the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre) in Constantinople in 1920. Shortly thereafter, during a turbulent period for the Greek community in Turkey that saw a Turkish victory in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22) along with the Greek genocide and the forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the palimpsest disappeared from the Greek church&#x27;s library in Istanbul.

Sometime between 1923 and 1930, the palimpsest was acquired by Marie Louis Sirieix, a &quot;businessman and traveler to the Orient who lived in Paris.&quot; Though Sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk, who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it, Sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript. Stored secretly for years by Sirieix in his cellar, the palimpsest suffered damage from water and mold. In addition, after its disappearance from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate&#x27;s library, a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value, further damaging the text. These forged gold leaf portraits nearly obliterated the text underneath them, and x-ray fluorescence imaging at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center would later be required to reveal it.

Sirieix died in 1956, and, in 1970, his daughter began attempting quietly to sell the valuable manuscript. Unable to sell it privately, in 1998, she finally turned to Christie&#x27;s to sell it in a public auction, risking an ownership dispute. The ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in New York in the case of the &quot;Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem&quot; v. &quot;Christie&#x27;s, Inc&quot;. The Greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in Constantinople in the 1920s, during a period of extreme persecution. Judge Kimba Wood decided in favor of Christie&#x27;s Auction House on laches grounds, and the palimpsest was bought for $2 million by an anonymous American buyer. The lawyer who represented the anonymous buyer stated that the buyer was &quot;a private American&quot; who worked in &quot;the high-tech industry&quot;, but was not Bill Gates.

===Imaging and digitization===
At the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, the palimpsest was the subject of an extensive imaging study from 1999 to 2008, and conservation (as it had suffered considerably from mold while in Sirieix&#x27;s cellar). This was directed by Dr. Will Noel, curator of manuscripts at the Walters Art Museum, and managed by Michael B. Toth of R.B. Toth Associates, with Dr. Abigail Quandt performing the conservation of the manuscript.

The target audiences for the digitisation are Greek scholars, math historians, people building applications, libraries, archives, and scientists interested in the production of the images.

A team of imaging scientists including Dr. Roger L. Easton, Jr. from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Dr. William A. Christens-Barry from Equipoise Imaging, and Dr. Keith Knox (then with Boeing LTS, now retired from the USAF Research Laboratory) used computer processing of digital images from various spectral bands, including ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths to reveal most of the underlying text, including that of Archimedes. After imaging and digitally processing the entire palimpsest in three spectral bands prior to 2006, in 2007 they reimaged the entire palimpsest in 12 spectral bands, plus raking light: UV: 365 nanometers; Visible Light: 445, 470, 505, 530, 570, 617, and 625 nm; Infrared: 700, 735, and 870 nm; and Raking Light: 910 and 470 nm. The team digitally processed these images to reveal more of the underlying text with pseudocolor. They also digitized the original Heiberg images. Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University and Nigel Wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text, filling in gaps in Heiberg&#x27;s account with these images.

Sometime after 1938, a forger placed four Byzantine-style religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value. It appeared that these had rendered the underlying text forever illegible. However, in May 2005, highly focused X-rays produced at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, California, were used by Drs. Uwe Bergmann and Bob Morton to begin deciphering the parts of the 174-page text that had not yet been revealed. The production of X-ray fluorescence was described by Keith Hodgson, director of SSRL:Synchrotron light is created when electrons traveling near the speed of light take a curved path around a storage ring—emitting electromagnetic light in X-ray through infrared wavelengths. The resulting light beam has characteristics that make it ideal for revealing the intricate architecture and utility of many kinds of matter—in this case, the previously hidden work of one of the founding fathers of all science.

In April 2007, it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest, a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories&quot; running to some 9 000 words. Most of this text was recovered in early 2009 by applying principal component analysis to the three color bands (red, green, and blue) of fluorescent light generated by ultraviolet illumination. Dr. Will Noel said in an interview:
You start thinking striking one palimpsest is gold, and striking two is utterly astonishing. But then something even more extraordinary happened.

This referred to the previous discovery of a text by Hypereides, an Athenian politician from the fourth century BC, which has also been found within the palimpsest. It is from his speech &quot;Against Diondas&quot;, and was published in 2008 in the academic journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik&quot;, vol. 165, becoming the first new text from the palimpsest to be published in a scholarly journal.

The transcriptions of the book were digitally encoded using the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines, and metadata for the images and transcriptions included identification and cataloging information based on Dublin Core Metadata Elements. The metadata and data were managed by Doug Emery of Emery IT.

On October 29, 2008 (the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the palimpsest at auction), all data, including images and transcriptions, were hosted on the Digital Palimpsest Web Page for free use under a Creative Commons License, and processed images of the palimpsest in original page order were posted as a Google Book. In 2011, it was the subject of the Walters Art Museum exhibit &quot;Lost and Found: The Secrets of Archimedes&quot;. In 2015, in an experiment into the preservation of digital data, Swiss scientists encoded text from the Archimedes Palimpsest into DNA. Thanks to its deciphering, some mathematicians suggest it is possible that Archimedes may have invented integration.

===&quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;===

The palimpsest contains the only known copy of &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;.

In his other works, Archimedes often proves the equality of two areas or volumes with Eudoxus&#x27; method of exhaustion, an ancient Greek counterpart of the modern method of limits. Since the Greeks were aware that some numbers were irrational, their notion of a real number was a quantity Q approximated by two sequences, one providing an upper bound and the other a lower bound. If one finds two sequences U and L, and U is always bigger than Q, and L always smaller than Q, and if the two sequences eventually came closer together than any prespecified amount, then Q is found, or &quot;exhausted&quot;, by U and L.

Archimedes used exhaustion to prove his theorems. This involved approximating the figure whose area he wanted to compute into sections of known area, which provide upper and lower bounds for the area of the figure. He then proved that the two bounds become equal when the subdivision becomes arbitrarily fine. These proofs, still considered to be rigorous and correct, used geometry with rare brilliance. Later writers often criticized Archimedes for not explaining how he arrived at his results in the first place. This explanation is contained in &quot;The Method&quot;.

The method that Archimedes describes was based upon his investigations of physics, on the center of mass and the law of the lever. He compared the area or volume of a figure of which he knew the total mass and center of mass with the area or volume of another figure he did not know anything about. He viewed plane figures as made out of infinitely many lines as in the later method of indivisibles, and balanced each line, or slice, of one figure against a corresponding slice of the second figure on a lever. The essential point is that the two figures are oriented differently so that the corresponding slices are at different distances from the fulcrum, and the condition that the slices balance is not the same as the condition that the figures are equal.

Once he shows that each slice of one figure balances each slice of the other figure, he concludes that the two figures balance each other. But the center of mass of one figure is known, and the total mass can be placed at this center and it still balances. The second figure has an unknown mass, but the position of its center of mass might be restricted to lie at a certain distance from the fulcrum by a geometrical argument, by symmetry. The condition that the two figures balance now allows him to calculate the total mass of the other figure. He considered this method as a useful heuristic but always made sure to prove the results he found using exhaustion, since the method did not provide upper and lower bounds.

Using this method, Archimedes was able to solve several problems now treated by integral calculus, which was given its modern form in the seventeenth century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Among those problems were that of calculating the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines. (For explicit details, see Archimedes&#x27; use of infinitesimals.)

When rigorously proving theorems involving volume, Archimedes used a form of Cavalieri&#x27;s principle, that two volume with equal-area cross-sections are equal; the same principle forms the basis of Riemann sums. In &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;, he gives upper and lower bounds for the surface area of a sphere by cutting the sphere into sections of equal width. He then bounds the area of each section by the area of an inscribed and circumscribed cone, which he proves have a larger and smaller area correspondingly.

But there are two essential differences between Archimedes&#x27; method and 19th-century methods:
# Archimedes did not know about differentiation, so he could not calculate any integrals other than those that came from center-of-mass considerations, by symmetry. While he had a notion of linearity, to find the volume of a sphere he had to balance two figures at the same time; he never determined how to change variables or integrate by parts.
# When calculating approximating sums, he imposed the further constraint that the sums provide rigorous upper and lower bounds. This was required because the Greeks lacked algebraic methods that could establish that error terms in an approximation are small.

A problem solved exclusively in the &quot;Method&quot; is the calculation of the volume of a cylindrical wedge, a result that reappears as theorem XVII (schema XIX) of Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Stereometria&quot;.

Some pages of the &quot;Method&quot; remained unused by the author of the palimpsest and thus they are still lost. Between them, an announced result concerned the volume of the intersection of two cylinders, a figure that Apostol and Mnatsakanian have renamed &quot;n = 4 Archimedean globe&quot; (and the half of it, &quot;n&quot; = 4 Archimedean dome), whose volume relates to the &quot;n&quot;-polygonal pyramid.

===Stomachion===

In Heiberg&#x27;s time, much attention was paid to Archimedes&#x27; brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas, volumes, and centers of gravity. Less attention was given to the &quot;Ostomachion&quot;, a problem treated in the palimpsest that appears to deal with a children&#x27;s puzzle. Reviel Netz of Stanford University has argued that Archimedes discussed the &quot;number of ways&quot; to solve the puzzle, that is, to put the pieces back into their box. No pieces have been identified as such; the rules for placement, such as whether pieces are allowed to be turned over, are not known; and there is doubt about the board.

The board illustrated here, as also by Netz, is one proposed by Heinrich Suter in translating an unpointed Arabic text in which twice and equals are easily confused; Suter makes at least a typographical error at the crucial point, equating the lengths of a side and diagonal, in which case the board cannot be a rectangle. But, as the diagonals of a square intersect at right angles, the presence of right triangles makes the first proposition of Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Ostomachion&quot; immediate. Rather, the first proposition sets up a board consisting of two squares side by side (as in Tangram). A reconciliation of the Suter board with this Codex board was published by Richard Dixon Oldham, FRS, in &quot;Nature&quot; in March, 1926, sparking an &quot;Ostomachion&quot; craze that year.

Modern combinatorics reveals that the number of ways to place the pieces of the Suter board to reform their square, allowing them to be turned over, is 17,152; the number is considerably smaller – 64 – if pieces are not allowed to be turned over. The sharpness of some angles in the Suter board makes fabrication difficult, while play could be awkward if pieces with sharp points are turned over. For the Codex board (again as with Tangram) there are three ways to pack the pieces: as two unit squares side by side; as two unit squares one on top of the other; and as a single square of side the square root of two. But the key to these packings is forming isosceles right triangles, just as Socrates gets the slave boy to consider in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot; – Socrates was arguing for knowledge by recollection, and here pattern recognition and memory seem more pertinent than a count of solutions. The Codex board can be found as an extension of Socrates&#x27; argument in a seven-by-seven-square grid, suggesting an iterative construction of the side-diameter numbers that give rational approximations to the square root of two.

The fragmentary state of the palimpsest leaves much in doubt. But it would certainly add to the mystery had Archimedes used the Suter board in preference to the Codex board. However, if Netz is right, this may have been the most sophisticated work in the field of combinatorics in Greek antiquity. Either Archimedes used the Suter board, the pieces of which were allowed to be turned over, or the statistics of the Suter board are irrelevant.

<text>The University of Ljubljana (, , ), abbreviated UL, is the oldest and largest university in Slovenia. It has approximately 38,000 enrolled students. The university has 23 faculties and three art academies with approximately 4,000 teaching and research staff, assisted by approximately 2,000 technical and administrative staff. The University of Ljubljana offers programs in the humanities, sciences, and technology, as well as in medicine, dentistry, and veterinary science.

The university was founded in the centre of Ljubljana, where the central university building and the majority of its faculties are located. Since then, newer buildings have been constructed in the suburbs of the city.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Although certain academies (notably of philosophy and theology) were established as Jesuit higher education in what is now Slovenia as early as the seventeenth century, the first university was founded in 1810 under the &quot;Écoles centrales&quot; of the French imperial administration of the Illyrian provinces. The chancellor of the university in Ljubljana during the French period was Joseph Walland (a.k.a. , 1763–1834), born in Upper Carniola. That university was disbanded in 1813, when Austria regained territorial control and reestablished the Imperial Royal Lyceum of Ljubljana as a higher-education institution.

===Quest for a national university===
During the second half of the 19th century, several political claims for the establishment of a Slovene-language university in Ljubljana were made. They gained momentum in the fin de siècle era, when a considerable number of renowned Slovene academians worked throughout Central Europe, while ever more numerous Slovenian students were enrolled in foreign-language universities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, particularly in the Austrian and Czech lands. Notable examples are the Charles University in Prague and the University of Olomouc, the latter of which Slovene philosopher Franc Samuel Karpe became the chancellor of in 1781. In the 1890s, a unified board for the establishment of a Slovenian university was founded, with Ivan Hribar, Henrik Tuma, and Aleš Ušeničnik as its main leaders. In 1898, the Carniolan regional parliament established a scholarship for all students who were planning a habilitation under the condition that they would accept a post at Ljubljana University when founded. In this way, a list of suitable members of faculty started to emerge.

Nevertheless, unfavorable political circumstances prevented the establishment of the university until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the establishment of the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918, the founding of the university became possible. On November 23, 1918, the first meeting of the Founding Board of Ljubljana University was called, presided over by Mihajlo Rostohar, professor of psychology at the Charles University in Prague. Together with Danilo Majaron, Rostohar convinced the central government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade to pass a bill formally establishing the university. The bill was passed on July 2, 1919; in late August, the first professors were appointed, and on September 18, the full professors established the University Council, thus starting the normal functioning of the institution. The first lectures started on December 3 of the same year.

===First decades===

In 1919, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. The seat of the university was in the central Congress Square of Ljubljana in a building that had served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918. The building was first designed in 1902 by Jan Vladimír Hráský, and was later remodelled by a Czech architect from Vienna, Josip Hudetz.

In the mid-1920s, the university was renamed the &quot;King Alexander University in Ljubljana&quot; (&quot;Universitas Alexandrina Labacensis&quot;) and continued to grow despite financial troubles and constant pressure from Yugoslav governments’ centralist policies. In 1941, Jože Plečnik&#x27;s National and University Library was completed, as one of the major infrastructure projects of the university in the interwar period.

After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the university continued to function under the Italian and Nazi German occupation, despite numerous problems and interference in its autonomous operation. Several professors were arrested or deported to Nazi concentration camps and large numbers of students joined either the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People or the Slovenian Home Guard.

===1945 and later===
Following the end of the Second World War, the first and only foreigner elected to hold the office of chancellor was the Czech professor Alois Král, who had lectured at Faculty of Technical Sciences since 1920 and also held the position of dean thereof four times. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1945, the university was again put under political pressure: numerous professors were dismissed, some were arrested and tried, and the theological faculty was excluded from the university. Some of the most brilliant students emigrated. Nevertheless, the university maintained its educational role and regained a limited degree of autonomy from the mid-1950s onward. It suffered a serious setback in autonomy from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, when some professors were again dismissed by the authorities. In 1979 it was renamed &quot;Edvard Kardelj University in Ljubljana&quot; after the Communist leader. In 1990, with the fall of Yugoslavia, it was regiven its original name.

<text>The University of Maribor () is Slovenia&#x27;s second-largest university, established in 1975 in Maribor, Slovenia. It currently has 17 faculties.

==History==
The university&#x27;s roots reach back to 1859 when a theological seminary was established with the encouragement of Maribor bishop and patriot Anton Martin Slomšek. More faculties were established during the late 1950s and early 1960s; the faculties of economics, business, and technology in 1959, agronomy and law in 1960, and pedagogy in 1961. The university&#x27;s opening ceremony occurred on 19 September 1975. The 1970s was a decade of exponential rise in the number of higher education institutions in the former Yugoslavia when alongside Maribor universities in Osijek, Rijeka, Split, Mostar, Podgorica, Bitola, Banja Luka, Kragujevac and Tuzla all opened their doors.

Rectors of the University of Maribor were Dali Džonlagić, Alojz Križman, Ludvik Toplak, Ivan Rozman and Igor Tičar. In late 2017 and early 2018, Jan Žan Oplotnik was acting rector for almost one year. In 2018 Zdravko Kačič was elected rector.

<doc id="167427" wikidata="Q221612" url="?curid=167427" title="Groundhog">
<text>The groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as the woodchuck, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots. 
A lowland creature of North America, it is found through much of the Eastern United States, across Canada and into Alaska. 
It was given its scientific name as &quot;Mus monax&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, based on a description of the animal by George Edwards, published in 1743.

The groundhog plays an important role maintaining healthy soil in woodlands and plains; as such, the species is considered a crucial habitat engineer. The groundhog is an extremely intelligent animal, forming complex social networks and kinship with its young; it is capable of understanding social behavior, communicating threats through whistling, and working cooperatively to accomplish tasks such as burrowing.

==Etymology==
Common names for the groundhog include chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistle-pig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk, land beaver and, among French Canadians in eastern Canada, siffleux. The name &quot;thickwood badger&quot; was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger. Monax () is an Algonquian name of the woodchuck, which means &quot;digger&quot; (cf. Lenape ). Young groundhogs may be called chucklings.

The etymology of the name &quot;woodchuck&quot; is unrelated to wood or any sense of . It stems from an Algonquian (possibly Narragansett) name for the animal, &quot;wuchak&quot;. The similarity between the words has led to the popular tongue-twister:

:How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
::if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
:A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could
::if a woodchuck could chuck wood!

==Description==

The groundhog is the largest sciurid in its geographical range, excluding its presence in British Columbia where its range may be comparable to that of its somewhat larger cousin, the hoary marmot. Adults may measure from in total length, including a tail of . Weights of adult groundhogs typically fall between .

Male groundhogs are slightly larger than females on average and, like all marmots, they are considerably heavier during autumn (when engaged in autumn hyperphagia) than when they emerge from hibernation in spring. Adult males average year-around weight , with spring to fall average weights of while females average , with spring to fall averages of . Seasonal weight changes reflect circannual deposition and use of fat. Groundhogs attain progressively higher weights each year for the first two or three years, after which weight plateaus.

Groundhogs have four incisors, which grow per week. Constant usage wears them down by about that much each week. Unlike the incisors of many other rodents, the incisors of groundhogs are white to ivory-white. Groundhogs are well-adapted for digging, with powerful, short legs and broad, long claws. The groundhog&#x27;s tail is shorter than that of other Sciuridae—only about one-fourth of body length.

==Distribution and habitat==
The groundhog dwells in lowland habitats, unlike other marmots that live in rocky and mountainous areas. &quot;Marmota monax&quot; has a wide geographic range. The groundhog prefers open country and the edges of woodland, being rarely found far from a burrow entrance. It can typically be found in small woodlots, low-elevation forests, fields and pastures, and hedgerows. It constructs dens in well-drained soil, and most groundhogs have summer and winter dens. Human activity has increased food access and abundance, allowing &quot;M. monax&quot; to thrive.

==Behavior==

W.J. Schoonmaker reports that groundhogs may hide when they see, smell, or hear an observer. Marmot researcher Ken Armitage states that the social biology of the groundhog is poorly studied.
Despite their heavy-bodied appearance, groundhogs are accomplished swimmers and occasionally climb trees when escaping predators or when they want to survey their surroundings. They prefer to retreat to their burrows when threatened; if the burrow is invaded, the groundhog tenaciously defends itself with its two large incisors and front claws. Groundhogs are generally agonistic and territorial toward conspecifics and may skirmish to establish dominance.
Outside their burrow, individuals are alert when not actively feeding. It is common to see one or more nearly motionless individuals standing erect on their hind feet watching for danger. When alarmed, they use a high-pitched whistle to warn the rest of the colony, hence the name &quot;whistle-pig&quot;. Groundhogs may squeal when fighting, seriously injured, or caught by a predator. Other vocalizations include low barks and a sound produced by grinding their teeth. David P. Barash wrote that he witnessed only two occasions of upright play-fighting among woodchucks and that the upright posture of play-fighting involves sustained physical contact between individuals that may require a degree of social tolerance virtually unknown in &quot;M. monax&quot;. Alternatively, upright play-fighting may be a part of the woodchuck&#x27;s behavioral repertoire that rarely is shown because of physical spacing and/or low social tolerance.

===Diet===
Mostly herbivorous, groundhogs eat primarily wild grasses and other vegetation, including berries, bark, leaves, and agricultural crops, when available. In early spring, dandelion and coltsfoot are important groundhog food items. Some additional foods include sheep sorrel, timothy-grass, buttercup, persicaria, agrimony, red and black raspberries, mulberries, buckwheat, plantain, wild lettuce, alfalfa, and all varieties of clover. Groundhogs also occasionally eat small animals, such as grubs, grasshoppers, snails, and even bird eggs and baby birds, but are not as omnivorous as many other Sciuridae.

An adult groundhog can eat more than of vegetation daily. In early June, woodchucks&#x27; metabolism slows, and while their food intake decreases, their weight increases by as much as 100% as they produce fat deposits to sustain them during hibernation and late winter. Instead of storing food, groundhogs stuff themselves to survive the winter without eating. Thought not to drink water, groundhogs are reported to obtain needed liquids from the juices of edible plants, aided by their sprinkling with rain or dew.

===Burrows===

Groundhogs are excellent burrowers, using burrows for sleeping, rearing young, and hibernating. Groundhog burrows usually have two to five entrances, providing groundhogs their primary means of escape from predators. The volume of earth removed from groundhog burrows in one study averaged per den. The longest burrow measured in addition to two short side galleries. 

Though groundhogs are the most solitary of the marmots, several individuals may occupy the same burrow.

Burrows can pose a serious threat to agricultural and residential development by damaging farm machinery and even undermining building foundations. In a June 7, 2009, Humane Society of the United States article, &quot;How to Humanely Chuck a Woodchuck Out of Your Yard&quot; by John Griffin, director of Humane Wildlife Services, stated you would have to have a lot of woodchucks working over a lot of years to create tunnel systems that would pose any risk to a structure.

The burrow is used for safety, retreat in bad weather, hibernating, sleeping, mating, and nursery. In addition to the nest, there is an excrement chamber. The hibernation or nest chamber is lined with dead leaves and dried grasses. The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet () below ground surface. It is about wide and high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries. Excluding side galleries, Schoonmaker reports the longest was , and the average length of eleven dens was . W. H. Fisher investigated nine burrows, finding the deepest point down. The longest, including side galleries, was . Numbers of burrows per individual groundhog decrease with urbanization.

Bachman mentioned when young groundhogs are a few months old, they prepare for separation, digging a number of holes in the area of their early home. Some of these holes were only a few feet deep and never occupied, but the numerous burrows gave the impression that groundhogs live in communities.

Abandoned groundhog burrows benefit many other species by providing shelter. They are used by cottontail rabbits, raccoons, foxes, river otters, eastern chipmunks, and a wide variety of small mammals, snakes, and birds.

===Hibernation===

Groundhogs are one of the few species that enter into true hibernation, and often build a separate &quot;winter burrow&quot; for this purpose. This burrow is usually in a wooded or brushy area and is dug below the frost line and remains at a stable temperature well above freezing during the winter months. In most areas, groundhogs hibernate from October to March or April, but in more temperate areas, they may hibernate as little as three months. Groundhogs hibernate longer in northern latitudes than southern latitudes. To survive the winter, they are at their maximum weight shortly before entering hibernation. When the groundhog enters hibernation, there is a drop in body temperature to as low as , heart rate falls to 4–10 beats per minute and breathing rate falls to one breath every six minutes. During hibernation, they experience periods of torpor and arousal. Hibernating woodchucks lose as much as half their body weight by February. They emerge from hibernation with some remaining body fat to live on until the warmer spring weather produces abundant plant materials for food. Males emerge from hibernation before females. Groundhogs are mostly diurnal and are often active early in the morning or late afternoon.

===Reproduction===
Groundhogs are considered the most solitary of the marmot species. They live in aggregations, and their social organization also varies across populations. Groundhogs do not form stable, long-term pair-bonds, and during mating season male-female interactions are limited to copulation. In Ohio, adult males and females associate with each other throughout the year and often from year to year. Usually groundhogs breed in their second year, but a small proportion may breed in their first. The breeding season extends from early March to mid- or late April, after hibernation. Woodchucks are polygynous but only alpine and woodchuck marmot females have been shown to mate with multiple males. A mated pair remains in the same den throughout the 31- to 32-day gestation period. As birth of the young approaches in April or May, the male leaves the den. One litter is produced annually. Female woodchucks give birth to one to nine offspring, with most litters ranging between 3 and 5 pups. Groundhog mothers introduce their young to the wild once their fur is grown in and they can see. At this time, if at all, the father groundhog comes back to the family. By the end of August, the family breaks up; or at least, the larger number scatter, to burrow on their own.

==Health and mortality==

In the wild, groundhogs can live up to six years with two or three being the average life expectancy. In captivity, groundhogs reportedly live up to 14 years. Human development often leaves vacant space near secondary forests, which are indigenous to groundhogs, which ensures that groundhogs in well-developed areas are nearly free of predators other than humans (through various forms of pest control or vehicular incursion) or mid-to-large sized dogs.

Occasionally, woodchucks may suffer from parasitism, and a woodchuck may die from infestation or from bacteria transmitted by vectors. In areas of intensive agriculture and the dairying regions of the state of Wisconsin, particularly in southern areas, the woodchuck had been almost extirpated by 1950. Jackson (1961) suggested that exaggerated reports of damage done by the woodchuck led to excessive culling, substantially reducing its numbers in the state.

In some areas woodchucks are important game animals and are killed regularly for sport, food, or fur. In Kentucky, an estimated 267,500 &quot;M. monax&quot; were taken annually from 1964 to 1971. Woodchucks had protected status in the state of Wisconsin until 2017. Woodchuck numbers appear to have decreased in Illinois.

===Natural predators===

Wild predators of adult groundhogs in most of eastern North America include coyotes, badgers, bobcats, and foxes (largely red fox). Many of these predators are successful stealth stalkers that catch groundhogs by surprise before they can escape to their burrows; badgers likely hunt them by digging them out from their burrows. Coyotes in particular are sizable enough to overpower any groundhog with the latter being the third most significant prey species per a statewide study in Pennsylvania.

Large predators such as gray wolf and eastern cougar are likely extirpated in the east but still may hunt groundhogs on occasion in Canada. Golden eagles can also prey on adult groundhogs, but seldom occur in the same range or in the same habitats as this marmot. Likewise, great horned owls can reportedly, per Bent (1938), prey upon groundhogs but rarely do so, given the temporal differences in their behaviors.

Young groundhogs (usually those less than a couple months in age) may also be taken by the American mink, and perhaps other small mustelids, cats, timber rattlesnakes, and hawks. Red-tailed hawks can take groundhogs at least of up to the size of yearling juveniles, and northern goshawks can take them up to perhaps weak emergent-adult groundhogs in the Spring.

Beyond their large size, groundhogs have several successful anti-predator behaviors, usually retreating to the safety of their burrow which most predators will not attempt to enter, but also being ready to defend themselves with their sharp claws and large incisors. They can also scale trees to escape a threat.

==Relationship with humans==

Both their diet and their habit of burrowing make groundhogs serious nuisance animals around farms and gardens. They will eat many commonly grown vegetables. Extensive burrowing can undermine foundations.

Very often, the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals, including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. Foxes and skunks feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles, and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner. In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten.

A report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee describes the groundhog&#x27;s objectionable character:

The committee concludes that, &quot;a small bounty will prove of incalculable good; at all events, even as an experiment, it is certainly worth trying; therefore your committee would respectfully recommend that the accompanying bill be passed.&quot;

Groundhogs may be raised in captivity, but their aggressive nature can pose problems. Doug Schwartz, a zookeeper and groundhog trainer at the Staten Island Zoo, has been quoted as saying &quot;They&#x27;re known for their aggression, so you&#x27;re starting from a hard place. His natural impulse is to kill &#x27;em all and let God sort &#x27;em out. You have to work to produce the sweet and cuddly.&quot; Groundhogs cared for in wildlife rehabilitation that survive but cannot be returned to the wild may remain with their caregivers and become educational ambassadors.

In the United States and Canada, the yearly Groundhog Day celebration on February 2 has given the groundhog recognition and popularity. The most popularly known of these groundhogs are Punxsutawney Phil, Wiarton Willie, Shubenacadie Sam, Jimmy the Groundhog, Dunkirk Dave, and Staten Island Chuck kept as part of Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania; Wiarton, Ontario; Sun Prairie, Wisconsin; Dunkirk, New York; and Staten Island respectively. The 1993 comedy film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; references several events related to Groundhog Day, and portrays both Punxsutawney Phil himself, and the annual Groundhog Day ceremony. Famous Southern groundhogs include General Beauregard Lee, based at Dauset Trails Nature Center outside Atlanta, Georgia.

Groundhogs are used in medical research on hepatitis B-induced liver cancer. A percentage of the woodchuck population is infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is similar to human hepatitis B virus. Humans cannot contract hepatitis from woodchucks with WHV, but the virus and its effects on the liver make the woodchuck the best available animal for the study of viral hepatitis in humans. The only other animal model for hepatitis B virus studies is the chimpanzee, an endangered species. Woodchucks are also used in biomedical research investigating metabolic function, obesity, energy balance, the endocrine system, reproduction, neurology, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and neoplastic disease. Researching the hibernation patterns of groundhogs may lead to benefits for humans, including lowering of the heart rate in complicated surgical procedures.

Groundhog burrows have revealed at least two archaeological sites, the Ufferman Site in the U.S. state of Ohio and Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania. Archaeologists have never excavated the Ufferman Site, but the activities of local groundhogs have revealed numerous artifacts. They favor the loose soil of the esker at the site lies, and their burrow digging has brought many objects to the surface: human and animal bones, pottery, and bits of stone. Woodchuck remains were found in the Indian mounds at Aztalan, Jefferson County, Wisconsin.

Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;A Drumlin Woodchuck&quot; uses the imagery of a groundhog dug into a small ridge as a metaphor for his emotional reticence.

<text>Midway is a board wargame published by Avalon Hill in 1964 that simulates the Battle of Midway during World War II.

==Background==
Six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan looked to extend its defensive perimeter by attacking and occupying the U.S. base on Midway Atoll. To do this, the Japanese navy sent a strong fleet of four aircraft carriers, two battleships and a variety of smaller craft, hoping to lure the American fleet into a trap. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, cryptographers had broken their fleet code and knew about the attack. Both forces sent aircraft to scout for the enemy fleet&#x27;s position, but it was American airplanes that found the Japanese fleet first. In a series of devastating torpedo and dive bomb attacks, American airplanes sunk all four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser, suffering a loss of one aircraft carrier themselves. It was a pivotal battle in the Pacific war, causing losses Japan would not be able to replace, and giving momentum and confidence to the Americans.

==Description==
&quot;Midway&quot; is a board wargame for 2 players (or more than 2 players divided into teams) that simulates the battle at the individual ship and squadron level.

Initiative in the game rests on the shoulders of the Japanese player, who must successfully invade the island of Midway with the heavy cruiser &quot;Atago&quot; within the time frame of the game. The American player seeks to prevent the Japanese player from successfully invading Midway. Both players also score points toward victory by sinking their opponent&#x27;s ships.

===Components===
The game box includes:
* 22&quot; x 34&quot; mounted battle map
* 22&quot; x 34&quot; mounted search map and divider screen, set up so that neither player can see their opponent&#x27;s side.
* 120 counters representing individual ships and squadrons of planes. Each ship has two counters, a -inch counter to fit the squares of the search board and a larger one for the rectangular grid of the battle board. The -inch airplane counters represent three types of aircraft: dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters.
* 24-page rulebook
* pad of hit record sheets

===Gameplay===
The game starts at 0500 on June 4, 1942, and ends at 1700 on June 6, after 34 turns. Each turn represents 2 hours of game time.
The two boards used are the search board and the battle board. The bulk of the game takes place on the search board with battles being resolved on the battle board. The search board consists of two identical boards separated by a divider allowing the players to see their own fleet&#x27;s location and movements, while the opponent&#x27;s operations remain hidden. The search board is divided into large square areas which are each further divided into nine smaller square zones. The battle board consists of long rectangular spaces to fit the large ship counters provided for the battle phases of the game.

The game has two distinct segments, Search and Battle.

====Search====
In the search segment, players send out search planes (these are abstract planes and not represented by any counters) to search areas of the sea for the enemy fleet. If the areas searched contain enemy ships, the ships&#x27; owner must inform his opponent of the exact zone within the area and types of ships found there.

After the search has been conducted, players can now send out combat squadrons to attack enemy ships. For each zone in which ships and enemy planes are present, a battle is conducted on the battle board.

After all battles are resolved, the squadrons return to their carriers to undergo a turn of refitting.

====Battle====
When planes locate and attack an enemy fleet, the air-sea battle is resolved on the battle board. The owner of the ships first places his ships on the battle board as desired within rule-driven requirements for spacing between ships. The attacker then places his planes around the ships to indicate which squadrons are attacking which ships. Dive bombers must be placed on top of the ship being attacked, and torpedo bombers must be placed in the space either to port or starboard of the ship being attacked.

The defender then indicates which ships will direct their fire against which squadrons(known as &quot;screening&quot;). Each ship may screen against any squadron within a two space range and is not limited to screening against squadrons attacking itself. Then through comparison of various factors printed on the counters, and the roll of the die, hits are recorded, and losses are taken against the ships and attacking squadrons.

After one round of battle the ships and planes are removed from the board, and additional battles in other zones are resolved as required.

===Victory conditions===
*The American player receives a varying number of victory points for sinking each Japanese ship, and 1 victory point for every turn after 0500 June 5 that the Japanese player does not occupy Midway Island.
*The Japanese player receives a varying number of victory points for sinking each American ship, and 15 points for occupying Midway Island before the end of the game.
The player with the most victory points is the winner.

==Publication history==
For a battle where much depended on searching for the opponent, game designers Lindsley Schutz and Larry Pinsky designed &quot;Midway&quot; with a double-blind hidden movement and search system. They used as a technical consultant C. Wade McCluskey, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral (Ret.), who had been air group commander on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; during the Battle of Midway, and had been credited by Admiral Nimitz with playing a pivotal role in the battle. The game was published by Avalon Hill in 1964. Eight years later, when company director Tom Shaw was looking to eliminate a game from Avalon Hill&#x27;s line-up, only an intervention by Don Greenwood saved &quot;Midway&quot;. (The axe fell on &quot;1914&quot; instead.) &quot;Midway&quot; remained part of Avalon Hill&#x27;s line of games through the 1980s.

In 1980, Avalon Hill released &quot;Midway Campaign&quot;, a videogame for various home computer platforms that was based to some extent on the board game. The videogame was a finalist for the Charles S. Roberts Award for &quot;Best Computer Game of 1980&quot;.

In 1991, a revised &quot;Smithsonian&quot; edition of the board game was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Reception==
In Issue 8 of &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;, Don Turnbull noted &quot;What little surface action there is can best be summed up in the word &#x27;imprecise&#x27;. Which is a polite way of saying unsatisfactory from the naval point of view.&quot; Turnbull concluded, &quot;For players who like a reasonably simple naval/air game, &quot;Midway&quot; is quite a good buy, but don&#x27;t expect too much from it.&quot;

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer felt that the game, already 12 years old at the time he was writing, was &quot;still played by people interested in the context.&quot; He noted, &quot;The game is often tense and exciting, although realism is limited and the Japanese have a definite edge in the usual game (this an be corrected by varying search capacities.)

Bill Thompson, writing for the Wargame Academy, felt the game&#x27;s &quot;greatest strength is its simplicity and is ideal for introducing wargaming to new players.&quot; Thompson didn&#x27;t feel that the 1991 Smithsonian edition was an improvement, saying, &quot;Despite up to date graphics, standardized rulebook format and inclusion of much historical material as a modern introductory game, [the 1991 edition] seems more complex and not an actual improvement over the original.&quot;

In &quot;The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training&quot;, Martin Campion noted, &quot;This is a very realistic game except perhaps for the excessively large number of casualties suffered by attacking aircraft.&quot; In terms of using the game as an educational aid, Campion wrote, &quot;In a classroom situation, the awkward search board rules could be replaced by the activities of an umpire.&quot;

<doc id="167434" wikidata="Q4563086" url="?curid=167434" title="Washington Bicentennial stamps of 1932">
<text>The Washington Bicentennial stamps of 1932 are postage stamps issued by the United States government in 1932 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of U.S. President George Washington&#x27;s birth. Twelve stamps were issued as a collection, with each one depicting the President in a different period in his life.

The series was designed by Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) designers Clair Aubrey Huston and Alvin Meissner. The ½¢ through 10¢ values present portraits of Washington derived from paintings, engravings or sculptures made during his lifetime. Huston designed seven stamps of the series: the ½¢, 1½¢, 2¢, 3¢, 6¢, 8¢ and 9¢ values; Meissner designed the remaining five.

The selections were made based on recommendations made by the Washington Bicentennial Commission, The United States Post Office Department and the BEP. The original concept called for not only picturing Washington but also featuring significant events, locations and iconic images of his life and after death. This was later modified to featuring only portraits.

The Post Office announced definite plans for the series in November 1930. These soon took on grandiose proportions, with the projected series comprising no fewer than eighteen stamps covering all values between ½¢ and $5. By comparison the largest commemorative set previously offered by the Post Office—the landmark Columbian Exposition issue of 1893—had consisted of sixteen stamps. (No other previous commemorative set had run to more than the nine values of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi series.) Indeed, the wide format of the Columbians was initially chosen for the Washington Bicentennial stamps and, like the Columbians, they were to survey their subject&#x27;s entire career, presenting tableaux and portraits from all periods of Washington&#x27;s life. In January 1931 a congressman went so far as to introduce a bill (never, however, enacted) proposing that during the whole of 1932 &quot;all postage stamps offered for sale through the United States..., of whatever color or denomination, shall bear the portrait of George Washington.&quot; The numerous preparatory wide-format designs produced by the post office, including tableaux for 14¢, 17¢ and 25¢ denominations, were intended to be printed in two colors. Among the subjects depicted were Washington&#x27;s tomb at Mount Vernon, Washington Crossing the Delaware, Washington&#x27;s 1793 Inaugural, Washington&#x27;s Home Life, Washington&#x27;s Birthplace, Washington Resigning his Commission, a double portrait of George and Martha Washington, and the Washington Monument. Ultimately, however, the post office elected to avoid historical tableaux altogether, on the grounds that the public would expect these to replicate famous paintings rife with historical inaccuracies. Instead, the series would consist of single-width, single-color issues devoted exclusively to portraits, and would be reduced to twelve denominations ranging no higher than 10¢. A series of stamped envelopes showing Washington&#x27;s home at Mount Vernon were also issued.
The bicentennial stamps were first placed on sale January 1, 1932, at the post office in Washington, D.C.
While the bicentennial issue presents many unfamiliar images of Washington, the Post Office took care to place the widely loved Gilbert Stuart portrait of the president on the 2-cent stamp, which satisfied the normal first-class letter rate and would therefore get the most use. Several months after the series appeared, however, the first-class letter rate was raised from 2 cents to 3 cents. The greatly increased demand for 3-cent stamps remained unsatisfied by emergency reprintings of the 3-cent Washington Bicentennial issue and the 3-cent Lincoln regular issue then currently available. Moreover, the new rate meant that the only Washington stamp available to the public for everyday use was one that offered a little-known and quite uncharacteristic image of Washington. Accordingly, the Post Office felt obliged to rush a new regular issue 3-cent stamp into production that offered a more familiar Washington portrait. Rather than taking the time to create a completely new design, the BEP revamped the bicentennial 2-cent Atheneum value as a 3-cent stamp (Scott #720), transforming it into a regular issue by eliminating the date ribbons flanking the portrait. This was printed in the standard 3-cent color, and also issued as vertical and horizontal coil stamps.

<doc id="167436" wikidata="Q4439293" url="?curid=167436" title="1943 steel cent">
<text>1943 steel cents are U.S. one-cent coins that were struck in steel due to wartime shortages of copper. The Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco mints each produced these 1943 Lincoln cents. The unique composition of the coin (low-grade steel coated with zinc, instead of the previously 95%-copper-based bronze composition) has led to various nicknames, such as &quot;wartime cent&quot;, &quot;steel war penny&quot;, &quot;zinc cent&quot; and &quot;steelie&quot;. The 1943 steel cent features the same Victor David Brenner design for the Lincoln cent which had been in use since 1909.

== History ==

Due to wartime needs of copper for use in ammunition and other military equipment during World War II, the United States Mint researched various ways to limit dependence and meet conservation goals on copper usage. After trying out several substitutes (ranging from other metals to plastics) to replace the then-standard bronze alloy, the one-cent coin was minted in zinc-coated steel. This alloy caused the new coins to be magnetic and 13% lighter. They were struck at all three mints: Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. As with the bronze cents, coins from the latter two sites have respectively &quot;D&quot; and &quot;S&quot; mintmarks below the date.

However, problems began to arise from the mintage. Freshly minted, they were often mistaken for dimes. Magnets in vending machines (which took copper cents) placed to pick up steel slugs also picked up the legitimate steel cents. Because the galvanization process did not cover the edges of the coins, sweat would quickly rust the metal. After public outcry, the Mint developed a process whereby salvaged brass shell casings were augmented with pure copper to produce an alloy close to the 1941–42 composition. This was used for 1944–46-dated cents, after which the prewar composition was resumed. Although they continued to circulate into the 1960s, the mint collected large numbers of the 1943 cents and destroyed them.

The steel cent is the only regular-issue United States coin that can be picked up with a magnet. The steel cent was also the only coin issued by the United States for circulation that does not contain any copper. (Even U.S. gold coins at various times contained from slightly over 2% copper to an eventual standard 10% copper to increase resistance to wear by making the pure gold coins slightly harder).

==Related variations==

=== 1943 copper cent ===

Far ahead of the 1955 doubled die cent in rarity, the 1943 copper cent is one of the notable rarities of the Lincoln cent series. An estimated 40 examples are believed to have been struck, with 13 confirmed to exist. The error occurred when copper planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines during the changeover from copper to steel blanks. Examples were discovered after the War, with the first two in 1947, and another in 1958. That example appeared in a 1958 Abe Kosoff sale, but was withdrawn prior to the sale; one mint condition Denver Mint specimen sold for over $1.7 million in 2010.

==== Counterfeits ====

Many people have counterfeited the coin by either copper-plating normal 1943 cents (sometimes as novelties with no intent to defraud), or altering cents from the period, usually 1945, 1948, or 1949-dated coins.

The copper cents differ from their steel counterparts in four ways:
* Genuine 1943 copper cents will not be attracted to a magnet. Copper-plated steel cents will exhibit a strong magnetic attraction.
* Copper cents weigh 3.11 grams. Steel cents weigh 2.702 grams.
* The numeral 3 in 1943 has the same long tail as the steel cents. Alterations from later-dated copper cents will be noticeable when compared side by side with genuine cents with years ending in 3.
* The quality of the strike is exceptionally sharp, especially around the rim, because the soft copper planchets were struck with the same (higher) pressure used for the steel cents.

=== 1943 tin cent ===
In 2019, NGC authenticated a worn 1943 cent composed of 86.41% tin and 8.37% antimony with other trace metals. The coin was discovered by a coin collector in the state of Oregon, who found it in his father&#x27;s yard and realized it was not attracted to a magnet while searching his coin collection for 1943 copper cents in 2019. It is likely that the coin is an error or was intentionally struck as a pattern in late 1942 using an obverse die intended for the following year, though no documented evidence of a pattern with this composition has been found.

The coin was found in a badly damaged state, with two large gashes and a slight bend. Believing it to be a steel cent, the discoverer straightened the coin in a bench vise so that it would fit inside a coin album. The coin weighs 2.702 g.

=== 1944 steel cent ===

In an error similar to the 1943 cents, a few 1944 cents were struck on steel planchets left over from 1943. There are two explanations given for why this happened. One explanation is that steel planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines from the previous year mixed in with copper planchets. Another explanation credits the error to the production of 25 million Belgian two franc pieces by the Philadelphia mint after that country&#x27;s liberation from the Nazis. These coins were of the same composition and the same planchets as the 1943 cents, but they differed slightly in weight. In all, 1944 steel cents are fewer in number than their 1943 copper counterparts, and are even more valuable; one such example minted in San Francisco sold for $373,750 in an August 2008 auction held by Heritage Auctions; this was the highest auction price ever for a Lincoln cent until September 23, 2010, when it was superseded by a 1943-D bronze penny.

== Cost of mintage ==
Although United States penny is widely known to hold a higher mintage cost than its face value, the United States actually made a large profit on minting steel coins. In 1943, the cost of a gross ton of steel was $34.

== Novelty coins ==
Since many steel cents corroded and became dull soon after entering circulation, some dealers who sold the coins as novelties improved their appearance by &quot;reprocessing&quot; – stripping off the old zinc coating and then replating them with zinc or chrome. These reprocessed coins are sometimes erroneously described as &quot;brilliant uncirculated&quot;, or similar terms, by ignorant or unscrupulous online sellers.

<doc id="167437" wikidata="Q168219" url="?curid=167437" title="Hemispheres (Rush album)">
<text>Hemispheres is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on October 24, 1978, by Anthem Records. It reached No. 14 in Canada and the UK, and No. 47 in the US. The album was a steady seller in the group&#x27;s catalogue, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies 15 years later.

After a particularly exhausting tour supporting &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; to capitalise on their growing fanbase, Rush had a dedicated rest period. They returned to Rockfield Studios in Wales to record a follow-up album but had no preconceived ideas, and spent two weeks writing and arranging new material with some difficulty over its direction. It is the final Rush album to feature a side-long track; the 18-minute opener &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres&quot; concludes the story initially left as a cliffhanger on &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, and the Apollonian and Dionysian concept addressed in drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s lyrics are represented on the cover artwork. The closer, &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;, was the band&#x27;s first instrumental.

&quot;Hemispheres&quot; received a mostly positive reception from critics upon release, and has gained further acclaim retrospectively. It was the first Rush album to receive widespread FM radio airplay, helped by the release of &quot;Circumstances&quot; and &quot;The Trees&quot;, the two shorter tracks on the album, as singles. The album has been remastered several times, and a deluxe 40th anniversary edition with previously unreleased live tracks followed in 2018.

==Background and recording==
In May 1978, Rush finished touring &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, which contributed to their breakthrough in the UK market, following a series of well-received shows and &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, the lead single from the album, reaching No. 36 in the UK. Following a dedicated rest period, the band regrouped to produce a follow-up album and returned to Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, Wales to record as they had enjoyed making &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; at the facility. Bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee said recording in the United States did not appeal to the group, and since they were influenced by many English bands, recording in the UK was an attractive idea. In a departure from previous albums, the band entered the songwriting process without any preconceived ideas. They rented a farmhouse close to the studio for two weeks of intensive writing and rehearsals, during which the trio had concerns over the direction the new album was to take.
&quot;Hemispheres&quot; was recorded in June and July 1978, then the longest amount of time Rush had to record an album–in comparison, 1976&#x27;s &quot;2112&quot; was recorded in five weeks and &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; in four. Rush were joined by long-time co-producer Terry Brown, also credited as co-arranger, and engineer Pat Moran. The conditions of the studio lacked the standard facilities, including a sofa. Lee described it as &quot;really funky&quot;. In one incident, a latch that failed to shut the studio doors frustrated Lifeson who, in a fit, took it off, installed a hydraulic door opener and built a handle on it. The album was recorded in sections at a time with the three members playing simultaneously. Rush could only put down the music in their allocated slot at Rockfield due to the time required to arrange the tracks, so they booked Advision Studios in Fitzrovia, London, to record the vocals. They had enjoyed the experience of mixing &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; there, and wanted to return as it was where Yes had recorded their favourite albums. Upon entering Advision, however, Lee had only sung the lyrics in basic form as the songs were being written acoustically, and the group carried on thinking he could sing them confidently. &quot;So we never really checked the keys that the songs were written in. And when I went to sing them, they were in such difficult keys for me to sing, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m singing so high.&quot; The process was frustrating for Lee, who had several blowouts during vocal takes and had to go for walks to calm down.

Once recording was complete, mixing was undertaken by Brown and assistant John Brand at Advision. After around two-and-a-half weeks, the pair had encountered problems and were unable to produce a satisfactory mix, which led to the decision to briefly return to Canada as the band had been away from home for several months. They returned to London in August, this time to Trident Studios in Soho, where a mix was finalised. The album cost an estimated CAN$100,000 to make, the most expensive Rush album at the time. In the three-month period of putting it together, the band had just one day off and took a six-week vacation once complete to recover. Lee looked back on the album in 2018, and said the band &quot;greatly underestimated the level of overachievement that we were shooting for&quot;.

==Songs==
===Side one===
Side one is occupied by &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres&quot;, an 18-minute sequel to &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage&quot; on &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; which had ended on a cliffhanger. Book I concerns an unnamed space explorer who travels to Cygnus X-1, a black hole, in its space ship and is pulled into it. In Book II, his wandering soul emerges into Olympus, who witnesses the gods Apollo and Dionysus caught in the struggle between mind and heart, the two leading two types of people: those who follow science and knowledge and build cities but with no emotional attachment, and those who live in forests but experience love. The clash leads to the world splintered into different hemispheres, and a silent scream from the explorer is heard by the two gods who reconsider and unite. They name the explorer Cygnus, the god of balance, and the world is restored with truth and love co-existing.

Initially, Lee had a different idea for the album&#x27;s centerpiece track, but after some music had been written the group felt it right to continue the &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; story. Peart started to outline the story and lyrics to Book II three weeks before the band left for Rockfield. The process was stressful for him, which took &quot;hours of tearing my hair out&quot;, and was only half complete when they arrived at the studio. The sequel, like Book I, uses mythology and symbolism to depict a conflict between the gods Apollo and Dionysus, which is resolved when Cygnus intervenes, claiming a balance of heart and mind are what is needed for humans to live well. Peart introduced the gong and timpani to his percussion set for the first time; he hadn&#x27;t thought of adding the instrument on previous albums but thought it was needed for &quot;Hemispheres&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Circumstances&quot; is the first of two shorter tracks on &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. With the band having accustomed its audience to longer, more elaborate formats, this song is qualified by Lee as an experiment, an attempt to break away from the prog formula that would steer the band into new directions in later albums.

&quot;The Trees&quot; tells the story of an upheaval in a forest of oak and maple trees, where the maples think the oaks grow too large and take all the sunlight. The maples form a union in an effort to have the oaks cut down to a smaller size, but in the end all the trees are kept equal by cutting tools made by humans. Lee said the Welsh countryside set the overall tone for the song: &quot;You&#x27;re watching English television, walking in the Welsh countryside; there are sheep talking to you in the early morning when you&#x27;re trying to sleep ... lyrics came first, and we wanted to construct a dynamic little tale as a soundtrack to those lyrics&quot;. Peart took inspiration from a cartoon he saw of trees &quot;carrying on like fools&quot;, and wrote a lyric based around the idea of trees acting like people. He later described the song as a parable about Collectivism, an idea addressed by novelist Ayn Rand.

The nine-minute &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot; (subtitled &quot;An Exercise in Self-Indulgence&quot;) is the first instrumental that Rush recorded, and has 12 distinct sections. The piece is what Lifeson described as a &quot;musical re-creation&quot; of the various nightmares he had, particularly while he was on tour. It was the sole piece that developed from the two-week rehearsal period the group had prior to entering the studio. The band encountered great difficulty in recording it as they wanted it put down as a single live performance, rather than a more produced and edited piece. Lee said it took as many as 40 takes to produce one that they were satisfied with, and he and Peart pointed out that they spent more time recording &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot; than their second album, &quot;Fly by Night&quot;. Peart recalled the group spent four days and nights playing it repeatedly, playing even when tired and with sore hands: &quot;We were determined to get the whole thing perfect, but in the end I just couldn&#x27;t do it, and we ended up putting it together from a few different takes.&quot; The segments &quot;Monsters!&quot; and &quot;Monsters! (Reprise)&quot; are taken from &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, a 1937 jazz instrumental by Raymond Scott.

==Artwork==

The cover was designed by longtime Rush collaborator, graphic artist Hugh Syme. The front depicts a figure that resembles the one in the painting &quot;The Son of Man&quot; by surreal artist René Magritte who is standing on the left side of a human brain. He is looking in the direction of a nude man in a ballet pose who is standing on the right side. The overall image was Syme&#x27;s own creation, but it developed from discussions with Peart about the left and right and the Apollonian and Dionysian parts of the brain, itself a theme covered in Peart&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres&quot;. The Magritte figure is Syme&#x27;s longtime friend Bobby King, who was also the nude model for Rush&#x27;s Starman logo on &quot;2112&quot; that Syme had also designed. The naked male is a dancer from the Toronto Ballet School. The brain was loaned to Syme from the Department of Anatomy at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine for him to photograph and the final design was completed with a composite. The background was a combination of airbrush and paint. Syme started working on the design before he had heard any music on the album.

==Release==
Prior to its release, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; aired in its entirety on Rick Ringer&#x27;s radio show on CHUM-FM in Toronto, on October 5, 1978, with the band as studio guests. Its release in stores followed on October 24, and reached number 14 on the Canadian Albums Chart and UK Albums Chart, and number 47 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. For a short time, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; was released in Canada on red vinyl with a gatefold sleeve with a poster and as a limited edition picture disc.

The album had a strong impact upon release, and marked the first time Rush received widespread FM radio exposure helped by &quot;Circumstances&quot; and &quot;The Trees&quot; being shorter and radio friendly. The album reached Platinum in Canada and Gold in the US by mid-December 1978, and Silver in the UK. It proved to be a steady seller in the band&#x27;s catalogue, reaching Platinum certification in the US in 1993 for selling one million copies, 15 years after its release.

Shortly after &quot;Hemispheres&quot; was released, Lee said the band intend to &quot;break tradition&quot; and avoid long, conceptual pieces on their next album.

==Reception==

Geoff Barton gave &quot;Hemispheres&quot; three stars in &quot;Sounds&quot; in an article where he pondered if it &quot;is a masterwork or a mistake&quot;. On one hand, he said the album is &quot;a lovingly crafted, highly complex album ... brimful with profound lyrical statements&quot; and &quot;music with a message (trite but true)&quot;. But on the other, Barton thought it finds Rush &quot;wallowing way, way out of their depth ... it seems impossible to think that this band were once honest, unpretentious purveyors of straight-forward, hard-hitting heavy metal music. Now, having forsaken basic beginnings. Rush sound ambitious beyond their musical means.&quot; In a review for &quot;Circus&quot; magazine, Bart Testa wrote the band plays &quot;stupendous fanfare music&quot; and noted their positive sentiments in the songs. He favoured &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book II&quot; over the side-long suite on &quot;2112&quot; as it showcased a better performance from the band, noting their ability to &quot;interlock metal whirlwinds&quot; driven by Peart&#x27;s drumming. However, Testa noted &quot;Circumstances&quot; was the only one true &quot;song&quot; on the record, &quot;and it&#x27;s not very good, either.&quot; Joe Nick Patoski gave a positive review in American rock magazine &quot;Creem&quot;, who thought Rush &quot;lay their cards on the table&quot; to much success with &quot;timely and illuminating issues&quot; in the lyrics. He summarised: &quot;Just the stuff America needs to nudge its way into the 80s.&quot;

The album gained further critical acclaim retrospectively. In a poll held by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; titled &quot;Readers&#x27; Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot; in 2012, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; was ranked at . Reviewing the album for the magazine, Michael Bloom stated, &quot;Overall, especially in &#x27;La Villa Strangiato&#x27;, Lifeson, Peart and Lee prove themselves masters of every power-trio convention. In fact, these guys have the chops and drive to break out of the largely artificial bounds of the format, and they constantly threaten to do so but never quite manage.&quot; In the review for AllMusic, Greg Prato favourably compared the album to the band&#x27;s previous work, &quot;While the story line isn&#x27;t as comprehensible as &quot;2112&quot; was, it&#x27;s much more consistent musically, twisting and turning through five different sections which contrast heavy rock sections against more sedate pieces.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked &quot;Hemispheres&quot; the 12th best progressive rock album of all time.

==Tour==

Rush supported the album with a 137-date tour of Canada, the US, and Europe between October 1978 and June 1979. It marked the band performing longer sets and in larger venues across Canada, including three sold out dates at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto in December 1978, culminating in a show on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The stage set improved, this time with more sophisticated lighting and triple the amount of video projection compared to their last tour, including a film to illustrate the story of &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot;. Rush were in considerable financial debt at the start of the tour, and Peart said they hoped to pay it off using receipts from the first leg and make a profit on the second. The group would not tour with a profit until their next album, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;.

<text>Shoreham-by-Sea (often shortened to Shoreham) is a coastal town and port in the Adur district, in the county of West Sussex, England. In 2011 it had a population of 20,547.

The town is bordered to its north by the South Downs, to its west by the Adur Valley, and to its south by the River Adur and Shoreham Beach on the English Channel. The town lies in the middle of the ribbon of urban development along the English south coast, approximately equidistant from the city of Brighton and Hove to the east and the town of Worthing to the west. Shoreham covers an area of and has a population of 20,547 (2011 census).

== History ==

Old Shoreham dates back to pre-Roman times.
St Nicolas&#x27; Church, inland by the River Adur, is partly Anglo-Saxon in its construction.
The name of the town has an Old English origin. The town and port of New Shoreham was established by the Norman conquerors towards the end of the 11th century.

St Mary de Haura Church (St Mary of the Haven) was built in the decade following 1103 (the Domesday Book was dated 1086), and around this time the town was laid out on a grid pattern that, in essence, still survives in the town centre. The present church is approximately half the size of the original structure – the former nave was already in ruins by the time of the English Civil War, although evidence of the original west façade survive in the churchyard to this day. 

Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, writing , described Shoreham as &quot;a fine and cultivated city containing buildings and flourishing activity&quot;. Shoreham had status as a Royal Port.

An 18th-century naval chartist and artist, Captain Henry Roberts, who was once a lieutenant under Captain Cook, was a native of Shoreham.

The rapid growth of the neighbouring towns of Brighton, Hove and Worthing – and in particular the arrival of the railway in 1840 – prepared the way for Shoreham&#x27;s rise as a Victorian sea port, with several shipyards and an active coasting trade. Shoreham Harbour remains in commercial operation today. The area became an urban district, with Shoreham Town Hall as its headquarters, in 1910.

==Kingston Buci old village==

Originally the people of Kingston Buci may have lived at Thundersbarrow. This may have been the centre of a large estate in the post-Roman Dark Ages. However, in early or mid-Saxon times, the people may have re-located down off the hill to Kingston Buci (), which sits to the east of Shoreham-by-Sea. It has a medieval church, rectory, manor house, and huge old barn which still make it a remarkable cluster – and, like Cissbury (where the people came off the hill to form Findon) and at Mount Caburn (where people re-located down at Beddingham), this stranded settlement is three quarters of a mile from the Downs. The church here was extensively re-modelled in the thirteenth century when the shifting river estuary temporarily made Kingston a port town.

The &#x27;king&#x27; of the name &#x27;Kingston&#x27; may have referred to a Saxon king of Sussex. The &#x27;Buci&#x27; part of the name comes from the Anglo-Norman owners&#x27; hometown of Bouce in Normandy.

== Shoreham Beach ==
Shoreham Beach, to the south of the town, is a shingle spit deposited over millennia by longshore drift. This blocks the southerly flow of the River Adur which turns east at this point to discharge into the English Channel further along the coast at a point that has varied considerably over time. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the mouth of the river shifted eastwards which restricted trade to the port; by 1810, it was almost opposite Aldrington church. In 1816, work had been completed to fix the position of the river in its present position, flowing into the sea between two piers. Once the harbour mouth was stabilised, it was defended by Shoreham Fort, which was built in 1857.

Converted railway carriages became summer homes around the start of the 20th century, and &#x27;Bungalow Town&#x27;, as it was then known, became home to the early British film industry. Francis L. Lyndhurst founded the Sunny South Film Company, which made its first commercial movie on Shoreham Beach in 1912 and built a film studio there. Shoreham Beach officially became part of Shoreham-by-Sea in 1910. Much of the housing in the area was cleared for defence reasons during the Second World War and most of what remained after the war is now long gone, having been replaced by modern houses. The Church of the Good Shepherd, built in 1913, still stands. Along the Adur mud flats adjacent to Shoreham Beach sits (and at high tides floats) a large collection of houseboats made from converted barges, tugs, mine sweepers, and motor torpedo boats. The seaside shingle bank of Shoreham beach extends further east past the harbour mouth, forming the southern boundary of the commercial harbour in Southwick, Portslade, and Hove. The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath, commemorating the escape route of Charles II to France after the Battle of Worcester, follows the beach westwards from Hove past Portslade and Southwick, ending by the harbour mouth&#x27;s east breakwater.

==Downland areas==

The River Adur, the downs, and the sea support a diverse wildlife flora and fauna in the area. The mudflats support wading birds and gulls, including the ringed plover which attempts to breed on the coastal shingle. The pied wagtail is common in the town in the winter months. Insects include dragonflies over the flood plains of the river. The south- and west-facing downs attract at least 33 species of butterfly, including a nationally important population of the chalkhill blue butterfly on Mill Hill. The underlying rock is chalk on the downs, with alluvium in the old river channels. The Adur district has a variety of habitats in a small area, including natural chalk downs and butterfly meadows, freshwater and reed beds, salt marsh and estuary, brackish water lagoons, woodland, shingle seashore, chalk platform undersea, and large expanses of sand.

Southwick Hill and the smaller sites connected to it are the second biggest surviving complex of ancient Down pasture on the entire plateau of the Brighton Downs (the biggest is around Castle Hill, near Woodingdean).:209

The town is the end-point of the Monarch&#x27;s Way, a long-distance footpath, based on the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated by Cromwell in the Battle of Worcester.

===Mill Hill===
Mill Hill () is also known as Shoreham bank, as the hillside falls sharply to the River Adur. It is a Local Nature Reserve and has been famous for its butterflies since the 1820s. In May, the hillside is dusted yellow with horseshoe vetch: the butterflies&#x27; food plant. In August, the hillside is colourful with knapweeds, pink centaury, the tiny white pinpoints of eyebright, and the white umbels of wild carrot, wild parsnip, St John&#x27;s wort, and wild thyme. The Hill is known for its dingy skippers and grizzled skippers in the spring, and in summer the chalkhill blue and Adonis blue are &#x27;flagship&#x27; species of this Hill.

From Mill Hill it is possible to see Applesham Farm, which was a village at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. To the north end is another Saxon farm, Old Erringham, which King Alfred&#x27;s successors fortified to defend the estuary. To the south is the Norman church of Old Shoreham, almost on the banks of the Adur, and next to it are the wooden piers of the 1781 toll bridge, which collected traffic tolls up to the 1960s.:203

Mill Hill now suffers from traffic and aircraft noise. The special mosses and lichens have gone, and the Heath and Carthusian snails are now gone. Despite efforts by volunteers and rangers, the hill still carries far too great an area of dense and simplified scrub, which has flourished at the expense of the biodiverse turf.:203

===Southwick Hill===

Southwick Hill () is owned by the National Trust and has some special wildlife areas. In 1985, local residents were presented with the plan for the A27 road bypass cutting through the Hill. Through the vigorous campaigning of activists from ABBA (the Anti-Brighton Bypass Association) the road was re-routed through a tunnel under the Hill rather than a cutting through it.

In high summer, on the hill (&#x27;bostal&#x27;) path, there is round-headed rampion, blue scabious, and autumn gentian. On the south side of the bridlepath, there is an un-grazed triangle with a taller sward. Here, there are still rabbits playing on the lawns amongst the purging flax, eggs and bacon, squinancywort, eyebright, and wild thyme, which themselves mingle with tall herb patches of parsnip, greater knapweed, ragwort, hogweed, and St John&#x27;s wort. There are bushes of raspberry and rose-bay willowherb. Butterflies in the area include common blue, clouded yellow, small heath, comma, red admiral, painted lady, and day-flying moths like treble-bar and dusky sallow. There are glowworms too. In autumn, parts of the short turf may be colourful from the many waxcap and other old meadow fungi. Additional mushrooms include puffballs, blue legs, and velvet shank; fairy rings also form.:211

However, Southwick Hill is not what it was. Until recent years, it was the best place on the Brighton Downs to get a sense of what Down pasture was like during late Victorian and Edwardian times through to 1940. The tenant farmer continuously grazed the whole Hill and, as a result, it was something of a time capsule from a particular period of Downland history, that of the long agricultural depression from 1876 to 1940, when scrub took over many old pastures and cattle replaced many sheep flocks.:210 In recent years, however, the Hill has been split by fencing into a southern half which is seriously under-grazed, with simplified tussocky grassland, and a northern half which remains better grazed. The southern half has now lost its close-bitten down pasture, with its flowerings of tiny herbs and fruitings of old pasture fungi. Nevertheless, as a whole the Hill still has a mixture of archaic pasture and scrub thickets, sometimes mature enough to harbour small maiden oaks, and it retains much of the wildlife lost elsewhere on the Brighton Downs.

===The Crooked Moon Hedge===
Hedges are very rare on these Downs (except around farmsteads). The Crooked Moon Hedge () lies on the top of a prehistoric field lynchet; these southern slopes of Southwick Hill were covered with an Iron Age field system whose banks lay regularly on east–west and south–north axes. At its northern end, it is the boundary between Kingston Buci and Southwick parishes, and at its southern end it bounded Kingston Buci sheep Down to the west, and one of the parish open fields to the east.

The hedge contains a lot of maple and ash and may have been bird-sown. As per Hooper&#x27;s rule, the hedge is three to four centuries old.:209

===The &#x27;Rest and Be Thankful&#x27; stone===

There is a large flat block of lichen-covered stone () by the path to Southwick Hill from Southwickhill Barn, which marks a corner on the old parish boundary between Kingston Buci and Southwick. It was notable enough to show on the Victorian Ordnance Survey maps.:210

===Thundersbarrow Hill===
Thunders Barrow () is a large barrow, although it was partially dug away on its south side in the nineteenth century to make way for a dew pond. It sits just north of Southwick Hill. The origins of its name are unknown.

It is only at this distance from the bypass that the silence of the Downs and the sound of the birds are bigger than the noise of the road. This point marks the beginning of Downland tranquility. The ramparts of Thundersbarrow&#x27;s late Bronze Age and Iron Age camp are still tall enough to walk around, although they get a bit vague on the eastern side because of plough damage, and because the Romano-British villagers built their houses just outside the rampart and right up against the barrow on that side. When the village was excavated in 1932, two corn-drying ovens were found, still with soot in the flues and bits of charred grain.

===Erringham Hole===
Erringham Hole () is the bushy combe to the east of Thundersbarrow, whose Celtic villagers built the huge field lynchets, parts of which are up to 12 feet in height. It was called &#x27;Erringham Hole&#x27; because it was part of Old Erringham Farm. Old Erringham Hole (not to be confused with Whitelot Bottom, which is the ploughed land further east down the combe) has flowery chalk grassland, scrub, rank grassland, and lots of rabbits. The rabbits encourage rabbit-resistant plants like tall woolly mullein (complete with mullein moth caterpillars, hound&#x27;s-tongue, ground ivy, and eyebright. Until 25 years ago, the combe remained substantially open and the ancient lynchet system was plain to see, but cessation of grazing and a lack of scrub control has allowed the species-rich Down pasture to be lost to simplified scrub and even secondary woodland.:212

===Hazelholt Bottom===

Hazelholt Bottom () is a tranquil slope with large flowery glades. There are often roe deer in the wide corn field below the slope. The National Trust own the south slope and Whitelot Bottom further south, but Whitelot was ploughed up after 1945 and has never been returned to public use.

Hazelholt has rich old chalk grassland with cowslips in spring and devil&#x27;s-bit scabious in September. In mid-summer, there are many butterflies, including adonis blue and chalkhill blue. At the head of the combe, there are more old grassland and great blackberry thickets. Since 1945, scrub has taken over much of this former open slope. The remaining grassland is only lightly grazed, allowing growth of bramble and thorn and a loss of its ancient down pasture character.:212

===Freshcombe===

Freshcombe () is owned by the National Trust, but was leased away from their management. It is threatened by scrub expansion and insufficient grazing. Its slopes have very old gorse thickets; they are shown as well-established on the 1873 OS map, and may be centuries older than that.

This is the only site in the South Downs that contains the plant saw-wort, which looks like a slimmer version of knapweed, and still blooms profusely in a little glade amongst the gorse. It is a survivor from the days of the Downland heaths. It survives here because the soil must have a strong clay-with-flints influence. The glade where it blooms also contains flowers of betony, red clover, hawkbit, and St John&#x27;s wort.:213

===Old Erringham Farmstead===

Old Erringham Farmstead () has an old flint farmhouse with great chimneys and part-Horsham slab roofing, and ramshackle old flint barns. It has one of only two remaining medieval manorial chapels on the Brighton Downs (the other at Swanborough Manor), which now functions as a front garden shed for one of the modern farm workers cottages just to the south of the old farmhouse. It has a tiny ecclesiastical window on its south face.

The farm is designated as an ancient monument, incorporating the remains of a medieval settlement and an eleventh century ringwork. It was presumably built as a defence against the Vikings, though it&#x27;s difficult to pick it out amongst the grassy plats now.

It is a mixed farm with corn crops, beef cattle, a bit of livery stabling, and hay meadows. The farm manages the sites of Old Erringham Combe and Anchor Bottom to preserve their natural value. Around the farmstead there is red star-thistle (a Brighton Downs speciality), musk thistle, spear thistle, welted thistle, creeping thistle, teasel, and viper&#x27;s bugloss, all adding summer colour.:204

===Old Erringham Combe and Shaw===

Old Erringham Combe () is an old-fashioned mosaic of habitats, making it a great refuge for Downland wildlife. The south-facing bank is the hottest place, but below it there are willows and a tiny tongue of wet grassland where lesser marsh grasshopper, autumn lady&#x27;s-tresses orchid, bastard toadflax, rockrose, betony, wild thyme, and other herbs grow.:205

Summer butterflies in the area include wall brown and clouded yellow, and day-flying moths like yellow belle, dusky sallow, common carpet, and grass moths enjoy the drying grassland. The rare Carthusian snail (&quot;Monacha cartusiana)&quot; still exists in this combe, possibly due to centuries of cattle grazing.:205

Old Erringham Shaw is a tangled wood of sycamore, ash, elm, and thorn. It&#x27;s more open at the northern end facing the combe, where the remains of four big old broken beeches and lots of may blossom make it a good place for insects.:205

=== Slonk Hill ===

Slonk Hill (): there were at least two Bronze Age barrows and a little Iron Age settlement on the Hill. They were surrounded by a rectangular ditched enclosure and perhaps made into a &#x27;temenos&#x27; or temple. Ritual deposits of animals and coins were buried at the site.:122 Evening shadows reveal dips and hummocks at the Hill&#x27;s southern end, although they are probably due to the trench digging of the large army camp that came here during the First World War.

There are three places that were spared the damage of decades of agribusiness on the hill: an island of old Down pasture on the eastern slope, an old bostal track, which winds down the slope at its southern end, and a patch of hillside a few hundred yards north, surrounded by Iron Age field lynchets. More recently, the use of agrochemicals has stopped, and the hillside is again colourful with herbs. The intact areas have pyramidal orchid, spotted orchid, meadow oat-grass, crested hair-grass, and round-headed rampion.:206

=== Mossy Bottom ===
Mossy Bottom () derives its name from &#x27;Muster&#x27; Bottom, where the shepherd mustered his sheep. Mossy Bottom slope is statutory access land under the right to roam &#x27;CROW&#x27; Act (2000), but public usage is heavily challenged by prohibitive notices and poor access provision. It has boney Iron Age lynchets across it made by the peasant farmers who lived in Thundersbarrow village. They used to be called &quot;Thunder&#x27;s Steps.&quot; There are big old anthills, and plants such as large thyme, dropwort, cowslip, basil, harebell, and round-headed rampion.:206

== Transport ==
Brighton City Airport lies to the west of the main town and has been in private ownership since 2006. It is the UK&#x27;s oldest licensed airport still in operation and has a 1936 Grade II*-listed Art Deco terminal building. The terminal has been a filming location for an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (&quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;), a Crimewatch-type reconstruction (2000, ITV Meridian), BBC &quot;Tenko&quot; series episode, scenes of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, and the film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot;.

The town is served by Shoreham-by-Sea railway station, located on the West Coastway Line.

Local bus services are provided by the Brighton &amp; Hove bus company, Stagecoach South, and a local town route is operated by Compass Travel.

Shoreham Tollbridge crosses the River Adur in the west of the town. This bridge is a Grade II* listed building and was the last Sussex toll bridge in use. The bridge was part of the A27 road until it was closed to traffic in 1968. The structure is now too weak to carry vehicles and underwent extensive restoration, then was ceremonially re-opened for pedestrians on 23 October 2008, by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Adur Ferry Bridge in the south of the town (replacing the old Shoreham footbridge) crosses the River Adur to Shoreham Beach. It was opened to the public by the Duke of Gloucester on 13 November 2013.

== Local media ==
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Whitehawk Hill TV transmitter. The town’s local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 95.3 FM, Heart South on 103.5 FM, More Radio Worthing on 107.7 FM and Seaside Hospital Radio that broadcast from the Southlands Hospital in Shoreham. Local newspapers are the Shoreham Herald, West Sussex Gazette and The Argus.
&quot;INSIDE Shoreham &amp; Southwick&quot; started in 2005 and is a free A5 magazine that goes to houses in Shoreham and neighbouring Southwick each month and carries articles about local people, local history as well as upcoming events and topics of local interest. It is supported by local businesses who advertise in the publication.

== Sport and leisure ==
Shoreham-by-Sea has a non-League football club, Shoreham FC, who play at Middle Road stadium with a 2,000-seat capacity, and a rugby union club, Shoreham RFC, who play at Buckingham Park.

Southdown Golf Club was founded in 1902, but ceased to operate in the 1940s.

Shoreham is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

The town centre hosts monthly farmers&#x27; and artisans&#x27; markets in East Street on the second and fourth Saturday of the month, respectively, together with the annual &#x27;Light up Shoreham&#x27; Christmas market and event.

== Climate ==
== Airshow crash ==

Most years, in late summer, Shoreham Airport hosts the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA) Shoreham Airshow. On 22 August 2015, a Hawker Hunter jet fighter taking part in the airshow crashed onto the busy A27 road just outside the airport, killing eleven people and injuring several others.

<text>Robert Don Oliver (17 March 1895 – 6 October 1980) was a Royal Navy officer who was appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff.

==Naval career==
Oliver served in World War I taking part in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914, fighting at Gallipoli in 1915 and then undertaking mine-laying off the German and Belgian coast. Promoted to captain, he was given command of HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; in 1939.

He also served in World War II and was commanding HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot;, a heavy cruiser, on 21 November 1941, when he was informed that codebreakers had determined that German U-boats were going to be surfacing near him, to refuel from a merchant raider, the Hilfskreuzer (cruiser) &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Using the intelligence, &quot;Devonshire&quot; sunk &quot;Atlantis&quot;. He later commanded the gunnery school HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; and then the cruiser .

After the War he was appointed Assistant Chief of Naval Staff (Weapons) and then Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in 1946. His last appointment, in 1947, was as Flag Officer commanding the 5th Cruiser Squadron, before he retired on 26 September 1948, and was promoted to vice-admiral on the same day.

In retirement he became Deputy Lieutenant of Roxburghshire.

==Family==
In 1928 he married Torfrida Lois Acantha Huddart; there were no children. Following the death of his first wife, he married Mrs M.J. Glendinning van der Velde in 1965.

<text>The German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis (HSK 2), known to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; as Schiff 16 and to the Royal Navy as Raider-C, was a converted German &quot;Hilfskreuzer&quot; (auxiliary cruiser), or merchant or commerce raider of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, which, in World War II, travelled more than in 602 days, and sank or captured 22 ships with a combined tonnage of 144,384. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was commanded by &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; Bernhard Rogge, who received the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. She was sunk on 22 November 1941 by the British cruiser .

Commerce raiders do not seek to engage warships, but rather attack enemy merchant shipping; the measures of success are tonnage destroyed (or captured) and time spent at large. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was second only to in tonnage destroyed, and had the longest raiding career of any German commerce raider in either world war. She captured highly secret documents from . A version of the story of &quot;Atlantis&quot; is told in the film &quot;Under Ten Flags&quot; with Van Heflin appearing as Captain Rogge.

==Early history==
Built by Bremer Vulkan in 1937, she began her career as the cargo ship &quot;Goldenfels&quot;, owned and operated by DDG Hansa, Bremen. &quot;Goldenfels&quot; was powered by two Six-cylinder Single Cycle Double Action diesel engines, built by Bremer Vulkan. She was allocated the Code Letters DOTP. In late 1939 she was requisitioned by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and converted into a warship by DeSchiMAG, Bremen. In December 1939, she was commissioned as the commerce raider &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

==Design==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; was long and displaced . She had a single funnel amidships. She had a crew of 349 (21 officers and 328 enlisted sailors) and a Scottish terrier, Ferry, as mascot. The cruiser carried a dummy funnel and variable-height masts, and was well supplied with paint, canvas, and materials for further altering her appearance, including costumes for the crew and flags. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was capable of being modified to twenty-six different silhouettes.

===Weapons and aircraft===
The ship was equipped with six guns, one gun on the bow, two twin-37 mm anti-aircraft guns and four 20 mm automatic cannons; all of these were hidden, mostly behind pivotable false deck or side structures. A phony crane and deckhouse on the aft section hid two of the guns; the other four guns were concealed via flaps in the side that were raised when action was imminent. &quot;Atlantis&quot; also had four waterline torpedo tubes, and a 92-mine compartment. This gave her the fire power, and more importantly the fire control, of a light cruiser. The ship also carried two Heinkel He-114C seaplanes in one of its holds, one of these was fully assembled and the other one was packed away in crates. The Heinkel was later replaced at sea with the smaller Arado Ar 196.

===Engines===
&quot;Atlantis&quot; had two 6-cylinder diesel engines, which powered a single propeller. Top speed was and a range of at . Diesel engines allowed her to drift when convenient to conserve fuel, and unlike steam machinery, instantly restart her powerplant.

==Service history==
===Journey to the South Atlantic===
In 1939, she became the command of &quot;Kapitän&quot; Bernhard Rogge. Commissioned in mid-December, she was the first of nine or ten merchant ships armed by Nazi Germany for the purposes of seeking out and engaging enemy cargo vessels. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was delayed by ice until 31 March 1940, when the former battleship was sent to act as an icebreaker, clearing the way for &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, and &quot;Widder&quot;.. Weather information was supplied to &quot;Atlantis&quot; by the weather ships , and .

&quot;Atlantis&quot; headed past the North Sea minefields, between Norway and Britain, across the Arctic Circle, between Iceland and Greenland, and headed south. By this time, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was pretending to be a Soviet vessel named &quot;Kim&quot; by flying the Soviet naval ensign, displaying a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English warnings on the stern, &quot;Keep clear of propellers&quot;. The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.

After crossing the equator, on 24–25 April, she took the guise of the Japanese vessel &quot;Kasii Maru&quot;. The ship now displayed a large K upon a red-topped funnel, identification of the K Line transportation company. She also had rising sun symbols on the gun flaps and Japanese characters (copied from a magazine) on the aft hull.

===&quot;City of Exeter&quot;===
On 2 May, she met the British passenger liner . Rogge, unwilling to cause non-combatant casualties, declined to attack. Once the ships had parted, &quot;Exeter&quot;″s Master radioed his suspicions about the &quot;Japanese&quot; ship to the Royal Navy.

===&quot;Scientist&quot;===

On 3 May, &quot;Atlantis&quot; met a British cargo ship, &quot;Scientist&quot;, which was carrying ore and jute. The Germans raised their battle ensign and displayed signal pennants stating, &quot;Stop or I fire! Don&#x27;t use your radio!&quot; The gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, &quot;QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has ordered me to stop&quot;, and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.

&quot;Scientist&quot; turned to flee, but on the second salvo from &quot;Atlantis&quot; flames exploded from the ship, followed by a cloud of dust and then white steam from the boilers. A British sailor was killed and the remaining 77 were taken as prisoners of war. After failing to sink the ship with demolition charges, &quot;Atlantis&quot; used guns and a torpedo to finish off &quot;Scientist&quot;.

===Cape Agulhas===
Continuing to sail south, &quot;Atlantis&quot; passed the Cape of Good Hope, reaching Cape Agulhas on 10 May. Here she set up a minefield with 92 horned contact naval mines, in a way which suggested that a U-boat had laid them. The minefield was successful, but the deception was foiled and the ship&#x27;s presence revealed by a German propaganda broadcast boasting that &quot;a minefield, sown by a German raider&quot; had sunk no fewer than eight merchant ships, three more were overdue, three minesweepers were involved, and the Royal Navy was not capable of finding &quot;a solitary raider&quot; operating in &quot;its own back yard&quot;. Furthermore, a British signal was sent from Ceylon on 20 May and intercepted by Germany, based on the report from &quot;City of Exeter&quot;, warning shipping of a German raider disguised as a Japanese ship.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; headed into the Indian Ocean disguised as the Dutch vessel MV &quot;Abbekerk&quot;. She received a broadcast—which happened to be incorrect—reporting that &quot;Abbekerk&quot; had been sunk, but retained that identity rather than repainting, as there were several similar Dutch vessels.

===&quot;Tirranna&quot;, &quot;City of Bagdad&quot;, and the &quot;Kemmendine&quot;===
On 10 June 1940, &quot;Atlantis&quot; stopped the Norwegian motor ship &quot;Tirranna&quot; with 30 salvos of fire after a three-hour chase. Five members of &quot;Tirranna&quot;&#x27;s crew were killed and others wounded. Filled with supplies for Australian troops in the Middle East, &quot;Tirranna&quot; was captured and sent to France.

On 11 July, the liner &quot;City of Bagdad&quot; was fired upon at a range of . A boarding party discovered a copy of &quot;Broadcasting for Allied Merchant Ships&quot;, which contained communications codes. &quot;City of Baghdad&quot;, like &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was a former DDG Hansa ship, having been passed to the British after World War I as reparations. A copy of the report sent by &quot;City of Exeter&quot; was found, describing &quot;Atlantis&quot; in minute detail and including a photograph of the similar &quot;Freienfels&quot;, confirming that the &quot;Japanese&quot; identity had not been believed. Rogge had his ship&#x27;s profile altered, adding two new masts.

At 10:09 on 13 July, &quot;Atlantis&quot; encountered another Freighter, &quot;Kemmendine&quot;, which was heading for Burma. The crew on the &quot;Kemmendine&quot; opened fire on &quot;Atlantis &quot;with a 3-inch gun mounted on &quot;Kemmendine&quot;&#x27;s stern. &quot;Atlantis &quot;returned fire, and &quot;Kemmendine&quot; was quickly ablaze. All the crew were taken off &quot;Kemmendine&quot;, and &quot;Kemmendine &quot;was then sunk.

===&quot;Talleyrand&quot; and &quot;King City&quot;===
In August, &quot;Atlantis&quot; sank &quot;Talleyrand&quot;, the sister ship of &quot;Tirranna&quot;. Then she encountered &quot;King City&quot;, carrying coal, which was mistaken for a British Q-Ship due to its erratic maneuvering caused by mechanical difficulties. Three shells from &quot;Atlantis&quot; destroyed &quot;King City&quot;&#x27;s bridge, killing four merchant cadets and a cabin boy. Another wounded sailor later died on the operating table aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

===&quot;Athelking&quot;, &quot;Benarty&quot;, &quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot;, &quot;Durmitor&quot;, &quot;Teddy&quot;, and &quot;Ole Jacob&quot;===
In September, &quot;Atlantis&quot; sank &quot;Athelking&quot;, &quot;Benarty&quot;, and . All of these were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken. In October, the Germans took the Yugoslavian steamboat &quot;Durmitor&quot;, loaded with a cargo of salt. Yugoslavia was neutral at the time, but Captain Rogge was desperate for an opportunity for &quot;Atlantis&quot; to get rid of the POWs that had accumulated on board, so the ship was captured because it had been carrying coal from Cardiff to Oran before its current voyage. Captured documents and 260 POWs were transferred to &quot;Durmitor&quot;, which, with a prize crew of 14 Germans commanded by Lt. Dehnel, was dispatched to Italian-controlled Mogadishu. Lacking sufficient fuel, the &quot;Durmitor&quot; resorted to sails and, after a &quot;hellish&quot; voyage, made landfall in Warsheikh, north of Mogadishu, on 22 November, five weeks after departure.
In the second week of November, two Norwegian tankers: &quot;Teddy&quot; and &quot;Ole Jacob&quot; were seized by &quot;Atlantis&quot;. On both occasions, &quot;Atlantis&quot; presented itself as HMS &quot;Antenor&quot;.

===&quot;Automedon&quot; and her secret cargo===

At about 07:00 on 11 November 1940, &quot;Atlantis&quot; encountered the Blue Funnel Line cargo ship &quot;Automedon&quot; about northwest of Sumatra. At 08:20, &quot;Atlantis&quot; fired a warning shot across &quot;Automedon&quot;″s bow, and her radio officer at once began transmitting a distress call of &quot;RRRR – Automedon – 0416N&quot; (&quot;RRRR&quot; meant &quot;under attack by armed raider&quot;).

At a range of around , &quot;Atlantis&quot; shelled &quot;Automedon&quot;, ceasing fire after three minutes in which she had destroyed her bridge, accommodation, and lifeboats. Six crew members were killed and twelve injured.

The Germans boarded the stricken ship and broke into the strong room, where they found fifteen bags of Top Secret mail for the British Far East Command, including a large quantity of decoding tables, fleet orders, gunnery instructions, and naval intelligence reports. After wasting an hour breaking open the ship&#x27;s safe only to discover &quot;a few shillings in cash&quot;, a search of the &quot;Automedon&quot;″s chart room found a small weighted green bag marked &quot;Highly Confidential&quot; containing the Chief of Staff&#x27;s report to the Commander in Chief Far East, Robert Brooke Popham. The bag was supposed to be thrown overboard if there was risk of loss, but the personnel responsible for this had been killed or incapacitated. The report contained the latest assessment of the Japanese Empire&#x27;s military strength in the Far East, along with details of Royal Air Force units, naval strength, and notes on Singapore&#x27;s defences. It painted a gloomy picture of British land and naval capabilities in the Far East, and declared that Britain was too weak to risk war with Japan.

&quot;Automedon&quot; was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon realised the importance of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired prize vessel &quot;Ole Jacob&quot;, ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in Kobe, Japan, on 4 December 1940.

The mail reached the German Embassy in Tokyo on 5 December. The German Naval attaché Paul Wenneker had the summary of the British plan wired to Berlin, while the original was hand-carried by Kamenz to Berlin via the Trans-Siberian railway. A copy was given to the Japanese, to whom it provided valuable intelligence prior to their commencing hostilities against the Western Powers. Rogge was rewarded for this with an ornate katana; the only other Germans so honoured were Hermann Göring and Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

After reading the captured Chief of Staff report, on 7 January 1941 Japanese Admiral Yamamoto wrote to the Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a death blow; the &quot;Automedon&quot; intelligence on the weakness of the British Empire is thus credibly linked with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack leading to the fall of Singapore.

===At Kerguelen and Africa===
In the Christmas period &quot;Atlantis&quot; was at Kerguelen Island in the Indian Ocean, where she was replenished by the MV Alstertor. There the crewmen did maintenance and replenished their water supplies. The ship&#x27;s complement suffered its first fatality when a sailor, named Bernhard Herrmann, fell while painting the funnel. He was buried in what is sometimes referred to as &quot;the southernmost of all German war graves&quot;.

In late January 1941, off the eastern coast of Africa, &quot;Atlantis&quot; sank the British ship &quot;Mandasor&quot; and captured &quot;Speybank&quot;. Then, on 2 February, the Norwegian tanker &quot;Ketty Brøvig&quot; was relieved of her fuel. The fuel was used not only for the German raider, but also to refuel the German cruiser &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and, on 29 March the Italian submarine &quot;Perla&quot;. &quot;Perla&quot; was making its way from the port of Massawa in Italian East Africa, around the Cape of Good Hope, to Bordeaux in France. Rogge wrote in his memoirs that, after seeing the small coastal submarine and its emaciated crew, he told the commander, Lt. Bruno Napp, his perplexity about his mission and suggested him to reach either Brazil or Argentina to be interned; by his account, Napp politely rejected the advice, telling that he would do his utmost to obey his orders, much to Rogge&#x27;s admiration.

===&quot;Zamzam&quot;===
By April, &quot;Atlantis&quot; had returned to the Atlantic where, on April 17, Rogge mistook the Egyptian liner for a British liner being used as a troop ship or Q-ship. She was in fact the former Bibby Liner &quot;Leicestershire&quot;. &quot;Atlantis&quot; opened fire at a range of . The second salvo hit and the wireless room was destroyed. 202 passengers and about 140 crew were captured. The passengers included missionaries, ambulance drivers, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine editor Charles J.V. Murphy, and &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer David E. Scherman. The Germans let Scherman take photographs. They seized most of his films when the prisoners returned to Europe aboard the German blockade runner , but he smuggled four rolls back to New York. The photos later helped the Royal Navy to identify and destroy &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s account of the incident and Scherman&#x27;s photos appeared in the 23 June 1941 issue of &quot;Life&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Bismarck&quot;===
After the was sunk, the North Atlantic swarmed with British warships. As a result, Rogge decided to abandon the original plan to go back to Germany and instead returned to the Pacific. En route, &quot;Atlantis&quot; encountered and sank the British ships &quot;Rabaul&quot;, &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, &quot;Tottenham&quot;, and &quot;Balzac&quot;. On 10 September 1941, east of New Zealand, &quot;Atlantis&quot; captured the Norwegian motor vessel &quot;Silvaplana&quot;.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; then patrolled the South Pacific, initially in French Polynesia between the Tubuai Islands and Tuamotu Archipelago. Without the knowledge of French authorities, the Germans landed on Vanavana Island and traded with the inhabitants. They then hunted Allied shipping in the area between Pitcairn and uninhabited Henderson islands, making a landing on Henderson Island. The seaplane from &quot;Atlantis&quot; made several fruitless reconnaissance flights. &quot;Atlantis&quot; headed back to the Atlantic on 19 October, and rounded Cape Horn ten days later.

===&quot;U-68&quot;, &quot;U-126&quot;, and HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot;===
On 18 October 1941 Rogge was ordered to rendezvous with the submarine
 south of St. Helena and refuel her, then to refuel at a location north of Ascension Island. &quot;Atlantis&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;U-68&quot; on 13 November, and on 21 or 22 November with &quot;U-126.&quot; The OKM (German Naval High Command) signal instruction sent to &quot;U-126&quot; ordering this rendezvous was intercepted and deciphered by the Allied Enigma code breakers at Bletchley Park and was passed on to the Admiralty, which in turn despatched the heavy cruiser to the rendezvous area.

==Sinking==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; met with U-126 in the early morning on 22 November 1941, and started immediately with refueling and resupplying the U-boat. The captain of &quot;U-126&quot;, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Ernst Bauer, one more of its four officers and six more crewman came aboard &quot;Atlantis.&quot; Usually &quot;Atlantis&quot; would fly off her Arado seaplane to cover the operation, but the seaplane was not operational on this day. They were detected by the scouting Walrus seaplane of &quot;Devonshire&quot;, and the British cruiser surprised the Germans at 08:15. &quot;U-126&quot; dived at once without the missing crewmembers and was not able to mount an attack. The &quot;Devonshire&quot; manoeuvred at high speed in order to avoid possible attacks by the sighted U-boat and kept outside the range of the guns of &quot;Atlantis,&quot; which she could outrange with her larger &quot;&quot; battery. At 08.37 the British cruiser fired two warning salvoes and in response &quot;Atlantis&quot; transmitted a raider report posing as the Dutch ship &quot;Polyphemus&quot;. By 09:34, &quot;Devonshire&quot; had received confirmation this report was false. She fired 30 salvoes and started scoring hits with her third salvo. At 09:58 the fore magazine exploded and at 10:16 the order was given to scuttle the ship. Seven sailors were killed and two more died of their wounds later. After &quot;Devonshire&quot; left the area, &quot;U-126&quot; resurfaced and picked up 300 German sailors and a wounded American prisoner. &quot;U-126&quot; carried or towed rafts towards the still-neutral Brazil ( west). Two days later the German refuelling ship &quot;Python&quot; arrived and took the survivors aboard.

On 1 December, while &quot;Python&quot; was replenishing &quot;U-126&quot; and , another of the British cruisers seeking the raiders, , appeared. &quot;U-126&quot; was in the process of taking on torpedoes and was not operational. The boat could dive but not attack. &quot;UA&quot; launched five torpedoes but missed the British cruiser. The &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; fired two warning shots and &quot;Python&quot;″s crew scuttled her. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; departed, leaving the U-boats to recover the survivors. Each submarine took about 100 survivors aboard, half of them below decks and the other half on deck. 200 survivors were put in ten lifeboats which were towed by the submarines. The two other German submarines and which were also operating in the South-Atlantic were ordered to assist the rescue operation. &quot;U-129&quot; arrived on 3 December and &quot;U-124&quot; arrived two days later. These two U-boats took the people from the lifeboats on board. Then the Germans turned to the Italians for assistance since they also operated submarines in the Atlantic. Between 14 and 18 December in the Cap Verde region the four big Italian submarines , , and took 260 Germans aboard so that all survivors had a place below decks and the U-boats were able to dive again. All eight submarines managed to return safely to St Nazaire, the last one arriving on 29 December.

<doc id="167469" wikidata="Q1141454" url="?curid=167469" title="The Dave Clark Five">
<text>The Dave Clark Five, also known as the DC5, were an English rock and roll band formed in 1958 in Tottenham, London. Drummer Dave Clark was the group&#x27;s leader, producer and co-songwriter. In January 1964, they had their first UK top-ten single, &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, which knocked the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; off the top of the UK Singles Chart. It peaked at No. 6 in the United States in April 1964. Although this was their only UK No. 1, they topped the US chart in December 1965, with their cover of Bobby Day&#x27;s &quot;Over and Over&quot;. Their other UK top-ten hits include &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t You See That She&#x27;s Mine&quot;, &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot;, &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, &quot;The Red Balloon&quot;, &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, and a version of Chet Powers&#x27; &quot;Get Together&quot; (retitled as &quot;Everybody Get Together&quot;).

They were the second group of the British Invasion to appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the United States (for two weeks in March 1964 following the Beatles&#x27; three weeks the previous month). They would ultimately have 18 appearances on the show. The DC5 were one of the most commercially successful acts of the British Invasion, releasing seventeen top-40 hits in the US between 1964 and 1967, including several that did not chart as highly in the UK such as &quot;Because&quot;, &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Everybody Knows (I Still Love You)&quot;, &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;, &quot;Try Too Hard&quot; and &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot;. In 1965, the group starred in a feature film vehicle, &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot;, directed by John Boorman. The group disbanded in early 1970, though Clark and a few former members continued as Dave Clark &amp; Friends until 1973. In 2008, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==

The band had its origins in 1958, as the backing musicians for north London vocalist Stan Saxon. Dave Clark played drums and contributed background vocals, alongside a frequently changing line-up. Clark and guitarist Rick Huxley both participated in the 1958 line-up. Clark and his bandmates eventually split with Saxon and reconstituted themselves as a standalone concern in January 1962, making their home in the South Grove Youth Club in Tottenham, London. After a little more evolution, a lasting ensemble was settled, with Clark on drums, Huxley moving to bass, Lenny Davidson on lead guitar, Denis Payton on saxophone (and harmonica and rhythm guitar), and Mike Smith on keyboards and lead vocals. Davidson&#x27;s previous bands were the Off Beats and the Impalas.

The DC5 was promoted as the vanguard of a &quot;Tottenham Sound&quot;, a response to Liverpool&#x27;s Mersey Beat sound, which featured an often loud and forceful production style driven by Clark&#x27;s punchy drumming, Payton&#x27;s saxophone padding and Smith&#x27;s belting vocals. Dave Clark produced their recordings in collaboration with sound engineer Adrian Kerridge of Lansdowne Studios, with production credited using the pseudonym Adrian Clark. 

Dave Clark was also the group&#x27;s manager, and struck business deals that allowed him to produce the band&#x27;s recordings and gave him control of the master recordings. Songwriting credits for the band&#x27;s original material went to Clark, or more often to the team of Clark and Smith. Clark/Davidson and Clark/Payton compositions were also not uncommon. Session drummer Bobby Graham is also reported to have played on some of the band&#x27;s hits.

The Dave Clark Five had 12 Top 40 hits in the UK between 1964 and 1967, and 17 records in the Top 40 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Their cover of Bobby Day&#x27;s &quot;Over and Over&quot; went to No. 1 in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on Christmas Day 1965, despite less impressive sales in the UK (it peaked at No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart). They made 18 appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; – more than any other British Invasion group.

The band released a film, &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; (directed by John Boorman) in 1965. It starred Barbara Ferris, and was released in the United States as &quot;Having a Wild Weekend&quot;. The short film &quot;Hits in Action&quot; highlighted a series of Dave Clark Five hits.

Other than the songs &quot;Live in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Maze of Love&quot;, &quot;Inside and Out&quot;, &quot;The Red Balloon&quot; and &quot;Lost in His Dreams&quot;, the band did not follow the psychedelic music trend. Their popularity in the US mostly dried up by 1967, though they continued to score hits in Britain for another three years. The Dave Clark Five disbanded in 1970, having had three singles on the UK chart that year, two of which reached the Top Ten. In 1970, Davidson, Huxley and Payton left, and Alan Parker and Eric Ford joined on lead guitar and bass. That line-up, renamed &quot;Dave Clark &amp; Friends&quot;, lasted until 1972.

==Post break-up==
Following the group&#x27;s break-up, Clark set up a media company. In the process, he acquired the rights to the 1960s pop series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. Additionally, he wrote and produced the 1986 London stage musical &quot;Time – The Musical&quot; where he directed the last performance of Sir Laurence Olivier. A two-disc vinyl album was released in conjunction with the stage production featuring music recorded by Julian Lennon (singing DC5&#x27;s song &quot;Because&quot;), Freddie Mercury, Stevie Wonder, Cliff Richard, Ashford &amp; Simpson and Olivier&#x27;s selected dialogue. This double album was digitally remastered and released on iTunes in May 2012.

Mike Smith teamed up with Mike d&#x27;Abo (previously with Manfred Mann) for one album in 1976. He also released a now-scarce CD in 2000 titled &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and returned to performing in 2003 after a hiatus of 25 years. He formed Mike Smith&#x27;s Rock Engine and did two mini-tours of the U.S. He died on 28 February 2008 in a Buckinghamshire hospital from pneumonia, a complication of a paralysing spinal injury sustained from a fall in 2003.

Denis Payton died on 17 December 2006 at the age of 63 after a long battle with cancer. Rick Huxley died from emphysema on 11 February 2013 at the age of 72. Lenny Davidson taught guitar for many years at a school in Cambridgeshire, the county he lives in.

Between 1978 and 1993, none of their music was available to be purchased in any commercial format due to rights-holder Clark declining to license the band&#x27;s recordings. In 1993, a single CD &quot;Glad All Over Again&quot; was produced by Dave himself and released by EMI in Britain. After a 1989 deal with the Disney Channel to rebroadcast the 1960s ITV show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; (which Clark owned), he made a deal with Disney-owned Hollywood Records to issue in 1993 a double CD &quot;History of the Dave Clark Five&quot;. No DC5 material was then legally available until 2008, when the 28-track &quot;The Hits&quot; compilation was released by Universal Music in the UK. In 2009, selections from the band&#x27;s catalogue were released on iTunes. 

In 2014, Dave Clark wrote, produced, appeared in, and partly presented the television documentary &quot;The Dave Clark Five and Beyond: Glad All Over&quot;. Smith also appeared via archival footage and archived interviews, but there was no participation from Lenny Davidson nor were there any archived interviews from the Denis Payton or Rick Huxley. The documentary also featured appearances from Paul McCartney, Whoopi Goldberg, Elton John, and Gene Simmons of Kiss.

In 2019, almost the entire catalogue from the band, including all the original 1960s studio albums, became available on Spotify for the first time. On 24 January 2020, BMG Rights Management, with whom Clark has recently joined forces to reissue the band&#x27;s recordings, released a new DC5 greatest hits CD (titled &quot;All the Hits&quot;, and which was based on the 2008 &quot;The Hits&quot; compilation) in two configurations.

==Induction into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame==
The Dave Clark Five made the list of nominees for the class of 2008, and on 13 December 2007 it was announced that the band would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2008. The group was inducted by Tom Hanks, who wrote, directed and starred in the 1996 film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;, which was about an American one-hit wonder band that became popular in the wake of the British Invasion.

In attendance with the three surviving members of the DC5 were the families of Lenny Davidson and Rick Huxley, and Denis Payton&#x27;s two sons. Mike Smith had planned on attending but died 11 days before the induction. Dave Clark opened up his acceptance speech by saying that he felt like he was at the Oscars. Davidson mentioned that they arrived in New York City for the ceremony on 8 March, exactly 44 years after the group&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

Joan Jett honoured the Dave Clark Five by performing &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; with John Mellencamp&#x27;s band. To perform &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, Jett was joined by John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, Billy Joel and other artists who performed throughout the evening.

<doc id="167471" wikidata="Q11937089" url="?curid=167471" title="Mythologies of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas">
<text>The Indigenous peoples of the Americas comprise numerous different cultures. Each has its own mythologies, many of which share certain themes across cultural boundaries. In North American mythologies, common themes include a close relation to nature and animals as well as belief in a Great Spirit that is conceived of in various ways. As anthropologists note, their great creation myths and sacred oral tradition in whole are comparable to the Christian Bible and scriptures of other major religions.

==Northern America==

There is no single mythology of the Native Americans in the United States, the Indigenous peoples in Canada and other peoples, but numerous different canons of traditional narratives associated with religion, ethics and beliefs. Such stories are deeply based in Nature and are rich with the symbolism of seasons, weather, plants, animals, earth, water, fire, sky, and the heavenly bodies. Common elements are the principle of an all-embracing, universal and omniscient Great Spirit, a connection to the Earth and its landscapes, a belief in a parallel world in the sky (sometimes also underground and/or below the water), diverse creation narratives, visits to the &#x27;land of the dead&#x27;, and collective memories of ancient sacred ancestors.

A characteristic of many of the myths is the close relationship between human beings and animals (including birds and reptiles). They often feature shape-shifting between animal and the human form. Marriage between people and different species (particularly bears) is a common theme. In some stories, animals foster human children.

Although most Native North American myths are profound and serious, some use light-hearted humor – often in the form of tricksters – to entertain, as they subtly convey important spiritual and moral messages. The use of allegory is common, exploring issues ranging from love and friendship to domestic violence and mental illness.

Some myths are connected to traditional religious rituals involving dance, music, songs, and trance (e.g. the Sun Dance).

Most of the myths from this region were first transcribed by ethnologists during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These sources were collected from Native American elders who still had strong connections to the traditions of their ancestors. They may be considered the most authentic surviving records of the ancient stories, and thus form the basis of the descriptions below.

===Northeast (Southeastern Canada and Northeastern US, including the Great Lakes)===
Myths from this region feature female deities, such as the creator, Big Turtle; and First Mother, from whose body grew the first corn and tobacco. The two great divine culture heroes are Glooskap and Manabus.

Other stories explore the complex relationships between animals and human beings. Some myths were originally recited as verse narratives.

* Ho-Chunk mythology - A North American tribe located in now eastern Wisconsin.
* Iroquois mythology - A confederacy of tribes located in the New York state area.
* Lenape mythology
* Seneca mythology - A North American tribe located south of Lake Ontario.
* Wyandot religion - A North American tribe located around the northern shore of Lake Ontario.

===Great Plains===
Stories unique to the Great Plains feature buffalo, which provided the Plains peoples with food, clothing, housing and utensils. In some myths they are benign, in others fearsome and malevolent. The Sun is an important deity; other supernatural characters include Morning Star and the Thunderbirds.

A common theme is the making of a journey, often to a supernatural place across the landscape or up to the parallel world in the sky.

One of the most dominant trickster stories of the Plains is Old Man, about whom numerous humorous stories are told. The Old Man, known as Waziya, lived beneath the earth with his wife, and they had a daughter. Their daughter married the wind and had four sons: North, East, South, and West. The sun, moon and winds then ruled the universe together.

An important supernatural hero is the Blood Clot Boy, transformed from a clot of blood.

* Pawnee mythology

===Southeastern US===
Important myths of this region deal with the origin of hunting and farming, and the origin of sickness and medicine.

An important practice of this region was animism, the belief that all objects, places, and creatures have a soul. Most death, disease, or misfortune would be associated with the failure to put the soul of a slain animal to rest. When this happens, the animal could get vengeance through their &quot;species chief&quot;. Large amounts of rare materials found with this regions dead suggest strong evidence that they believed in a sort of afterlife. It is thought that when a member of a tribe died, their soul would hover over their communities, trying to get their friends and relatives to join them, so their funeral ceremonies were not just to commemorate the dead, but to protect the living.

The Green Corn ceremony, also known as Busk, was an annual celebration of a successful corn crop. Their fires were put out and rekindled, grudges are forgiven, and materials are thrown out or broken to then be replaced. It was essentially a renewing of life and community for these tribes.

==== Cherokee Myth of Creation ====
There was a time when there was no earth, and all creatures lived in a place above the sky called Galvlo’i. Everything below was only water, but when Galvlo’i got too crowded, the creatures decided to send down Water Beetle to see if he could find them a new place to live. He obliged and dove down into the water, all the way to the bottom of the sea, where he picked up a bit of mud and brought it to the surface. Once above the water, the mud spread out in all directions and became an island. The Great Spirit secured the island by attaching cords to it and tying it to the vault in the sky.

Though the land was now stable, the ground was too soft for any of the animals to stand on, so they sent down Buzzard to scope it out. He flew around for some time until he could find a dry enough spot to land, and when he did the flapping of his wings caused the mud to shift. It went down in some places and up in others, creating the peaks, valleys, hills, and mountains of the earth. The rest of the creatures were now able to come down, but they soon realized it was very dark, so they invited the sun to come with them. Everyone was happy except Crawfish, who said his shell turned a bright red because the sun was too close, so they raised the sun seven different times until Crawfish was satisfied.

The Great Spirit then created plants for this new land, after which he told the animals to stay awake for seven days. Only Owl was able to do so, and as a reward, the Great Spirit gave him the gift of sight in the dark. The plants tried as well, but only the pines, firs, holly, and a select few others were able to stay awake, so he gave them the gift of keeping their leaves year-round. Great Spirit then decided he wanted to have people live on this island, so he created one man and one woman. The pair did not yet know how to make children, so the man took a fish and pressed it against the woman&#x27;s stomach, after which she gave birth. They did this for seven days until Great Spirit felt there was enough humans for the time being, and made it so a woman could only give birth once a year.

===Caribbean US===
* Taíno mythologyThis mythology and philosophy expresses the spiritual beliefs of the maritime Maipurean island settlers from the Amazon and/or Arawakan group of peoples. Their lineage and mythologies include having a creator deity as well as endless cyclical spontaneous birth. Immigrating from North East South America, their stories include gods and deity veneration as well as a view beyond that. Some of the philosophies include a concept of reality as illusion; and also that this world is a dream. Some petroglyphs on the islands include references interpreted to suggest galactic or alien life. Today&#x27;s members of the community have established several views of mythology; some indicating ancestor veneration while others focus on deity and spirit veneration. The belief sets indicate the lineage rather than pointing to one absolute truth. A commonality between lineages includes honoring ancestors through cemi/zemi stones; spiritual homes of the lineage, as well as respecting sun and moon spirits. Weather spirits and spirits of the honored dead are also respectfully acknowledged.

===California and Great Basin===
Myths of this region are dominated by the sacred creator/trickster Coyote. Other significant characters include the Sun People, the Star Women and Darkness.

A few of the most distinctive ceremonies of this region were their funeral customs and their commemoration of the dead. When a death occurred, the house in which it happened would be burnt down, and there would sometimes be bans on speaking the name of the dead. Widows would be smeared with pitch and their hair would be cut until the annual mourning releases them. This mourning came to be known as the &quot;burning&quot;, the &quot;cry&quot;, or the &quot;dance of the dead&quot;. During these ceremonies, multiple properties are burned while the tribe dances, chants, and wails, in order to appease the ghosts.

Another common ceremony is one that takes place when adolescents hit puberty. Girls go through a series of grueling tabus when her first period starts but is followed by a celebratory dance when it ends. Boys will undergo an official initiation into the tribe by participating in ceremonies that recount the tribes&#x27; mysteries and myths.

===Southwest ===
Myths of the Navajo, Apache, and Pueblo peoples tell how the first human beings emerged from an underworld to the Earth. According to the Hopi Pueblo people, the first beings were the Sun, two goddesses known as Hard Being Woman &quot;(Huruing Wuhti)&quot; and Spider Woman. It was the goddesses who created living creatures and human beings. Other themes include the origin of tobacco and corn, and horses; and a battle between summer and winter. Some stories describe parallel worlds in the sky and underwater. These peoples went on to kill each other due to Zuni tales.

Multi-sensory experiences also are prominent in Ancestral Pueblo ceremonial rituals; for example, to evoke a paradisiacal realm, Chacoan people would perform sensorial ceremonies by use of exotic artifacts such as turquoise, shell, cacao, copper bells, and macaws.

===Arctic (coastal Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland)===
The myths of this region are strongly set in the landscape of tundra, snow, and ice. Memorable stories feature the winds, the moon, and the giants. Some accounts say that Anguta is the supreme being, who created the Earth, sea and heavenly bodies. His daughter, Sedna created all living things – animals and plants. Sedna is also regarded as the protecting divinity of the Inuit.

===Subarctic (inland northern Canada and Alaska)===
Here some myths reflect the extreme climate and the people&#x27;s dependence on salmon as a major food resource. In imagination, the landscape is populated by both benign and malevolent giants.

===Northwest===
In this region, the dominant sacred trickster is Raven, who brought daylight to the world and appears in many other stories. Myths explore the people&#x27;s relationship with the coast and the rivers along which they traditionally built their towns. There are stories of visits to parallel worlds beneath the sea and up in the sky.

===Aztecs===
The Aztecs, who predominantly inhabited modern-day central Mexico, had a complex system of beliefs based on deities who directly affected the lives of humans, including those who controlled rain, the rising Sun, and fertility. Voluntary human sacrifice was a central piece to the order of the universe and human survival.

The Aztecs viewed people as servants and warriors of the gods, whom were not merciful or generous, but all-powerful beings that needed to be fed and appeased in order to avoid disaster and punishment. Thus, the concept of human sacrifice emerged. This practice was not new and had been used in other cultures such as the Mayans, but the Aztecs made this their main event, so to speak, in their ceremonies. These sacrifices were mainly to appease the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli.

==== Creation Myth ====
According to Aztec belief, the creation of the earth started with a god called Ometeotl, otherwise known as the Dual God, as they were made from the union of Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl, whom the Aztecs believed were the lord and lady of their sustenance. Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl had four children: Xipe Totec, which translates to &quot;the flayed god&quot; in Nahuatl, is associated with the color red. He is the god of the seasons and all things that grow on the earth. Tezcatlipoca, which translates to &quot;smoking mirror&quot;, is associated with the color black. He is the god of the earth and the most powerful of the four children. Quetzalcoatl, which translates to &quot;plumed serpent&quot;, is associated with the color white. He is the god of air. Finally, Huitzilopochtli, which translates to &quot;hummingbird of the south&quot;, is associated with the color blue. He is the god of war.

The four children decided they wanted to create a world with people to live in it. Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli made the first attempt, starting by making fire. This fire became the sun, but only half a sun, because it was not big or bright enough to light their entire world. They then made the first man and woman, which they called Cipactonal and Oxomoco respectively. Their many children were called macehuales, and were to be the farmers of the land. From there they created time, and then the underworld known as
There are many stories of how the age of the fifth and final sun came to be. One story tells of how Tezcatlipoca took flint and used it to make fires to light the world again, before discussing with his brothers what should be done. They decided to make a new sun that feeds on the hearts and blood of humans. To feed it, they made four hundred men and five women. This is where the story goes into different directions. Some say that both Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc wanted their sons to become the new sun, so they each threw their sons into one of the fires created by Tezcatlipoca. Tlaloc waited for the fire to burn out before throwing his son into the embers, so his son became the moon. Quetzalcoatl elected to throw his son directly into the fiery blaze, so he became the fifth and final sun that we see in the sky today. Another story tells of the gathering of the gods at the ancient city of Teotihuacan, to discuss how to make a new sun. A god by the name of Nanahuatzin, god of disease, offered to throw himself into the fire and become the new sun. Being a weak and sickly god, the others thought he should not be the one to do it, and that a stronger and more powerful god should be the sun. 
Tecuciztecatl, a very wealthy god, stepped forward and said he would do it, but was not able to find the courage to jump into the flames. Nanahuatzin, with little hesitation, then threw himself into the fire. Seeing his bravery, Tecuciztecatl decided to jump in too. They were both transformed into suns, but the light was now too bright to see anything, so one of the other gods threw a rabbit at Tecuciztecatl, dimming his light and turning him into the moon. Nanahuatzin, now the new sun, was essentially reborn as Ollin Tonatiuh. The problem they now had was that he would not move from his position in the sky unless the other gods sacrificed their blood for him. So a god by the name of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, lord of dawn, threw a dart at Tonatiuh, but missed. Tonatiuh then threw one back at Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, hitting him in the head and turning him into Itzlacoliuhqui, god of coldness, frost, and obsidian. Realizing that they could not refuse, the other gods offered their bare chests to him, and Quetzalcoatl cut out their hearts with a sacrificial knife. With the blood of the gods, Tonatiuh began to move across the sky in the same pattern that we see to this day. Quetzalcoatl took the clothing and ornaments of the sacrificed gods and wrapped them in bundles, which the people then worshipped.

<text>Gerry and the Pacemakers were an English beat group prominent in the 1960s Merseybeat scene. In common with the Beatles, they came from Liverpool, were managed by Brian Epstein and recorded by George Martin. Their early successes helped make popular the Merseybeat sound and launch the wider British beat boom of the mid-1960s

They were the first act to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart with their first three single releases: &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;, &quot;I Like It&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. This record was not equalled for 20 years, until the mid-1980s success of fellow Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Another of their most famous songs, &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, refers to the River Mersey, which flows past Liverpool and was the title song for the film of the same name. The group also enjoyed some success in North America as part of the British Invasion, with seven of their singles reaching the US top 40, the most popular being &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot;.

Gerry Marsden led the group on and off through the years until his retirement in 2018. Since his death in 2021 his bandmates, from his final lineup of the band, have returned to touring as Gerry&#x27;s Pacemakers, as Marsden requested before he retired. 

== History ==
Marsden formed the group in 1956 with his brother Fred, Les Chadwick, and Arthur McMahon. At the time, Gerry had been working for British Rail as a deliveryman. They rivalled the Beatles early in their career, playing in the same areas of Liverpool. McMahon (known as Arthur Mack) was replaced on piano by Les Maguire around 1961. The group&#x27;s original name was Gerry Marsden and the Mars Bars, but they were forced to change this when the Mars Company, producers of the chocolate Mars bar, complained.

 Epstein later signed them to Columbia Records (a sister label to the Beatles&#x27; label Parlophone under EMI). They began recording in January 1963 with &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;, a song written by Mitch Murray. The song was produced by George Martin and became a number one hit in the UK, the first by an Epstein-managed Liverpool group to achieve this on all charts. &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; was also reluctantly recorded by the Beatles (they eventually convinced Martin to let them release their song &quot;Love Me Do&quot; as a single instead). Both the Pacemakers&#x27; and Beatles&#x27; versions of &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; were recorded at Abbey Road Studios.

Gerry Marsden was quoted as saying:

Gerry and the Pacemakers&#x27; next two singles, Murray&#x27;s &quot;I Like It&quot; and Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, both also reached number one in the UK Singles Chart, the latter recorded instead of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; had been a favourite of Marsden&#x27;s since seeing &quot;Carousel&quot; when he was growing up. It quickly became the signature tune of Liverpool Football Club and, later, other sports teams around the world. The song remains a football anthem. The group narrowly missed a fourth consecutive number one when &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; was kept off the top spot for two weeks in February 1964 by fellow Liverpudlians The Searchers&#x27; &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;.

Gerry and the Pacemakers had the distinction of being the first act to have their first three recordings go to number 1 in the UK charts. Although they never had a number 1 in the United States, they were the second-most successful group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have hits on the United States Billboard pop charts.

Despite this early success, Gerry and the Pacemakers never had another number one single in the UK. Marsden began writing most of their songs, including &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be All Right&quot; and &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, as well as their first and biggest US hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot; (Laurie 3251), which peaked at No. 4.

The band also starred in the early 1965 film, &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; for which Marsden wrote much of the soundtrack. The film was co-written by &quot;Coronation Street&quot; creator and writer Tony Warren and is considered to be their version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

The title song was revived in 1989 as a charity single for an appeal in response to the Hillsborough football crowd disaster, giving Marsden – in association with other Liverpool stars, including Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s Holly Johnson – another British number one.

In the US, their recordings were released by the small New York City record label Laurie in 1963, with which they issued four singles without success. When the Beatles broke through in January 1964, Laurie&#x27;s next regular single release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot; (Laurie 3284) became a big hit and, during 1964, Laurie coupled &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; with &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; (Laurie 3261), and &quot;I Like It&quot; with &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot; (Laurie 3271), with some success. They appeared in the landmark concert film &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, released in December 1964, performing alongside Chuck Berry, The Beach Boys, James Brown and The Rolling Stones.

By late 1965, their popularity was rapidly declining on both sides of the Atlantic. They disbanded either in October 1966 or sometime in early-to-mid-1967, (or perhaps in 1969) with much of their later recorded material never released in the UK. Gerry Marsden maintained a low-key (but popular) career on television, including on TV variety shows and as a regular slot on children&#x27;s television in &quot;The Sooty Show&quot;. He also starred in the West End musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; alongside Derek Nimmo and Anna Neagle.

While working as a solo artist, Gerry Marsden began working with pianist and musical director Jose McLaughlin in 1970. In 1972, Gerry Marsden and McLaughlin reformed the Pacemakers in 1972 with fellow Liverpool musicians Billy Kinsley (bass) and Pete Clarke (drums). Kinsley had previously been a member of The Merseybeats, the Kinsleys, and Rockin&#x27; Horse. (Kinsley would later reunite Rockin&#x27; Horse after leaving the Pacemakers and rename his new group Liverpool Express). Clarke had previously been a member of a band called The Escorts. In April 1973, this second version of the group became the only Merseybeat band to ever record for the John Peel Show on BBC Radio. The tracks from that show have now been included on the album &quot;Gerry and the Pacemakers Live at the BBC&quot;, released on Parlophone Records in October 2018. Since then, Marsden often toured with various lineups of the band on the oldies circuit. By the mid-1980s, Gerry and the Pacemakers toured nine months every year (in the words of David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;) &quot;doing lucrative cabaret gigs and nostalgia rock shows in Europe, North America, and Australia.&quot;

Gerry Marsden returned to #1 in the UK charts twice during the 1980s with re-recordings of two of his hits with the Pacemakers, with all profits going to charity. In 1985 after the Bradford Football Club stadium tragedy in which 56 were killed, he formed a group called the Crowd, which included other musicians, singers, and radio disc jockeys, to produce a new version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster in which 97 Liverpool F.C. fans died, he joined forces with Paul McCartney, the Christians, Holly Johnson, and the production trio Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman on a new version of &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;.

Drummer Freddie Marsden later opened the Pacemaker driving school in Formby after having previously worked for British Telecom during the 1980s. He died on 9 December 2006 in Southport, age 66.

On 15 March 2017, Gerry Marsden collapsed onstage due to a sore knee while performing at a concert in Newport, Wales. After being helped offstage, Marsden did not return but was quoted as saying the incident was &quot;nothing serious&quot;.

Gerry Marsden announced his retirement on 29 November 2018, in order to spend more time with family, but, on 6 June 2019, to commemorate Liverpool&#x27;s win against Tottenham in the Champions League, he surprised Take That fans by singing &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; at their show at Anfield.

Original bass player Les Chadwick died on 26 December 2019. (After the original lineup broke up during the 1960s, Chadwick moved to Australia.)

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gerry Marsden released a new version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; in tribute to the National Health Service.

Marsden died on 3 January 2021 at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside, after being diagnosed with a blood infection in his heart. He was 78 years old.

Les Maguire, the last surviving member of the classic 1960s lineup, died on 25 November 2023. (Some time after the original lineup split during the 1960s, Maguire joined the Royal Navy, where he was still serving and employed during 1985.)

== Liverpool F.C. ==
Gerry and the Pacemakers song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; was adopted by the Liverpool F.C. as an anthem.

The chart-topping song quickly gained popularity within the Liverpool community and became the Reds football anthem shortly thereafter. 

Gerry Marsden gave Liverpool manager Bill Shankly a copy of the single during a pre-season trip in 1963, the manager said to have been in awe of the song. Since then, the song has been played prior to every Liverpool home game at Anfield, with the club also eventually adding You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone to its coat of arms and using the phrase as an official motto. The sea of red scarves raised by Liverpool fans in The Kop as they blast out their anthem pre-game has become one of the most iconic images in the sport of football.

<text>Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow or Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow) are a British rock band formed in Hertford in 1975 by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Established in the aftermath of Blackmore&#x27;s first departure from Deep Purple, they originally featured four members of the American rock band Elf, including their singer Ronnie James Dio, but after their self-titled debut album, Blackmore fired these members, except Dio, recruiting drummer Cozy Powell, bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboardist Tony Carey. This line-up recorded the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Rising&quot; (1976), while &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1978) saw Bob Daisley and David Stone replace Bain and Carey, respectively. &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was also the last album with Dio before he left the band to join Black Sabbath in 1979.

Rainbow&#x27;s early work primarily used mystical lyrics with a hard rock/heavy metal style, then went in a more pop-rock oriented direction following Dio&#x27;s departure from the group. In 1979, Blackmore and Powell revamped the group, recruiting three new members—singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey and another then-former Deep Purple member, bassist Roger Glover—and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; from their fourth studio album &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. With Joe Lynn Turner, who replaced Bonnet in 1980, Rainbow recorded three more albums—&quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; (1981), &quot;Straight Between the Eyes&quot; (1982) and &quot;Bent Out of Shape&quot; (1983)—that had commercial success similar to the band&#x27;s previous albums. Other members of the band during this period were drummers Bobby Rondinelli and Chuck Burgi and keyboardist David Rosenthal. The band split in 1984, when Blackmore and Glover re-joined Deep Purple. In 1993, after leaving Deep Purple for a second time, Blackmore reformed Rainbow with a new line-up, fronted by a then-unknown Doogie White, which recorded their eighth and last studio album to date &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot; (1995). Blackmore&#x27;s change in direction, from rock to Renaissance and medieval-influenced music, led to Rainbow&#x27;s second dissolution in 1997. He revived the band once again in 2015, and they performed live occasionally until 2019. Rainbow have since been on an indefinite hiatus.

Over the years Rainbow went through many personnel changes, with each studio album recorded with a different line-up, leaving Blackmore as the band&#x27;s only constant member. Their longest serving lineup—which featured Blackmore on guitar, Blackmore&#x27;s wife Candice Night on backing vocals, Ronnie Romero on lead vocals, Bob Nouveau on bass, David Keith on drums and Jens Johansson on keyboards—lasted from 2015 to 2023, when Romero announced his departure from the band.

Rainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. The band has sold over 28 million records worldwide.

==History==
===Formation (1975)===

In 1973, Blackmore steered Deep Purple through a significant personnel change, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover being replaced by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. However, the new members were keen to add their own musical influences into the band&#x27;s sound, some of which were not to Blackmore&#x27;s taste. During the sessions for the 1974 album &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, Blackmore found his request to record the Steve Hammond-penned &quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot; turned down by the band. On the subsequent tour, Deep Purple were supported by American band Elf, with Blackmore being especially impressed by their singer Ronnie James Dio. Still wishing to put his interpretation of &quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot; to record, he decided to record the song as a single, accompanied by four members of Elf, Dio, bassist Craig Gruber, drummer Gary Driscoll, and keyboardist Mickey Lee Soule. The sessions went so well that a full album began to take shape, with Blackmore and Dio collaborating on original songs. The album, &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, was recorded between February and March 1975 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The band name was inspired by the Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, California.

The style was partly inspired by classical music since Blackmore had started playing cello to help him construct interesting chord progressions, and Dio&#x27;s lyrics reflected medieval themes and imagery. Dio possessed a powerful and versatile vocal range that encompassed hard rock and lighter ballads. Blackmore commented that when he heard Dio sing, &quot;I felt shivers down my spine.&quot; Although Dio never played a musical instrument on any Rainbow album, he is credited with writing and arranging the music with Blackmore, in addition to writing all the lyrics. Blackmore and Dio also found a common ground in their sense of humour. The band, said the singer, &quot;was my opportunity to show my wares. I thank Ritchie for that all the time. Ritchie Blackmore is the one who gave me my opportunity to show what I was worth.&quot;

Following the positive experience of recording with Dio, Blackmore decided to leave Deep Purple, playing his last show with them in Paris in April 1975. The album met a positive critical reception and was a top 20 UK and top 30 US hit. Blackmore&#x27;s departure from Purple was announced on 21 June.

===First world tour and initial success (1975–1978)===

The album line-up never played live together as Blackmore was unhappy with Driscoll&#x27;s R&amp;B influenced style of drumming and the funky bass playing of Gruber. While rehearsing for the tour, Blackmore decided to fire Gruber and bring in Jimmy Bain on bass, and after that he also fired Driscoll. As a consequence of that, Soule decided to quit the band to play on a Roger Glover album and tour with the Ian Gillan Band. 

Blackmore would continue to dictate personnel for the remainder of the band&#x27;s lifetime, with drummer and former bandmate Ricky Munro remarking &quot;he was very difficult to get on with because you never knew when he would turn around and say &#x27;You&#x27;re sacked&#x27;.&quot; Blackmore recruited bassist Jimmy Bain, keyboard player Tony Carey and drummer Cozy Powell, who had previously worked with Jeff Beck and had some solo success. Powell also greatly appealed to Blackmore in their mutual fondness for practical jokes.

This line-up commenced the first world tour for the band, with the first date in Montreal on 10 November 1975. The centrepiece of the band&#x27;s live performance was a computer-controlled rainbow including 3,000 lightbulbs, which stretched 40 feet across the stage. In 1976, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to Rainbow, and a second album, &quot;Rising&quot;, was recorded in February at Musicland. By the time of the European dates in the summer of 1976, Rainbow&#x27;s reputation as a blistering live act had been established. The band added Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Mistreated&quot; to their setlist, and song lengths were stretched to include improvisation, as displayed on the live album &quot;On Stage&quot;, released in the summer of 1977. Carey recalls rehearsing the material was fairly straightforward, saying &quot;We didn&#x27;t work anything out, except the structure, the ending ... very free-form, really progressive rock.&quot; The album art was designed by American fantasy artist Ken Kelly, who had drawn Tarzan and Conan the Barbarian.

In August 1976, following a gig at Newcastle City Hall, Blackmore decided to fire Carey, believing his playing style to be too complicated for the band. Unable to find a suitable replacement on such short notice, Carey was quickly reinstated, but as the world tour progressed on to Japan, he found himself regularly being the recipient of Blackmore&#x27;s pranks and humour. Blackmore subsequently decided that Bain was substandard and fired him in January 1977. Carey quit the band shortly after, after getting tired of Blackmore&#x27;s pranks. Blackmore, however, had difficulty finding replacements he liked. On keyboards, after auditioning several high-profile artists, including Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s Mark Stein, Procol Harum&#x27;s Matthew Fisher and ex-Curved Air and Roxy Music man Eddie Jobson, Blackmore finally selected Canadian David Stone, from the little-known band Symphonic Slam. For a bass player, Blackmore initially chose Mark Clarke, formerly of Jon Hiseman&#x27;s Colosseum and Uriah Heep, but once in the studio for the next album, &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Blackmore disliked Clarke&#x27;s fingerstyle method of playing so much that he fired him on the spot and played bass himself on all but three songs: &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Kill the King&quot;, and &quot;Sensitive to Light&quot;. Former Widowmaker bassist Bob Daisley was hired to finish the album, completing the band&#x27;s next line-up.

After the release of &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and its extensive world tour in 1978, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new, more mainstream direction, away from the &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; themes. Dio did not agree with this change and left the band.

In a 1979 interview with Sounds, Blackmore said:


===Commercial success (1978–1984)===

Blackmore asked Ian Gillan, also formerly of Deep Purple, to replace Dio, but Gillan turned him down. After a series of auditions, Graham Bonnet, former singer/guitarist of The Marbles, was recruited. Powell stayed, but Daisley was fired, and Stone quit the band to be replaced by Powell&#x27;s former bandmate Don Airey. At first the band auditioned bass players, rehearsing with Clive Chaman when Stone was still in the band, and later with Jack Green, but, at Cozy Powell&#x27;s suggestion, Blackmore hired another former Deep Purple member, Roger Glover, as a producer, bassist and lyricist. The resulting album, &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, featured the band&#x27;s first major singles chart successes, &quot;All Night Long&quot; and the Russ Ballard-penned &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. In 1980, the band headlined the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in England. However, this was Powell&#x27;s last Rainbow gig: he had already given his notice to quit, disliking Blackmore&#x27;s increasingly pop rock direction. Then, after numerous fallouts with Blackmore, Bonnet resigned to pursue a solo project.

For the next album, Bonnet and Powell were replaced by Americans Joe Lynn Turner and Bobby Rondinelli, respectively. The title track from &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; was a version of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. The album spawned their most successful UK single, &quot;I Surrender&quot; (another Ballard song), which reached No.3. After the supporting tour, Don Airey quit over musical differences and was replaced by David Rosenthal.

The band attained significant airplay on Album-oriented rock radio stations in the US with the track &quot;Jealous Lover&quot;, reaching No. 13 on Billboard Magazine&#x27;s Rock Tracks chart. Originally issued as the B-side to &quot;Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, &quot;Jealous Lover&quot; subsequently became the title track to an EP issued in the US that featured similar cover art to &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;.

Rainbow&#x27;s next full-length studio album was &quot;Straight Between the Eyes&quot;. The album was more cohesive than &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;, and had more success in the United States. The band, however, was alienating some of its earlier fans with its more AOR sound. The single &quot;Stone Cold&quot; was a ballad that had some chart success (No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Rock Tracks chart) and its video received heavy airplay on MTV. The successful supporting tour skipped the UK completely and focused on the American market. A date in San Antonio, Texas on this tour was filmed, and the resulting &quot;Live Between the Eyes&quot; also received repeated showings on MTV, and was released on home video.

&quot;Bent Out of Shape&quot; saw drummer Rondinelli fired in favour of former Brand X and Balance drummer Chuck Burgi. The album featured the single &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, which became another AOR hit for the group. Blackmore claims on his website that the song&#x27;s video was banned by MTV for its supposedly controversial hypnosis theme, but Dr. Thomas Radecki of the National Coalition on Television Violence criticised MTV for airing the video, contradicting Blackmore&#x27;s claim. The following tour saw Rainbow return to the UK, and also to Japan in March 1984 where the band performed &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; with a full orchestra. The concert was also filmed and released on home video as &quot;Japan Tour &#x27;84&quot;.

===Dissolution and temporary revival (1984–1997)===

During the early 1980s, Rainbow&#x27;s management Thames Talent had co-ordinated attempts to reform Deep Purple Mark II. By April 1984, Blackmore and Glover had committed to the reunion, and Rainbow was disbanded. A then-final Rainbow album, &quot;Finyl Vinyl&quot;, was released in 1986. A double live album covering the band&#x27;s whole history, it also includes three stray studio B-sides, &quot;Weiss Heim&quot; (&quot;All Night Long&quot; B-side), &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (&quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; B-side), and &quot;Jealous Lover&quot; (&quot;Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; B-side).

In 1988, after joining the band Impelliteri, Graham Bonnet covered &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; on the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Stand In Line&quot;.

In 1993, Blackmore left Deep Purple again due to &quot;creative differences&quot; with other members, and reformed Rainbow with all-new members featuring Scottish singer Doogie White. The band released &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot; in 1995, and embarked on a lengthy world tour.

The tour proved successful, and the show in Düsseldorf, Germany, was professionally filmed for the &quot;Rockpalast&quot; TV show. This show, initially heavily bootlegged (and considered by many collectors to be the best Rainbow bootleg of the era), was officially released by Eagle Records on CD and DVD as &quot;Black Masquerade&quot; in 2013. The live shows featured frequent changes in set lists, and musical improvisations that proved popular with bootleggers and many shows are still traded over a decade later.

However, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner Candice Night as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced Blackmore&#x27;s Night. Around the same time as production of &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot; (1995), they were already gearing up their debut album &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; (1997).

===Split (1997–2014)===

Many Rainbow songs have been performed live by former members of the band since the group&#x27;s split in 1984 and then in 1997, particularly former frontmen Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White in recent years. Also, Don Airey often plays 1979-1981 era songs during his solo shows. Blackmore&#x27;s Night occasionally performs one or two Rainbow songs live, namely &quot;Ariel&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Eyes&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Temple of the King&quot;. The latter three were also re-recorded by Blackmore&#x27;s Night in studio.

In 2002–2004, the Hughes Turner Project played a number of Rainbow songs at their concerts. On 9 August 2007, Joe Lynn Turner and Graham Bonnet played a tribute to Rainbow show in Helsinki, Finland. The concert consisted of songs from the 1979-1983 era.

In 2009, Joe Lynn Turner, Bobby Rondinelli, Greg Smith and Tony Carey created the touring tribute band Over the Rainbow with Jürgen Blackmore (Ritchie&#x27;s son) as the guitarist. Over the Rainbow performed songs from every era of the band&#x27;s history. After the first tour, Tony Carey had to leave the band due to health concerns; he was replaced by another former Rainbow member, Paul Morris. Plans for the band to record original material were scrapped and Over the Rainbow was formally disbanded in 2011.

===Revival (2015–present)===

In 2015, Blackmore announced that he would play &quot;all rock&quot; concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, his first rock shows since 1997. The new Rainbow lineup was announced on 6 November 2015. It featured Lords of Black singer Ronnie Romero, Stratovarius keyboardist Jens Johansson, Blackmore&#x27;s Night drummer David Keith and bassist Bob Nouveau.

The band headlined the German edition of the &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; festival. They debuted on 17 June 2016 at Loreley Freilichtbühne, an open-air show in front of an audience of an estimated 15,000. On 18 June, they played another open-air gig for 30,000 fans in Bietigheim-Bissingen (Festplatz am Viadukt). The third and final show took place at the Birmingham Genting Arena in England. A live album and DVD, &quot;Memories in Rock&quot;, was released in late 2016.

When asked in May 2016 if Rainbow were planning to record a new studio album, bassist Bob Curiano said, &quot;I&#x27;d love to go into the studio with this Rainbow. All we need is Ritchie to say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go!&#x27; I think all of us feel under pressure, because of the fans&#x27; expectations. For me, the pressure makes me work harder and get better results.&quot; However, Blackmore said that they had no plans for a new album or world tour, and that the reunion was &quot;just a few dates for fun.&quot; Blackmore also said that Rainbow had received many offers to do a &quot;few more shows again&quot; in the future.

Despite an earlier decision not to release new music, Blackmore revealed in a May 2017 interview with &quot;Burrn!&quot; magazine that Rainbow were in the studio recording two new tracks. Blackmore stated, &quot;I wrote one new song, and also recorded one of the old ones. Ronnie, who is in Madrid now, added his vocals and sent it back. Rather than make an album, we may release as singles.&quot;

Rainbow embarked on a four-date UK tour in June 2017. It kicked off with the band&#x27;s first show in London since 1995 at the second annual Stone Free Festival at The O2, followed by shows in Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham; the Manchester show was cancelled following the Manchester Arena bombing.

Rainbow released another live album and DVD, &quot;Memories in Rock II&quot; in 2018, which chronicles a live show in Germany. The final track on the album, &quot;Waiting for a Sign&quot;, is a studio track recorded with the current band lineup, and marked Rainbow&#x27;s first song in 23 years. The band played five dates in April 2018, at Moscow, St Petersburg, Helsinki, Berlin, and Prague. The shows were well-attended, with Helsinki a sell-out. The set-list again varied from night-to-night, with an almost 50/50 selection of Rainbow and Deep Purple songs. Rainbow released another single, &quot;The Storm&quot;, in May 2019, which was &quot;a rocked-up remake&quot; of Blackmore&#x27;s Night&#x27;s 2001 song with the same title, and the band resumed touring in Europe that summer.

The future of Rainbow has been uncertain since wrapping up their 2019 European tour. When asked in November 2020 about the current status of the band, Romero said, &quot;Obviously, nothing&#x27;s gonna happen next year. And Ritchie and Candice, they&#x27;re really focused on the new Blackmore&#x27;s Night record. So probably if everything comes back to normality in the next few years, probably we&#x27;ll do some more shows. But at the moment, everything is on standby.&quot; In April 2022, Romero claimed that he had kept in contact with the remaining members of Rainbow, but again expressed his doubt that the band would ever tour again or record new music: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s gonna be any plan in the near future because the pandemic was way complicated, obviously, for all the music business. And now it&#x27;s like everything is getting back to normal but delayed two years. So there is a lot of shows happening. And until it gets completely back to normal, it&#x27;s gonna happen at least a couple of years. So I think Ritchie is not too much into the idea to make anything so far. And he is focused right now with Blackmore&#x27;s Night — they released an album recently, I think. There&#x27;s no plan so far; we were not informed about any plan. So we&#x27;re just waiting for… With Ritchie, you never know — maybe in a couple of days he&#x27;s gonna come with an idea. You never know.&quot; In October 2023, Romero effectively confirmed his departure from the band by stating that Rainbow was &quot;not his place anymore&quot; while speaking positively of his time in the group.

<text>The Am5x86 processor is an x86-compatible CPU announced in November 1995 by AMD for use in 486-class computer systems. It began shipping in December 1995, with a base price of $93 per unit in bulk quantities. Before being released, it was in development under the codename &quot;X5&quot;.

== Specifications ==
The Am5x86 (also known as the 5x86-133, Am5x86, X5-133, and sold under various 3rd-party labels such as the Kingston Technology &quot;Turbochip&quot;) is an Enhanced Am486 processor with an internally set multiplier of 4, allowing it to run at 133 MHz on systems without official support for clock-multiplied DX2 or DX4 486 processors. Like all Enhanced Am486, the Am5x86 featured write-back L1 cache, and unlike all but a few, a generous 16 kilobytes rather than the more common 8 KB. A rare 150 MHz-rated OEM part was also released by AMD.

Since having a clock multiplier of four is not part of the original Socket 3 design (and that the 486 only have a single CLKMUL pin anyway), AMD made the 5x86 accept a 2x setting from the motherboard and instead operate at a rate of 4x. When using an Am5x86, the motherboard must be set to the 2x setting. The chip will actually physically fit into an older 486 socket such as a socket 1 or 2 or the original 168-pin 80486 socket, but doing this requires a replacement voltage regulator, since the AMD chip runs at 3.45 volts.

The combination of clock speed and the relatively large 16 KB write-back L1 cache allows the 5x86 to equal or slightly exceed an Intel Pentium 75 MHz processor in integer arithmetic in benchmarks. Real world performance varies, however, with later Windows operating systems and many FPU-sensitive games favoring the Pentium 75 MHz. Because it is based on a pure 486 design, it is compatible with older systems, something its slightly faster rival, the Cyrix Cx5x86, has trouble with. The CPU is commonly overclocked to 160 MHz, thereby giving performance similar to that of a Pentium 90 MHz system. There are four main versions of the socketed version of this CPU, manufactured in different locations. There is the common ADW variety, as well as the later ADY, ADZ and BGC. The later models were the preferred versions of the chip, because they were rated for higher temperatures and thus more forgiving of overclocking.

The Am5x86 made the first-ever use of the controversial PR rating. Because the 5x86 is the equal of a Pentium 75 MHz processor in benchmarks, AMD later marketed the chip as &quot;Am5x86-P75&quot;.

Sales of the Am5x86 were an important source of revenue for AMD at a time when lengthy delays in bringing the AMD K5 to production were threatening the company&#x27;s profitability.

AMD manufactured the Am5x86 processor for ordinary PC systems until 1999. It was popular for entry-level desktop systems, appeared in many different notebook models, and also sold separately as an upgrade processor for older 486 systems. Several companies made upgrade kits with an AMD 5x86 with a voltage regulator and socket converter, which allows its use on virtually every socketed 486 motherboard ever produced. Several companies also provided upgrades for older 486 notebooks by replacing soldered 486 CPUs. The chips were even used on later Acorn RiscPC &quot;PC card&quot; second processors. The RiscPC&#x27;s OpenBus memory interface was only 32 bit, which meant that the Pentium could not be easily interfaced to it. Intel&#x27;s expensive Pentium Overdrive for 486 systems is a troublesome CPU, with many compatibility issues, and so is not used. The 5x86 therefore provided the acme of RiscPC Windows performance.

The chip remained in production for a long time, as it was a popular choice for use in embedded controllers. One derivative of the 5x86 family is the core used in the AMD Élan SC520 family of SoC 00200microcontrollers marketed by AMD. This powers the original Cisco PIX 501 model.

<doc id="167483" wikidata="Q5167739" url="?curid=167483" title="Cooper A-2 jacket">
<text>The Cooper A-2 (flight jacket or flying jacket) is a leather jacket, made by Cooper Sportswear, from sheepskin worn by United States Army Air Forces and United States Air Force pilots, during World War II. It was replaced after World War Two by nylon versions of the jacket, though it continued to be worn operationally during the Korean War by World War II veterans called back into service. It was re-introduced by the military just prior to Operation Desert Shield, with a modification to allow for modern insignia on the front of the jacket, and has been in service ever since.

Key features of a military-specification jacket (as opposed to a civilian version) are one-piece back (some knock-off jackets have a seam across the shoulder blades; this seam causes discomfort during long flights in a confined position) and lack of side-entry hand-warmer pockets under the large snap-down patch pockets (apparently, the military designers did not want their pilots to be seen standing around with their hands in their pockets and believed that a lack of hand-warmer pockets would force pilots to be more productive and appear more professional) and no interior pocket.

Other key features include horsehide or goatskin leather for the shell, dual-knit waist and wrist cuffs, full-length brass zipper, two brass grommets under each armpit for ventilation, a metal hook under the collar to fasten the top of the opening, and a snap-down collar, so the tips won&#x27;t blow around from propwash and jetwash. Seams on the arms of the jacket run along the backside of the pattern so as not to interfere with the movement of the arms along the sides of the torso in confined spaces. Military specifications did not provide for insulation of the A-2 model.

New-build A-2s for USAF members include a velcro patch on the left breast for removable insignia, whereas World War Two models had a thin 1-inch high by 4-inch long leather name tag sewn or glued directly to the leather jacket.

Cooper Sportswear ceased production in the late 1990s, and retailer inventories were exhausted some time afterwards. Even though the A-2 is still a military-requisitioned item and contracts have been awarded to other USA suppliers using the A-2 pattern, the Cooper label is considered collectible and highly sought after by World War II re-enactors and historians. A vintage Cooper A-2 in excellent condition can be worth more than the market rate of a new-build A-2 from a current manufacturer. While original Cooper jackets are no longer in production, reproductions of Cooper jackets are being manufactured by Ohio-based US Wings Inc. US Wings was partnered with Cooper Sportswear from the 1980s until Cooper ceased production in the 1990s and now owns the rights to the Cooper name. US Wings is reproducing Cooper A-2s, G-1s and Indy Jackets under their Cooper Originals line with a label reminiscent of the original Cooper Sportswear label.

<text>Utah Lake is a shallow freshwater lake in the center of Utah County, Utah, United States. It lies in Utah Valley, surrounded by the Provo-Orem metropolitan area. The lake&#x27;s only river outlet, the Jordan River, is a tributary of the Great Salt Lake. Evaporation accounts for 42% of the lake&#x27;s outflow, which leaves the lake slightly saline. The elevation of the lake is at above sea level. If the lake&#x27;s water level rises above that, the pumps and gates on the Jordan River are left open. Recently the lake has been at a lower level because of a drought.
The first European to see Utah Lake was Father Silvestre Vélez de Escalante in 1776. He stayed with the Timpanogots band of Ute Tribe for three days. Mormon settlers later settled near the lake beginning in 1849, with the Timpanogots becoming mostly displaced from the area by 1872. The native fish species of the lake were overharvested by the settlers and subsequently restocked with non-native species.

Although thirteen species of fish were native to the lake, only the Utah sucker and the previously critically endangered, now threatened, June sucker remain. The dominant species in the lake is the common carp, introduced in 1883 as an alternative to the overharvested native fish. The carp is now estimated at 90% of the biomass of the lake and contributes to a decline in native fish populations by severely altering the ecosystem. Pollution has also caused problems with the lake&#x27;s ecosystem. Raw sewage was dumped into the lake as late as 1967. Pollution problems still remain; the lake&#x27;s phosphorus and mineral salt levels are in violation of the Clean Water Act. In recent years, the lake has been prone to harmful algal blooms or HABs.

Utah Lake is managed cooperatively by the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire &amp; State Lands and the Utah Lake Authority. The Division manages public use and issues a permit for commercial users of the lakebed and shoreline while the Commission facilitates development. The lakebed and surrounding shoreline are made up of State Sovereign Lands. Utah Lake is one of three lakes in the state that were deemed &quot;navigable&quot; at statehood and granted to the State of Utah. Sovereign lands are managed under the public trust doctrine.

The Utah State Legislature has designated the Division of Forestry, Fire &amp; State Lands as the executive authority for the management of sovereign lands and the state&#x27;s mineral estates on lands other than school and institutional trust lands. Sovereign lands are defined by the Utah State Legislature as &quot;those lands lying below the ordinary high water mark of navigable bodies of water at the date of statehood and owned by the state by virtue of its sovereignty.&quot;

The Commission was created by State statute in Utah&#x27;s 2007 General Legislative Session, House Concurrent Resolution 1, under the authority of the Interlocal Cooperation Act. The Commission is funded and empowered by 17 area governments, including; Utah County and its municipalities, the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, and three state agencies. Founded in 2007, the Commission seeks to promote multiple public uses of the lake, facilitate orderly planning and development in and around the lake, and enable individual Commission members to govern their own areas.

==Name==
European explorers initially called the lake &quot;Lake Timpanogos&quot; after the Timpanogos band of the Shoshone tribe. An 1827 letter written by American explorer Jedidiah Strong Smith contains the earliest known reference to &quot;Utah&quot; as the name of the lake. The precise origin of the name &quot;Utah Lake&quot; is unknown. One possible explanation is that it was named for the abundant reeds in and around the lake, called &quot;Eu-tah&quot;. Another explanation is that it was incorrectly named after the Ute Tribe (Timpanogos are often incorrectly referred to as Ute).

==Geography==
Utah Lake is within Utah Valley in north-central Utah. Mountains surround Utah Valley on three sides: the Wasatch Range to the east, Traverse Mountains to the north, and the Lake Mountains to the west. Mount Nebo reaches an altitude of , and Mount Timpanogos reaches an altitude of , nearly above the valley floor. Jutting into the south portion of the lake is West Mountain, which divides Goshen Bay and Lincoln Beach. Utah Lake is situated on the western edge of the valley and covers more than 25% of Utah Valley&#x27;s floor. Because of its location on the western side of the valley, the eastern shore has a gentle slope and the western shore rises abruptly against the Lake Mountains. Connected to the main body of the lake are two large, shallow bays: the aforementioned Goshen Bay (north Goshen Valley) to the south and Provo Bay to the east. Major cities such as Provo and Orem are located between the lake&#x27;s eastern shore and the Wasatch Range.

Utah Lake is a remnant of a much larger pleistocene lake called Lake Bonneville, which existed from 75,000 to 8,000 years ago. At its peak 30,000 years ago, Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of , which was nearly as large as Lake Michigan. The weight of the lake depressed sections of the lake bottom by as much as before the surface rebounded when the lake dried up. About 12,000 years ago, the climate of the region became warmer and drier. As evaporation rates exceeded inflow rates, the lake began to dry up, leaving Utah Lake, the Great Salt Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake as remnants.
Over the roughly 65,000 years that Lake Bonneville existed, sediments built up, creating a lacustrine plain over Utah Valley. As a result, the valley floor and lake bed are relatively flat, which causes the lake to be shallow. The lake has a maximum depth of just under and an average depth of about . This shallowness allows winds to easily stir up sediments from the lake&#x27;s bottom, contributing to the turbidity or the impression of pollution seen in Utah Lake&#x27;s water.

Three faults run under Utah Lake. One of the faults, the Bird Island fault, runs under the eastern edge of the lake and helps give rise to hot springs near Lincoln Beach. The other major hot spring is on the northern shore and is called Saratoga Springs. The hot springs mostly result from the development of hydraulic pressure as the ground water slopes toward the middle of the lake.

The lake contains a small island called Bird Island, about north of the Lincoln Beach boat ramp, near its south end. The island has a few trees and is somewhat visible from Lincoln Beach. During high-water years, the island may be completely submerged, the trees being the only indication it is there. It is a fairly popular destination among fishermen seeking walleye, white bass, and channel catfish.

==Hydrology==

The Utah Lake watershed drains over mostly mountainous terrain. The watershed&#x27;s highest point is at Bald Mountain in the Uinta Mountains. (32%) are managed by the United States Forest Service, (11%) are managed by other government entities, and the majority of the rest, (51%), are privately owned.

Two major tributaries account for nearly 60% of inflow by streams or rivers into Utah Lake. The Provo River accounts for 36% of the inflow, and the Spanish Fork river accounts for 24%. Other tributaries include the American Fork river, Current Creek, Dry Creek, Hobble Creek, and Mill Race Creek. Additionally, many hot springs and smaller creeks are flowing into the lake. Utah Lake is drained by the Jordan River, which begins at the lake&#x27;s north end. The river flows north through Utah, Salt Lake, and Davis counties and then into the southeast portion of the Great Salt Lake. Given the lake&#x27;s semi-arid climate, large surface area, and shallow average depth, evaporation accounts for 42% of Utah Lake&#x27;s outflow.
After several years of drought, irrigation companies argued over their share of Utah Lake&#x27;s water from the Jordan River. Judge Morse of the Third District Court issued his judgment known as the Morse Decree of 1901. The decree stated that the irrigation companies &quot;are entitled to a decree awarding to them, subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, the right to the use of all the balance of the waters of the Jordan River, for municipal, irrigation, culinary, and domestic purposes, to the extent of the capacity of their several canals, and the right to impound and store all of the waters of said river in Utah Lake.&quot; In response to the drought, a pumping plant was installed at the outlet of the Jordan River from Utah Lake. It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time. The plant contained seven pumps with a total capacity of per second. After the decree was released, Utah Lake essentially became an irrigation reservoir, and the Jordan River&#x27;s flow was highly regulated.

As a result of the 1983–1984 flooding, a lawsuit was filed for compensation due to flooding based upon breach of contract of the previous compromise level. In 1985, a new compromise level was reached, which governed the maximum level of the lake. The new level was chosen to be above sea level. When the water level in Utah Lake exceeds this level, the Jordan River pumps and gates are left open. The new compromise level also meant that the lake&#x27;s elevation was below Jordan River&#x27;s stream bed.

===Pollution===
In 1948, a study showed Utah Lake was being seriously polluted. As a result, Utah County cities decided to plan how and where to build sewage treatment plants instead of dumping raw sewage into the lake. By 1954, many cities had constructed sewage treatment plants, but Provo&#x27;s was still under construction. Raw sewage was still getting into the lake by 1967.

In the State of Utah, the Utah Division of Water Quality and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the management and regulation of water quality. Lakes, rivers, and streams that exceed the standard levels are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The Act requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for pollutants that a body of water can assimilate without causing the water body to exceed the water quality standards. Utah Lake was originally put on Utah&#x27;s 2000 and 2004 303d list for phosphorus and total dissolved solids (TDS) exceeding recommend values. High levels of phosphorus can cause high levels of nuisance algae growth, low dissolved oxygen, and eleTDS tells about the concentration of mineral salts in the water, which can cause problems to agriculture and culinary water supplies. Excess levels of phosphorus come from multiple sources, but namely the wastewater treatment plants, are extremely concerning when it comes to Utah Lake management because high levels can trigger harmful algal blooms and eutrophication There is some discussion as to how much of the phosphorus is the result of anthropogenic causes and how much is the result of historic phosphorus stored in the lake sediment.

Krissy Wilson of Utah&#x27;s Division of Wildlife Resources stated in 2010 that water quality is now improving, with greater flows of water, among other things, contributing to the improvement. However, the presence and activity of carp, which stir up solids in the water, makes it difficult to appreciate the improvement without conducting scientific measurements.

===Harmful algal blooms in Utah Lake===
There are several cyanobacteria species that are especially common when phosphorus levels and temperature, among other unknown criteria, are favorable for harmful algal blooms. These are Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Dolichospermum flosaquae species, both of which produce cyanotoxins. If levels are high enough for either species and others, the lake is closed to the public.

==History==

===Pre-European===
The first inhabitants of the area were nomadic hunter-gatherers of the Desert Archaic Culture. An archeology site, called the Soo&#x27;nkahni Village, has been explored next to the Jordan River in Draper. The site dates back 3,000 years, and over 30,000 artifacts have been found. The next recorded inhabitants were the Fremont people who lived in the Utah Lake area from about 400 AD to about 1350 AD. They consisted of small villages of hunters and farmers. They farmed corn, squash, and beans. When climatic conditions changed, they caused trouble for farming. Also, the ancestors to the Ute, Paiute, and Northwestern Shoshone moved into the area. As a result, the Fremont people left the area.

The third group inhabited the area was the Utes of central Utah and eastern Colorado. The Timpanogot (also called Timpanogos, Timpanogotzi, Timpannah, and Tempenny) band of the Utes inhabited Utah Valley. They were the most dominant band of Utes due to the relative ease of gathering the plentiful local food supply. It was a sacred meeting place for the Timpanogos, Ute and Shoshone tribes. During the spring spawning season, these tribes would meet at Utah Lake for the annual fish festival. At the festival, there was dancing, singing, trading, horse races, gambling, and feasting on the plentiful fish the lake provided. It was also an opportunity to find a mate from another clan. In 1826, Jedediah Smith visited a camp along the Spanish Fork river that had 35 lodges with about 175 people.

===European explorers===
Franciscan missionary Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, while on his expedition in late summer and early autumn of 1776, was trying to find a land route from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Monterey, California. Two Timpanogots from Utah Valley acted as guides for his party. On September 23, 1776, the party traveled down Spanish Fork Canyon and entered the Utah Valley. From Escalante&#x27;s journal, he describes Utah Lake: &quot;The lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to what they told us, it communicates with others much larger. This lake of Timpanogotzis abounds in several kinds of good fish, geese, beaver, and other amphibious animals which did not have an opportunity to see. Round about it is these Indians, who live on the abundant fish of the lake, for which reason the Yutas Sabuaganas call them &quot;Come Pescados&quot; (Fish Eaters). Besides this, they gather in the plain grass seeds from which they make atole, which they supplement by hunting hares, rabbits, and fowl of which there is great abundance here.&quot; Escalante named the lake Lake Timpanogos, after the tribe living in the area. Escalante&#x27;s record clearly distinguishes between this Lake Timpanogos, a body of freshwater that he saw and sized, and the Great Salt Lake, which he did not see or name but was described to him as a river &quot;communicates with others much larger.&quot; The next recorded European visitor was Étienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper who visited Utah Lake in October 1824. The city of Provo and the Provo River are named after him.

===Early settlement by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The settlement of Utah by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began in July 1847, when pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Under the direction of Parley P. Pratt, an exploration of Utah Valley was conducted. The party brought a small boat in which they explored Utah Lake and caught fish with their nets. The first battle between settlers and Indians occurred in early March 1849. A company of forty men was sent into Utah Valley to stop the stealing of cattle from the Salt Lake Valley. The company met in the village of Little Chief, who told them where the people responsible for the stealing were located. A skirmish took place in which four Timpanogots were killed. The settlers named the site of the skirmish Battle Creek, which was later renamed Pleasant Grove.

In April 1849, a group of about thirty families came into Utah Valley and settled on the Provo River, very close to the main Timpanogot village on the Provo River. The settlers built a stockade called Fort Utah and armed it with a twelve-pound cannon to intimidate the Timpanogots. In August, a Timpanogot named Old Bishop was murdered by three settlers over a shirt they wanted from him. Some Timpanogots shot at cattle or stole corn in response. Winter was especially hard, and Timpanogots stole cattle for food. By January 1850, settlers of Fort Utah reported to officials in Salt Lake City that the situation was getting dangerous. They wanted a military party to attack the Timpanogots. A militia was sent from Salt Lake City, and on February 8 and 11, they engaged the Timpanogots in battle. On February 14, eleven Timpanogots surrendered but were later executed while their families watched. A government surgeon went to the execution site and cut off the Timpanogots&#x27; heads for later examination. One militia man and 102 Timpanogots were killed. Over the ensuing years, fewer and fewer Timpanogots lived in Utah Valley, and by 1872, all Timpanogots had moved to the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. However, some Timpanogots occasionally returned to fish on Utah Lake into the 1920s.

Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Army&#x27;s Corps of Topographical Engineers was ordered to map, survey, and explore Utah and Salt Lake Valleys. In 1850, Captain Stansbury explored Utah Lake and Utah Valley, surveyed and made observation of the local wildlife.

==Ecosystem==
Historically, there have been four species of amphibia, twelve species of reptiles, thirteen species of fish, 152 species of birds, and forty-two species of mammals found in the environs of Utah Lake. The dumping of raw sewage, destruction of natural habit, hunting, and the introduction of non-native fish species have taken a toll on the native species in and around the lake.

Some of the mammals that live around the lake are the big brown bat, the silver-haired bat, mule deer, Botta&#x27;s pocket gopher, desert woodrat, and striped skunk. There is seventeen known native mollusca to Utah Lake. Only three were reported in the lake ecosystem in 1969, and one species is extinct. The last living example of the thickshell pondsnail (&quot;Stagnicola utahensis&quot;), a freshwater snail, was reportedly seen in the early 1930s. Four specimens were sent to the Smithsonian Institution in 1911 and the only known location for the snail was Utah Lake.

===Birds===
During the 1800s and the 1930s, killing fish-eating birds were seen as a fish conservation measure. Local government entities gave bounties, and upon presenting evidence of offending dead birds, game officers paid the bounties. A report by a hunter states, &quot;There was a bounty paid on cranes and heron in 1895. Two men could make as high as $66 a day. Wading into the rookeries with their pants off they would crack the heron over the head. When the bounty was paid on pelican we would use a fish float tide to a wad of rushes. Gulls were also caught. There has been 10,000 slaughtered. At the Big Channel gidls have been shot and there are four or five hundred pelicans which have been shot. In 1928 I killed 1,240 mudhens [coot]. We would eat the hearts and gizzards, take the feathers and oil and discard the rest.&quot;
The Utah Lake wetland ecosystem is an important breeding area and stopover for migratory birds in the Pacific Flyway. Today, about 226 species of birds use the lake as their permanent home or as a stopover on their migration. The Utah Lake Wetland Preserve has been established at the south end of Utah Lake. It contains two units, one at Goshen bay with more than of land preserved, and another unit at Benjamin Slough. Birds seen at Utah Lake include sandhill crane, double-crested cormorant, great horned owl, turkey vulture, golden eagle, cinnamon teal duck, and mallard duck.

===Fish===
Parley P. Pratt visited Fort Utah in June 1849 and saw thousands of fish caught by settlers and Timpanogots. He estimated that 5000 barrels of fish could be secured annually from the fishery. The winter of 1885–1886 caused much of the livestock to die. Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elders sent members in the Salt Lake Valley to Utah Lake to obtain fish; an estimated of fish were brought back. The first commercial fishery also started the same year. At the 1870 General Conference of the LDS Church, a committee was appointed to develop fish culture because of the declining fish harvest in Utah Lake. By 1904, it became illegal to commercially catch any fish except for non-native species.

At least 25 species have been introduced into Utah Lake&#x27;s waters. Thirteen introductions were unsuccessful. Carp, largemouth bass, white bass, black bullhead, channel catfish, walleye, goldfish, yellow perch, blue gill, and black crappie are found in abundance. The golden shiner and the fathead minnow are rarely found.

Of the thirteen species of fish native to Utah Lake, one species is extinct (the Utah Lake sculpin), one is no longer present in the lake and is under review to see if it qualifies for protection under the Endangered Species Act (least chub), one is already listed as endangered (the June sucker), and one is found in relative abundance throughout Utah (the Utah sucker). All other native fish are no longer extant in the lake.

The Bonneville cutthroat trout was historically the top predator fish in the ecosystem but is now restricted to tributary streams. A review in 2008 indicates that viable populations are distributed throughout its historic range and do not merit listing as a threatened or endangered species.

The Utah Lake sculpin was last found in 1928 and likely became extinct in the 1930s after severe drought lowered the lake levels, allowing much of the lake to freeze, overcrowding fish in unfrozen portions of the lake. This overcrowding and pollution from agricultural runoff are probable causes of the fish&#x27;s extinction.

The Bonneville redside shiner, mottled sculpin, leatherside chub, Utah chub, speckled dace, longnose dace, mountain whitefish and mountain sucker are no longer in the lake, but still exist in tributaries.

The June sucker was federally listed as an endangered species in 1986. The lower of the Provo River is the only known spawning location for the species. Biologists have been rearing the June sucker in Red Butte Reservoir and releasing them into Utah Lake to help build the population. During the summer of 2005, over 8,000 June sucker were released into Utah Lake. The June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program (JSRIP) coordinates and implements recovery actions for the June sucker. As of February 3, 2021 the June sucker was officially down-listed from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;threatened&quot;; a direct result of conservation efforts made by the JSRIP and its partners. 
The common carp was introduced in 1883 as a source of food after native species had been depleted by overfishing. It is now the most prevalent fish found in Utah Lake. Carp makes up about 90% of the lake&#x27;s biomass, with an adult population numbering around 7.5 million. The average carp in the lake is about , for a total of nearly of carp in the lake.

As early as 1901, fish and wildlife representatives noted that carp were causing the trout population in the lake to collapse. Due to their habit of grubbing through bottom sediments for food, carp stir up sediments and increase the turbidity of the water. In addition, they destroy submerged vegetation that holds sediments in place and provides shelter for native fish populations. Without vegetation, winds can more easily stir up sediment from the bottom of the lake, which is already a problem due to the lake&#x27;s shallowness, resulting in greater turbidity and less sunlight reaching the remaining vegetation. Without cover for their young, native fish, such as the June sucker, become easy prey for white bass, walleye, and other predators.

Efforts are underway to reduce the population of carp in Utah Lake by employing local commercial fishermen, led by Bill Loy, Jr., to remove 5 million pounds of carp each year as part of the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program&#x27;s efforts to restore Utah Lake to a habitat in which the June sucker can survive. The intent is to cause a crash in the carp population which will allow the ecosystem to begin to rebuild and the June sucker to reestablish dominance in the lake.

The Utah Lake Commission has previously stated its goal is to remove 32 million pounds of carp from the lake, and more than 17 million pounds have been removed as of November 2019.

==Recreation==
Due to its proximity to the Provo-Orem metropolitan area, Utah Lake is a fairly popular destination. From the 1880s to the 1930s, up to twelve resorts offering boat rentals, picnic facilities, dance halls, swimming pools, and bathhouses served tourists at the lake. Saratoga Springs, on the north shore, was the most popular and longest-lived resort. Saratoga Springs was best known for its natural hot springs but also had waterslides and amusement park rides. It lasted from the 1860s until the floods of 1984. In the summer, fishing, water skiing, boating, camping, and picnicking are the most popular activities. During the winter, ice fishing, ice hockey, and ice skating are popular on the lake, especially at Utah Lake State Park, and Lincoln Beach. The main marina for Utah Lake is at Utah Lake State Park on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore. Other marinas are at Saratoga Springs, American Fork, Lindon, and Lincoln Beach.

==Legal issues==
The ownership of lands along the shoreline of Utah Lake has been in dispute between the State of Utah and farmers for many years. The bed of Utah Lake, along with other natural lakes, was granted to the state upon admission to the Union in 1896. However, due to the lack of an exact definition and significantly fluctuating lake levels, intermittently dry areas, and wetlands, including all of Provo Bay, have been claimed and farmed by surrounding land owners. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that the State of Utah owned the land beneath Utah Lake.

In January 2018, the Utah Department of Natural Resources received a project proposal as a potential solution to the lake&#x27;s nutrient pollution, invasive species, and murky water. The project proposal involved dredging the lake bottom of all nutrient-loaded sediment, replacing invasive plant and animal species with native species, and restoring the water quality before building and developing housing on arch-shaped islands. The proposal became known as the Utah Lake Restoration project, and had an estimated cost of $6.4 billion which would be obtained through private investors. The proposal led to the creation of the House Bill 272 - Utah Lake Amendments (HB 272), which asserted that Utah Lake faced serious challenges, that conservation and restoration were possible, and in the interest of the state, and authorized &quot;the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands to dispose of state land in exchange for the execution of a project for the comprehensive restoration of Utah Lake,&quot; an act which would otherwise be prohibited. On March 21, 2018, Governor Gary Herbert signed HB 272 into law.

Critics of the project include ecologists and other scientists raising hydrologic and ecological concerns with the project. Specific issues include the fact that the project would likely lead to the creation of anoxic waters due to lake stratification, the destruction of the lake&#x27;s unique hydrology and biogeochemistry, the release of toxins and nutrients, altering the lake from its natural state, and geology unsuitable for supporting inhabited islands. Other critics disputed the passing of HB272 as an attempt to trade sovereign lands in exchange for a service. The ability of the developer to maintain the alterations to the lake after the completion of the project has also been brought into question.

In October 2022, permitting for the Utah Lake Restoration project was put on hold, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, because of a lack of documentation required to win federal permits under the Clean Water Act.

On October 27, 2022, Utah’s Division of Forestry, Fire &amp; State Lands rejected the proposal by Lake Restoration Solutions. The division director Jamie Barnes said that the lake bed is sovereign state land and cannot be privatized.

==Environmental concerns==

In 2008, Utah Lake&#x27;s carp and channel catfish were found to be contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCB&#x27;s. After an investigation, no originating source for the PCBs was found.

The lake was closed due to contamination from toxic algae in 2016, 2018, and 2019.

==Recovery efforts==

===June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program (JSRIP)===
The June Sucker is a species of fish endemic to Utah Lake and its tributaries. The June Sucker is a key indicator species for the overall health of the ecosystem. Though listed as endangered in 1986 after ecosystem degradation and invasive species concentration, thanks to the efforts of the JSRIP, the June Sucker was downlisted to “threatened” on February 3, 2021. Actions taken to recover the June Sucker include non-native species removal, specifically carp and Northern pike; increasing the population through stocking and monitoring; and restoring and maintaining habitat, including the tributaries Hobble Creek and the Provo River.

====Provo River Delta Restoration Project====
In an effort to recover the June Sucker and restore the area’s natural ecosystem, the Provo River Delta Restoration Project is an ongoing process in which a large portion of the lower Provo River flow is diverted into a series of channels and wetlands before reaching Utah Lake. The restored delta area provides a habitat for juvenile June Suckers to grow to a survivable size. The project also provides for improved trail and river access, fishing platforms, and other recreational facilities. The project began in 2020 and is expected to be completed in 2024.

===Phragmites removal===
Phragmites is an aggressive, invasive plant species that dominates a large portion of the Utah Lake shoreline. Since 2014, a large-scale collaborative effort has been underway to mitigate the negative effects of the species through the use of herbicides and crushing techniques. Reports in 2020 indicated a 70% decrease in phragmites.

===Utah Lake Water Quality Study (ULWQS)===
The purpose of the ULWQS is to gather data on the nutrient concentrations (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in Utah Lake and develop nutrient criteria to protect the ecosystem. Phase 1 of the project, Data Gathering, was completed in 2018. Phase 2, Developing Criteria, is currently underway and will be followed by Phase 3, Implementation.

==Utah Lake folklore==
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were several reported sightings of strange creatures in the lake, leading to tales of a lake monster with descriptions of the cryptid&#x27;s appearance varying from being reptilian with an alligator&#x27;s head to being seal-like.

<text>The PR (performance rating, P-rating, or Pentium rating) system was a figure of merit developed by AMD, Cyrix, IBM Microelectronics and SGS-Thomson in the mid-1990s as a method of comparing their x86 processors to those of rival Intel. The idea was to consider instructions per cycle (IPC) in addition to the clock speed, so that the processors become comparable with Intel&#x27;s Pentium that had a higher clock speed with overall lower IPC.

== Branding ==
The first use of the PR system was in 1995, when AMD used it to assert that their AMD 5x86 processor was as fast as a Pentium running at 75 MHz. The designation &quot;P75&quot; was added to the chip to denote this. Later that year, Cyrix also adopted the PR system for its 6x86 and 6x86MX line of processors. These processors were faster than Pentiums of the same speed in some benchmarks, so Cyrix gave them a Performance Rating faster than their clock speed. Some AMD K5 models also use the PR system. 

AMD initially branded its AMD K6 processors with a &quot;PR2&quot; rating but dropped this after consumer confusion. AMD revived the branding for its Athlon XP, which was released in 2001. The efficient Athlon XP chips could perform better than similarly-clocked chips from Intel&#x27;s competing Pentium 4 line-up, which depended on high clock speeds to overcome their low IPC. As a result, AMD believed consumers would be swayed by the megahertz myth. These chips were rated against the Athlon Thunderbird but were popularly compared to the Pentium 4. As a result, the branding became colloquially known as a &quot;Pentium Rating&quot;. &quot;Maximum PC&quot; criticized this as making it more difficult for power users to differentiate between the various Athlon XP chips. For example, two chips could be given the same &quot;PR&quot; branding but have much different engineering (cache size, bus speed, etc), which would affect their performance at different tasks.

<doc id="167494" wikidata="Q1299260" url="?curid=167494" title="Roots reggae">
<text>Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of Africans and those in the African Diaspora, including the spiritual side of Rastafari, black liberation, revolution and the honouring of God, called Jah by Rastafarians. It is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, struggles by artists, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to fascism, capitalism, corrupt government and racial oppression. A spiritual repatriation to Africa is a common theme in roots reggae.

==History==
The increasing influence of the Rastafari movement after the visit of Haile Selassie to Jamaica in 1966 played a major part in the development of roots reggae, with spiritual themes becoming more common in reggae lyrics in the late 1960s. Important early roots reggae releases included Winston Holness&#x27;s &quot;Blood &amp; Fire&quot; (1970) and Yabby You&#x27;s &quot;Conquering Lion&quot; (1972). Political unrest also played its part, with the 1972 election campaign of Michael Manley targeting the support of Jamaica&#x27;s ghetto communities. Increasing violence associated with the opposing political parties was also a common lyrical theme, with tracks such as Junior Murvin&#x27;s &quot;Police &amp; Thieves&quot; and Culture&#x27;s &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot;.

The heyday of roots reggae is usually considered the latter half of the 1970s – with artists such as The Abyssinians, Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Horace Andy, Hugh Mundell, and Lincoln Thompson, and groups like Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse, Israel Vibration, The Gladiators and Culture – teaming up with producers such as Lee &#x27;Scratch&#x27; Perry, Bunny Lee, Joseph Hoo Kim and Coxsone Dodd. The Sound system (Jamaican) was of unequalled importance in spreading reggae and dub, with the diaspora represented by leading sound system operators such as Jah Shaka, who, in turn, went on to profoundly influence many in Britain and the world, influencing early punk rock musicians in London, as well as definitively shaping later bass dominated genres such as Jungle music and Drum and bass. The experimental pioneering of such producers within often-restricted technological parameters gave birth to dub, and is seen by some music historians as one of the earliest (albeit analogue) contributions to modern dance music production techniques.

Roots reggae became popular in Europe in the 1970s, especially among left-wing white youths in Western Europe. The Wailers&#x27; popularity in Europe opened the door for other artists, and roots reggae artists became popular with punk rock fans. When Jamaicans turned to dancehall, a lot of black, white and mixed roots reggae bands were formed in Europe. Later on roots reggae made its way into the United States with the migration of Jamaicans to New York. This took place with the reforms made to American immigration laws in the early 1960s. Along with localised traditions and food, reggae music was inevitably brought as well, contributing to the New York City soundscape, such as the development of hip hop.

While roots reggae was largely overtaken in popularity in Jamaica by dancehall, several artists from the original era, such as Culture, Burning Spear, and Israel Vibration continued to produce roots reggae, and artists like Beres Hammond and Freddie McGregor continued the use of roots reggae, as a musical style and thematically, through the 1980s. In the 1990s younger Jamaican artists became interested in the Rastafari movement and began incorporating roots themes into their music. Most notable among the new generation of &quot;conscious&quot; artists was Garnett Silk, whose positive spiritual message and consistent use of roots and rocksteady riddims gave him cross generational appeal with Caribbean audiences. While other notable dancehall stars like Capleton and Buju Banton became devout Rastas and changed their musical direction as a result. Other modern roots artists and bands also emerged at this time, including Luciano, Junior Kelly, Morgan Heritage, Anthony B, and Sizzla.

==Africa as myth==
Similar to the oversimplification and limitations of the terminology &quot;middle passage&quot;, the roots reggae displays Africa as a mythical paradise that functions primarily as a motivating symbol, imagined origin, and semantic center. &quot;More so even than earlier sounds, roots reggae always seemed to invite itself directly to Africa, brazenly insisting upon itself as the continent&#x27;s primary echo, if not recursive mirror&quot;. The mythical Africa articulated in roots reggae is shaped by desire, nostalgia and trauma under the pressure of local Caribbean politics. While an imagined Africa is used as an inspiration for resistance and revolution against &quot;Babylon&quot; (corrupted capitalist colonial culture), Africa&#x27;s actual complexity and contradictions are not investigated.

== Roots reggae vs. traditional reggae ==
Traditional reggae and roots reggae, a subgenre that evolved from traditional reggae, while sharing a common Jamaican heritage, exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart. Traditional reggae encompasses diverse themes, including love, everyday life, and dancehall culture, whereas roots reggae tends to focus its lyrics on social consciousness. Traditional reggae rhythms vary widely, featuring both upbeat and slower tunes. In contrast, roots reggae is marked by a deliberate one-drop rhythm and a slower tempo. Rooted in a deep social and political consciousness, its lyrics often tackle issues of poverty, oppression, and spirituality, influenced by the Rastafarian movement. Musically, roots reggae maintains a specific sonic identity, characterised by deep basslines, skanking guitar patterns, and the inclusion of horns. While these distinctions exist, the lines between reggae and roots reggae can be flexible, and the two genres share a significant overlap within the broader reggae musical landscape.

<text>Bernhard Rogge (4 November 1899 – 29 June 1982) was a German naval officer who, during World War II, commanded a merchant raider. Later, he became a Konteradmiral in West Germany&#x27;s navy.

Rogge became a &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (vice-admiral) by the end of World War II, and, when the West German navy was established after the war, returned to service as a &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (rear-admiral). He also was one of the few German officers of flag rank who was not arrested by the Allies after the war. This was due to the way he had exercised his command of .

==Early life==
Rogge was born in Schleswig, the son of a Lutheran minister, and was himself devoutly religious. His grandfather, on his mother&#x27;s side, was Jewish.

==Military career==
* 1915 — joins the Imperial German Navy as a volunteer
* After World War I — serves on various cruisers
* Mid-1930s to 1939 — commander of the sail training ship SSS &quot;Albert Leo Schlageter&quot;
* September 1939 — assigned to the 
** Mid-December 1939 — &quot;Atlantis&quot; is formally commissioned
** 31 March 1940 — &quot;Atlantis&quot; sets out to sea
** 11 November 1940 — &quot;Atlantis&quot; scuttles British cargo ship near Sumatra after retrieving top secret documents for which the Japanese government would reward Rogge with an ornate katana in April 1943
** 22 November 1941 — &quot;Atlantis&quot; is sunk by 
**15 Apr 1942- Chief of Staff to Inspector of Training Affairs
**1 March 1943- promoted to Konteradmiral and Inspector of Training Affairs
**20 Sept 1944- Cdr Fleet Training Formations
**1 March 1945- promoted to Vizeadmiral
* After World War II — discharged
* 1 June 1957 — enters the post-World War II West German Bundesmarine with the rank of Konteradmiral
** 1 June 1957 – 29 September 1957 — delegated with the Command of Military Area Command I 

** 30 September 1957 – 31 March 1962 — Commander of Military Area Command I

* 31 March 1962 — retires from the German Bundesmarine as a Konteradmiral

==Assessment==

J. Armstrong White, captain of the British merchant ship City of Bagdad, which &quot;Atlantis&quot; sank in July 1940, stated, &quot;His treatment of prisoners left respect, instead of hatred&quot;. White later wrote the foreword to &quot;Atlantis, the Story of a German Surface Raider&quot;, written by U. Mohr &amp; A. V. Sellwood.

Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was, following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s suicide briefly head of state of Nazi Germany in May 1945, and was prosecuted for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials, cited his own support of Rogge, who had a Jewish grandparent, in an effort to clear himself of the charge of being antisemitic.

Rogge confirmed the death sentence of the 21-year-old sailor Johann Christian Süß. Süß was sentenced to death on 10 May 1945, two days after the German capitulation, for &quot;undermining the discipline&quot; and &quot;disruptive speeches&quot; based on paragraph 5 numeral 2 of the &quot;Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung&quot; (KSSVO—Special War Criminal Regulation). Süß was executed by firing squad on 11 May 1945.

<doc id="167496" wikidata="Q1534578" url="?curid=167496" title="Guttural">
<text>Guttural speech sounds are those with a primary place of articulation near the back of the oral cavity, where it is difficult to distinguish a sound&#x27;s place of articulation and its phonation. In popular usage it is an imprecise term for sounds produced relatively far back in the vocal tract, such as the German &quot;ch&quot; or the Arabic ayin, but not simple glottal sounds like &quot;h&quot;. The term &#x27;guttural language&#x27; is used for languages that have such sounds.

As a technical term used by phoneticians and phonologists, &quot;guttural&quot; has had various definitions. The concept always includes pharyngeal consonants, but may include velar, uvular or laryngeal consonants as well.
Guttural sounds are typically consonants, but murmured, pharyngealized, glottalized and strident vowels may be also considered guttural in nature.
Some phonologists argue that all post-velar sounds constitute a natural class.

==Meaning and etymology==

The word &quot;guttural&quot; literally means &#x27;of the throat&#x27; (from Latin &quot;guttur&quot;, meaning throat), and was first used by phoneticians to describe the Hebrew glottal (א) and (ה), uvular (ח), and pharyngeal (ע).

The term is commonly used non-technically by English speakers to refer to sounds that subjectively appear harsh or grating. This definition usually includes a number of consonants that are not used in English, such as epiglottal and , uvular , and , and velar fricatives and . However, it usually excludes sounds used in English, such as the velar stops and , the velar nasal , and the glottal consonants and .

==Guttural languages==

In popular consciousness, languages that make extensive use of guttural consonants are often considered to be &quot;guttural languages&quot;. English-speakers sometimes find such languages strange and even hard on the ear.

===Examples of significant usage===

Languages that extensively use [x], [χ], [ʁ], [ɣ] and/or [q] include:

*Afrikaans
*Arabic
*Armenian
*Assamese
*Sureth
*Azerbaijani
*Crimean Tatar
*Dutch
*French
*German
*Greek
*Hebrew
*Hindustani (Hindi, Urdu)
*Irish
*Lakota
*Manx 
*Mongolian language 
*Kartvelian languages (i.e. Georgian, Mingrelian, Laz, Svan)
*Kurdish
*Pashto
*Persian 
*Punjabi
*Scottish Gaelic
*Sindhi 
*Spanish
*Tajik Persian
*Tswana
*Welsh
In addition to their usage of [q], [x], [χ], [ʁ] and [ɣ], these languages also have the pharyngeal consonants of [ʕ] and [ħ]:

*Berber languages (i.e. Kabyle, Tamasheq)
*Cushitic languages (i.e. Somali and Oromo)
*Some Kurdish dialects (as a result of borrowings from Arabic)
*Northeast Caucasian languages (i.e. Chechen, Lezgian, Avar) 
*Northwest Caucasian (i.e. Abkhaz, Adyghe, Kabardian).
*Salishan and Wakashan language families in British Columbia
*Semitic languages (i.e. Arabic, Sureth, Tigre, Tigrinya, Turoyo, Hebrew, Ge’ez)

===Examples of partial usage===
In French, the only truly guttural sound is (usually) a uvular fricative (or the guttural R). In Portuguese, is becoming dominant in urban areas. There is also a realization as a , and the original pronunciation as an also remains very common in various dialects.

In Russian, is assimilated to the palatalization of the following velar consonant: лёгких . It also has a voiced allophone , which occurs before voiced obstruents. In Romanian, becomes the velar in word-final positions (&quot;duh&quot; &#x27;spirit&#x27;) and before consonants (&quot;hrean&quot; &#x27;horseradish&#x27;). In Czech, the phoneme followed by a voiced obstruent can be realized as either or , e.g. &quot;abych byl&quot; .

In Kyrgyz, the consonant phoneme has a uvular realisation () in back vowel contexts. In front-vowel environments, is fricativised between continuants to , and in back vowel environments both and fricativise to and respectively. In Uyghur, the phoneme occurs with a back vowel. In the Mongolian language, is usually followed by .

The Tuu and Juu (Khoisan) languages of southern Africa have large numbers of guttural vowels. These sounds share certain phonological behaviors that warrant the use of a term specifically for them. There are scattered reports of pharyngeals elsewhere, such as in the Nilo-Saharan, Tama language.

In Swabian German, a pharyngeal approximant is an allophone of in nucleus and coda positions. In onsets, it is pronounced as a uvular approximant. In Danish, may have slight frication, and, according to , it may be a pharyngeal approximant . In Finnish, a weak pharyngeal fricative is the realization of after the vowels or in syllable-coda position, e.g. &quot;tähti&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;.

<text>Kerry Allen Livgren (born September 18, 1949) is an American musician, best known as one of the founding members and primary songwriters for the American rock band Kansas.

Livgren, raised in Topeka, Kansas, developed an early interest in music and songwriting. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he played in various bands, exploring spiritual themes in his lyrics. Livgren formed bands such as the Gimlets, Saratoga, and eventually Kansas. With Kansas, he achieved commercial success, writing hit songs like &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. In 1979, Livgren converted to Christianity, which influenced his subsequent work. He continued to work with Kansas, formed a new band called AD, and pursued a solo career. Livgren later formed a band called Proto-Kaw, which released new material until 2011. As the primary songwriter for Kansas, Livgren contributed to the band&#x27;s worldwide success, with numerous Gold and multi-Platinum albums and over 14 million recordings sold.

== Biography ==
Livgren was raised in Topeka, Kansas, by his father Allen Leroy, an industrial engineer, and his mother Betty ( McElhiney). He was drawn to music at a young age, and his first musical interests developed with classical and jazz influences. His first equipment included an electric guitar he built using a cheap Stella guitar, a Sears amplifier and a low-quality Astatic microphone. Along with learning guitar, Livgren also focused on learning to write songs due to his desire for more creative expression and originality. He attended Washburn University for some time.

=== Early years: 1960s–1973 ===
Livgren was a member of numerous bands in the late 1960s and early 1970s and developed a reputation for complex compositions and poetic lyrics that explored spiritual themes. His investigations into various religions are reflected in the lyrics of his songs on Kansas&#x27; first six albums.

Livgren formed his first band, the Gimlets, with several close friends in high school, including John Pribble, drums, Scott Kessler, bass, Tim Strauss, guitar, and Dan Wright on keyboards. They soon found themselves booked after school and on weekends throughout Kansas and neighboring Missouri, where they played their original compositions, a blend of pop, English and psychedelic rock. After graduating from Topeka West High School in 1967, Livgren continued to perform with the Gimlets through college before joining a predominantly black mainstream rhythm-and-blues band named the Mellotones, in which he met keyboard player Don Montre in 1969.

Forming a friendship, Livgren and Montre decided to leave the Mellotones and join the more commercially viable band the Reasons Why, which included Lynn Meredith and Wright. Though this band was doing well financially, Livgren became frustrated because of his desire for more creative expression, and he and Montre decided to start their own band. They briefly re-formed the Gimlets with former members Scott Kessler and Wright along with several new members. A short time later, they renamed the band Saratoga, after the name on the pencil that Livgren was using to write songs. Saratoga included Meredith, Montre, Wright, Livgren, Phil Ehart and Dave Hope.

In 1970, Livgren and Ehart decided to form a new group by combining the best members from Saratoga and Phil&#x27;s band White Clover (which included Steve Walsh, Rich Williams, Hope and Jeff Glixman). While Livgren and Ehart were discussing what to call the new band, Hope walked in on the conversation and suggested they call themselves Kansas. This version of Kansas (referred to as &quot;Kansas I&quot; by fans) was known for its complex musical arrangements and originality, but the lineup lasted for only one year.

In 1971, Ehart and Hope left the group, and Livgren reworked the band and continued it under the name Kansas. (This group later became known by fans as Kansas II and is the lineup that re-formed decades later as Proto-Kaw). Kansas II continued to perform Livgren&#x27;s original works, which fused experimental rock with psychedelia and jazz. During this time, Kansas II recorded a demo cassette that was released commercially 30 years later. Kansas II generated a loyal fan following, and the built-in audience helped the band secure concert bookings. However, financial problems plagued the band, and after a record deal with Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s label failed to materialize and an old school bus broke down while the band was on the road touring, the band dissolved in 1973.

Shortly afterward, Livgren was invited by Ehart to join the re-formed White Clover, which also included vocalist Walsh, violinist Robby Steinhardt, bassist Hope, guitarist Williams and Ehart on drums. Before Livgren joined the band, White Clover had sent out a five-song demo tape, which Don Kirshner was interested in for his new label. As part of the effort to sign with Kirshner, the players soon renamed themselves Kansas, becoming the third, and eventually the best-known, lineup to use the name.

=== Commercial success with Kansas: 1974–1983 ===
After three albums in two years failed to provide them with a hit single, Kansas was under pressure from Kirshner and CBS records to write a hit. Livgren and the band realized it was their last chance. Because Walsh was experiencing writer&#x27;s block, Livgren wrote or co-wrote all the songs for the group&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Leftoverture&quot;. On the last day of rehearsal for the new album, Livgren brought the band one more song, which they performed once before heading to the studio. The song, &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, became Kansas&#x27; first hit, reaching No. 11.

Riding the success of &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, Livgren wrote &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; for the &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; album. Like &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; was added to the album at the last minute. Livgren said the song was an acoustic guitar warmup. While playing it one day at home when his wife was doing laundry, she told him he should put it on the album. Since the album at that point had extra time available, he presented the song to the band and it was included. It became their highest-charting single, reaching No. 6.
In early 1979, Livgren became interested in The Urantia Book, a series of papers that claim to be a revelation authored by supernatural beings. Its influence can be felt in the lyrics of Kansas&#x27; 1979 album &quot;Monolith&quot;. Livgren subsequently rejected Urantia doctrine, and while on tour with the band in support of &quot;Monolith&quot;, he converted to Christianity. This was a result of a series of debates in the back of the tour bus with Jeff Pollard of Louisiana&#x27;s Le Roux, the opening act for Kansas during the tour. The discussions between Livgren and Pollard concerned whether the Bible or the Urantia Book was the accurate record of the life of Jesus Christ. Because of the debates, Livgren became convinced that the Bible was the genuine record of Christ and that he had been mistaken in following the teachings of the Urantia Book. After a private hotel-room conversion experience, he became an evangelical Christian.

In 1980, Livgren released his first solo album, &quot;Seeds of Change&quot;. The album features several members of Kansas, along with Ambrosia singer David Pack and noted heavy-metal singer Ronnie James Dio, who sang on the tracks &quot;To Live for the King&quot; and &quot;Mask of the Great Deceiver&quot;.

Livgren recorded three more albums with Kansas. However, tension was growing among the band members as a result of the increasingly Christian perspective of his lyrics. Walsh left the band near the end of 1981 as a result. Steinhardt also left, for personal reasons, prior to recording of the band&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; album. Meanwhile, Livgren had also become increasingly dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s musical direction (at least in part due to his newfound faith), and he would leave the band himself shortly after &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; was released.

Livgren has continued to appear occasionally with Kansas on various tours since the 1990s and contributed new songs to &quot;The Kansas Boxed Set&quot; in 1994 (&quot;Wheels&quot;) and to &quot;Freaks of Nature&quot; in 1995 (&quot;Cold Grey Morning&quot;). In 2000, the original and current members of Kansas reunited at Livgren&#x27;s studio to record a new album written entirely by Livgren, titled &quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;. Though the album received very favorable reviews, sales were not comparable to Kansas&#x27; past successes decades earlier.

=== AD : 1983–1988 ===
In 1983, after his departure from Kansas, Livgren recorded his second self-produced album for CBS, &quot;Time Line&quot; with Hope, Warren Ham, Michael Gleason and drummer Dennis Holt. By the end of the recording sessions, the session musicians had jelled, and he decided to name the group AD.

Due to legal entanglements caused by his contractual obligations with Kansas, Livgren was unable to market AD in the mainstream secular market. After negotiating with the record label, he received a waiver to perform with AD in the Christian rock market. Unfortunately, this would become a hindrance to commercial viability for the band. AD toured extensively between 1983 and 1986, sometimes playing bars and clubs one night and then churches the next. Livgren has stated on several occasions that he experienced some of the highest and lowest points in his career during his time with AD. Livgren mentions in his book &quot;Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren&quot; that his time playing live with AD was his best as a guitarist.

AD released &quot;Art of the State&quot; in 1985. Due to financial difficulties, AD faded away in 1986 after releasing the album &quot;Reconstructions&quot;, though no official breakup was announced. In 1988, Livgren released a collection of previously unreleased AD songs titled &quot;Prime Mover&quot;. Livgren played all instruments, and all vocals were performed by Ham.

In 1997, Livgren rediscovered recordings of two AD performances from 1984 and 1985 that had been recorded by the soundboard engineer. Though they had not been made for release, Livgren remastered them and released them as a &quot;thank you&quot; to fans on a CD-R title called &quot;AD Live&quot;. The performances include mistakes and technical problems left intact and is meant as an archival release.

=== Solo years: 1989–2000 ===
In 1989, Livgren released his first all-instrumental album, &quot;One of Several Possible Musiks&quot;. He played all instruments on the album, which combines orchestral, jazz and rock styles. This effort won Livgren his first Dove Award, for Instrumental Album of the Year.

Livgren then released a double-CD retrospective, titled &quot;Decade&quot;, celebrating 10 years since his first solo recording. It included Livgren&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Seeds of Change&quot; and &quot;Time Line&quot;, in their entirety, plus tracks from other albums and previously unreleased songs. Enthusiasts of Livgren&#x27;s music continue to hold this album in high regard, making it very hard to find.

In 1994, after moving back to Topeka, Livgren created GrandyZine production company and Numavox Records. He converted a restored barn on his farm into a state-of-the-art recording and production facility.

In 1995, Livgren released his next solo album, &quot;When Things Get Electric&quot;, on his new label. In 1996, he released his first soundtrack, for Sony&#x27;s fourth Mind&#x27;s Eye computer animation feature, titled &quot;Odyssey into the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;. In 1998, Livgren mostly re-recorded the album &quot;Prime Mover&quot; and added five new songs and a new version of &quot;Fair Exchange&quot; from the Kansas album &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; to the reissue, &quot;Prime Mover II&quot;. (He reworked and reissued the album again in 2008 as &quot;Prime Mover (Redux)&quot;.)

In 2000, Livgren released &quot;Collector&#x27;s Sedition&quot;, featuring several vocalists, including his nephew, Jake Livgren. At this time, Livgren was writing new songs prolifically and realized that some of them &quot;sounded like Kansas.&quot; He called Phil Ehart and offered him the opportunity to hear the songs. This led to a reunion album with Kansas, titled &quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;, which featured the then-touring version of Kansas along with Livgren and Dave Hope, the original bassist. The album was recorded at Livgren&#x27;s Grandyzine Studio in his converted barn, where he performed on the album as lead guitarist and keyboardist and produced the album. It was the first Kansas album for which Livgren had written all the songs.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;, Livgren began work on &quot;The Best of Kerry Livgren&quot;. Both retrospective and forward-looking, it contains tracks from all his solo releases and some AD tracks. The album also includes two new songs and new recordings of four older songs. Each of these new versions features the original vocalists, including Ham, Gleason and Dio.

=== Proto-Kaw: 2003–2011 ===
In 2003, Cuneiform Records issued a collection of material recorded by Kansas II, the early lineup that had included Livgren, Meredith, Wright, Montre, John Bolton, Rod Mikinski and Brad Schulz, calling the group Proto-Kaw. The band then re-formed under that name and released &quot;Before Became After&quot; in 2004 on Inside Out Records.

They released their second studio album, &quot;The Wait of Glory&quot;, on January 31, 2006, also on Inside Out Records. Unlike &quot;Before Became After&quot;, this work was composed of entirely new material written by Livgren. The package included a live concert DVD of Proto-Kaw&#x27;s appearance at the 2005 NEARfest.

In late 2010, Livgren announced that the members of Proto-Kaw had decided to finish working on the band&#x27;s fourth CD. Although he had suffered a stroke and was unable to play guitar or keyboard, Livgren worked with other band members to finish the project. On August 6, 2011, the band had a CD release party in Kansas City for the album, titled &quot;Forth&quot;.

== Influence and recognition ==
As primary songwriter, lead guitarist and keyboard player for Kansas, having penned such hits as &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, Livgren propelled the band to worldwide success and critical acclaim, with numerous Gold and multi-Platinum albums and more than 14 million recordings sold to date. Kansas produced eight Gold albums, one Platinum album, two quadruple-Platinum albums, one Platinum live album, and a 1 million-selling Gold single, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, according to the Kansas State Historical Society.

Kerry Livgren is listed as a &quot;Famous Kansan&quot; by the Kansas State Historical Society. The Platinum record awarded to him for the Kansas album &quot;Monolith&quot; hangs in the Kansas Museum of History. He was also honored by the Kansas State Legislature with a commendation on April 28, 2006.

== Guest appearances ==
Livgren&#x27;s keyboard and guitar playing can be heard on the 2nd Chapter of Acts albums &quot;Rejoice&quot; (1981), &quot;Singer Sower&quot; (1983) and &quot;Night Light&quot; (1985). He also played on the Robin Crow album &quot;Electric Cinema&quot; (1992) and contributed a guitar solo to &quot;Long Story&quot;, a song on Neal Morse&#x27;s album &quot;Testimony&quot; (2003). In addition, Livgren recorded a guitar solo on the song &quot;Rockstar Now&quot; on the Crunchy album &quot;Loserville&quot; (2007).

On his website, Livgren reported in July 2009 that he had recently contributed to the new album by former Kansas bandmate John Elefante. &quot;Revolution of Mind&quot; by John Elefante and Mastedon was released in 2010, crediting Livgren as one of several guest guitarists.

== Book ==
In 1983, Livgren published his autobiography, &quot;Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren&quot;, co-written with Kenneth Boa. A revised and expanded edition was released in 1991 that updated the book to cover his time with AD. In 2022, the book was revised and updated once more with a fresh new look and layout as well as additional photos that had not appeared in previous versions. A short &quot;epilogue&quot; chapter was also added to bridge the gap from the early &#x27;90s to present day.

== Stroke ==
On September 1, 2009, Livgren had a stroke early in the day. His condition was reported as &quot;serious but stable&quot;. By September 4, family members called his condition &quot;positive&quot; and said his progress in recovering was &quot;encouraging&quot;. Livgren underwent surgery and received two stents in his carotid arteries. The area of his brain where the stroke-causing clot formed deals with language and other high-end skills. Livgren&#x27;s family says his face did not have the &quot;sagging&quot; often found in stroke victims and he recognized family members squeezing their hands in recognition. The family established the Kansas band website as the only authorized source for information on Livgren&#x27;s recovery. Livgren has now recovered partially and has resumed work on his various musical projects.

He made his first post-stroke appearance with Kansas on January 28, 2011 when he conducted the Kansas State University Symphony Orchestra for &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; during a special concert celebrating the 150th anniversary of the state of Kansas. Livgren was greeted with a prolonged standing ovation.

<doc id="167506" wikidata="Q1164536" url="?curid=167506" title="Echo sounding">
<text>Echo sounding or depth sounding is the use of sonar for ranging, normally to determine the depth of water (bathymetry). It involves transmitting acoustic waves into water and recording the time interval between emission and return of a pulse; the resulting time of flight, along with knowledge of the speed of sound in water, allows determining the distance between sonar and target. This information is then typically used for navigation purposes or in order to obtain depths for charting purposes.

Echo sounding can also be used for ranging to other targets, such as fish schools. Hydroacoustic assessments have traditionally employed mobile surveys from boats to evaluate fish biomass and spatial distributions. Conversely, fixed-location techniques use stationary transducers to monitor passing fish.

The word &quot;sounding&quot; is used for all types of depth measurements, including those that don&#x27;t use sound, and is unrelated in origin to the word &quot;sound&quot; in the sense of noise or tones. Echo sounding is a more rapid method of measuring depth than the previous technique of lowering a sounding line until it touched bottom.

== History ==

German inventor Alexander Behm was granted German patent No. 282009 for the invention of echo sounding &quot;(device for measuring depths of the sea and distances and headings of ships or obstacles by means of reflected sound waves)&quot; on 22 July 1913.
Meanwhile, in France, physicist Paul Langevin (connected with Marie Curie and better known for his research work in nuclear physics) was recruited by French Navy laboratories at the beginning of World War 2 and conducted (then secret) research on active sonars for anti-submarine warfare (using a piezoelectric transmitter). His work was developed and implemented by other scientists and technnicians such as Chilowski, Florisson and Pierre Marti. Though a fully operational &quot;échosondeur&quot; (sonar) was not ready for use in wartime, there were successful trials both off Toulon and in the English Channel as early as 1920, and French patents taken for civilian uses. Oceanographic ships and French high-sea fishing assistance vessels were equipped with Langevin-Florisson and Langevin Marti recording sonars as early as the mid/late 1920s.

One of the first commercial echo sounding units was the Fessenden Fathometer, which used the Fessenden oscillator to generate sound waves. This was first installed by the Submarine Signal Company in 1924 on the M&amp;M liner SS Berkshire.

==Technique==
Distance is measured by multiplying half the time from the signal&#x27;s outgoing pulse to its return by the speed of sound in water, which is approximately 1.5 kilometres per second. The speed of sound will vary slightly depending on temperature, pressure and salinity; and for precise applications of echosounding, such as hydrography, the speed of sound must also be measured, typically by deploying a sound velocity probe in the water. Echo sounding is a special purpose application of sonar used to locate the bottom. Since a historical pre-SI unit of water depth was the fathom, an instrument used for determining water depth is sometimes called a fathometer.

Most charted ocean depths are based on an average or standard sound speed. Where greater accuracy is required, average and even seasonal standards may be applied to ocean regions. For high accuracy depths, usually restricted to special purpose or scientific surveys, a sensor may be lowered to measure the temperature, pressure and salinity. These factors are used to estimate more accurately the actual sound speed in the local water column. This technique is often used by the US Office of Coast Survey for navigational surveys of US coastal waters.

== Types ==

=== Single beam ===

A single-beam echo sounder is one of the simplest and most fundamental types of underwater sonar. They are ubiquitous in the boating world and used on a number of different marine robotic vehicles. It operates by using a transducer to emit a pulse through the water and listen for echos to return. Using that data, it&#x27;s able to determine the distance from the strongest echo, which can be the seafloor, a concrete structure, or other larger obstacle. A fishfinder is an echo sounding device used by both recreational and commercial fishers.

=== Multibeam ===
==Common use==
As well as an aid to navigation (most larger vessels will have at least a simple depth sounder), echo sounding is commonly used for fishing. Variations in elevation often represent places where fish congregate. Schools of fish will also register.

== Hydrography==
In areas where detailed bathymetry is required, a precise echo sounder may be used for the work of hydrography. There are many considerations when evaluating such a system, not limited to the vertical accuracy, resolution, acoustic beamwidth of the transmit/receive beam and the acoustic frequency of the transducer. 


The majority of hydrographic echosounders are dual frequency, meaning that a low frequency pulse (typically around 24 kHz) can be transmitted at the same time as a high frequency pulse (typically around 200 kHz). As the two frequencies are discrete, the two return signals do not typically interfere with each other. Dual frequency echosounding has many advantages, including the ability to identify a vegetation layer or a layer of soft mud on top of a layer of rock.

Most hydrographic operations use a 200 kHz transducer, which is suitable for inshore work up to 100 metres in depth. Deeper water requires a lower frequency transducer as the acoustic signal of lower frequencies is less susceptible to attenuation in the water column. Commonly used frequencies for deep water sounding are 33 kHz and 24 kHz.

The beamwidth of the transducer is also a consideration for the hydrographer, as to obtain the best resolution of the data gathered a narrow beamwidth is preferable. The higher the operating frequency, the narrower the beamwidth. Therefore, it is especially important when sounding in deep water, as the resulting footprint of the acoustic pulse can be very large once it reaches a distant sea floor.

A multispectral multibeam echosounder is an extension of a dual frequency vertical beam echosounder in that, as well as measuring two soundings directly below the sonar at two different frequencies; it measures multiple soundings at multiple frequencies, at multiple different grazing angles, and multiple different locations on the seabed. These systems are detailed further in the section called multibeam echosounder.

Echo sounders are used in laboratory applications to monitor sediment transport, scour and erosion processes in scale models (hydraulic models, flumes etc.). These can also be used to create plots of 3D contours.

===Standards for hydrographic echo sounding===

The required precision and accuracy of the hydrographic echo sounder is defined by the requirements of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) for surveys that are to be undertaken to IHO standards. These values are contained within IHO publication S44.

In order to meet these standards, the surveyor must consider not only the vertical and horizontal accuracy of the echo sounder and transducer, but the survey system as a whole. A motion sensor may be used, specifically the heave component (in single beam echosounding) to reduce soundings for the motion of the vessel experienced on the water&#x27;s surface. Once all of the uncertainties of each sensor are established, the hydrographer will create an uncertainty budget to determine whether the survey system meets the requirements laid down by IHO.

Different hydrographic organisations will have their own set of field procedures and manuals to guide their surveyors to meet the required standards. Two examples are the US Army Corps of Engineers publication EM110-2-1003, and the NOAA &#x27;Field Procedures Manual&#x27;.

<text>Nina Hamnett (14 February 1890 – 16 December 1956) was a Welsh artist and writer, and an expert on sailors&#x27; shanties, who became known as the Queen of Bohemia.

== Early life ==
Hamnett was born in the small coastal town of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Wales, eldest of the four children of George Edward Hamnett (born 1864), a captain in the Royal Army Service Corps, and Mary Elizabeth De Blois (1863/4-1947), daughter of Captain William Edwin Archdeacon, a Royal Navy officer and cartographer. Hamnett was sent to a private boarding school at Westgate-on-Sea before moving on, aged 12, to the Royal School for Daughters of Officers of the Army in Bath, Somerset from 1902 to 1905. Her father, having been dishonourably discharged from the army, took work as a taxi driver. Her education had to be funded by her aunts and by a loan against a future bequest. From 1906 to 1907 she studied at the Pelham Art School and then at the London School of Art until 1910. In 1914 she went to Montparnasse, Paris to study at Marie Vassilieff&#x27;s Academy.

While studying in London, she met and posed for Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who sculpted a series of nude bronzes. During this period she became friendly with Olivia Shakespear and Ezra Pound. She went on to have a love affair with Brzeska, and later with Amedeo Modigliani and Roger Fry.

On her first night in the Bohemian community she went to the café &quot;La Rotonde&quot; where the man at the next table introduced himself as &quot;Modigliani, painter and Jew&quot;. In addition to making close friends with Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Serge Diaghilev, and Jean Cocteau, she stayed for a while at La Ruche, where many of the leading members of the avant-garde lived at the time. In Montparnasse in 1914 she also met her future husband, the Norwegian artist Edgar de Bergen, who later changed his name to Roald Kristian to sound less German. She would remain married for forty years, but her relationship with her husband lasted only three years. In 1916 her husband was deported as an unregistered alien.

Her work was well regarded by Walter Sickert, who endeavoured to advise her on her painting, but she lacked his dedication and revelled in not taking advice. Sickert used her as a model, and also painted her with her husband in 1915–16 in &quot;The Little Tea Party: Nina Hamnett and Roald Kristian&quot;.

== Flamboyant lifestyle ==

Flamboyantly unconventional, and openly bisexual, Hamnett once danced nude on a Montparnasse café table just for the &quot;hell of it&quot;. She drank heavily, was sexually promiscuous, and kept numerous lovers and close associations within the artistic community. Very quickly, she became a well-known bohemian personality throughout Paris and modelled for many artists. Her reputation soon reached back to London, where for a time, she went to work making or decorating fabrics, clothes, murals, furniture, and rugs at the Omega Workshops, which was directed by Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell, and Duncan Grant.

Her artistic creations were widely exhibited during World War I, including at the Royal Academy in London as well as the &quot;Salon d&#x27;Automne&quot; in Paris. Back in England, she taught at the Westminster Technical Institute from 1917 to 1918. After Kristian left, she took up with another free spirit, composer E. J. Moeran.

From the mid-1920s until the end of World War II, the area known as Fitzrovia was London&#x27;s main Bohemian artistic centre. The place took its name from the popular Fitzroy Tavern on the corner of Charlotte and Windmill Streets that formed the area&#x27;s centre. Home of the café life in Fitzrovia, it was Hamnett&#x27;s favourite hangout as well as that of her friend from her home town, Augustus John, and later another Welshman, the poet Dylan Thomas.

== Later life ==
In 1932 Hamnett published &quot;Laughing Torso&quot;, a tale of her bohemian life, which became a bestseller in the UK and US. The notorious occultist Aleister Crowley unsuccessfully sued her and the publisher for libel over allegations of black magic made in her book.

Although she won the case, the situation profoundly affected her for the remainder of her life. Alcoholism would soon overtake her many talents and the tragic &quot;Queen of the Fitzroy&quot; spent a good part of the last few decades of her life at the bar (usually that of the Fitzroy Tavern), trading anecdotes for drinks.

Twenty-three years after her first book &quot;Laughing Torso&quot; was published, Hamnett, in poor health, released a follow-up book titled: &quot;Is She a Lady?&quot;.

Hamnett died in 1956 from complications after falling out of her apartment window and being impaled on the fence forty feet below. The great debate has always been whether it was a suicide attempt or merely a drunken accident. Her last words were &quot;Why don&#x27;t they let me die?&quot;

The American novelist Julius Horwitz (1920–1986) portrayed Nina Hamnett in his 1964 novel about London during World War Two, titled &quot;Can I Get There By Candlelight&quot;. Horwitz was stationed outside of London during World War Two, and was befriended by Hamnett as a young soldier when he would go into London on a three-day pass. A biography, &quot;Nina Hamnett: Queen of Bohemia&quot; by Denise Hooker, was published in 1986. In 2011, Hamnett was the subject of a short film by writer/director Chris Ward— &quot;What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor,&quot; starring Siobhan Fahey. In November 2019, the Fitzrovia Chapel hosted an exhibition called &quot;Nina Hamnett - Everybody was Furious&quot;.

<doc id="167513" wikidata="Q105006" url="?curid=167513" title="Sphalerite">
<text>Sphalerite is a sulfide mineral with the chemical formula . It is the most important ore of zinc. Sphalerite is found in a variety of deposit types, but it is primarily in sedimentary exhalative, Mississippi-Valley type, and volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. It is found in association with galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite (and other sulfides), calcite, dolomite, quartz, rhodochrosite, and fluorite.

German geologist Ernst Friedrich Glocker discovered sphalerite in 1847, naming it based on the Greek word &quot;sphaleros&quot;, meaning &quot;deceiving&quot;, due to the difficulty of identifying the mineral.

In addition to zinc, sphalerite is an ore of cadmium, gallium, germanium, and indium. Miners have been known to refer to sphalerite as zinc blende, &quot;black-jack&quot;, and &quot;ruby blende&quot;. Marmatite is an opaque black variety with a high iron content.

==Crystal habit and structure==

Sphalerite crystallizes in the face-centered cubic zincblende crystal structure, which was named after the mineral. This structure is a member of the hextetrahedral crystal class (space group &quot;F&quot;3m). In the crystal structure, both the sulfur and the zinc or iron ions occupy the points of a face-centered cubic lattice, with the two lattices displaced from each other such that the zinc and iron are tetrahedrally coordinated to the sulfur ions, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Minerals similar to sphalerite include those in the sphalerite group, consisting of sphalerite, colaradoite, hawleyite, metacinnabar, stilleite and tiemannite. The structure is closely related to the structure of diamond. The hexagonal polymorph of sphalerite is wurtzite, and the trigonal polymorph is matraite. Wurtzite is the higher temperature polymorph, stable at temperatures above . The lattice constant for zinc sulfide in the zinc blende crystal structure is 0.541 nm. Sphalerite has been found as a pseudomorph, taking the crystal structure of galena, tetrahedrite, barite and calcite. Sphalerite can have Spinel Law twins, where the twin axis is [111].

The chemical formula of sphalerite is ; the iron content generally increases with increasing formation temperature and can reach up to 40%. The material can be considered a ternary compound between the binary endpoints ZnS and FeS with composition ZnxFe(1-x)S, where x can range from 1 (pure ZnS) to 0.6.

All natural sphalerite contains concentrations of various impurities, which generally substitute for zinc in the cation position in the lattice; the most common cation impurities are cadmium, mercury and manganese, but gallium, germanium and indium may also be present in relatively high concentrations (hundreds to thousands of ppm). Cadmium can replace up to 1% of zinc and manganese is generally found in sphalerite with high iron abundances. Sulfur in the anion position can be substituted for by selenium and tellurium. The abundances of these impurities are controlled by the conditions under which the sphalerite formed; formation temperature, pressure, element availability and fluid composition are important controls.

== Properties ==

=== Physical properties ===
Sphalerite possesses perfect dodecahedral cleavage, having six cleavage planes. In pure form, it is a semiconductor, but transitions to a conductor as the iron content increases. It has a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.

It can be distinguished from similar minerals by its perfect cleavage, its distinctive resinous luster, and the reddish-brown streak of the darker varieties.

=== Optical properties ===

Pure zinc sulfide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor, with bandgap of about 3.54 electron volts, which makes the pure material transparent in the visible spectrum. Increasing iron content will make the material opaque, while various impurities can give the crystal a variety of colors. In thin section, sphalerite exhibits very high positive relief and appears colorless to pale yellow or brown, with no pleochroism.

The refractive index of sphalerite (as measured via sodium light, average wavelength 589.3 nm) ranges from 2.37 when it is pure ZnS to 2.50 when there is 40% iron content. Sphalerite is isotropic under cross-polarized light, however sphalerite can experience birefringence if intergrown with its polymorph wurtzite; the birefringence can increase from 0 (0% wurtzite) up to 0.022 (100% wurtzite).

Depending on the impurities, sphalerite will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Sphalerite can be triboluminescent. Sphalerite has a characteristic triboluminescence of yellow-orange. Typically, specimens cut into end-slabs are ideal for displaying this property.

==Varieties==
Gemmy, colorless to pale green sphalerite from Franklin, New Jersey (see Franklin Furnace), are highly fluorescent orange and/or blue under longwave ultraviolet light and are known as &quot;cleiophane&quot;, an almost pure ZnS variety. Cleiophane contains less than 0.1% of iron in the sphalerite crystal structure. Marmatite or christophite is an opaque black variety of sphalerite and its coloring is due to high quantities of iron, which can reach up to 25%; marmatite is named after Marmato mining district in Colombia and christophite is named for the St. Christoph mine in Breitenbrunn, Saxony. Both marmatite and cleiophane are not recognized by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA). Red, orange or brownish-red sphalerite is termed ruby blende or ruby zinc, whereas dark colored sphalerite is termed black-jack.

==Deposit types==
Sphalerite is amongst the most common sulfide minerals, and it is found worldwide and in a variety of deposit types. The reason for the wide distribution of sphalerite is that it appears in many types of deposits; it is found in skarns, hydrothermal deposits, sedimentary beds, volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (VMS), Mississippi-valley type deposits (MVT), granite and coal.

=== Sedimentary exhalitive ===
Approximately 50% of zinc (from sphalerite) and lead comes from Sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits, which are stratiform Pb-Zn sulfides that form at seafloor vents. The metals precipitate from hydrothermal fluids and are hosted by shales, carbonates and organic-rich siltstones in back-arc basins and failed continental rifts. The main ore minerals in SEDEX deposits are sphalerite, galena, pyrite, pyrrhotite and marcasite, with minor sulfosalts such as tetrahedrite-freibergite and boulangerite; the zinc + lead grade typically ranges between 10 and 20%. Important SEDEX mines are Red Dog in Alaska, Sullivan Mine in British Columbia, Mount Isa and Broken Hill in Australia and Mehdiabad in Iran.

=== Mississippi-Valley type ===
Similar to SEDEX, Mississippi-Valley type (MVT) deposits are also a Pb-Zn deposit which contains sphalerite. However, they only account for 15–20% of zinc and lead, are 25% smaller in tonnage than SEDEX deposits and have lower grades of 5–10% Pb + Zn. MVT deposits form from the replacement of carbonate host rocks such as dolostone and limestone by ore minerals; they are located in platforms and foreland thrust belts. Furthermore, they are stratabound, typically Phanerozoic in age and epigenetic (form after the lithification of the carbonate host rocks). The ore minerals are the same as SEDEX deposits: sphalerite, galena, pyrite, pyrrhotite and marcasite, with minor sulfosalts. Mines that contain MVT deposits include Polaris in the Canadian arctic, Mississippi River in the United States, Pine Point in Northwest Territories, and Admiral Bay in Australia.

=== Volcanogenic massive sulfide ===
Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits can be Cu-Zn- or Zn-Pb-Cu-rich, and accounts for 25% of Zn in reserves. There are various types of VMS deposits with a range of regional contexts and host rock compositions; a common characteristic is that they are all hosted by submarine volcanic rocks. They form from metals such as copper and zinc being transferred by hydrothermal fluids (modified seawater) which leach them from volcanic rocks in the oceanic crust; the metal-saturated fluid rises through fractures and faults to the surface, where it cools and deposits the metals as a VMS deposit. The most abundant ore minerals are pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and pyrrhotite. Mines that contain VMS deposits include Kidd Creek in Ontario, Urals in Russia, Troodos in Cyprus, and Besshi in Japan.

=== Localities ===
The top producers of sphalerite include the United States, Russia, Mexico, Germany, Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Peru, Kazakhstan and England.

Sources of high quality crystals include:
== Uses ==

=== Metal ore ===
Sphalerite is an important ore of zinc; around 95% of all primary zinc is extracted from sphalerite ore. However, due to its variable trace element content, sphalerite is also an important source of several other metals such as cadmium, gallium, germanium, and indium which replace zinc. The ore was originally called &quot;blende&quot; by miners (from German &quot;blind&quot; or &quot;deceiving&quot;) because it resembles galena but yields no lead.

=== Brass and bronze ===
The zinc in sphalerite is used to produce brass, an alloy of copper with 3–45% zinc. Major element alloy compositions of brass objects provide evidence that sphalerite was being used to produce brass by the Islamic as far back as the medieval ages between the 7th and 16th century CE. Sphalerite may have also been used during the cementation process of brass in Northern China during the 12th–13th century CE (Jin Dynasty). Besides brass, the zinc in sphalerite can also be used to produce certain types of bronze; bronze is dominantly copper which is alloyed with other metals such as tin, zinc, lead, nickel, iron and arsenic.
=== Other ===

* Yule Marble – sphalerite is found as inclusions in yule marble, which is used as a building material for the Lincoln Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown.
* Galvanized iron – zinc from sphalerite is used as a protective coating to prevent corrosion and rusting; it is used on power transmission towers, nails and automobiles.
* Batteries.
* Gemstone.

<text>Greenockite, also &quot;cadmium blende&quot; or &quot;cadmium ochre&quot; (obsolete) is a rare cadmium bearing metal sulfide mineral consisting of cadmium sulfide (CdS) in crystalline form. Greenockite crystallizes in the hexagonal system. It occurs as massive encrustations and as hemimorphic six-sided pyramidal crystals which vary in color from a honey yellow through shades of red to brown. The Mohs hardness is 3 to 3.5 and the specific gravity is 4.8 to 4.9.

Greenockite belongs to the wurtzite group and is isostructural with it at high temperatures. It is also isostructural with sphalerite at low temperatures. It occurs with other sulfide minerals such as sphalerite and galena, and is the only &quot;ore mineral&quot; of cadmium. Most cadmium is recovered as a byproduct of copper, zinc, and lead mining. It is also known from the lead-zinc districts of the central United States.

It was first recognized in 1840 in Bishopton, Scotland, during the cutting of a tunnel for the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. The mineral was named after the land owner Lord Greenock (1783–1859).

==Use==
Greenockite, also known as &quot;cadmium ochre&quot;, was used as a yellow pigment prior to cadmium being recognized as a toxic element. The extracted cadmium has various industrial use, such as electrical nickel-cadmium (NiCd) rechargeable batteries, electroplating, high temp alloys, plating steel and other metals that corrode easily, and use in control rods for some nuclear reactors.

<doc id="167520" wikidata="Q151957" url="?curid=167520" title="Guyot">
<text>In marine geology, a guyot (), also called a tablemount, is an isolated underwater volcanic mountain (seamount) with a flat top more than below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat summits can exceed . Guyots are most commonly found in the Pacific Ocean, but they have been identified in all the oceans except the Arctic Ocean. They are analogous to tables (such as mesas) on land. 

==History==
Guyots were first recognized in 1945 by Harry Hammond Hess, who collected data using echo-sounding equipment on a ship he commanded during World War II. His data showed that some undersea mountains had flat tops. Hess called these undersea mountains &quot;guyots&quot;, after the 19th-century geographer Arnold Henry Guyot. Hess postulated they were once volcanic islands that were beheaded by wave action, yet they are now deep under sea level. This idea was used to help bolster the theory of plate tectonics.

==Formation==
Guyots show evidence of having once been above the surface, with gradual subsidence through stages from fringed reefed mountain, coral atoll, and finally a flat-topped submerged mountain. Seamounts are made by extrusion of lavas piped upward in stages from sources within the Earth&#x27;s mantle, usually hotspots, to vents on the seafloor. The volcanism invariably ceases after a time, and other processes dominate. When an undersea volcano grows high enough to be near or breach the ocean surface, wave action or coral reef growth tend to create a flat-topped edifice. However, all ocean crust and guyots form from hot magma or rock, which cools over time. As the lithosphere that the future guyot rides on slowly cools, it becomes denser and sinks lower into Earth&#x27;s mantle, through the process of isostasy. In addition, the erosive effects of waves and currents are found mostly near the surface: the tops of guyots generally lie below this higher-erosion zone.

This is the same process that gives rise to higher seafloor topography at oceanic ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean, and deeper ocean at abyssal plains and oceanic trenches, such as the Mariana Trench. Thus, the island or shoal that will eventually become a guyot slowly subsides over millions of years. In the right climatic regions, coral growth can sometimes keep pace with the subsidence, resulting in coral atoll formation, but eventually the corals dip too deep to grow and the island becomes a guyot. The greater the amount of time that passes, the deeper the guyots become.

Seamounts provide data on movements of tectonic plates on which they ride, and on the rheology of the underlying lithosphere. The trend of a seamount chain traces the direction of motion of the lithospheric plate over a more or less fixed heat source in the underlying asthenosphere, the part of the Earth&#x27;s mantle beneath the lithosphere. There are thought to be up to an estimated 50,000 seamounts in the Pacific basin. The Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain is an excellent example of an entire volcanic chain undergoing this process, from active volcanism, to coral reef growth, to atoll formation, to subsidence of the islands and becoming guyots.

==Characteristics==
The steepness gradient of most guyots is about 20 degrees. To technically be considered a guyot or tablemount, they must stand at least tall. One guyot in particular, the Great Meteor Tablemount in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, stands at more than high, with a diameter of . However, there are many undersea mounts that can range from just less than to around . Very large oceanic volcanic constructions, hundreds of kilometres across, are called oceanic plateaus. Guyots have a mean area of , which is much larger than typical seamounts, which have a mean area of .

There are 283 known guyots in the world&#x27;s oceans, with the North Pacific having 119, the South Pacific 77, the South Atlantic 43, the Indian Ocean 28, the North Atlantic eight, the Southern Ocean six, and the Mediterranean Sea two; there are none known in the Arctic Ocean, though one is found along the Fram Strait off northeastern Greenland. Guyots are also associated with specific lifeforms and varying amounts of organic matter. Local increases in chlorophyll a, enhanced carbon incorporation rates and changes in phytoplankton species composition are associated with guyots and other seamounts.

<doc id="167524" wikidata="Q693597" url="?curid=167524" title="Herman's Hermits">
<text>Herman&#x27;s Hermits are an English rock and pop group formed in 1963 in Manchester and formerly fronted by singer Peter Noone. Known for their jaunty beat sound and Noone&#x27;s often tongue-in-cheek vocal style, the Hermits charted with numerous transatlantic hits in the UK and in America, where they ranked as one of the most successful acts in the Beatles-led British Invasion. Between March and August 1965 in the United States, the group logged twenty-four consecutive weeks in the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 with five singles, including the two number ones &quot;Mrs. Brown You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Henry VIII, I Am&quot;. 

Their other international hits in the 1960s include &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; (their sole UK number one), &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear My Heartbeat&quot;, the two covers &quot;Silhouettes&quot; and &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot;, &quot;Listen People&quot;, &quot;No Milk Today&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush&quot;, &quot;I Can Take or Leave Your Loving&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Happening&quot; and &quot;My Sentimental Friend&quot;, all of which were produced by Mickie Most. Herman&#x27;s Hermits also appeared in four films, two of which were vehicles for the band.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
Herman&#x27;s Hermits was formed from two different local bands. Keith Hopwood (Rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Karl Green (lead guitar, backing vocals), Alan Wrigley (bass), Steve Titterington (drums) and Peter Noone (lead vocals) came from the Heartbeats where Hopwood had replaced rhythm guitarist Alan Chadwick. The second-youngest member of a young group (four months older than Karl Green who was originally in the Balmains), 15-year-old Noone was already an experienced actor on the popular British TV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Derek &quot;Lek&quot; Leckenby (lead guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums) (born Jan Barry Whitwam) joined later from another local group, the Wailers. Whitwam replaced Titterington on drums, Green switched to bass guitar (replacing Wrigley) and Leckenby took over for Green as lead guitarist. After Leckenby joined the band, the group made a deal with producer Mickie Most and signed with EMI&#x27;s Columbia label in Europe and MGM Records in the United States.

The band&#x27;s name came from a resemblance, noted by a publican in Manchester, England, between Noone and Sherman from the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; cartoons. Sherman was shortened to Herman and then became Herman and His Hermits, which was soon shortened to Herman&#x27;s Hermits.

=== 1960s fame ===
Harvey Lisberg discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to London record producer Mickie Most so that he could fly to see the band play in Bolton. Most, already successful with the Animals, became the group&#x27;s producer and controlled the band&#x27;s output. He emphasised a simple and non-threatening clean-cut image.

Their chart debut was a cover of Gerry Goffin and Carole King&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; (a then-recent US Top 40 hit for Earl-Jean). In September 1964, it replaced the Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; at number one in the UK singles chart and in December reached no. 13 in the US. The Hermits never topped the British charts again. However, in America in 1965—when &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked them America&#x27;s top singles act of the year (with the Beatles at no. 2)—they topped the Hot 100 with two non-UK releases: &quot;Mrs. Brown You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot; and &quot;I’m Henry VIII, I Am” (a remake of the 1910 Cockney-style music hall song &quot;I&#x27;m Henry the Eighth, I Am&quot;). The no. 12 debut of &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; on the Hot 100 in April 1965 was the decade&#x27;s third highest (behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot;).The band played on most of its singles, including &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear My Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Brown You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Henry VIII, I Am&quot; (said at the time to be &quot;the fastest-selling song in history&quot;), &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot;, &quot;Listen People&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be Leaving&quot; and &quot;Leaning on a Lamp Post&quot;. Leckenby soloed on &quot;Henry&quot; and Hopwood played rhythm guitar on &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;. Despite the group&#x27;s competent musicianship, some subsequent singles employed session musicians – including Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Vic Flick and Bobby Graham – with contributions from the band, although the role of session players on Herman&#x27;s Hermits records has been exaggerated in the rock media and in liner notes on the 2004 ABKCO Records compilation &quot;Retrospective&quot; (which does not credit the Hermits&#x27; playing). Mickie Most used session musicians on many records he produced; this was industry practice then.

Between late 1964 and early 1968, Herman&#x27;s Hermits never failed to reach the Top 40 in the States. Six of their 11 US Top Tens were not released as A-side singles in their native UK, including the two aforementioned number ones plus &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear My Heartbeat&quot; (no. 2), &quot;Listen People&quot; (no. 3), a cover of Noel Gay&#x27;s 1937 song &quot;Leaning on a Lamp-post&quot; (no. 9, under the title &quot;Leaning on the Lamp Post&quot;) and their version of Ray Davies&#x27;s &quot;Dandy&quot; (no. 5). Conversely they hit big in Britain between 1968 and 1970 with several major hits which failed to register in America, among them the four Top Tens &quot;Sunshine Girl&quot; (no. 8), &quot;Something&#x27;s Happening&quot; (no. 6), &quot;My Sentimental Friend&quot; (no. 2) and &quot;Years May Come, Years May Go&quot; (no. 7). Their final UK hit, &quot;Lady Barbara&quot; (no. 13), released in the autumn of 1970, was credited to &#x27;Peter Noone &amp; Herman&#x27;s Hermits&#x27;.

In America the group appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. The group&#x27;s US records were released by MGM Records, which often showcased its musical performers in MGM films. The band appeared in several movies. On screen the Hermits featured opposite Connie Francis in &quot;When the Boys Meet the Girls&quot; (1965) and starred outright in &quot;Hold On!&quot; (1966) — featuring one song performed by co-star Shelley Fabares and nine by the Hermits, including the title track — and &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot; (1968). They also appeared in the 1965 British music revue film &quot;Pop Gear&quot;. P. F. Sloan wrote the Hermits soundtrack title track to the 1966 film &quot;Hold On!&quot;. Sloan and regular collaborator Steve Barri—whose songs include &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, &quot;You Baby&quot; and &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;—also co-wrote &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You&quot;, &quot;All the Things I Do for You Baby&quot; and the Top Ten hit &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot;, all recorded by Herman&#x27;s Hermits. 

Ray Davies of the Kinks wrote &quot;Dandy&quot;  – a 1966 US no. 5 hit for the Hermits – and Graham Gouldman wrote three of their 1966 hits: &quot;Listen People&quot;, &quot;No Milk Today&quot; and &quot;East West&quot;, the latter of which was covered in 1989 by singer and Hermits fan Morrissey.

In November 1966 in the UK, after two consecutive Top 20 hits, the Hermits returned to the Top Ten with &quot;No Milk Today&quot;, backed with &quot;My Reservation&#x27;s Been Confirmed&quot;. For the US release of &quot;No Milk Today&quot; in 1967, MGM backed it with &quot;There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush&quot;. The latter climbed to no. 4 in March 1967. &quot;No Milk Today&quot; peaked at no. 35, though it was linked to &quot;Hush&quot; on local charts nationwide. &quot;No Milk Today&quot; also scored in its own right, including success on San Francisco Top 40 station KFRC, where in April 1967, it reached no. 1, ranking 6 for the year.

In 1966 the group was nominated for three Grammy awards including Best New Artist of 1965—they lost to singer Tom Jones—and two for their chart-topper &quot;Mrs. Brown You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;: Best Performance by a Vocal Group and Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Performance – Group (Vocal or Instrumental). According to Noone and Hopwood, &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; was recorded as an afterthought in two takes – using two microphones, with Hopwood on guitar, Green on bass guitar and Whitwam on drums. Noone and the band deliberately emphasised their English accents on the record, never intended to be a single. Hopwood recalls playing a Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar in the studio, with its strings muted to create the distinctive sound. When playing the song live, Hopwood often used a Rickenbacker guitar with a rag tied around the bridge to duplicate the sound, which can be seen clearly in old performance clips.

The 1967 album &quot;Blaze&quot; received critical acclaim, but barely made the Top 100 in the US and did not chart in the UK. The album included original songs by Leckenby, Whitwam, Hopwood, Green and Noone, including &quot;Ace King Queen Jack&quot; and the psychedelic &quot;Moonshine Man&quot;.

In 1968, Hopwood and Leckenby eventually started a music company, Pluto Music, which is still in business as of 2023, working primarily on commercial and animation soundtracks. 

A 1969 two-disc album &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Party&quot; was never released.

=== 1970s–present ===
Peter Noone left in 1971 to pursue a solo career in the United States. In 1973, a cover of the song &quot;(I Think I&#x27;m Over) Getting Over You&quot; went to number 63 on the Adult Contemporary Chart.

When Noone left the group in 1971, the Hermits continued, first with singer Pete Cowap. They signed with RCA Records in the UK and, as &quot;The Hermits&quot;, recorded two singles at Strawberry Studios and an unreleased album (under the name &quot;Sourmash&quot;) produced by Eric Stewart. The group subsequently cut one-off singles for Private Stock, Buddah, and Roulette in 1975, 1976, and 1977 without significant success. Noone did return to front Herman&#x27;s Hermits during a 1973–1974 U.S. multi-artist tour of &quot;British Invasion&quot; acts, after which Whitwam, Leckenby, and Green (who assumed lead vocal duties until his 1980 retirement) continued to tour with newer members, including Rod Gerrard (formerly with Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders and Salford Jets). Hopwood left in 1972.

Karl Green left the band in 1980 to spend more time with his family. He later opened a plumbing and tiling business in London.

In 1986, the Hermits opened for the Hep Stars and the Monkees on their 1980s reunion tours of the US.

Hopwood has since become a composer of scores for film and television. Green has become a manager of sound systems for concert venues along London&#x27;s South Bank.

Leckenby died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1994, leaving Whitwam as the only original member of the band. Noone continues to play solo shows billed as &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits starring Peter Noone&quot;.

On 8 June 1997, Hopwood, Green, and Whitwam reunited to play a one-off reunion concert with Noone.

Karl Green has noted that he preferred harder rock but was grateful for the hand he was dealt. Many of the band&#x27;s singles and album tracks were written by some of the top songwriters of the day, but Noone, Leckenby, Hopwood and Green contributed lesser-known songs such as &quot;My Reservation&#x27;s Been Confirmed&quot;, &quot;Take Love, Give Love&quot;, &quot;Marcel&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;For Love&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Baby&quot;, &quot;Busy Line&quot;, Moonshine Man&quot;, &quot;I Know Why&quot; and &quot;Gaslight Street&quot;. &quot;I Know Why&quot; enjoyed a limited A-side release.

The &quot;Sourmash&quot; album from 1972 was finally released in 2000 under the title &quot;A Whale of a Tale! And Others&quot;.

Scottish-born keyboardist Robert Birrell joined in May 2002. He was diagnosed with cancer a few years into being a Hermit, and Kevan Lingard was added in on keys in 2005 to fill in for dates Birrell couldn&#x27;t attend. Robert eventually left in September 2006 and later died on 18 October 2008.

Paul Cornwell (guitarist from 2013 to 2019) was added into Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich in January 2015 on bass as &quot;Dozy II&quot; following the death of original Dozy Trevor Ward-Davies.

In 2019, Noone won the &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; award at the Casino Entertainment Awards. In 2023, Herman&#x27;s Hermits Starring Peter Noone were scheduled to perform in over 100 concerts in countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and France.

Geoff Foot, who, with the exception of Whitwam, was the longest serving member, left the Hermits after playing his last gig with them at a Butlin&#x27;s on Saturday, 14 January 2023. Foot was replaced by John Summerton. The group has played some concerts since that time, however, including one on 23 July 2023 in New Jersey.

Also, in 2023, Tony Hancox left the band after six years. He was replaced by Tony Young of Gerry&#x27;s Pacemakers. Hancox&#x27;s last performance with the Hermits was at the Leeds Grand Theatre on 29 October 2023, when they were touring in the &quot;Sixties Gold&quot; nostalgia tour. In turn, Hancox filled Young&#x27;s place in Gerry&#x27;s Pacemakers.
As of April 2024, the current lineup of Herman&#x27;s Hermits is: Barry Whitwam (drummer since 1964), Jamie Thurston (formerly of The Tornados starring Dave Watts; bassist and lead vocalist since 2020), John Summerton (formerly of Flintlock; guitarist since January 2023), and Tony Young (formerly of Gerry and the Pacemakers; keyboardist since October 2023).

== Controversies and legal disputes ==

=== Disputes over recording contributions ===
Continuing acrimony among former members of Herman&#x27;s Hermits has increased the amount of disinformation about the group&#x27;s role on their records; the late Derek Leckenby, in particular, was a skilled guitarist. Mickie Most commented on the VH1 &quot;My Generation: Herman&#x27;s Hermits&quot; episode that the Hermits &quot;played on a lot of their records, and some they didn&#x27;t.&quot; The group played on all their UK and US no. 1 hits (&quot;I&#x27;m Into Something Good&quot;, &quot;Mrs Brown You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Henry VIII, I Am&quot;), on most of their US Top Ten singles, on several other singles and most album cuts. According to Peter Noone, Leckenby played the muted lead on &quot;This Door Swings Both Ways&quot;.

The riff in &quot;Silhouettes&quot; variously has been credited to Jimmy Page, Big Jim Sullivan and Vic Flick; however, according to Keith Hopwood and Karl Green, Leckenby replaced Flick in the studio and played the signature riff under Most&#x27;s direction. According to Hopwood, Green and Noone, Jimmy Page played on the single &quot;Wonderful World&quot; (although Big Jim Sullivan lists the song as part of a session he played); both may have added to the backing track. Several writers have claimed that session players played on &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot;; according to the surviving band members, the song was recorded on a two-track recorder, with only a piano player in addition to the Hermits.

=== Legal disputes over &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits&quot; name ===
Legal disputes between Whitwam and Noone have occurred since the 2000s. In 2003, members were forced to rename the band &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits starring Barry Whitwam&quot; when they tour in North America, but remain billed as &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits&quot; elsewhere. 

One such case in 2009 had the band sued by Peter Noone when advertisements for their tour in the US had &quot;Herman&#x27;s Hermits&quot; in large text, with &quot;starring/featuring Barry Whitwam&quot; in small text underneath, which would not have been noticed by people looking at the advertisement, possibly misleading them into thinking that they were seeing an ad for Noone. A lawsuit unravelled, and Whitwam ultimately decided to stop touring in the United States with his band:

<text>Dornbirn () is a city in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg. It is the administrative centre for the district of Dornbirn, which also includes the town of Hohenems, and the market town Lustenau.

Dornbirn is the largest city in Vorarlberg and the tenth largest city in Austria. It is an important commercial and shopping centre.

==Geography==
===Location===
Dornbirn is located at 437 metres above sea level in the Alpine Rhine Valley, at the foot of the Karren mountain, part of the Bregenz Forest Mountain chain at the edge of the Eastern Alps. It is near the borders to Switzerland, Germany and Liechtenstein. The Dornbirner Ach river flows through the town and later into Lake Constance.

===Municipal structure===

Dornbirn once consisted only of four &quot;quarters&quot; or precincts: Markt, Hatlerdorf, Oberdorf and Haselstauden. By the 20th century, two new precincts to the west were formed: Rohrbach (formerly a part of Markt) and Schoren (formerly a part of Hatlerdorf), thus bringing the total number of precincts to six.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
The town of Dornbirn itself constitutes almost 70% of the surface of the district Dornbirn and borders on numerous other municipalities: Hohenems and Lustenau, 15 municipalities of the Bregenz District: (Lauterach, Wolfurt, Schwarzach, Bildstein, Alberschwende, Schwarzenberg, Reuthe, Mellau, Damüls), and four of the Feldkirch District: (Laterns, Zwischenwasser, Viktorsberg, Fraxern).
==History==
The earliest evidence of human presence in the Dornbirn area dates from the Mesolithic era. The name &quot;Dornbirn&quot; derives from &#x27;torrin puirron&#x27;, meaning the &#x27;Settlement of Torro&#x27; (the name of an Alemannic farmer living there), and thus has nothing to do with &quot;pears&quot; (German &quot;Birnen&quot;), although this fruit is prominently portrayed on the town emblem. &#x27;Torrin puirron&#x27; is mentioned for the first time in 895, in a document from St. Gallen (Switzerland).

Dornbirn became part of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1380. In 1793 it was elevated to a market community. It was not given municipal status until 1901. In 1932 the mountain village of Ebnit was annexed. In 1969 Dornbirn became the seat of the new Dornbirn district administrative authority.

<text>Hohenems (High Alemannic: &quot;Ems&quot;) is a town in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg in the Dornbirn district. It lies in the middle of the Austrian part of the Rhine valley. With a population of 16,946, it is the fifth largest municipality in Vorarlberg and currently has the fastest population growth in the state. Hohenems&#x27; attractions include a Renaissance palace dating back to the 16th century, a Jewish history museum, and the old town center.

==Geography==
The town is located at above sea level, about south of Lake Constance. Hohenems extends for from north to south and from west to east. Its total area is , of which 42% is covered with forest. The oxbow lake of the river Rhine in the west, forming the border of Austria as well as EU to Switzerland, and the mountainside in the east is at the narrowest point of the Austrian Rhine valley. The &quot;Schlossberg&quot; (&quot;castle mountain&quot;), elevation , offers a distinctive backdrop to the town center.

Hohenems is divided into the neighborhoods of Markt (centre), Oberklien and Unterklien (north), Hohenems-Reute (east), Schwefel (south) and Herrenried (west). It is surrounded by six other communities, Lustenau and Dornbirn in the Dornbirn district (north and east), Fraxern, Götzis and Altach in the Feldkirch district (south) and Diepoldsau in the Swiss canton St. Gallen (west).

==History==

The summit of the &quot;Schlossberg&quot; rock, within 45 minutes walk from the town center, is crowned by the ruins of &quot;Alt-Ems&quot;, a castle dating back to the 9th century CE. From the 12th century it was among the largest fortifications in the south of the German kingdom. The stronghold was very extensive, with a length of up to 800 m (2,625 ft) and a width of 85 m (280 ft). It reached its peak of fame from the 13th to 16th centuries, as a residence of many lords and knights of Hohenems. As they were loyal &quot;ministeriales&quot; of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the castle served as a prison for notable prisoners like the Norman king William III of Sicily, who probably died there in 1198.

Hohenems was granted municipal rights and liberties (German &quot;Stadtrecht&quot;) in 1333, but the town did not make use of these rights for 650 years until, in 1983, the government of Vorarlberg granted Hohenems full status as a &quot;municipality&quot;.

The Burg Neu-Ems (also called &quot;Schloss Glopper&quot;), built in 1343, is located on a mountain promontory near Alt-Ems. In 1407 both castles were destroyed during the Appenzell Wars, but rebuilt shortly afterwards. Burg Neu-Ems is still intact today and is the private property of the Waldburg-Zeil family.
The Renaissance palace stands at the foot of the Schlossberg and dominates the main square of town, the &quot;Schlossplatz.&quot; It was built from 1562 to 1567, according to plans by architect Martino Longhi the Elder at the initiative of Cardinal Marcus Sittich Hohenems (Altemps), architect who also designed the Cardinal’s palace in Rome. Religious wars and a plague decimated the population and devastated the area over the next century, ironically the time of the greatest power of the (Protestant) Counts of Hohenems, when they acquired Vaduz Castle from what was later to become Liechtenstein. Two manuscripts of the Nibelungenlied were found in Hohenems, in 1755 and 1779, in the palace&#x27;s library.

The first café (1797), bank and printing office (1920) of Vorarlberg were opened in Hohenems.

===Jewish heritage===
The Jewish community in Hohenems had its beginnings with a charter in 1617. Soon thereafter a synagogue, a ritual bath (mikvah), a school and a poorhouse were built. A cemetery was established on the southern outskirts of town. Jewish economic activity in the town resulted in the first coffee house in 1797, and in 1841, the first bank and insurance company in Vorarlberg. The Hohenems Jewish community celebrated its golden era around 1862, with nearly 600 Jewish citizens, 12% of the population. The Jewish presence in town was terminated in 1942 with the deportation of the last remaining Jew, Frieda Nagelberg, to Vienna and eventually to Izbica. Recently three Jewish people have moved into Hohenems.
The synagogue survived the Kristallnacht without damage. It was acquired by the municipality after the war and converted into a fire station. All objects pertaining to its use as a synagogue were removed or destroyed. In 2001 the synagogue was renovated and it now used as a cultural centre. The Jewish quarter, which has had historical preservation status since 1996, includes numerous townhouses and mansions surrounding the synagogue. Along with the former &quot;Christengasse&quot; (&quot;Christian Lane&quot;), renamed &quot;Marktstrasse&quot; (Market Street), it forms the urban core of Hohenems.

In 1991, the Jewish Museum Hohenems was opened in a mansion in the center of the Jewish quarter. The museum commemorates the history of the Jewish community in Hohenems. The many remaining objects it exhibits bear witness to the former flourishing Jewish community in Hohenems. As part of its remembrance culture, a section of the museum is dedicated to the memory of the darkest chapter in Vorarlberg history – the national socialist period, and its attempts to eliminate all traces of Jewish culture in Vorarlberg and beyond. The Jewish cemetery south of the town dates to the first Jewish settlement in 1617 and is still in use today. It contains more than 500 graves, with 370 surviving gravestones.

==Population==
==Infrastructure==
Apart from the historical sites, the town center is rapidly developing a modest urban ambience, with hotels, shops, and restaurants. On the outskirts of town there are large businesses, with branches of multinational retail chains and a ten-screen multiplex. On the way to the mountain village &quot;Reute&quot;, high above Hohenems, there is a unique museum – &quot;Stoffels Säge-Mühle&quot; (&quot;Stoffel&#x27;s Sawmill&quot;) – which presents the history of saw milling and mill grinding technologies.

Hohenems has several leisure amenities. In the mountain area there is a small ski resort (&quot;Schuttannen&quot;) and a rock-climbing area called &quot;Löwenzähne&quot; (&quot;Lion&#x27;s Teeth&quot;) with walls up to 150 m (500 ft) and level 10. There also is a wide range of hiking trails and mountain biking routes nearby. The town boasts of the largest recreational centers (13 hectares) in Vorarlberg, situated on the banks of the river Rhine&#x27;s oxbow lake.
One section of the hospital in Hohenems was originally built in 1908, and has now been totally renovated. Called the &quot;Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Krankenhaus&quot; (&quot;Empress Elisabeth hospital&quot;), it is a magnificent example of Art Nouveau architecture. It hosts the palliative care unit. The modern General Hospital was built in 1972.

===Transport===

Two state roads, the &quot;Vorarlberger Strasse&quot; L190 and the &quot;Rheinstrasse&quot; L203 cross the municipality from north to south. The L46 leads from the town center to the customs buildings at the border to Switzerland. Hohenems has motorway access to the &quot;Rheintal/Walgau-Autobahn&quot; (Austrian A14/European route E60).

Hohenems railway station is on the main west–east route connecting the Vorarlberg railway line () in the directions Bregenz and Innsbruck. The train system is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB).

The sole airfield in Vorarlberg, with a 630 m (2,066 ft) runway, is located within the municipal borders 

== Trivia ==
Hohenems was one of the locations in the Swiss-Austrian film &quot;Akte Grüninger&quot;.

The town is the site of the climax of Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s novel about the 1914 outbreak of the First World War, &quot;The Second Seal&quot; (1950).

Bernard Levin mentions Hohenems in his book &quot;Conducted Tour&quot; (1982) as being the location of a music festival where all the works of Franz Schubert were performed in chronological order.

<text>Bludenz (; Alemannic: &quot;Bludaz&quot;) is a town in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg with around 15,000 inhabitants. It is the administrative seat of the Bludenz District, which encompasses about half of Vorarlberg&#x27;s territory.

==Geography==
The town is located on the Ill River, a direct tributary of the Rhine. It is surrounded by the ranges of the Bregenz Forest Mountains in the north, and by the Rätikon and Silvretta ranges in the south. Bludenz lies at the meeting point of five valleys: Walgau and Montafon (Ill), Brandnertal, Klostertal up to Arlberg Pass, and Großes Walsertal.

Bludenz is a popular starting point for hiking and mountain-biking in spring, summer, and autumn. It is located not far from many skiing resorts (e.g., Brand and Lech).

Major companies are Mondelēz International (Milka chocolate) and the Fohrenburg brewery which was established in 1881.
==History==
Archaeological finds indicate that settlement in the area of Bludenz began in the Bronze Age, and continued throughout the La Tène era.

Bludenz itself was first mentioned in the year 830 CE in an urbarium of the Raetian estates within the Carolingian Empire. The town was established by the comital Werdenberg dynasty; town privileges were granted in 1274. A stay by the Habsburg Duke Frederick IV of Austria, who had just received an imperial ban at the Council of Constance, is documented from 30 March 1416. Four years later, Bludenz passed into the Further Austrian possessions of the Habsburg dynasty.

The Bludenz district headquarters are situated in the Castle of Gayenhofen, built in the 18th century.

== Education ==
High schools in Blundenz include Bundesgymnasium und Bundesrealgymnasium Bludenz.

== Culture ==
The Alpinale Short Film Festival was founded in 1985 in Bludenz. In August, around 40 international short films are shown to a crowd of 1,000 visitors. Related events are the Alpinale Ländle Tour, the Vorarlberger Short Film Night, and the Horror Short Film Night in autumn. The festival has taken place in Bludenz from 1985 to 2002, and from 2020 onwards. Between 2003 and 2019, it was held in Nenzing.

The Brewery Museum Fohrenburg displays the development of the Fohrenburg brewery and beer brewing in Bludenz in general. Historical photographs, old beer bottles and labels, earlier advertising motifs and equipment for beer production allow a look back at more than 130 years of Fohrenburg&#x27;s brewing history.

The Bludenzer Tage zeitgemäßer Musik is an international contemporary music festival annually held in autumn/winter. It was founded by Hans Peter Frick, later artistic directors were Georg Friedrich Haas, Wolfram Schurig and Alexander Moosbrugger and the young Italian composer, Clara Iannotta, who been responsible for the programme since 2014.

<text>Vito Antuofermo (; born February 9, 1953) is an Italian American actor and retired professional boxer. He is a former undisputed World Middleweight Champion.

== Background ==
Antuofermo was born in Italy, in the town of Palo del Colle, about inland from the city of Bari. His family moved to the United States when he was 17 years old. Antuofermo learned how to fight in the tough areas of New York City. By his teens, he had made up his mind that he wanted to be a professional boxer.

He has lived in Howard Beach, Queens.

== Amateur career ==
Antuofermo won the 1970 New York Golden Gloves Championship, defeating Thomas Chestnut in the finals. In 1971, Antuofermo was defeated by future Light Heavyweight Champion Eddie Gregory in the finals of the Open division. Antuofermo trained at the Police Athletic Leagues Sweeney Center in Brooklyn, New York.

==Professional career==
Antuofermo had a propensity to cut easily, especially around the eyebrows. In between rounds in his fights, as much attention (if not more) was given to Vito patching up cuts on his face as it was giving him advice and instructions.

In 1979, Antuofermo became World Middleweight Champion by beating defending champion Hugo Corro by a decision in 15 rounds at Monte Carlo. According to an article in &quot;The Ring&quot;, Howard Cosell, who was working on that fight&#x27;s live broadcast to the US, was telling viewers that Corro was, in his opinion, way ahead on the judges&#x27; cards. When someone on the American television crew found out it was Antuofermo who was actually leading on the cards, Cosell then began to say he had Antuofermo ahead. All three judges&#x27; scorecards were very close, each showing a tight, one-point margin: 143–142, 146–145 in Antuofermo&#x27;s favor, and 146–145 in Corro&#x27;s favor.

On the morning after winning the title, Antuofermo and his crew were driving to a small vacation in Italy, when he saw a car fly off a bridge under which they were passing. The car landed right in front of him, but luckily the accident did not injure any occupants in Antuofermo&#x27;s car. He was so shocked that he kept driving and never found out what happened to the occupants of that car. He came back to his senses about 20 minutes later.

On November 30, 1979, Antuofermo defended his title against Marvelous Marvin Hagler in Las Vegas, Nevada, the fight resulting in a controversial 15-round draw. Judge Duane Ford scored the bout in Hagler&#x27;s favor, 145–141. Judge Dalby Shirley scored it for Antuofermo, 144–142. Judge Hal Miller had it even at 143–143. The draw enabled Antuofermo to retain his title. In his next defense, against Alan Minter, also in Las Vegas, he lost the title by a 15-round split decision. The bout featured a wild disparity in scoring with a Venezuelan judge scoring the fight for Antuofermo while a British judge had Minter winning 13 of the 15 rounds. They had a rematch in London on June 28, 1980. Minter retained the crown by a TKO (on cuts) in eight rounds.

Antuofermo kept fighting and winning and, after Hagler won the title from Minter in 1980, Antuofermo was given another chance to regain the World Middleweight Championship. In front of an HBO Boxing audience and a full house at Hagler&#x27;s native Boston&#x27;s Boston Garden, Antuofermo this time lost by a TKO on cuts in the fourth round.

After several attempts at becoming a top middleweight again, Antuofermo retired from boxing in 1985.

Apart from Corro, other boxers he beat included world champions Eckhard Dagge, Denny Moyer and Emile Griffith.

In 1992, Michael Franzese, a Caporegime of the Colombo crime family, testified that Antoufermo had been under the control of mobsters including Andy Russo. Franzese stated that the outcome of many of Antuofermo&#x27;s fights was pre-determined so that organized crime figures could safely bet, but that the fights with Marvelous Marvin Hagler were not fixed.

== Life after boxing ==
After retirement, Antuofermo began to pursue an acting career. In 1990, he landed a small role in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; as the chief bodyguard of gangster Joey Zasa. He has landed several small speaking roles in movies and television shows since, including the critically acclaimed television show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as a mobster. He has also done many theater plays.

Antuofermo also made television commercials for Old Spice deodorant.

Antuofermo&#x27;s record reads 50 wins, 7 losses and 2 draws, with 21 wins by knockout. Vito Antuofermo&#x27;s second oldest son, Pasquale Antuofermo, boxed as an amateur, but never turned pro. He now owns a successful landscaping company that operates in Long Island, New York.

<doc id="167538" wikidata="Q1771942" url="?curid=167538" title="United Fruit Company">
<text>The United Fruit Company (later the United Brands Company) was an American multinational corporation that traded in tropical fruit (primarily bananas) grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the United States and Europe. The company was formed in 1899 from the merger of the Boston Fruit Company with Minor C. Keith&#x27;s banana-trading enterprises. It flourished in the early and mid-20th century, and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, and the West Indies. Although it competed with the Standard Fruit Company (later Dole Food Company) for dominance in the international banana trade, it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions, some of which came to be called banana republics – such as Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.

United Fruit had a deep and long-lasting effect on the economic and political development of several Latin American countries. Critics often accused it of exploitative neocolonialism, and they described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of the so-called banana republics. After a period of financial decline, United Fruit merged with Eli M. Black&#x27;s AMK in 1970 to become the United Brands Company. In 1984, Carl Lindner, Jr. transformed United Brands into the present-day Chiquita Brands International.
==Corporate history==

===Early years===
In 1871, U.S. railroad entrepreneur Henry Meiggs signed a contract with the government of Costa Rica to build a railroad connecting the capital city of San José to the port of Limón in the Caribbean. Meiggs was assisted in the project by his young nephew, Minor C. Keith, who took over Meiggs&#x27;s business concerns in Costa Rica after his death in 1877. Keith began experimenting with the planting of bananas as a cheap source of food for his workers.

When the Costa Rican government defaulted on its payments in 1882, Keith had to borrow £1.2 million from London banks and from private investors to continue the difficult engineering project. In exchange for this and for renegotiating Costa Rica&#x27;s own debt, in 1884, the administration of President Próspero Fernández Oreamuno agreed to give Keith of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. The railroad was completed in 1890, but the flow of passengers proved insufficient to finance Keith&#x27;s debt. However, the sale of bananas grown in his lands and transported first by train to Limón, then by ship to the United States, proved very lucrative. Keith eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and along the Caribbean coast of Colombia.

===United Fruit (1899–1970)===
In 1899, Keith lost $1.5 million when Hoadley and Co., a New York City broker, went bankrupt. He then traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, to participate in the merger of his banana trading company, Tropical Trading and Transport Company, with the rival Boston Fruit Company. Boston Fruit had been established by Lorenzo Dow Baker, a sailor who, in 1870, had bought his first bananas in Jamaica, and by Andrew W. Preston. Preston&#x27;s lawyer, Bradley Palmer, had devised a scheme for the solution of the participants&#x27; cash flow problems and was in the process of implementing it. 
The merger formed the United Fruit Company, based in Boston, with Preston as president and Keith as vice-president. Palmer became a permanent member of the executive committee and for long periods of time the director. From a business point of view, Bradley Palmer was United Fruit. Preston brought to the partnership his plantations in the West Indies, a fleet of steamships, and his market in the U.S. Northeast. Keith brought his plantations and railroads in Central America and his market in the U.S. South and Southeast. At its founding, United Fruit was capitalized at $11.23 million. The company at Palmer&#x27;s direction proceeded to buy, or buy a share in, 14 competitors, assuring them of 80% of the banana import business in the United States, then their main source of income. The company catapulted into financial success. Bradley Palmer overnight became a much-sought-after expert in business law, as well as a wealthy man. He later became a consultant to presidents and an adviser to Congress.

In 1900, the United Fruit Company produced &quot;The Golden Caribbean: A Winter Visit to the Republics of Colombia, Costa Rica, Spanish Honduras, Belize and the Spanish Main – via Boston and New Orleans&quot; written and illustrated by Henry R. Blaney. The travel book featured landscapes and portraits of the inhabitants pertaining to the regions where the United Fruit Company possessed land. It also described the voyage of the United Fruit Company&#x27;s steamer, and Blaney&#x27;s descriptions and encounters of his travels.

In 1901, the government of Guatemala hired the United Fruit Company to manage the country&#x27;s postal service, and in 1913 the United Fruit Company created the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company. By 1930, it had absorbed more than 20 rival firms, acquiring a capital of $215 million and becoming the largest employer in Central America. In 1930, Sam Zemurray (nicknamed &quot;Sam the Banana Man&quot;) sold his Cuyamel Fruit Company to United Fruit and retired from the fruit business. By then, the company held a major role in the national economies of several countries and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. This led to serious labor disputes by the Costa Rican peasants, involving more than 30 separate unions and 100,000 workers, in the 1934 Great Banana Strike, one of the most significant actions of the era by trade unions in Costa Rica.

By the 1930s the company owned of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase &quot;banana republic&quot;.

In 1933, concerned that the company was mismanaged and that its market value had plunged, Zemurray staged a hostile takeover. Zemurray moved the company&#x27;s headquarters to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was based. United Fruit went on to prosper under Zemurray&#x27;s management; Zemurray resigned as president of the company in 1951.

In addition to many other labor actions, the company faced two major strikes of workers in South and Central America, in Colombia in 1928 and the Great Banana Strike of 1934 in Costa Rica. The latter was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective trade unions in Costa Rica since the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938. Labor laws in most banana production countries began to be tightened in the 1930s. United Fruit Company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and often refused to negotiate with strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws.

In 1952, the government of Guatemala began expropriating unused United Fruit Company land to landless peasants. The company responded by intensively lobbying the U.S. government to intervene and mounting a misinformation campaign to portray the Guatemalan government as communist. In 1954, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency armed, funded, and trained a military force that deposed the democratically elected government of Guatemala and installed a pro-business military dictatorship.

In 1967, it acquired the A&amp;W Restaurants.

===United Brands (1970–1984)===
Corporate raider Eli M. Black bought 733,000 shares of United Fruit in 1968, becoming the company&#x27;s largest shareholder. In June 1970, Black merged United Fruit with his own public company, AMK (owner of meat packer John Morrell), to create the United Brands Company. United Fruit had far less cash than Black had counted on, and Black&#x27;s mismanagement led to United Brands becoming crippled with debt. The company&#x27;s losses were exacerbated by Hurricane Fifi in 1974, which destroyed many banana plantations in Honduras. On February 3, 1975, Black committed suicide by jumping out a window from the 44th floor of the Pan Am Building in New York City. Later that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exposed a scheme by United Brands (dubbed Bananagate) to bribe Honduran President Oswaldo López Arellano with $1.25 million, plus the promise of another $1.25 million upon the reduction of certain export taxes. Trading in United Brands stock was halted, and López was ousted in a military coup.

===Chiquita Brands International===

After Black&#x27;s suicide, Cincinnati-based American Financial Group, one of billionaire Carl Lindner, Jr.&#x27;s companies, bought into United Brands. In August 1984, Lindner took control of the company and renamed it Chiquita Brands International. The headquarters was moved to Cincinnati in 1985. By 2019, the company&#x27;s main offices left the United States and relocated to Switzerland.

Throughout most of its history, United Fruit&#x27;s main competitor was the Standard Fruit Company, now the Dole Food Company.

==Reputation==
The United Fruit Company is reported to have been involved in bribing government officials in exchange for preferential treatment and working to consolidate monopolies. Latin American journalists sometimes referred to the company as &quot;el pulpo&quot; (&quot;the octopus&quot;), and leftist parties in Latin America encouraged the company&#x27;s workers to strike. Criticism of the United Fruit Company became a staple of the discourse of the communist parties in several Latin American countries, where its activities were often interpreted as illustrating Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s theory of capitalist imperialism. Major writers in Latin America, such as Carlos Luis Fallas of Costa Rica, Ramón Amaya Amador of Honduras, Miguel Ángel Asturias and Augusto Monterroso of Guatemala, Gabriel García Márquez of Colombia, Carmen Lyra of Costa Rica, and Pablo Neruda of Chile, denounced the company in their literature:

The business practices of United Fruit were also frequently criticized by journalists, politicians, and artists in the United States. Little Steven released a song in 1987 called &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot;, with lyrics that referred to a hard life for a company &quot;far away&quot;, and whose accompanying video depicted orange groves worked by peasants overseen by wealthy managers. The lyrics and scenery are generic, but United Fruit (or its successor Chiquita) was reputedly the target.

US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell negotiated land giveaways to the United Fruit Company in Guatemala and Honduras. John Foster Dulles&#x27;s brother, Allen Dulles, who was head of the CIA under Eisenhower, also did legal work for United Fruit. The Dulles brothers and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell were on the United Fruit payroll for thirty-eight years. Recent research has uncovered the names of multiple other government officials who received benefits from United Fruit:

==History in Latin America==
The United Fruit Company (UFCO) owned huge tracts of land in the Caribbean lowlands. It also dominated regional transportation networks through its International Railways of Central America and its Great White Fleet of steamships. In addition, UFCO branched out in 1913 by creating the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company. UFCO&#x27;s policies of acquiring tax breaks and other benefits from host governments led to it building enclave economies in the regions, in which a company&#x27;s investment is largely self-contained for its employees and overseas investors and the benefits of the export earnings are not shared with the host country.

One of the company&#x27;s primary tactics for maintaining market dominance was to control the distribution of arable land. UFCO claimed that hurricanes, blight and other natural threats required them to hold extra land or reserve land. In practice, what this meant was that UFCO was able to prevent the government from distributing land to peasants who wanted a share of the banana trade. The fact that the UFCO relied so heavily on manipulating land use rights to maintain their market dominance had a number of long-term consequences for the region. For the company to maintain its unequal land holdings it often required government concessions. And this in turn meant that the company had to be politically involved in the region even though it was an American company. In fact, the heavy-handed involvement of the company in often-corrupt governments created the term &quot;banana republic&quot;, which represents a servile dictatorship. The term &quot;Banana Republic&quot; was coined by American writer O. Henry.

===Environmental effects===
The United Fruit Company&#x27;s entire process of creating a plantation to farming the banana and the effects of these practices created noticeable environmental degradation when it was a thriving company. Infrastructure built by the company was constructed by clearing out forests, filling in low, swampy areas, and installing sewage, drainage, and water systems. Ecosystems that existed on these lands were destroyed, devastating biodiversity. With a loss in biodiversity, other natural processes within nature necessary for plant and animal survival are shut down.

Techniques used for farming were at fault for loss of biodiversity and harm to the land as well. To create farmland, the United Fruit Company would either clear forests (as mentioned) or would drain marshlands to reduce avian habitats and to create &quot;good&quot; soil for banana plant growth. The most common practice in farming was called the &quot;shifting plantation agriculture&quot;. This is done by using produced soil fertility and hydrological resources in the most intense manner, then relocating when yields fell, and pathogens followed banana plants.

In addition to the loss of biodiversity, many new species were introduced into the environment including the largemouth bass. The largemouth bass, a popular fish in the United States, has been exported and introduced to waters worldwide. Lake Yojoa in Honduras was home to many largemouth bass not native to the region. A group of North American United Fruit Company employees, wanting to indulge in their love for fishing, introduced 1,800 largemouth bass from Florida. From 1954–55 to about 1970, the bass population greatly impacted the native fish population, and continued to grow. The 55-gallon drums imported by the UFCO has led this American export to grow and become genetically superior in the warmer and longer growing seasons.

===Guatemala===

Although UFCO sometimes promoted the development of the nations where it operated, its long-term effects on their economy and infrastructure were often devastating. In Central America, the Company built extensive railroads and ports, provided employment and transportation, and created numerous schools for the people who lived and worked on Company land. On the other hand, it allowed vast tracts of land under its ownership to remain uncultivated and, in Guatemala and elsewhere, it discouraged the government from building highways, which would have lessened the profitable transportation monopoly of the railroads under its control. UFCO also destroyed at least one of those railroads upon leaving its area of operation.

In 1954, the Guatemalan government of Colonel Jacobo Árbenz, elected in 1950, was toppled by forces led by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas who invaded from Honduras. Commissioned by the Eisenhower administration, this military operation was armed, trained and organized by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (see &quot;Operation PBSuccess&quot;). The directors of United Fruit Company (UFCO) had lobbied to convince the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that Colonel Árbenz intended to align Guatemala with the Eastern Bloc. Besides the disputed issue of Árbenz&#x27;s allegiance to communism, UFCO was being threatened by the Árbenz government&#x27;s agrarian reform legislation and new Labor Code. UFCO was the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala, and the Árbenz government&#x27;s land reform program included the expropriation of 40% of UFCO land. U.S. officials had little proof to back their claims of a growing communist threat in Guatemala; however, the relationship between the Eisenhower administration and UFCO demonstrated the influence of corporate interest on U.S. foreign policy. United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, an avowed opponent of communism, was also a member of the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, which had represented United Fruit. His brother Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, was also a board member of United Fruit. United Fruit Company is the only company known to have a CIA cryptonym. The brother of the Assistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs, John Moors Cabot, had once been president of United Fruit. Ed Whitman, who was United Fruit&#x27;s principal lobbyist, was married to President Eisenhower&#x27;s personal secretary, Ann C. Whitman. Many individuals who directly influenced U.S. policy towards Guatemala in the 1950s also had direct ties to UFCO.

After the overthrow of Árbenz, a military dictatorship was established under Carlos Castillo Armas. Soon after coming to power, the new government launched a concerted campaign against trade unionists, in which some of the most severe violence was directed at workers on the plantations of the United Fruit Company.

Despite UFCO&#x27;s government connections and conflicts of interest, the overthrow of Árbenz failed to benefit the company. Its stock market value declined along with its profit margin. The Eisenhower administration proceeded with antitrust action against the company, which forced it to divest in 1958. In 1972, the company sold off the last of its Guatemalan holdings after over a decade of decline.

Even as the Árbenz government was being overthrown, in 1954 a general strike against the company organized by workers in Honduras rapidly paralyzed that country, and, due to the United States&#x27; concern about the events in Guatemala, was settled more favorably for the workers in order for the United States to gain leverage for the Guatemala operation.

===Cuba===
By the early 20th century, the UFCO began its operations in Cuba by controlling large tracts of land and influencing local governance and labor markets. In the early 1920s, the UFCO established its central hub for operations in the Cuban city of Banes where the banana plantations were run by the &quot;antillano&quot; population. The antillano population refers to migrants from the British Caribbean, more specifically from Jamaica and Haiti. With the introduction of the UFCO in Banes, the city was transformed socially and economically, due to an increase in employment, better infrastructure, and more law enforcement.

Company holdings in Cuba, which included sugar mills in the Oriente region of the island, were expropriated by the 1959 revolutionary government led by Fidel Castro. By April 1960 Castro was accusing the company of aiding Cuban exiles and supporters of former leader Fulgencio Batista in initiating a seaborne invasion of Cuba directed from the United States. Castro warned the U.S. that &quot;Cuba is not another Guatemala&quot; in one of many combative diplomatic exchanges before the U.S. organized the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961.

===Infrastructure In Costa Rica===

In the 20th century, many parts of Latin America were not positively operated and invested in compared to the region of Costa Rica. The United Fruit Company, according to researchers, made positive impacts in the region that continued past the bankruptcy and ceasing of production in 1984.

Since 1880 with the first initial U.S. investment in 4% of the country&#x27;s territory, the UFCO grew in Costa Rica to develop around 7% of their labor force. With a growing labor force and plantations expanding, camps for farmers and families emerged. With the emergence of the workforce came the construction of commissaries, schools, electric plants, sewage systems, hospitals, and recreation facilities all funded by the UFCo.

According to Yale Insights, the impact of the infrastructure still persists today in astonishing numbers. In 1973, households living within the boundaries of UFCo were 26% less likely to be poor compared to outside households. A most recent research statistic in 2011, states that only 63% of the poverty gap had closed by 2011. The impact of the UFCo investment in capital among families had statistically paid off as outside work options had around a 1% increase in probability of being poor in 2011 since 1973 compared to the 0.73% lower probability on a UFCo location.

=== Colombia ===
In the early to mid-20th century, the UFC dominated the banana industry throughout the northern regions. The introduction of this multinational corporation meant that small farmers needed to be displaced to make room for large tracts of land. This forced displacement of small farmers created resentment throughout Colombia which led to numerous resistance movements to help drive this corporation. With banana plantations expanding in the 1870s, peasants left haciendas to stake new land claims on public land that would be used for cultivation, however, land sharks and the Colombian government would encroach on their land with fabricated property titles to claim ownership of their land. The UFC acquired their land for their plantations in regions such as Urabá and Magdalena through deals with local elites and the government, which often displaced these small farmers living and working on the land. These farmers had little recourse in these land disputes, because of the close relationship that the UFC had with the national government, the legal systems often favored corporate interests.

With the UFC interfering with local issues throughout Colombia, the Liberal Party often fought back against the Conservative party for supporting the exploitation of multinational corporations towards the Colombian people. Not only did the Majority of liberal Colombians have strong criticisms against tax and railway concessions from the UFC, but it also led to Liberal newspapers expressing their opposition to their operations throughout the region. Many Colombians were upset that UFC received numerous tax breaks from the Colombian government which they saw as unfair since the UFC didn&#x27;t contribute to the national treasury while they profited extensively from Colombian resources. The Colombian Liberal Party favored policies that promoted domestic industry and reduced foreign influence in Colombia, which is why they wanted to oust the UFC&#x27;s monopolistic practices. The opposition from the Liberal Party put pressure on the UFC and its government backed allies to create a more equitable society, however their disregard for the Colombian people often led to labor strikes such as the Banana Massacre.

Not only was the UFC known for monopolizing land and resources along with sidelining Colombian farmers, but their workers often experienced exploitative and inhumane labor conditions. From the 1960s to the 70s, UFC plantation workers were subjected to grueling working schedules and a lack of basic amenities such as water and housing while living on company property. The majority of workers worked up to twenty hours each day which most labor systems frowned upon since these long hours often led to physical exhaustion and long-term health issues. The UFC provided camps for workers to live in, however, the company exercised significant control over their workers&#x27; social conditions and access to resources. The lack of basic housing in these camps left these workers to live in cardboard boxes which was dehumanizing and showed how these workers were viewed as tools instead of human beings. Lack of basic infrastructure such as clean drinking water and electricity meant that workers lived in unsanitary conditions, which exacerbated health issues relating to diseases. The UFC perpetuated cycles of poverty and violence towards their workers, which led to violent repression ultimately leading to its demise in Colombia in the early 1970s.

==Banana massacre==
A strike by United Fruit workers broke out on 12 November 1928 near Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. On December 6, Colombian Army troops allegedly under the command of General Cortés Vargas opened fire on a crowd of strikers in the central square of Ciénaga. Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 47 to 3,000. The military justified this action stating that the strike was subversive, and its organizers were Communist revolutionaries. Congressman Jorge Eliécer Gaitán claimed that the army had acted under instructions from the United Fruit Company. The ensuing scandal contributed to President Miguel Abadía Méndez&#x27;s Conservative Party being voted out of office in 1930, putting an end to 44 years of Conservative rule in Colombia. The first novel of Álvaro Cepeda Samudio, &quot;La Casa Grande&quot;, focuses on this event, and the author himself grew up in close proximity to the incident. The climax of García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is based on the events in Ciénaga.

General Cortés Vargas issued the order to shoot, arguing later that he had done so because of information that US boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company. Vargas issued the order so the United States would not invade Colombia.

==The United Fruit Company in Honduras==

===Attempt at state capture===
Following the Honduran declaration of independence in 1838 from the Central American Federation, Honduras was in a state of economic and political strife due to constant conflict with neighboring countries for territorial expansion and control. Liberal President Marco Aurelio Soto (1876–1883) saw instating the Agrarian Law of 1877 as a way to make Honduras more appealing to international companies looking to invest capital into a promising host export-driven economy. The Agrarian Law would grant international, multinational companies leniency in tax regulations along with other financial incentives. Acquiring the first railroad concession from liberal President Miguel R. Dávila in 1910, the Vaccaro brothers and Company helped set the foundation on which the banana republic would struggle to balance and regulate the relationships between American capitalism and Honduran politics.

Samuel Zemurray, a small-sized American banana entrepreneur, rose to be another contender looking to invest in the Honduran agricultural trade. In New Orleans, Zemurray found himself strategizing with the newly exiled General Manuel Bonilla (nationalist ex-president of Honduras 1903–1907, 1912–1913) and fomented a coup d&#x27;état against President Dávila. On Christmas Eve, December 1910, in clear opposition of the Dávila administration, Samuel Zemurray, U.S. General Lee Christmas, and Honduran General Manuel Bonilla boarded the yacht &quot;Hornet&quot;, formerly known as the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; and recently purchased by Zemurray in New Orleans. With a gang of New Orleans mercenaries and plenty of arms and ammunition, they sailed to Roatan to attack, then seize the northern Honduran ports of Trujillo and La Ceiba. Unbeknownst to Zemurray, he was being watched by the US Secret Service. Having captured the aging fort at Roatan, he quickly sold the &quot;Hornet&quot; to a Honduran straw buyer on the island to avoid falling foul of the Neutrality Act. After successfully attacking the port of Trujillo, the &quot;Hornet&quot; unexpectedly encountered the U.S. gunboat &quot;Tacoma&quot; and was towed back to New Orleans. The nascent revolution continued apace, Zemurray&#x27;s media contacts having spread the word in advance. President Dávila was forced to step down, with Francisco Bertrand becoming interim president until General Bonilla handily won the November 1911 Honduran presidential elections.

In 1912, General Bonilla quickly granted the second railroad concession to the newly incorporated Cuyamel Fruit Company owned by Zemurray. The period of some of these exclusive railroad land concessions was up to 99 years. The first railroad concession leased the national railroad of Honduras to the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. (once Standard Fruit Company and currently Dole Food Company). Zemurray granted his concession to the Tela Railroad Company—another division within his own company. Cuyamel Fruit Company&#x27;s concession would also be awarded to the Tela Railroad Company. United Fruit Company (currently Chiquita Brands International) would partner with President Bonilla in the exchange of access and control of Honduran natural resources plus tax and financial incentives. In return, President Bonilla would receive cooperation, protection and a substantial amount of U.S. capital to build a progressive infrastructure in Honduras.

===Banana multinational establishment and expansion===

The granting of land ownership in exchange for the railroad concession started the first official competitive market for bananas and giving birth to the banana republic. Cuyamel Fruit Company and the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. would become known as being multinational enterprises. Bringing western modernization and industrialization to the welcoming Honduran nation. All the while Honduran bureaucrats would continue to take away the indigenous communal lands to trade for capital investment contracts as well as neglect the fair rights of Honduran laborers. After the peak of the banana republic era, resistance eventually began to grown on the part of small-scale producers and production laborers, due to the exponential rate in growth of the wealth gap as well as the collusion between the profiting Honduran government officials and the U.S. fruit companies (United Fruit Co., Standard Fruit Co., Cuyamel Fruit Co.) versus the Honduran working and poor classes.

Due to the exclusivity of the land concessions and lack of official ownership documentation, Honduran producers and experienced laborers were left with two options to regain these lands—&quot;dominio util&quot; or &quot;dominio pleno. Dominio util&quot;—meaning the land was intended to be developed for the greater good of the public with a possibility of being the granted &quot;full private ownership&quot; versus &quot;dominio pleno&quot; was the immediate granting of &quot;full private ownership with the right to sell&quot;. Based on the 1898 Honduran agrarian law, without being sanctioned the right their communal lands, Honduran villages and towns could only regain these lands if granted by the Honduran government or in some cases it was permitted by U.S. companies, such as United Fruit Co., to create long-term contracts with independent producers on devastatingly diseased infested districts. Even once granted land concessions, many were so severely contaminated with either the Panaman, moko, or sigatoka, that it would have to reduce the acreage used and the amount produced or changed the crop being produced. Additionally, accusations were reported of the Tela Railroad Company placing intense requirements, demanding exclusivity in distribution, and unjustly denying crops produced by small-scale farmers because they were deemed &quot;inadequate&quot;. Compromise was attempted between small-scale fruit producers and the multinationals enterprises but were never reached and resulted in local resistance.

The U.S. fruit corporations were choosing rural agriculture lands in Northern Honduras, specifically using the new railroad system for their proximity to major port cities of Puerto Cortes, Tela, La Ceiba, and Trujillo as the main access points of transport for shipments designated back to the United States and Europe. To get an understanding of the dramatic increase in amount of bananas being exported, firstly &quot;in the Atlantida, the Vaccaro Brothers (Standard Fruit) oversaw the construction of 155 kilometers of railroad between 1910 and 1915...the expansion of the railroad led to a concomitant rise exports, from 2.7 million bunches in 1913 to 5.5 million in 1919.&quot; Standard Fruit, Cuyamel, and the United Fruit Co. combined surpassed past profit performances, &quot;In 1929 a record 29 million bunches left Honduran shores, a volume that exceeded the combined exports of Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Panama.&quot;

===Social welfare programs for employees of United Fruit Company===
U.S. food corporations, such as United Fruit established community services and facilitates for mass headquartered (production) divisions, settlements of banana plantations throughout their partnered host countries such in the Honduran cities of Puerto Cortes, El Progreso, La Ceiba, San Pedro Sula, Tela, and Trujillo.) Because of the strong likelihood of these communities being in extremely isolated rural agricultural areas, both American and Honduran workers were offered on-site community services similar to those found in other company towns, such as free, furnished housing (similar to barracks) for workers and their immediate family members, health care via hospitals/clinics/health units, education (2–6 years) for children/younger dependents/ other laborers, commissaries (grocery/retail), religious (United Fruit built on-site churches) and social activities, agricultural training at the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School, and cultural contributions such as the restoration of the Mayan city Zaculeu in Guatemala.

According to a 2022 study in &quot;Econometrica&quot;, the UFCo had a positive and persistent effect on living standards in Costa Rica, which had granted substantial land concessions to the company from 1899 to 1984. The reason is that the company invested heavily in local amenities, such as education and health care, in order to attract and maintain a sizable workforce.

====Agriculture research and training====

Samuel Zemurray employed agronomists, botanists, and horticulturists to aid in research studies for United Fruit in their time of crisis, as early as 1915, when the Panama disease first inhabited crops. Funding specialized studies to treat Panama disease and supporting the publishing of such findings throughout the 1920s–1930s, Zemurray consistently was an advocate for agricultural research and education. This was first observed when Zemurray funded the first research station of Lancetilla in Tela, Honduras in 1926 and led by Dr. Wilson Popenoe.

Zemurray also founded the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School (Escuela Agricola Panamericana) in 1941 with Dr. Popenoe as the head agronomist. There were certain requirements before a student could be accepted into the fully paid for 3-year program including additional expenses (room and board, clothing, food, stc), a few being a male between the ages of 18 and 21, 6 years of elementary education, plus an additional 2 years of secondary. Zemurray, established a policy where, &quot;The School is not for the training or improvement of the company&#x27;s own personnel, but represents an outright and disinterested contribution to the improvement of agriculture in Spanish America...This was one way in which the United Fruit Company undertook to discharge its obligation of social responsibility in those countries in which it operates-and even to help others.&quot; Zemurray was so intensely adamant in his policy, that students were not allowed to become employees at the United Fruit Company post-graduation.

===United fruit and labor challenges===

====Invasive banana diseases====
Epidemic diseases would cyclically strike the banana enterprise in the form of Panama disease, black sigatoka, and Moko (&quot;Ralstonia solanacearum&quot;). Large investments of capital, resources, time, tactical practices, and extensive research would be necessary in search for a solution. The agriculture research facilities employed by United Fruit pioneered in the field of treatment with physical solutions such as controlling Panama disease via &quot;flood fallowing&quot; and chemical formulations such as the Bordeaux mixture spray.

These forms of treatment and control would be rigorously applied by laborers on a daily basis and for long periods of time so that they would be as effective as possible. Potentially toxic chemicals were constantly exposed to workers such as copper(II) sulfate in Bordeaux spray (which is still used intensively today in organic and &quot;bio&quot; agriculture), 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in Nemagon the treatment for Moko, or the sigatoka control process that began a chemical spray followed by an acid wash of bananas post-harvesting. The fungicidal treatments would cause workers to inhale fungicidal dust and come into direct skin contact with the chemicals without means of decontamination until the end of their workday. These chemicals would be studied and proven to carry their own negative repercussions towards the laborers and land of these host nations.

While the Panama disease was the first major challenging and aggressive epidemic, again United Fruit would be faced with an even more combative fungal disease, Black sigatoka, in 1935. Within a year, sigatoka plagued 80% of their Honduran crop and once again scientists would begin a search for a solution to this new epidemic. By the end of 1937 production resumed to its normal level for United Fruit after the application of Bordeaux spray, but not without creating devastating blows to the banana production. &quot;Between 1936–1937, the Tela Railroad Company banana output fell from 5.8 to 3.7 million bunches&quot; and this did not include independent farmers who also suffered from the same epidemics, &quot;export figures confirm the devastating effect of the pathogen on non-company growers: between 1937-1939 their exports plummeted from 1.7 million bunches to a mere 122,000 bunches&quot;. Without any positive eradication of sigatoka from banana farms due to the tropical environment, the permanent fungicidal treatment was incorporated and promoted in every major banana enterprise, which would be reflective in the time, resources, labor, and allocation of expenses needed for rehabilitation.

====Labor health risks====
Both United Fruit Company production laborers and their fellow railroad workers from the Tela Railroad Company were not only at constant risk from long periods of chemical exposure in the intense tropical environment, but there was a possibility of contracting malaria and yellow fever from mosquito bites or inhale the airborne bacteria of tuberculosis from infected victims.

In 1950, &quot;El Prision Verde&quot; (&quot;The Green Prison&quot;), written by Ramón Amaya Amador, a leading member of the Honduran Communist Party, exposed the injustices of working and living conditions on banana plantations with the story of Martin Samayoa, a former Bordeaux spray applicator. This literary piece is the personal account of everyday life, as an applicator, and the experienced as well as witnessed injustices pre/post-exposure to the toxic chemicals within these fungicidal treatments and insecticides. The Bordeaux spray in particular is a blue-green color and many sources referring to its usage usually bring to light the apparent identification of those susceptible to copper toxicity based on their appearance after working. For example, &quot;Pericos&quot; (&quot;parakeets&quot;) was the nickname given to spray workers in Puerto Rico because of the blue-green coloring left on their clothing after a full day of spraying. In 1969, there was only one documented case of vineyard workers being studied in Portugal as they worked with the Bordeaux spray whom all suffered similar health symptoms and biopsied to find blue-green residue within the victim&#x27;s lungs.

Little evidence was collected in the 1930s–1960s by either the American or Honduran officials to address these acute, chronic, and deadly effects and illnesses warranted from the chemical exposure such as tuberculosis, long-term respiratory problems, weight loss, infertility, cancer, and death. Many laborers were discouraged to voice the pain caused from physical injustices that occurred from the chemicals penetrating their skin or by inhalation from fungicide fumes in long labor-intensive hours spraying the applications. Without any specialized health care targeted to cure these unabating ailments and little to no compensation of workers who did become gravely ill. Bringing awareness to such matters especially against major powers such as United Fruit Co. amongst other multinational companies and the involved national governments would be feat for any single man/ woman to prove and demand for change. That is until the legalization of labor unionization and organized resistance.

===Resistance and reformation===
Labor resistance, although was most progressive in the 1950s to the 1960s, there has been a consistent presence of abrasiveness towards multinational enterprises such as United Fruit. General Bonilla&#x27;s choice to approve the concessions without demanding the establishment of fair labor rights and market price, nor enforce a comprise between small-scale fruit producers and the conglomerate of U.S. fruit enterprises would create the foundation in which strife would ensue from political, economic, and natural challenges. The first push for resistance began from the labor movement, leading into the Honduran government&#x27;s turn towards nationalism, compliance with Honduran land and labor reformations (1954–1974)*, and the severance of U.S. multinational support in all host countries&#x27; governmental affairs (1974–1976)*. As United Fruit battles with Honduran oppositions, they also fight similar battles with the other host Central American nations, let alone their own Great Depression and the rising threat of communism.

====Labor unionization====
From 1900 to 1945, the power and economic hegemony allotted to the American multinational corporations by host countries was designed to bring nations such as Honduras out of foreign debt and economic turmoil all the while decreasing the expenses of production, increasing the levels of efficiency and profit, and thriving in a tariff-free economic system. However, the growing demand for bananas surpassed the supply because of challenges such as invasive fruit diseases (Panama, sigtaoka, and moko) plus human illnesses from extreme working conditions (chemical toxicity and communicable diseases).

Laborers began to organize, protest, and expose the conditions in what they were suffering from at the location of their division. Small-scale fruit producers would also join the opposition to regain equality in the market economy and push for the redistribution of the taken communal lands sold to American multinational corporations. Referencing to the Honduran administrations from 1945 to 1954, business historian Marcelo Bucheli interpreted their acts of collusion and stated &quot;The dictators helped United Fruit&#x27;s business by creating a system with little or no social reform, and in return United Fruit helped them remain in power&quot;. As the rise of dictatorship flourished under Tiburcio Carías Andino&#x27;s national administration (1933–1949) and prevailed for 16 years until it was passed onto nationalist President Juan Manuel Gálvez (a former lawyer for the United Fruit Company).

The General Strike of 1954 in Tela, Honduras was largest organized labor opposition against the United Fruit company. However, it did involve the laborers from United Fruit, Standard Fruit, along with industrial workers from San Pedro Sula. Honduran laborers were demanding fair pay, economic rights, checked national authority, and eradication of imperialist capitalism. The total number of protesters was estimated at greater than 40,000. On the 69th day, an agreement was made between United Fruit and the mass of protesters leading to the end of the General Strike. Under the administration of Galvez (1949–1954) strides were taken to put into effect the negotiated improvements of workers&#x27; rights. Honduran laborers gained the right for shorter workdays, paid holidays, limited employee responsibility for injuries, the improvement of employment regulation over women and children, and the legalization of unionization. In the summer of 1954 the strike ended, yet the demand for economic nationalism and social reform was just beginning to gain even more momentum going into the 1960s–1970s.

====Nationalist movement====

By legalizing unionization, the large mass of laborers were able to organize and act on the influences of nationalist movement, communist ideology, and becomes allies of the communist party. As like in the neighboring nation of Cuba and the rise communism led by Fidel Castro, the fight for nationalism spread to other Latin American nations and ultimately led to a regional revolution. Americans struggled to maintain control and protect their capital investment while building tensions grew between America, the communist, and nationalist parties.

The 1970s energy crisis was a period where petroleum production reached its peak, causing an inflation in price, leading to petroleum shortages, and a 10-year economic battle. Ultimately the United Fruit Company, among other multinational fruit enterprises, would attempt to recover capital lost due to the oil crisis through the Latin American nations. The United Fruit&#x27;s plan for recovery would ensue by increasing taxation and reestablishing exclusivity contracts with small-scale farmers. &quot;The crisis forced local governments to realign themselves and follow protectionist policies&quot; (Bulmer-Thomas, 1987). The fight to not lose their control over Honduras and other sister host nations to communism failed, yet the nature of their relationship did change to where the national government had the higher authority and control.

=== Hurricane Fifi===
In September 1974, Hurricane Fifi made landfall in Honduras as a Category 2 hurricane. The northern coastal region of Honduras was ravaged by this hurricane, especially the United Fruit Company&#x27;s banana plantations which were flattened by high winds and flooded up to thirty feet of storm surge. Banana plants were vulnerable to flooding and high winds, which uprooted and destroyed these plantations, significantly reducing the company&#x27;s productivity in Honduras. The hurricane caused extensive damage to the infrastructure such as roads, railways, and ports which all supported banana production since they were used to transport bananas to export markets. Rebuilding this infrastructure added to the economic burden on the company, which eventually led to its demise in June 1970.

===End of the Honduran banana republic era===
At the end of the 1970s energy crisis, Honduras was under the administration of Oswaldo Lopez Arellano after he seized control from President Ramon Villeda Morales. Trying to redistribute the taken lands of Honduras, President Arellano attempted to aid the Honduran people in regaining their economic independence but was stopped by President Ramón Ernesto Cruz Uclés in 1971. In 1960, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was created and did not involve Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia. Designed to strengthen the same nations that experienced extreme economic turmoil, the authority and control of foreign multinational companies, 1970s energy crisis, and the inflation of trade tariffs. Through nullification of the concession contracts originally granted to the U.S. multinational companies, Latin American countries were able to further their plan for progress but were met with hostility from the U.S. companies. Later in 1974, President Arellano approved a new agrarian reform granting thousands of acres of expropriated lands from the United Fruit Company back to Honduran people. The worsened relations between the U.S. and the newly affirmed powers of the Latin American countries would bring all parties into the 1974 banana War.

==Aiding and abetting a terrorist organization==
In March 2007 Chiquita Brands pleaded guilty in a United States Federal court to aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, when it admitted to the payment of more than $1.7 million to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a group that the United States has labeled a terrorist organization since 2001. Under a plea agreement, Chiquita Brands agreed to pay $25 million in restitution and damages to the families of victims of the AUC. The AUC had been paid to protect the company&#x27;s interest in the region.

In addition to monetary payments, Chiquita has also been accused of smuggling weapons (3,000 AK-47s) to the AUC and in assisting the AUC in smuggling drugs to Europe. Chiquita Brands admitted that they paid AUC operatives to silence union organizers and intimidate farmers into selling only to Chiquita. In the plea agreement, the Colombian government let Chiquita Brands keep the names of U.S. Citizens who brokered this agreement with the AUC secret, in exchange for relief to 390 families.

Despite calls from Colombian authorities and human rights organizations to extradite the U.S. citizens responsible for war crimes and aiding a terrorist organization, the U.S. Department of Justice has refused to grant the request, citing &#x27;conflicts of law&#x27;. As with other high-profile cases involving wrongdoing by American companies abroad, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Justice are very careful to hand over any American citizen to be tried under another country&#x27;s legal system, so for the time being Chiquita Brands International avoided a catastrophic scandal, and instead walked away with a humiliating defeat in court and eight of its employees fired.

==The Great White Fleet==


For over a century, United Fruit Company steamships carried bananas and passengers between Caribbean and United States seaports. These fast ships were initially designed to transport bananas but later included cargo liners with accommodations for fifty to one hundred passengers. Cruises of two to four weeks were instrumental in establishing Caribbean tourism. These banana boats were painted white to keep the temperature of the bananas lower by more effectively reflecting tropical sunlight:

<doc id="167539" wikidata="Q190586" url="?curid=167539" title="Neocolonialism">
<text>Neocolonialism is the control by a state (usually, a former colonial power) over another nominally independent state (usually, a former colony) through indirect means. The term &quot;neocolonialism&quot; was first used after World War II to refer to the continuing dependence of former colonies on foreign countries, but its meaning soon broadened to apply, more generally, to places where the power of developed countries was used to produce a colonial-like exploitation. 

Neocolonialism takes the form of economic imperialism, globalization, cultural imperialism and conditional aid to influence or control a developing country instead of the previous colonial methods of direct military control or indirect political control (hegemony). Neocolonialism differs from standard globalisation and development aid in that it typically results in a relationship of dependence, subservience, or financial obligation towards the neocolonialist nation.

Coined by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1956, it was first used by Kwame Nkrumah in the context of African countries undergoing decolonisation in the 1960s. Neocolonialism is also discussed in the works of Western thinkers such as Sartre (&quot;Colonialism and Neocolonialism&quot;, 1964) and Noam Chomsky (&quot;The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism&quot;, 1979).

== Term ==
=== Origins ===
When first proposed, the term neocolonialism was applied to European countries&#x27; continued economic and cultural relationships with their former colonies, those African countries that had been liberated in the aftermath of Second World War. At the 1962 National Union of Popular Forces conference, Mehdi Ben Barka, the Moroccan political organizer and later chair of the Tricontinental Conference 1966, used the term &quot;al-isti&#x27;mar al-jadid&quot; ( &quot;the new colonialism&quot;) to describe the political trends in Africa in the early sixties.

Kwame Nkrumah, president of Ghana from 1960 to 1966, is credited with coining the term, which appeared in the 1963 preamble of the Organisation of African Unity Charter, and was the title of his 1965 book, &quot;Neo-Colonialism, The Last Stage of Imperialism&quot;. In his book the President of Ghana exposes the workings of International monopoly capitalism in Africa. For him Neo-colonialism, insidious and complex, is even more dangerous than the old colonialism and shows how meaningless political freedom can be without economic independence. Nkrumah theoretically developed and extended to the post–World War II 20th century the socio-economic and political arguments presented by Lenin in the pamphlet &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; (1917). The pamphlet frames 19th-century imperialism as the logical extension of geopolitical power, to meet the financial investment needs of the political economy of capitalism.

In &quot;Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism&quot;, Kwame Nkrumah wrote:

== Neocolonial economic dominance ==
In 1961, regarding the economic mechanism of neocolonial control, in the speech &quot;Cuba: Historical Exception or Vanguard in the Anti-colonial Struggle?&quot;, Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara said:

=== Dependency theory ===

Dependency theory is the theoretical description of economic neocolonialism. It proposes that the global economic system comprises wealthy countries at the centre, and poor countries at the periphery. Economic neocolonialism extracts the human and natural resources of a poor country to flow to the economies of the wealthy countries. It claims that the poverty of the peripheral countries is the result of how they are integrated in the global economic system. Dependency theory derives from the Marxist analysis of economic inequalities within the world&#x27;s system of economies, thus, under-development of the periphery is a direct result of development in the centre. It includes the concept of the late 19th century semi-colony. It contrasts the Marxist perspective of the theory of colonial dependency with capitalist economics. The latter proposes that poverty is a development stage in the poor country&#x27;s progress towards full integration in the global economic system. Proponents of dependency theory, such as Venezuelan historian Federico Brito Figueroa, who investigated the socioeconomic bases of neocolonial dependency, influenced the thinking of the former President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez.

===Cold War===

During the mid-to-late 20th century, in the course of the ideological conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., each country and its satellite states accused each other of practising neocolonialism in their imperial and hegemonic pursuits. The struggle included proxy wars, fought by client states in the decolonised countries. Cuba, the Warsaw Pact bloc, Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser (1956–1970) &quot;et al.&quot; accused the U.S. of sponsoring anti-democratic governments whose regimes did not represent the interests of their people and of overthrowing elected governments (African, Asian, Latin American) that did not support U.S. geopolitical interests.

In the 1960s, under the leadership of Chairman Mehdi Ben Barka, the Cuban Tricontinental Conference (Organisation of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America) recognised and supported the validity of revolutionary anti-colonialism as a means for colonised peoples of the Third World to achieve self-determination, a policy which angered the U.S. and France. Moreover, Chairman Barka headed the Commission on Neocolonialism, which dealt with the work to resolve the neocolonial involvement of colonial powers in decolonised counties; and said that the U.S., as the leading capitalist country of the world, was, in practise, the principal neocolonialist political actor.

=== Multinational corporations ===

Critics of the practice of neocolonialism also argue that investment by multinational corporations enriches few in underdeveloped countries and causes humanitarian, environmental and ecological damage to their populations. They argue that this results in unsustainable development and perpetual underdevelopment. These countries remain reservoirs of cheap labor and raw materials, while restricting access to advanced production techniques to develop their own economies. In some countries, monopolization of natural resources, while initially leading to an influx of investment, is often followed by increases in unemployment, poverty and a decline in per-capita income.

In the West African nations of Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Mauritania, fishing was historically central to the economy. Beginning in 1979, the European Union began negotiating contracts with governments for fishing off the coast of West Africa. Unsustainable commercial over-fishing by foreign fleets played a significant role in large-scale unemployment and migration of people across the region. This violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which recognises the importance of fishing to local communities and insists that government fishing agreements with foreign companies should target only surplus stocks.

Oxfam&#x27;s 2024 report &quot;Inequality, Inc&quot; concludes that multinational corporations located in the Global North are &quot;perpetuating a colonial style &#x27;extractivist&#x27; model&quot; across the Global South as the economies of the latter &quot;are locked into exporting primary commodities, from copper to coffee&quot; to these multinationals.

=== International borrowing ===

American economist Jeffrey Sachs recommended that the entire African debt (c. US$200 billion) be dismissed, and recommended that African nations not repay either the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF):

=== Conservation and neocolonialism ===
Wallerstein, and separately Frank, claim that the modern conservation movement, as practiced by international organisations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, inadvertently developed a neocolonial relationship with underdeveloped nations.

=== Science ===
==Former colonial powers and Africa==
=== Françafrique ===
The representative example of European neocolonialism is &quot;Françafrique&quot;, the &quot;France-Africa&quot; constituted by the continued close relationships between France and its former African colonies.

In 1955, the initial usage of the term &quot;French Africa&quot;, by President Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Ivory Coast, denoted positive social, cultural and economic Franco–African relations.
It was later applied by neocolonialism critics to describe an imbalanced international relation.

Neocolonialism was used to describe a type of foreign intervention in countries belonging to the Pan-Africanist movement, as well as the Asian–African Conference of Bandung (1955), which led to the Non-Aligned Movement (1961).
Neocolonialism was formally defined by the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference (AAPC) and published in the &quot;Resolution on Neo-colonialism&quot;. At both the Tunis conference (1960) and the Cairo conference (1961), AAPC described the actions of the French Community of independent states, organised by France, as neocolonial.

The politician Jacques Foccart, the principal adviser for African matters to French presidents Charles de Gaulle (1958–1969) and Georges Pompidou (1969–1974), was the principal proponent of &quot;Françafrique&quot;.

The works of Verschave and Beti reported a forty-year, post-independence relationship with France&#x27;s former colonial peoples, which featured colonial garrisons &quot;in situ&quot; and monopolies by French multinational corporations, usually for the exploitation of mineral resources. It was argued that the African leaders with close ties to France—especially during the Soviet–American Cold War (1945–1992)—acted more as agents of French business and geopolitical interests than as the national leaders of sovereign states. Cited examples are Omar Bongo (Gabon), Félix Houphouët-Boigny (Ivory Coast), Gnassingbé Eyadéma (Togo), Denis Sassou-Nguesso (Republic of the Congo), Idriss Déby (Chad), and Hamani Diori (Niger).

=== Belgian Congo ===
Belgium&#x27;s approach to Belgian Congo has been characterized as a quintessential example of neocolonialism, as the Belgians embraced rapid decolonization of the Congo with the expectation that the newly independent state would become dependent on Belgium. This dependence would allow the Belgians to exert control over Congo, even though Congo was formally independent.

After the decolonisation of Belgian Congo, Belgium continued to control, through the , an estimated 70% of the Congolese economy following the decolonisation process. The most contested part was in the province of Katanga where the , part of the , controlled the mineral-resource-rich province. After a failed attempt to nationalise the mining industry in the 1960s, it was reopened to foreign investment.

== United States ==

There is an ongoing debate about whether certain actions by the United States should be considered neocolonialism. Nayna J. Jhaveri, writing in &quot;Antipode&quot;, views the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a form of &quot;petroimperialism&quot;, believing that the U.S. was motivated to go to war to attain vital oil reserves, rather than to pursue the U.S. government&#x27;s official rationale for the Iraq War.

Noam Chomsky has been a prominent critic of &quot;American imperialism&quot;; he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of &quot;open societies&quot; that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper. He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power. He believes that official accounts of U.S. operations abroad have consistently whitewashed U.S. actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in spreading democracy. Examples he regularly cites are the actions of the United States in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Chalmers Johnson argued in 2004 that America&#x27;s version of the colony is the military base. Johnson wrote numerous books, including three examinations of the consequences of what he called the &quot;American Empire&quot;. Chip Pitts argued similarly in 2006 that enduring United States bases in Iraq suggested a vision of &quot;Iraq as a colony&quot;.

David Vine, author of &quot;Base Nation: How U.S. Military Bases Overseas Harm America and the World&quot; (2015), said the US had bases in 45 &quot;less-than-democratic&quot; countries and territories. He quotes political scientist Kent Calder: &quot;The United States tends to support dictators [and other undemocratic regimes] in nations where it enjoys basing facilities&quot;.

== China ==

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has built increasingly strong ties with some African, Asian, European and Latin American nations which has led to accusations of colonialism, As of August 2007, an estimated 750,000 Chinese nationals were working or living for extended periods in Africa. In the 1980s and 90s, China continued to purchase natural resources—petroleum and minerals—from Africa to fuel the Chinese economy and to finance international business enterprises. In 2006, trade had increased to $50 billion expanding to $500 billion by 2016.

In Africa, China has loaned $95.5 billion to various countries between 2000 and 2015, the majority being spent on power generation and infrastructure. Cases in which this has ended with China acquiring foreign land have led to accusations of &quot;debt-trap diplomacy&quot;. Other analysts say that China&#x27;s activities &quot;are goodwill for later investment opportunities or an effort to stockpile international support for contentious political issues&quot;. 

In 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled two China-funded projects. He also talked about fears of Malaysia becoming &quot;indebted&quot; and of a &quot;new version of colonialism&quot;. He later clarified that he did not refer to the Belt and Road Initiative or China with this.

According to Mark Langan in 2017, China, Western actors, and other emerging powers pursue their own interests at the expense of African interests. Western actors depict China as a threat to Africa, while depicting European and American involvement in Africa as being virtuous.

== Russia ==
Russia currently occupies parts of neighboring states. These occupied territories are Transnistria (part of Moldova); Abkhazia and South Ossetia (part of Georgia); and five provinces of Ukraine, which it has illegally annexed. Russia has also established effective political domination over Belarus, through the Union State. Historian Timothy Snyder defines Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine as &quot;a colonial war, in the sense that Russia meant to conquer, dominate, displace and exploit&quot; the country and its people. Russia has been accused of colonialism in Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, by enforced Russification, passportization, and by settling Russian citizens on the peninsula and forcing out Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.
The Wagner Group, a Russian state-funded private military company (PMC), has provided military support, security and protection for several autocratic regimes in Africa since 2017. In return, Russian and Wagner-linked companies have been given privileged access to those countries&#x27; natural resources, such as rights to gold and diamond mines, while the Russian military has been given access to strategic locations such as airbases and ports. This has been described as a neo-colonial and neo-imperialist kind of state capture, whereby Russia gains sway over countries by helping to keep the ruling regime in power and making them reliant on its protection, while generating economic and political benefits for Russia, without benefitting the local population. Russia has also gained geopolitical influence in Africa through election interference and spreading pro-Russian propaganda and anti-Western disinformation. Russian PMCs have been active in the Central African Republic, Sudan, Libya, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mozambique, among other countries. They have been accused of human rights abuses and killing civilians. In 2024, the Wagner Group in Africa was merged into a new &#x27;Africa Corps&#x27; under the direct control of Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Defense. Analysts for the Russian government have privately acknowledged the neo-colonial nature of Russia&#x27;s policy towards Africa.

The &quot;Russian world&quot; is a term used by the Russian government and Russian nationalists for territories and communities with a historical, cultural, or spiritual tie to Russia. The Kremlin meanwhile refers to the Russian diaspora and Russian-speakers in other countries as &quot;Russian compatriots&quot;. In her book &quot;Beyond Crimea: The New Russian Empire&quot; (2016), Agnia Grigas highlights how ideas like the &quot;Russian world&quot; and &quot;Russian compatriots&quot; have become an &quot;instrument of Russian neo-imperial aims&quot;. The Kremlin has sought influence over its &quot;compatriots&quot; by offering them Russian citizenship and passports (passportization), and in some cases eventually calling for their military protection. Grigas writes that the Kremlin uses the existence of these &quot;compatriots&quot; to &quot;gain influence over and challenge the sovereignty of foreign states and at times even take over territories&quot;.

== Other countries and entities ==
=== Iran ===
The Iranian government has been called an example of neocolonialism. The motivation for Iran is not economic, but religious. After its establishment in 1979, Iran sought to export Shia Islam globally and position itself as a force in world political structures. Africa&#x27;s Muslims present a unique opportunity in Iran&#x27;s dominance in the Muslim world. Iran is able to use these African communities to circumvent economic sanctions and move arms, man power, and nuclear technology. 

Iran exerts its influence through humanitarian initiatives, such as those seen in Ghana. Through the building of hospitals, schools, and agricultural projects Iran uses &quot;soft power&quot; to assert its influence in Western Africa.

=== Niue ===
The government of Niue has been trying to get back access to its domain name, .nu. The country signed a deal with a Massachusetts-based non-profit in 1999 that gave away rights to the domain name. Management of the domain name has since shifted to a Swedish organisation. The Niue government is currently fighting on two fronts to get back control on its domain name, including with the ICANN. Toke Talagi, the long-serving Premier of Niue who died in 2020, called it a form of neocolonialism.

=== South Korea ===
To ensure a reliable, long-term supply of food, the South Korean government and powerful Korean multinationals bought farming rights to millions of hectares of agricultural land in under-developed countries.

South Korea&#x27;s RG Energy Resources Asset Management CEO Park Yong-soo stressed that &quot;the nation does not produce a single drop of crude oil and other key industrial minerals. To power economic growth and support people&#x27;s livelihoods, we cannot emphasise too much that securing natural resources in foreign countries is a must for our future survival.&quot; The head of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jacques Diouf, stated that the rise in land deals could create a form of &quot;neocolonialism&quot;, with poor states producing food for the rich at the expense of their own hungry people.

In 2008, South Korean multinational Daewoo Logistics secured 1.3 million hectares of farmland in Madagascar to grow maize and crops for biofuels. Roughly half of the country&#x27;s arable land, as well as rainforests were to be converted into palm and corn monocultures, producing food for export from a country where a third of the population and 50 percent of children under five are malnourished, using South African workers instead of locals. Local residents were not consulted or informed, despite being dependent on the land for food and income. The controversial deal played a major part in prolonged anti-government protests that resulted in over a hundred deaths. This was a source of popular resentment that contributed to the fall of then-President Marc Ravalomanana. The new president, Andry Rajoelina, cancelled the deal. Tanzania later announced that South Korea was in talks to develop 100,000 hectares for food production and processing for 700 to 800 billion won. Scheduled to be completed in 2010, it was to be the largest single piece of overseas South Korean agricultural infrastructure ever built.

In 2009, Hyundai Heavy Industries acquired a majority stake in a company cultivating 10,000 hectares of farmland in the Russian Far East and a South Korean provincial government secured 95,000 hectares of farmland in Oriental Mindoro, central Philippines, to grow corn. The South Jeolla province became the first provincial government to benefit from a new central government fund to develop farmland overseas, receiving a loan of $1.9 million. The project was expected to produce 10,000 tonnes of feed in the first year. South Korean multinationals and provincial governments purchased land in Sulawesi, Indonesia, Cambodia and Bulgan, Mongolia. The national South Korean government announced its intention to invest 30 billion won in land in Paraguay and Uruguay. As of 2009 discussions with Laos, Myanmar and Senegal were underway.

== Cultural approaches ==
Although the concept of neocolonialism was originally developed within a Marxist theoretical framework and is generally employed by the political left, the term &quot;neocolonialism&quot; is found in other theoretical frameworks.

=== Coloniality ===
&quot;Coloniality&quot; claims that knowledge production is strongly influenced by the context of the person producing the knowledge and that this has further disadvantaged developing countries with limited knowledge production infrastructure. It originated among critics of subaltern theories, which, although strongly de-colonial, are less concerned with the source of knowledge.

=== Cultural theory ===

One variant of neocolonialism theory critiques &quot;cultural colonialism&quot;, the desire of wealthy nations to control other nations&#x27; values and perceptions through cultural means such as media, language, education and religion, ultimately for economic reasons. One impact of this is &quot;colonial mentality&quot;, feelings of inferiority that lead post-colonial societies to latch onto physical and cultural differences between the foreigners and themselves. Foreign ways become held in higher esteem than indigenous ways. Given that colonists and colonisers were generally of different races, the colonised may over time hold that the colonisers&#x27; race was responsible for their superiority. Rejections of the colonisers culture, such as the Negritude movement, have been employed to overcome these associations. Post-colonial importation or continuation of cultural mores or elements may be regarded as a form of neocolonialism.

==== Postcolonialism ====

Post-colonialism theories in philosophy, political science, literature and film deal with the cultural legacy of colonial rule. Post-colonialism studies examine how once-colonised writers articulate their national identity; how knowledge about the colonised was generated and applied in service to the interests of the coloniser; and how colonialist literature justified colonialism by presenting the colonised people as inferior whose society, culture and economy must be managed for them. Post-colonial studies incorporate subaltern studies of &quot;history from below&quot;; post-colonial cultural evolution; the psychopathology of colonisation (by Frantz Fanon); and the cinema of film makers such as the Cuban Third Cinema, e.g. Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, and Kidlat Tahimik.

===Critical theory===
Critiques of postcolonialism/neocolonialism are evident in literary theory. International relations theory defined &quot;postcolonialism&quot; as a field of study. While the lasting effects of cultural colonialism are of central interest, the intellectual antecedents in cultural critiques of neocolonialism are economic. Critical international relations theory references neocolonialism from Marxist positions as well as postpositivist positions, including postmodernist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. These differ from both realism and liberalism in their epistemological and ontological premises. The neoliberalist approach tends to depict modern forms of colonialism as a benevolent imperialism.

=== Neocolonialism and gender construction ===
Concepts of neocolonialism can be found in theoretical works investigating gender outside the global north. Often these conceptions can be seen as erasing gender norms within communities in the global south to create conceptions of gender that align with the global north. Gerise Herndon argues that applying feminism or other theoretical frameworks around gender must look at the relationship between the individual subject, their home country or culture, and the country and culture that exerts neocolonial control over the country. In her piece &quot;Gender Construction and Neocolonialism&quot;, Herndon presents the writings of Maryse Condé as an example of grappling with what it means to have your identity constructed by neocolonial powers. Her work explores how women in burgeoning nations rebuilt their identities in the postcolonial period. The task of creating new identities was met with challenges from not only an internal view of what the culture was in these places but also from the external expectations of ex-colonial powers.

An example of the construction of gender norms and conceptions by neocolonial interests is made clear in the Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act introduced in 2009 and passed in 2014. The act expanded upon previously existing laws against sodomy to make gay relationships punishable by life imprisonment. The call for this bill came from Ugandans who claimed traditional African values that did not include homosexuality. This act faced backlash from western countries, citing human rights violations. The United States imposed economic sanctions against Uganda in June 2014 in response to the law, the World Bank indefinitely postponed a $90 million aid loan to Uganda and the governments of Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway halted aid to Uganda in opposition to the law; the Ugandan government defended the bill and rejected condemnation of it, with the country&#x27;s authorities stating President Museveni wanted &quot;to demonstrate Uganda&#x27;s independence in the face of Western pressure and provocation&quot;. The Ugandan response was to claim that this was a neocolonialist attack on their culture. Kristen Cheney argued that this is a misrepresentation of neocolonialism at work and that this conception of gender and anti-homosexuality erased historically diverse gender identities in Africa. To Cheney, neocolonialism was found in accepting conservative gender identity politics, specifically those of U.S.-based Evangelical Christians. Before the introduction of this act, conservative Christian groups in the United States had put African religious leaders and politicians on their payroll, reflecting the talking points of U.S.-based Christian evangelism. Cheney argues that this adoption and bankrolling of U.S. conservative Christian evangelist thought in Uganda is the real neocolonialism and effectively erodes any historical gender diversity in Africa.

<text>Protein production is the biotechnological process of generating a specific protein. It is typically achieved by the manipulation of gene expression in an organism such that it expresses large amounts of a recombinant gene. This includes the transcription of the recombinant DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), the translation of mRNA into polypeptide chains, which are ultimately folded into functional proteins and may be targeted to specific subcellular or extracellular locations.

Protein production systems (also known as expression systems) are used in the life sciences, biotechnology, and medicine. Molecular biology research uses numerous proteins and enzymes, many of which are from expression systems; particularly DNA polymerase for PCR, reverse transcriptase for RNA analysis, restriction endonucleases for cloning, and to make proteins that are screened in drug discovery as biological targets or as potential drugs themselves. There are also significant applications for expression systems in industrial fermentation, notably the production of biopharmaceuticals such as human insulin to treat diabetes, and to manufacture enzymes.

== Protein production systems ==

Commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria, yeast, baculovirus/insect, mammalian cells, and more recently filamentous fungi such as &quot;Myceliophthora thermophila&quot;. When biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems, process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts.

===Cell-based systems===

The oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the &quot;combination of an expression vector, its cloned DNA, and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell, that is, produce proteins at a high level&quot;. Overexpression is an abnormally and excessively high level of gene expression which produces a pronounced gene-related phenotype.

There are many ways to introduce foreign DNA to a cell for expression, and many different host cells may be used for expression — each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities. Expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the DNA source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material. For example, common hosts are bacteria (such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;B. subtilis&quot;), yeast (such as &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;) or eukaryotic cell lines. Common DNA sources and delivery mechanisms are viruses (such as baculovirus, retrovirus, adenovirus), plasmids, artificial chromosomes and bacteriophage (such as lambda). The best expression system depends on the gene involved, for example the &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is often preferred for proteins that require significant posttranslational modification. Insect or mammal cell lines are used when human-like splicing of mRNA is required. Nonetheless, bacterial expression has the advantage of easily producing large amounts of protein, which is required for X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for structure determination.

Because bacteria are prokaryotes, they are not equipped with the full enzymatic machinery to accomplish the required post-translational modifications or molecular folding. Hence, multi-domain eukaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria often are non-functional. Also, many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein-refolding.

To address these concerns, expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in, or closer to eukaryotic organisms: cells of plants (i.e. tobacco), of insects or mammalians (i.e. bovines) are transfected with genes and cultured in suspension and even as tissues or whole organisms, to produce fully folded proteins. Mammalian &quot;in vivo&quot; expression systems have however low yield and other limitations (time-consuming, toxicity to host cells..). To combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast, and advanced epigenetic features of plants, insects and mammalians systems, other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes (i.e. non-pathogenic &#x27;&quot;Leishmania&quot;&#x27; cells).

==== Bacterial systems ====

===== &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; =====

&quot;E. coli&quot; is one of the most widely used expression hosts, and DNA is normally introduced in a plasmid expression vector. The techniques for overexpression in &quot;E. coli&quot; are well developed and work by increasing the number of copies of the gene or increasing the binding strength of the promoter region so assisting transcription.

For example, a DNA sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or subcloned into a high copy-number plasmid containing the &quot;lac&quot; (often LacUV5) promoter, which is then transformed into the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;. Addition of IPTG (a lactose analog) activates the lac promoter and causes the bacteria to express the protein of interest.

&quot;E. coli&quot; strain BL21 and BL21(DE3) are two strains commonly used for protein production. As members of the B lineage, they lack &quot;lon&quot; and &quot;OmpT&quot; proteases, protecting the produced proteins from degradation. The DE3 prophage found in BL21(DE3) provides T7 RNA polymerase (driven by the LacUV5 promoter), allowing for vectors with the T7 promoter to be used instead.

===== &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; =====
Non-pathogenic species of the gram-positive &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; are used for the commercial production of various amino acids. The &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; species is widely used for producing glutamate and lysine, components of human food, animal feed and pharmaceutical products.

Expression of functionally active human epidermal growth factor has been done in &quot;C. glutamicum&quot;, thus demonstrating a potential for industrial-scale production of human proteins. Expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general, secretory pathway (Sec) or the twin-arginine translocation pathway (Tat).

Unlike gram-negative bacteria, the gram-positive &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; lack lipopolysaccharides that function as antigenic endotoxins in humans.

===== &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; =====
The non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria, &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;, is used for high level production of recombinant proteins; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines. &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; is a metabolically versatile organism, allowing for high throughput screening and rapid development of complex proteins. &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; is most well known for its ability to rapid and successfully produce high titers of active, soluble protein.

==== Eukaryotic systems ====

===== Yeasts =====
Expression systems using either &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; or &quot;Pichia pastoris&quot; allow stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells, at high yield, in chemically defined media of proteins.

===== Filamentous fungi =====

Filamentous fungi, especially &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Trichoderma&quot;, have long been used to produce diverse industrial enzymes from their own genomes (&quot;native&quot;, &quot;homologous&quot;) and from recombinant DNA (&quot;heterologous&quot;).

More recently, &quot;Myceliophthora thermophila&quot; C1 has been developed into an expression platform for screening and production of native and heterologous proteins.The expression system C1 shows a low viscosity morphology in submerged culture, enabling the use of complex growth and production media. C1 also does not &quot;hyperglycosylate&quot; heterologous proteins, as &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Trichoderma&quot; tend to do.

===== &quot;Baculovirus&quot;-infected cells =====

Baculovirus-infected insect cells (Sf9, Sf21, High Five strains) or mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that cannot be produced using fungal or bacterial systems. It is useful for production of proteins in high quantity. Genes are not expressed continuously because infected host cells eventually lyse and die during each infection cycle.

===== Non-lytic insect cell expression =====
Non-lytic insect cell expression is an alternative to the lytic baculovirus expression system. In non-lytic expression, vectors are transiently or stably transfected into the chromosomal DNA of insect cells for subsequent gene expression. This is followed by selection and screening of recombinant clones. The non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression. Cell lines used for this system include: Sf9, Sf21 from &quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot; cells, Hi-5 from &quot;Trichoplusia ni&quot; cells, and Schneider 2 cells and Schneider 3 cells from &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; cells. With this system, cells do not lyse and several cultivation modes can be used. Additionally, protein production runs are reproducible. This system gives a homogeneous product. A drawback of this system is the requirement of an additional screening step for selecting viable clones.

===== &quot;Excavata&quot; =====
&quot;Leishmania tarentolae&quot; (cannot infect mammals) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield, in chemically defined media. Produced proteins exhibit fully eukaryotic post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and disulfide bond formation.

===== Mammalian systems =====
The most common mammalian expression systems are Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) and Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells.
* Chinese hamster ovary cell
* Mouse myeloma lymphoblstoid (e.g. NS0 cell)
* Fully Human
** Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293)
** Human embryonic retinal cells (Crucell&#x27;s Per.C6)
** Human amniocyte cells (Glycotope and CEVEC)

===Cell-free systems===
Cell-free production of proteins is performed &quot;in vitro&quot; using purified RNA polymerase, ribosomes, tRNA and ribonucleotides. These reagents may be produced by extraction from cells or from a cell-based expression system. Due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell-free systems, cell-based systems are more widely used.

<text>Hermeto Pascoal (born June 22, 1936) is a Brazilian composer and multi-instrumentalist. He was born in Lagoa da Canoa, Alagoas, Brazil. Pascoal is best known in Brazilian music for his orchestration and improvisation, as well as for being a record producer and contributor to many Brazilian and international albums.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Pascoal comes from Northeastern Brazil, in an area that lacked electricity at the time he was born. He learned the accordion from his father and practiced for hours indoors, as, being born with albinism, he was incapable of working in the countryside with the rest of his family.

His career began in 1964 with appearances on several Brazilian recordings alongside relatively unknown groups. These albums and the musicians involved (Edu Lobo, Elis Regina, Cesar Camargo Mariano) established widely influential new directions in post-bossa nova Brazilian jazz.

In 1966, he played in the Sambrasa Trio, with Airto Moreira and Humberto Clayber; they released only one album, &quot;Em Som Maior&quot;. Then he joined Trio Novo (Airto Moreira, Heraldo do Monte, Theo de Barros) and in 1967 the group, renamed Quarteto Novo, released an album that launched the careers of Pascoal and Moreira. Pascoal would then go on to join the multi-faceted group Brazilian Octopus.

===International fame===

Pascoal initially caught the international public&#x27;s attention with an appearance on Miles Davis&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Live-Evil&quot;, which featured him on three pieces, which he also composed. Davis allegedly called Pascoal &quot;the most impressive musician in the world&quot;. Later collaborations involved fellow Brazilian musicians Airto Moreira and Flora Purim. From the late 1970s onward, he has mostly led his own groups, playing at many prestigious venues, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1979. Other members of the group have included bassist Itibere Zwarg, pianist Jovino Santos-Neto and percussionists Nene, Pernambuco, and Zabelê. 

Known as &quot;o Bruxo&quot; (the Sorcerer), Pascoal often makes music with unconventional objects such as teapots, children&#x27;s toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordions, melodica, saxophones, guitars, flutes, voices, various brass and folkloric instruments. He uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his &quot;Música da Lagoa&quot;, in which the musicians burble water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup with his mouth partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.

Between 1996 and 1997, Pascoal worked on a book project called &quot;Calendário do Som&quot;, which contains a song for every day of the year, including February 29, so that everyone would have a song for their birthday.

He was married to Ilza da Silva, to whom he dedicated many compositions, from 1954 until her death in 2000. They had six children, Jorge, Fábio, Flávia, Fátima, Fabiula, and Flávio, and many grandchildren. Hermeto was later married to Aline Morena from 2003 until 2016, while living in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.

He has since returned to the Jabour neighborhood in Bangu, Rio de Janeiro, where he spends much of his time composing, rehearsing and hosting musicians from all over the world.

In 2019, his album &quot;Hermeto Pascoal e Sua Visão Original do Forró&quot; won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Roots Album.

<text>The Santalaceae, sandalwoods, are a widely distributed family of flowering plants (including small trees, shrubs, perennial herbs, and epiphytic climbers) which, like other members of Santalales, are partially parasitic on other plants. Its flowers are bisexual or, by abortion (&quot;flower drop&quot;), unisexual. Modern treatments of the Santalaceae include the family Viscaceae (mistletoes), previously considered distinct.

The APG II system of 2003 recognises the family and assigns it to the order Santalales in the clade core eudicots. However, the circumscription by APG is much wider than accepted by previous classifications, including the plants earlier treated in families Eremolepidaceae and Viscaceae. It includes about 1,000 species in 43 genera. Many have reported traditional and cultural uses, including as medicine.

<text>Transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA for the purpose of gene expression. Some segments of DNA are transcribed into RNA molecules that can encode proteins, called messenger RNA (mRNA). Other segments of DNA are transcribed into RNA molecules called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language. During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called a primary transcript.

In virology, the term transcription is used when referring to mRNA synthesis from a viral RNA molecule. The genome of many RNA viruses is composed of negative-sense RNA which acts as a template for positive sense viral messenger RNA - a necessary step in the synthesis of viral proteins needed for viral replication. This process is catalyzed by a viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

== Background ==
A DNA transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a &quot;coding sequence&quot;, which will be translated into the protein, and &quot;regulatory sequences&quot;, which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein. The regulatory sequence before (upstream from) the coding sequence is called the five prime untranslated regions (5&#x27;UTR); the sequence after (downstream from) the coding sequence is called the three prime untranslated regions (3&#x27;UTR).

As opposed to DNA replication, transcription results in an RNA complement that includes the nucleotide uracil (U) in all instances where thymine (T) would have occurred in a DNA complement.

Only one of the two DNA strands serves as a template for transcription. The antisense strand of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3&#x27; end to the 5&#x27; end during transcription (3&#x27; → 5&#x27;). The complementary RNA is created in the opposite direction, in the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction, matching the sequence of the sense strand except switching uracil for thymine. This directionality is because RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3&#x27; end of the growing mRNA chain. This use of only the 3&#x27; → 5&#x27; DNA strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments that are seen in DNA replication. This also removes the need for an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis, as is the case in DNA replication.

The &quot;non&quot;-template (sense) strand of DNA is called the coding strand, because its sequence is the same as the newly created RNA transcript (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine). This is the strand that is used by convention when presenting a DNA sequence.

Transcription has some proofreading mechanisms, but they are fewer and less effective than the controls for copying DNA. As a result, transcription has a lower copying fidelity than DNA replication. 

== Major steps ==
Transcription is divided into &quot;initiation&quot;, &quot;promoter escape&quot;, &quot;elongation,&quot; and &quot;termination&quot;.

===Setting up for transcription===
====Enhancers, transcription factors, Mediator complex, and DNA loops in mammalian transcription====

Setting up for transcription in mammals is regulated by many cis-regulatory elements, including core promoter and promoter-proximal elements that are located near the transcription start sites of genes. Core promoters combined with general transcription factors are sufficient to direct transcription initiation, but generally have low basal activity. Other important cis-regulatory modules are localized in DNA regions that are distant from the transcription start sites. These include enhancers, silencers, insulators and tethering elements. Among this constellation of elements, enhancers and their associated transcription factors have a leading role in the initiation of gene transcription. An enhancer localized in a DNA region distant from the promoter of a gene can have a very large effect on gene transcription, with some genes undergoing up to 100-fold increased transcription due to an activated enhancer.

Enhancers are regions of the genome that are major gene-regulatory elements. Enhancers control cell-type-specific gene transcription programs, most often by looping through long distances to come in physical proximity with the promoters of their target genes. While there are hundreds of thousands of enhancer DNA regions, for a particular type of tissue only specific enhancers are brought into proximity with the promoters that they regulate. In a study of brain cortical neurons, 24,937 loops were found, bringing enhancers to their target promoters. Multiple enhancers, each often at tens or hundred of thousands of nucleotides distant from their target genes, loop to their target gene promoters and can coordinate with each other to control transcription of their common target gene.

The schematic illustration in this section shows an enhancer looping around to come into close physical proximity with the promoter of a target gene. The loop is stabilized by a dimer of a connector protein (e.g. dimer of CTCF or YY1), with one member of the dimer anchored to its binding motif on the enhancer and the other member anchored to its binding motif on the promoter (represented by the red zigzags in the illustration). Several cell function specific transcription factors (there are about 1,600 transcription factors in a human cell) generally bind to specific motifs on an enhancer and a small combination of these enhancer-bound transcription factors, when brought close to a promoter by a DNA loop, govern level of transcription of the target gene. Mediator (a complex usually consisting of about 26 proteins in an interacting structure) communicates regulatory signals from enhancer DNA-bound transcription factors directly to the RNA polymerase II (pol II) enzyme bound to the promoter.

Enhancers, when active, are generally transcribed from both strands of DNA with RNA polymerases acting in two different directions, producing two enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) as illustrated in the Figure. An inactive enhancer may be bound by an inactive transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor may activate it and that activated transcription factor may then activate the enhancer to which it is bound (see small red star representing phosphorylation of transcription factor bound to enhancer in the illustration). An activated enhancer begins transcription of its RNA before activating transcription of messenger RNA from its target gene.

====CpG island methylation and demethylation====

Transcription regulation at about 60% of promoters is also controlled by methylation of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides (where 5&#x27; cytosine is followed by 3&#x27; guanine or CpG sites). 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine (see Figure). 5-mC is an epigenetic marker found predominantly within CpG sites. About 28 million CpG dinucleotides occur in the human genome. In most tissues of mammals, on average, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated (forming 5-methylCpG or 5-mCpG). However, unmethylated cytosines within 5&#x27;cytosine-guanine 3&#x27; sequences often occur in groups, called CpG islands, at active promoters. About 60% of promoter sequences have a CpG island while only about 6% of enhancer sequences have a CpG island. CpG islands constitute regulatory sequences, since if CpG islands are methylated in the promoter of a gene this can reduce or silence gene transcription.

DNA methylation regulates gene transcription through interaction with methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins, such as MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2. These MBD proteins bind most strongly to highly methylated CpG islands. These MBD proteins have both a methyl-CpG-binding domain as well as a transcription repression domain. They bind to methylated DNA and guide or direct protein complexes with chromatin remodeling and/or histone modifying activity to methylated CpG islands. MBD proteins generally repress local chromatin such as by catalyzing the introduction of repressive histone marks, or creating an overall repressive chromatin environment through nucleosome remodeling and chromatin reorganization.

As noted in the previous section, transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a gene. The binding sequence for a transcription factor in DNA is usually about 10 or 11 nucleotides long. As summarized in 2009, Vaquerizas et al. indicated there are approximately 1,400 different transcription factors encoded in the human genome by genes that constitute about 6% of all human protein encoding genes. About 94% of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are associated with signal-responsive genes occur in enhancers while only about 6% of such TFBSs occur in promoters.

EGR1 protein is a particular transcription factor that is important for regulation of methylation of CpG islands. An EGR1 transcription factor binding site is frequently located in enhancer or promoter sequences. There are about 12,000 binding sites for EGR1 in the mammalian genome and about half of EGR1 binding sites are located in promoters and half in enhancers. The binding of EGR1 to its target DNA binding site is insensitive to cytosine methylation in the DNA.

While only small amounts of EGR1 transcription factor protein are detectable in cells that are un-stimulated, translation of the &quot;EGR1&quot; gene into protein at one hour after stimulation is drastically elevated. Production of EGR1 transcription factor proteins, in various types of cells, can be stimulated by growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, stress and injury. In the brain, when neurons are activated, EGR1 proteins are up-regulated and they bind to (recruit) the pre-existing TET1 enzymes that are produced in high amounts in neurons. TET enzymes can catalyse demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. When EGR1 transcription factors bring TET1 enzymes to EGR1 binding sites in promoters, the TET enzymes can demethylate the methylated CpG islands at those promoters. Upon demethylation, these promoters can then initiate transcription of their target genes. Hundreds of genes in neurons are differentially expressed after neuron activation through EGR1 recruitment of TET1 to methylated regulatory sequences in their promoters.

The methylation of promoters is also altered in response to signals. The three mammalian DNA methyltransferasess (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) catalyze the addition of methyl groups to cytosines in DNA. While DNMT1 is a maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT3A and DNMT3B can carry out new methylations. There are also two splice protein isoforms produced from the &quot;DNMT3A&quot; gene: DNA methyltransferase proteins DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2.

The splice isoform DNMT3A2 behaves like the product of a classical immediate-early gene and, for instance, it is robustly and transiently produced after neuronal activation. Where the DNA methyltransferase isoform DNMT3A2 binds and adds methyl groups to cytosines appears to be determined by histone post translational modifications.

On the other hand, neural activation causes degradation of DNMT3A1 accompanied by reduced methylation of at least one evaluated targeted promoter.

=== Initiation ===

Transcription begins with the RNA polymerase and one or more general transcription factors binding to a DNA promoter sequence to form an RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex. In the closed complex, the promoter DNA is still fully double-stranded.

RNA polymerase, assisted by one or more general transcription factors, then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of DNA to form an RNA polymerase-promoter open complex. In the open complex, the promoter DNA is partly unwound and single-stranded. The exposed, single-stranded DNA is referred to as the &quot;transcription bubble&quot;.

RNA polymerase, assisted by one or more general transcription factors, then selects a transcription start site in the transcription bubble, binds to an initiating NTP and an extending NTP (or a short RNA primer and an extending NTP) complementary to the transcription start site sequence, and catalyzes bond formation to yield an initial RNA product.

In bacteria, RNA polymerase holoenzyme consists of five subunits: 2 α subunits, 1 β subunit, 1 β&#x27; subunit, and 1 ω subunit. In bacteria, there is one general RNA transcription factor known as a sigma factor. RNA polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription (sigma) factor to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter.
(RNA polymerase is called a holoenzyme when sigma subunit is attached to the core enzyme which is consist of 2 α subunits, 1 β subunit, 1 β&#x27; subunit only). Unlike eukaryotes, the initiating nucleotide of nascent bacterial mRNA is not capped with a modified guanine nucleotide. The initiating nucleotide of bacterial transcripts bears a 5′ triphosphate (5′-PPP), which can be used for genome-wide mapping of transcription initiation sites.

In archaea and eukaryotes, RNA polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five RNA polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits. In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together. In archaea, there are three general transcription factors: TBP, TFB, and TFE. In eukaryotes, in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, there are six general transcription factors: TFIIA, TFIIB (an ortholog of archaeal TFB), TFIID (a multisubunit factor in which the key subunit, TBP, is an ortholog of archaeal TBP), TFIIE (an ortholog of archaeal TFE), TFIIF, and TFIIH. The TFIID is the first component to bind to DNA due to binding of TBP, while TFIIH is the last component to be recruited. In archaea and eukaryotes, the RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the &quot;preinitiation complex&quot;.

Transcription initiation is regulated by additional proteins, known as activators and repressors, and, in some cases, associated coactivators or corepressors, which modulate formation and function of the transcription initiation complex.

=== Promoter escape ===

After the first bond is synthesized, the RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. During this time there is a tendency to release the RNA transcript and produce truncated transcripts. This is called abortive initiation, and is common for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Abortive initiation continues to occur until an RNA product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized, at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed.

Mechanistically, promoter escape occurs through DNA scrunching, providing the energy needed to break interactions between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter.

In bacteria, it was historically thought that the sigma factor is definitely released after promoter clearance occurs. This theory had been known as the &quot;obligate release model.&quot; However, later data showed that upon and following promoter clearance, the sigma factor is released according to a stochastic model known as the &quot;stochastic release model&quot;.

In eukaryotes, at an RNA polymerase II-dependent promoter, upon promoter clearance, TFIIH phosphorylates serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme (CE). The exact mechanism of how CE induces promoter clearance in eukaryotes is not yet known.

=== Elongation ===
One strand of the DNA, the &quot;template strand&quot; (or noncoding strand), is used as a template for RNA synthesis. As transcription proceeds, RNA polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the DNA template to create an RNA copy (which elongates during the traversal). Although RNA polymerase traverses the template strand from 3&#x27; → 5&#x27;, the coding (non-template) strand and newly formed RNA can also be used as reference points, so transcription can be described as occurring 5&#x27; → 3&#x27;. This produces an RNA molecule from 5&#x27; → 3&#x27;, an exact copy of the coding strand (except that thymines are replaced with uracils, and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose (5-carbon) sugar whereas DNA has deoxyribose (one fewer oxygen atom) in its sugar-phosphate backbone).

mRNA transcription can involve multiple RNA polymerases on a single DNA template and multiple rounds of transcription (amplification of particular mRNA), so many mRNA molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene. The characteristic elongation rates in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are about 10–100 nts/sec. In eukaryotes, however, nucleosomes act as major barriers to transcribing polymerases during transcription elongation. In these organisms, the pausing induced by nucleosomes can be regulated by transcription elongation factors such as TFIIS.

Elongation also involves a proofreading mechanism that can replace incorrectly incorporated bases. In eukaryotes, this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate RNA editing factors to bind. These pauses may be intrinsic to the RNA polymerase or due to chromatin structure.

Double-strand breaks in actively transcribed regions of DNA are repaired by homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Since transcription enhances the accessibility of DNA to exogenous chemicals and internal metabolites that can cause recombinogenic lesions, homologous recombination of a particular DNA sequence may be strongly stimulated by transcription.

=== Termination ===
Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination – Rho-independent termination and Rho-dependent termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of Us. When the hairpin forms, the mechanical stress breaks the weak rU-dA bonds, now filling the DNA–RNA hybrid. This pulls the poly-U transcript out of the active site of the RNA polymerase, terminating transcription. In Rho-dependent termination, Rho, a protein factor, destabilizes the interaction between the template and the mRNA, thus releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.

Transcription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3&#x27; end, in a process called polyadenylation.

Beyond termination by a terminator sequences (which is a part of a gene), transcription may also need to be terminated when it encounters conditions such as DNA damage or an active replication fork. In bacteria, the Mfd ATPase can remove a RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion by prying open its clamp. It also recruits nucleotide excision repair machinery to repair the lesion. Mfd is proposed to also resolve conflicts between DNA replication and transcription. In eukayrotes, ATPase TTF2 helps to suppress the action of RNAP I and II during mitosis, preventing errors in chromosomal segregation. In archaea, the Eta ATPase is proposed to play a similar role.

===Transcription increases susceptibility to DNA damage===

Genome damage occurs with a high frequency, estimated to range between tens and hundreds of thousands of DNA damages arising in each cell every day. The process of transcription is a major source of DNA damage, due to the formation of single-strand DNA intermediates that are vulnerable to damage. The regulation of transcription by processes using base excision repair and/or topoisomerases to cut and remodel the genome also increases the vulnerability of DNA to damage.

== Role of RNA polymerase in post-transcriptional changes in RNA ==

RNA polymerase plays a very crucial role in all steps including post-transcriptional changes in RNA.

As shown in the image in the right it is evident that the CTD (C Terminal Domain) is a tail that changes its shape; this tail will be used as a carrier of splicing, capping and polyadenylation, as shown in the image on the left.

== Inhibitors ==

Transcription inhibitors can be used as antibiotics against, for example, pathogenic bacteria (antibacterials) and fungi (antifungals). An example of such an antibacterial is rifampicin, which inhibits bacterial transcription of DNA into mRNA by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase by binding its beta-subunit, while 8-hydroxyquinoline is an antifungal transcription inhibitor. The effects of histone methylation may also work to inhibit the action of transcription. Potent, bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the XPB subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter production.

==Endogenous inhibitors==
In vertebrates, the majority of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. When many of a gene&#x27;s promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes inhibited (silenced). Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, transcriptional inhibition (silencing) may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally inhibited by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered production of microRNAs. In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-produced microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers).

== Transcription factories ==
Active transcription units are clustered in the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories or euchromatin. Such sites can be visualized by allowing engaged polymerases to extend their transcripts in tagged precursors (Br-UTP or Br-U) and immuno-labeling the tagged nascent RNA. Transcription factories can also be localized using fluorescence in situ hybridization or marked by antibodies directed against polymerases. There are ≈10,000 factories in the nucleoplasm of a HeLa cell, among which are ≈8,000 polymerase II factories and ≈2,000 polymerase III factories. Each polymerase II factory contains ≈8 polymerases. As most active transcription units are associated with only one polymerase, each factory usually contains ≈8 different transcription units. These units might be associated through promoters and/or enhancers, with loops forming a &quot;cloud&quot; around the factor.

== History ==
A molecule that allows the genetic material to be realized as a protein was first hypothesized by François Jacob and Jacques Monod. Severo Ochoa won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for developing a process for synthesizing RNA &quot;in vitro&quot; with polynucleotide phosphorylase, which was useful for cracking the genetic code. RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase was established &quot;in vitro&quot; by several laboratories by 1965; however, the RNA synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly.

Roger D. Kornberg won the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription&quot;.

== Measuring and detecting ==
Transcription can be measured and detected in a variety of ways:
* G-Less Cassette transcription assay: measures promoter strength
* Run-off transcription assay: identifies transcription start sites (TSS)
* Nuclear run-on assay: measures the relative abundance of newly formed transcripts
* KAS-seq: measures single-stranded DNA generated by RNA polymerases; can work with 1,000 cells.
* RNase protection assay and ChIP-Chip of RNAP: detect active transcription sites
* RT-PCR: measures the absolute abundance of total or nuclear RNA levels, which may however differ from transcription rates
* DNA microarrays: measures the relative abundance of the global total or nuclear RNA levels; however, these may differ from transcription rates
* In situ hybridization: detects the presence of a transcript
* MS2 tagging: by incorporating RNA stem loops, such as MS2, into a gene, these become incorporated into newly synthesized RNA. The stem loops can then be detected using a fusion of GFP and the MS2 coat protein, which has a high affinity, sequence-specific interaction with the MS2 stem loops. The recruitment of GFP to the site of transcription is visualized as a single fluorescent spot. This new approach has revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, or pulses (see Transcriptional bursting). With the notable exception of in situ techniques, most other methods provide cell population averages, and are not capable of detecting this fundamental property of genes.
* Northern blot: the traditional method, and until the advent of RNA-Seq, the most quantitative
* RNA-Seq: applies next-generation sequencing techniques to sequence whole transcriptomes, which allows the measurement of relative abundance of RNA, as well as the detection of additional variations such as fusion genes, post-transcriptional edits and novel splice sites
* Single cell RNA-Seq: amplifies and reads partial transcriptomes from isolated cells, allowing for detailed analyses of RNA in tissues, embryos, and cancers

== Reverse transcription ==

Some viruses (such as HIV, the cause of AIDS), have the ability to transcribe RNA into DNA. HIV has an RNA genome that is &quot;reverse transcribed&quot; into DNA. The resulting DNA can be merged with the DNA genome of the host cell. The main enzyme responsible for synthesis of DNA from an RNA template is called reverse transcriptase.

In the case of HIV, reverse transcriptase is responsible for synthesizing a complementary DNA strand (cDNA) to the viral RNA genome. The enzyme ribonuclease H then digests the RNA strand, and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of DNA to form a double helix DNA structure (cDNA). The cDNA is integrated into the host cell&#x27;s genome by the enzyme integrase, which causes the host cell to generate viral proteins that reassemble into new viral particles. In HIV, subsequent to this, the host cell undergoes programmed cell death, or apoptosis, of T cells. However, in other retroviruses, the host cell remains intact as the virus buds out of the cell.

Some eukaryotic cells contain an enzyme with reverse transcription activity called telomerase. Telomerase carries an RNA template from which it synthesizes a telomere, a repeating sequence of DNA, to the end of linear chromosomes. It is important because every time a linear chromosome is duplicated, it is shortened. With the telomere at the ends of chromosomes, the shortening eliminates some of the non-essential, repeated sequence, rather than the protein-encoding DNA sequence farther away from the chromosome end.

Telomerase is often activated in cancer cells to enable cancer cells to duplicate their genomes indefinitely without losing important protein-coding DNA sequence. Activation of telomerase could be part of the process that allows cancer cells to become immortal. The immortalizing factor of cancer via telomere lengthening due to telomerase has been proven to occur in 90% of all carcinogenic tumors &quot;in vivo&quot; with the remaining 10% using an alternative telomere maintenance route called ALT or Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.
